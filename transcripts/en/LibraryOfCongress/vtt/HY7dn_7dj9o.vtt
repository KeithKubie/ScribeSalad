symposia and more.

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:20.578
We would like to thanks 
Elizabeth Dolen for first 

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:22.579
suggesting the idea fev 

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:25.585

00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:35.678
-- for their outstanding work on
the project. For special thanks 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.679
are due to the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.340
library of congress for live 
streaming 

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.451
and organizing this reading and 
for so crotchetyly hosting us in

00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:49.452
this grand 

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:52.731
historic space, the site of so 
much brilliant research.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.677
And finally, we'd like to thank 
the national endowment for the 

00:05:57.678 --> 00:06:01.156
humanities, which made the whole
event possible through a 

00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.157
chairman's grant.

00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:09.479
With that, I'll turn things over
to Mark, who has been a strong 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480
pillar of 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.834
support throughout the project. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you. I'll be as quick 

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:21.991
as possible with my remarks, as 
you'll be hearing my voice as 

00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:23.992
much today.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.291
I would like to congratulate 
Amanda, Neil, Stephanie, and 

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:30.292
everyone involved 

00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:35.859
with this remarkable project. It
was done in the recognition that

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.722
the 200th anniversary of the 
book is an 

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.191
extraordinary reason to 
celebrate the

00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:49.277
vie brancy of the novel.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.162
We're proud to support the 
humanities whenever possible.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.230
I read the book in high school, 
and my 

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.351
first deep dive with it came in 
a graduate seminar with Neil, 

00:07:02.352 --> 00:07:04.352
where we 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.009
read the novel alongside works 
like the 

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:11.218
Matrix, and

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:17.682
things like that in the novel, 
victor Frankenstein has a dream 

00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:19.683
about his future bride, 
embracing her.

00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:24.757
He soon realizes that with a 
kiss, she 

00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:28.217
became vivid with the hue of 
death, a 

00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:31.869
shroud envel lopping her form, 
with 

00:07:36.137 --> 00:07:38.137
grave worms crawling in the 
folds of

00:07:39.657 --> 00:07:44.976
her flannel. If this train is 
reversed, as it is in the story,

00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:46.977
with the dead coming back to 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.262
life, it's a metaphor for what 
the team has accomplished with 

00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:52.263
their own embrace of the novel's
power.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:58.828
Frankenstein never died, and the
book remains one of the most 

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.829
read in the world.

00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:04.058
When I think about what this 
project 

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:08.185
has succeeded in doing with 600 
partners in 49 countries, I 

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:12.899
can't help but imagine the ways 
that the novel is coming alive 

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.900
again in a manner that it 

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:17.949
has never had before.

00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.611
I imagine voices speaking in 
unison 

00:08:23.652 --> 00:08:26.091
with shelly's passions coming to
life, and occasionally, I would 

00:08:26.092 --> 00:08:28.092
like to think 

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.190
a unity, a harmony.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.316
But to the power of the words 
themselves, the strange, 

00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:40.927
beautiful deepening mastery that
they hold when we speak them 

00:08:40.928 --> 00:08:42.928
aloud to each other.

00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:48.903
I think it's no exaggeration to 
say that this novel has never 

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.144
been quite so human as it has 
through the course of 

00:08:55.371 --> 00:08:59.930
the project, and how it has 
today. Never did we expect it to

00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:01.931
transform 

00:09:03.737 --> 00:09:05.737
into the monster that it has.

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:10.876
From the esteemed library of 
congress herself, Carla.

00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:15.543
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the library of 
congress 

00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:19.001

PaidPetersberg, December

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:22.722
You will rejoice to hear that no
disaster has accompanied the 

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:23.133
commencement of an enterprise 
which you have regarded with 

00:10:23.134 --> 00:10:25.134
such evil forebodings.task is to
assure my dear sister of my 

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.774
welfare and increasing 
confidence in the success of my 

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:28.408
undertaking.as I walk in the 
streets of Petersburgh, I feel a

00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:29.055
cold northern breeze play upon 
my cheeks, which braces my 

00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:31.714
nerves and fills me with 
delight.the regions towards 

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.715
which I am advancing, gives me a
foretaste of those icy climes.

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.383
promise, my daydreams become 
more fervent and vivid.

00:10:56.208 --> 00:10:58.441
pole is the seat of frost and 
desolation; it ever presents 

00:10:58.442 --> 00:11:01.112
itself to my imagination as the 
region of beauty and delight.

00:11:09.037 --> 00:11:10.052
ever visible, its broad disk 
just skirting the horizon and 

00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:12.053
diffusing a perpetual splendour.

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:24.297
I will put some trust in

00:11:28.873 --> 00:11:29.271
preceding navigators there snow 
and frost are banished; and, 

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:30.485
sailing over a calm sea, we may 
be wafted to a land surpassing 

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:32.752
in wonders and in beauty every 
region hitherto discovered on 

00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:34.753
the habitable globe.

00:11:39.049 --> 00:11:40.681
without example, as the 
phenomena of the heavenly bodies

00:11:40.682 --> 00:11:42.682
undoubtedly are in those 

00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:47.681
undiscovered solitudes.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.720
which attracts the needle and 
may regulate a thousand 

00:11:57.721 --> 00:12:02.150
celestial observations that 
require only this voyage to

00:12:06.287 --> 00:12:06.801
render their seeming 
eccentricities consistent for 

00:12:06.802 --> 00:12:08.802
ever.

00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:15.318
with the sight of a part of the 
world never before visited, and 

00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.319
may tread a land never before 
imprinted by the foot of man.

00:12:25.024 --> 00:12:27.024
sufficient to conquer all fear 
of danger 

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:30.029
or death and 

00:12:31.337 --> 00:12:33.564
to induce me to commence this 
laborious voyage with the joy a 

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:35.604
child feels when he embarks in a
little boat, with his 

00:12:40.492 --> 00:12:44.425
holiday mates, on an expedition 
of discovery up his native 

00:12:40.492 --> 00:12:42.492
river.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:52.761
be false, you cannot contest the
inestimable benefit 

00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:57.771
which I shall confer on 

00:12:59.357 --> 00:13:00.382
all mankind, to the last 
generation, by discovering a 

00:13:00.383 --> 00:13:03.028
passage near the pole to those 
countries, to reach which at 

00:13:04.044 --> 00:13:05.809
present so many months are 
requisite; or by ascertaining 

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.810
the secret of the 

00:13:09.297 --> 00:13:11.297
magnet, which,

00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.238
if at all possible, can only be 
effected by an undertaking such 

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.239
as mine.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.347
agitation with which I began my 
letter, and I feel my heart glow

00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:26.348
with an 

00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:29.353
enthusiasm which 

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.609
elevates me to heaven, for 

00:13:39.963 --> 00:13:40.981
steady purpose,a point on which 
the soul may fix its 

00:13:40.982 --> 00:13:42.982
intellectual eye.dream of my 
early years.

00:13:52.283 --> 00:13:54.283
Thomas's library.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:07.162
the various voyages which have 
been made in the prospect of 

00:14:07.163 --> 00:14:07.763
arriving at the North Pacific 
Ocean through the seas which 

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.797
surround the pole.the voyages 
made for purposes of discovery 

00:14:10.798 --> 00:14:13.023
composed the whole of our good 
Uncle Thomas's library.These 

00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:13.625
volumes were my study day and 
night, and my familiarity with 

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:15.626
them 

00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:18.631
increased that regret 

00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:21.967
learning that my fatherâ ™s 
dying 

00:14:22.977 --> 00:14:24.977
injunction had forbidden 

00:14:26.234 --> 00:14:31.156
my uncle to allow me to embark 
in a seafaring life.the first 

00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:33.157
time, those poets whose 

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.165
effusions 

00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:42.237
entranced my soul and lifted it 

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.995
to heaven.lived in a paradise of
my own creation; I imagined that

00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:55.996
I also might obtain a niche in 
the temple where the names of 

00:14:56.238 --> 00:14:58.238
Homer and Shakespeare are 
consecrated.

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:04.135
and how heavily I bore the 
disappointment.

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:12.029
fortune of my 

00:15:14.626 --> 00:15:15.438
cousin, and my thoughts were 
turned into the channel of their

00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:17.439
earlier bent.

00:15:28.792 --> 00:15:30.792
on my present undertaking.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.310
which I dedicated myself to this
great enterprise.

00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:46.325
several expeditions to the North
Sea; I voluntarily endured cold,

00:15:46.326 --> 00:15:48.817
famine, thirst, and want of 
sleep; I often worked harder 

00:15:48.818 --> 00:15:50.818
than the common sailors 

00:15:51.821 --> 00:15:53.821
during 

00:15:54.903 --> 00:15:55.720
the day and devoted my nights to
the study of mathematics, the 

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:57.721
theory of 

00:15:58.732 --> 00:16:01.434
medicine, and those branches of 
physical science from which a 

00:16:01.435 --> 00:16:02.243
naval adventurer might derive 
the greatest practical 

00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:04.244
advantage.

00:16:10.766 --> 00:16:12.998
under-mate in a Greenland 
whaler, and acquitted myself to 

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:14.999
admiration.

00:16:21.373 --> 00:16:23.310
my captain offered me the second
dignity in the vessel and 

00:16:23.311 --> 00:16:25.311
entreated me to remain 

00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:28.192
with the greatest earnestness, 
so valuable did he consider my 

00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:30.193
services.

00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:41.662
deserve to accomplish some great
purpose?

00:16:42.923 --> 00:16:44.923
and luxury, but I preferred 
glory to 

00:16:45.947 --> 00:16:47.947
every 

00:16:51.874 --> 00:16:53.874
enticement that wealth placed in
my path.

00:16:57.324 --> 00:16:59.324
but my hopes fluctuate, 

00:17:06.571 --> 00:17:08.571
and my spirits are often 
depressed.

00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:16.999
and difficult voyage, the 
emergencies of which will demand

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.791
all my fortitude:  I am required
not only to raise the spirits of

00:17:18.792 --> 00:17:20.792
others, but sometimes to sustain
my own, when theirs are failing.

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.797
sledges; the motion is pleasant,
and, in my opinion, far more 

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.019
agreeable than that of an 
English stagecoach.

00:17:42.031 --> 00:17:43.652
you are wrapped in furs, a dress
which I have already adopted, 

00:17:43.653 --> 00:17:45.318
for there is a great difference 
between walking the deck and 

00:17:45.319 --> 00:17:47.977
remaining seated motionless for 
hours, when no exercise prevents

00:17:47.978 --> 00:17:49.978
the blood from actually freezing
in your veins.

00:17:56.693 --> 00:17:58.693
the post-road between 

00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:02.803
St. Petersburgh and Archangel.

00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:13.022
fortnight or three weeks; and my
intention is to 

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.239
hire a ship there, which can 
easily be done by paying the 

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.240
insurance for the owner, and to 
engage as many 

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:23.782
sailors as I think necessary 
among those who are accustomed 

00:18:23.783 --> 00:18:25.783
to the whale-fishing.

00:18:27.476 --> 00:18:29.476
of June; and when shall I 
return?

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.030
answer this question?

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:42.166
perhaps years, will pass before 
you and I may meet.

00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:01.748
you, and save me, that I may 
again and again testify my 

00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:03.749
gratitude for all your love and 
kindness.

00:19:28.538 --> 00:19:30.538
encompassed as I am by frost and
snow!

00:19:41.527 --> 00:19:43.527
in collecting my 

00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:47.097
sailors; those whom I have 
already engaged appear to be men

00:19:47.098 --> 00:19:48.721
on whom I can depend and are 
certainly possessed of dauntless

00:19:48.722 --> 00:19:50.722
courage.

00:19:57.438 --> 00:19:59.438
yet been able to satisfy, 

00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:03.891
and the absence of the object of

00:20:05.564 --> 00:20:07.564
which I now feel as a most 

00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:10.824
severe evil, I have no friend, 

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.140
Margaret:  When I am glowing 

00:20:16.937 --> 00:20:19.199
with the enthusiasm of success, 
there will be none to 

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.177
participate my joy; if I am 

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:27.309
assailed by disappointment, no 

00:20:28.525 --> 00:20:30.525
one will endeavour to sustain me
in dejection.

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:38.882
paper, it is true; but that is a
poor medium for the 

00:20:38.883 --> 00:20:40.883
communication of feeling.

00:20:47.423 --> 00:20:49.423
who could sympathise with me, 
whose eyes would reply to mine.

00:20:55.565 --> 00:20:57.565
sister, but I bitterly feel the 
want of a friend.

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:04.443
courageous, possessed of a 
cultivated as well as of a 

00:21:04.444 --> 00:21:07.332
capacious mind, whose tastes are
like my own, to approve or 

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:12.339
amend my plans.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.655
for the first fourteen years of 
my life 

00:21:32.665 --> 00:21:35.564
I ran wild on a common and read 
nothing but our Uncle Thomas' 

00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:37.565
books of voyages.

00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:45.157
the celebrated poets of our own 
country; but it was only when it

00:21:45.158 --> 00:21:47.158
had ceased to be 

00:21:50.013 --> 00:21:53.007
in my power to derive its most 
important benefits from such a 

00:21:55.755 --> 00:21:58.425
conviction that I perceived the 
necessity of becoming acquainted

00:21:58.426 --> 00:22:01.071
with more languages than that of
my native country.

00:22:07.588 --> 00:22:09.588
more illiterate than many 
schoolboys of fifteen.

00:22:15.128 --> 00:22:20.427
that my daydreams are more 
extended and magnificent, but 

00:22:20.428 --> 00:22:23.093
they want keeping; and I greatly
need a friend who would have 

00:22:23.094 --> 00:22:28.401
sense enough not to despise me 
as romantic, and affection 

00:22:28.402 --> 00:22:31.045
enough for me to endeavour to 
regulate my mind.

00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:38.921
shall certainly find no friend 
on the 

00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:44.442
wide ocean, nor even here in 
Archangel, among merchants and 

00:22:44.443 --> 00:22:46.443
seamen.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.340
dross of human nature, beat even
in these rugged bosoms.

00:22:57.904 --> 00:23:00.537
of wonderful courage and 
enterprise; he is madly desirous

00:23:00.538 --> 00:23:06.213
of glory, or rather, to word my 
phrase more characteristically, 

00:23:08.123 --> 00:23:10.123
of advancement in his 
profession.

00:23:12.957 --> 00:23:14.957
of national and professional 
prejudices, 

00:23:17.212 --> 00:23:19.254
unsoftened by cultivation, 
retains some of the noblest 

00:23:19.255 --> 00:23:21.255
endowments of humanity.

00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:28.356
board a whale vessel; finding 
that he was unemployed in this 

00:23:28.357 --> 00:23:30.357
city, I easily 

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.360
engaged him to assist in my 
enterprise.

00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:41.270
disposition and is remarkable in
the ship for his gentleness and 

00:23:41.271 --> 00:23:43.908
the mildness of his discipline.

00:23:49.806 --> 00:23:52.463
well-known integrity and 
dauntless courage, made me very 

00:23:52.464 --> 00:23:54.464
desirous to engage him.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.067
best years spent under your 
gentle and feminine fosterage, 

00:24:06.775 --> 00:24:07.387
has so refined the groundwork of
my character that I cannot 

00:24:07.388 --> 00:24:09.388
overcome an intense distaste to 
the usual brutality 

00:24:11.204 --> 00:24:13.204
exercised on

00:24:20.863 --> 00:24:21.265
He saw his mistress once before 
the destined ceremony; but she 

00:24:21.266 --> 00:24:23.266
was bathed in tears, and 
throwing herself at his feet, 

00:24:23.502 --> 00:24:24.520
entreated him to spare her, 
confessing at the same time that

00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:27.010
she loved another, but that he 
was poor, and that her father 

00:24:27.011 --> 00:24:29.011
would never consent to the 
union.

00:24:35.611 --> 00:24:37.865
suppliant, and on being informed
of the name of her lover, 

00:24:37.866 --> 00:24:39.866
instantly abandoned his pursuit.

00:24:45.311 --> 00:24:51.211
money, on which he had designed 
to pass the remainder of his 

00:24:51.212 --> 00:24:53.261
life; but he bestowed the whole 
on his rival, together with the 

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:55.262
remains 

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:00.803
of his prize-money to purchase 
stock, and then himself 

00:25:00.804 --> 00:25:03.438
solicited the young woman's 
father to consent to her 

00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:05.439
marriage with her lover.

00:25:10.973 --> 00:25:12.973
thinking himself bound in honour
to my 

00:25:15.857 --> 00:25:16.874
friend, who, when he found the 
father inexorable, quitted his 

00:25:16.875 --> 00:25:20.522
country, nor returned until he 
heard that his former mistress 

00:25:20.523 --> 00:25:22.523
was married according to her 
inclinations.” you will exclaim.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:29.859
uneducated:  He is as silent as 
a Turk, 

00:25:30.879 --> 00:25:32.879
and a kind of ignorant 

00:25:34.156 --> 00:25:36.156
carelessness attends him, which,

00:25:37.902 --> 00:25:39.902
while it renders his conduct the

00:25:42.629 --> 00:25:45.159
more astonishing, detracts from 
The interest.the interest and 

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.160
sympathy which otherwise he 
would command.

00:25:59.292 --> 00:26:01.313
labour, to arrive at once at the
summit But this discovery was so

00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:03.380
great and overwhelming that all 
the steps by which I had been 

00:26:03.381 --> 00:26:03.994
progressively led to it were 
obliterated, and I beheld only 

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:05.995
the result.

00:26:17.682 --> 00:26:17.895
but the spring promises well, 
and it is considered as a 

00:26:17.896 --> 00:26:18.724
remarkably early season, so that
perhaps I may sail sooner than I

00:26:18.725 --> 00:26:21.214
expected.sufficiently to confide
in my prudence and 

00:26:21.215 --> 00:26:22.025
considerateness whenever the 
safety of others is committed to

00:26:22.026 --> 00:26:24.026
my care.

00:26:29.137 --> 00:26:31.137
on the near prospect of my 
undertaking.

00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:41.235
a conception of the trembling 
sensation, half pleasurable and 

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:43.236
half fearful, with which I am 
preparing to depart.

00:26:49.743 --> 00:26:51.743
“the land of mist 

00:26:53.526 --> 00:26:55.526
and snow,” but I shall kill no 

00:26:56.547 --> 00:26:58.547
albatross; therefore do not be 

00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:10.241
A LARMed by my

00:27:14.194 --> 00:27:14.593
Shall I meet you again, after 
having traversed immense seas, 

00:27:14.594 --> 00:27:15.616
and returned by the most 
southern cape of Africa or 

00:27:15.617 --> 00:27:17.617
America?cannot bear to look on 
the reverse of the picture.

00:27:23.252 --> 00:27:24.880
by every opportunity:  I may 
receive your letters on some 

00:27:24.881 --> 00:27:26.881
occasions when I need them most 
to support my spirits.

00:27:35.156 --> 00:27:37.156
never hear from me again.

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:44.809
Walton

00:27:49.802 --> 00:27:51.802
To Mrs. Saville, England.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.050
haste to say that I am safe—and 
well advanced on my voyage.

00:28:05.677 --> 00:28:10.548
merchantman now on its homeward 
voyage from Archangel; more 

00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:12.549
fortunate than I, who may not 
see 

00:28:13.557 --> 00:28:15.557
my native land, perhaps, for 
many years.

00:28:24.033 --> 00:28:26.063
purpose, nor do the floating 
sheets of ice that continually 

00:28:26.064 --> 00:28:28.064
pass us, indicating 

00:28:30.808 --> 00:28:32.808
the dangers of the region 
towards which 

00:28:33.825 --> 00:28:35.825
we are advancing, appear to 
dismay them.

00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:43.247
latitude; but it is the height 
of summer, and although not so 

00:28:43.248 --> 00:28:45.248
warm as in 

00:28:46.249 --> 00:28:48.249
England, the southern gales, 
which blow 

00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:54.000
us speedily towards those shores
which I so ardently desire to 

00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:56.001
attain, breathe a 

00:28:59.053 --> 00:29:01.053
degree of renovating warmth 
which I had not expected.

00:29:05.237 --> 00:29:07.237
that would make a figure in a 
letter.

00:29:11.592 --> 00:29:13.645
springing of a leak are 
accidents which experienced 

00:29:13.646 --> 00:29:15.646
navigators scarcely remember 

00:29:18.561 --> 00:29:20.561
to record, and I shall be well 
content 

00:29:21.835 --> 00:29:23.835
if nothing worse happen to us 
during our voyage.

00:29:31.761 --> 00:29:33.761
well as yours, I will not 

00:29:50.045 --> 00:29:52.045
rashly encounter danger.

00:30:13.005 --> 00:30:14.039
us that I cannot forbear 
recording it, although it is 

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.658
very probable that you will see 
me before these papers can come 

00:30:14.659 --> 00:30:16.659
into your possession.

00:30:18.354 --> 00:30:19.990
by ice, which closed in the ship
on all sides, scarcely leaving 

00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:20.809
her the sea-room in which she 
floated.especially as we were 

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.851
compassed round by a very thick 
fog.change would take place in 

00:30:22.852 --> 00:30:24.852
the atmosphere and weather.

00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:30.025
away, and we beheld, stretched 
out in 

00:30:32.447 --> 00:30:33.516
every direction, vast and 
irregular plains of ice, which 

00:30:33.517 --> 00:30:35.517
seemed to have no end.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.820
mind began to grow watchful with
anxious 

00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:44.312
thoughts, when a strange sight 
suddenly attracted our attention

00:30:44.313 --> 00:30:46.313
and diverted our solicitude from
our own situation.

00:30:52.935 --> 00:30:54.935
fixed on a sledge and drawn by 
dogs, 

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:58.452
pass on towards the north, at 
the distance of half a mile; a 

00:30:58.453 --> 00:31:00.453
being 

00:31:01.473 --> 00:31:03.473
which had the shape of a man, 
but apparently of gigantic 

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:06.028
stature, sat in the sledge and 
guided the dogs.

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.818
traveller with our telescopes 
until he was lost among the 

00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:14.819
distant inequalities of the ice.

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:26.375
miles from any land; but

00:31:28.092 --> 00:31:30.092
this apparition seemed to denote

00:31:31.193 --> 00:31:33.193
that it was not, in reality, so 
distant as we had supposed.

00:31:34.908 --> 00:31:37.903
impossible to follow his track, 
which we had observed with the 

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:40.019
greatest attention.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.584
we heard the ground sea, and 
before night the ice broke and 

00:31:46.585 --> 00:31:48.585
freed our ship.

00:31:53.338 --> 00:31:55.338
morning, fearing to encounter in
the 

00:31:56.794 --> 00:31:58.794
dark those large loose 

00:32:04.402 --> 00:32:06.402
masses which float about after 
the breaking up of the ice.

00:32:15.305 --> 00:32:16.355
was light, I went upon deck and 
found all the sailors busy on 

00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:17.586
one side of the vessel, 
apparently talking to someone in

00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:21.254
the sea.had seen before, which 
had drifted towards us in the 

00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:22.486
night on a large fragment of 
ice.was a human being within it 

00:32:22.487 --> 00:32:24.487
whom the sailors were persuading
to enter the vessel.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.982
seemed to be, a savage 
inhabitant of some undiscovered 

00:32:27.983 --> 00:32:29.983
island, but a European.

00:32:35.558 --> 00:32:37.972
said, “Here is our captain, and 
he will not allow you to perish 

00:32:37.973 --> 00:32:39.973
on the open sea.

00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:45.942
On perceiving me, the stranger 
addressed me in English, 

00:32:45.943 --> 00:32:47.943
although with a foreign accent.

00:32:53.503 --> 00:32:55.547
said he, “will you have the 
kindness to inform me whither 

00:32:55.548 --> 00:32:57.548
you are bound?

00:32:59.838 --> 00:33:02.481
You may conceive my astonishment
on hearing such a question 

00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:05.134
addressed to me from a man on 
the brink of destruction 

00:33:10.423 --> 00:33:12.473
and to whom I should have 
supposed that my vessel would 

00:33:12.474 --> 00:33:18.123
have been a resource which he 
would not have exchanged for the

00:33:18.124 --> 00:33:20.124
most precious wealth the earth 
can afford.

00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:27.625
voyage of discovery towards the 
northern pole.

00:33:32.573 --> 00:33:34.573
and consented to come on board.

00:33:39.327 --> 00:33:42.182
thus capitulated for his safety,
your surprise would have been 

00:33:42.183 --> 00:33:44.183
boundless.

fatigue and suffering.cabin, but

00:33:51.122 --> 00:33:53.122
as soon as he had quitted the 
fresh air he fainted.

00:33:58.129 --> 00:34:00.781
deck and restored him to 
animation by rubbing him with 

00:34:00.782 --> 00:34:02.827
brandy and forcing him to 
swallow a small quantity.

00:34:10.327 --> 00:34:12.971
wrapped him up in blankets and 
placed him near the chimney of 

00:34:12.972 --> 00:34:14.972
the kitchen stove.

00:34:17.882 --> 00:34:20.529
little soup, which restored him 
wonderfully.he was able to 

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.952
speak, and I often feared that 
his sufferings had deprived him 

00:34:21.953 --> 00:34:23.953
of understanding.

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.019
I removed him to my own cabin 
and attended on him as much as 

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.020
my duty would permit.

00:34:37.933 --> 00:34:39.955
creature:  His eyes have 
generally an expression of 

00:34:39.956 --> 00:34:41.956
wildness, and even 

00:34:42.974 --> 00:34:47.504
madness, but there are moments 
when, if anyone performs an act 

00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:50.143
of kindness towards him or does 
him any the most trifling 

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800
service, his whole countenance 
is 

00:34:57.904 --> 00:34:59.904
lighted up, as it were, with a 
beam of 

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.932
benevolence and sweetness that I
never saw equalled.

00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:10.215
despairing, and sometimes he 
gnashes his teeth, as if 

00:35:10.216 --> 00:35:12.879
impatient of the weight of woes 
that oppresses him.

00:35:15.944 --> 00:35:16.554
had great trouble to keep off 
the men, who wished to ask him a

00:35:16.555 --> 00:35:18.555
thousand 

00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:24.432
questions; but I would not allow
him to be tormented by their 

00:35:24.433 --> 00:35:26.871
idle curiosity, in a state of 
body and mind whose restoration 

00:35:27.313 --> 00:35:29.313
evidently depended upon entire 
repose.

00:35:33.053 --> 00:35:35.076
he had come so far upon the ice 
in so strange a vehicle.

00:35:40.353 --> 00:35:43.002
aspect of the deepest gloom, and
he replied, “To seek one who 

00:35:43.003 --> 00:35:45.003
fled from me.

00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:49.439
“And did the man whom you 
pursued travel in the same 

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.440
fashion?

00:35:53.106 --> 00:35:55.734
“Then I fancy we have seen him, 
for the day before we picked you

00:35:55.735 --> 00:35:58.386
up we saw some dogs drawing a 
sledge, with a man in it, 

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.390
across the ice.

00:36:04.776 --> 00:36:06.776
This aroused the stranger's 
attention, 

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:11.121
and he asked a multitude of 
questions concerning the route 

00:36:11.122 --> 00:36:13.165
which the daemon, as he called 
him, had pursued.

00:36:18.464 --> 00:36:20.464
he said, “I have, doubtless, 
excited 

00:36:23.768 --> 00:36:26.443
your curiosity, as well as that 
of these good people; but you 

00:36:26.444 --> 00:36:28.525
are too considerate to make 
inquiries.

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:34.229
“Certainly; it would indeed be 
very impertinent and inhuman in 

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.881
me to trouble you with any 
inquisitiveness of mine.

00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:44.307
“And yet you rescued me from a 
strange and perilous situation; 

00:36:44.308 --> 00:36:46.933
you have benevolently restored 
me to life.

00:36:50.848 --> 00:36:53.845
Soon after this he inquired if I
thought that the breaking up of 

00:36:56.597 --> 00:36:58.597
the ice had destroyed the other 
sledge.

00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:03.305
any degree of certainty, for the
ice had 

00:37:06.592 --> 00:37:08.592
not broken until near midnight, 
and the 

00:37:09.598 --> 00:37:12.491
traveller might have arrived at 
a place of safety before that 

00:37:12.492 --> 00:37:15.142
time; but of this I could not 
judge.

00:37:20.464 --> 00:37:22.464
life animated the decaying frame
of the stranger.

00:37:29.023 --> 00:37:29.439
be upon deck to watch for the 
sledge which had before 

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:29.843
appeared; but I have persuaded 
him to remain in the cabin, for 

00:37:29.844 --> 00:37:31.844
he is far too weak to sustain 
the rawness of the atmosphere.

00:37:32.801 --> 00:37:33.198
watch for him and give him 
instant notice if any new object

00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:35.851
should appear in sight.this 
strange occurrence up to the 

00:37:36.646 --> 00:37:38.646
present day.

00:37:43.307 --> 00:37:44.549
health but is very silent and 
appears uneasy when anyone 

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.590
except myself enters his cabin.

00:37:52.071 --> 00:37:53.115
gentle that the sailors are all 
interested in him, although they

00:37:53.116 --> 00:37:55.766
have had very little 
communication with him.

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:06.266
a brother, and his 

00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:08.974
constant and deep grief fills me
with sympathy and compassion.his

00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:10.975
better days, being even now in 
wreck so attractive and amiable.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.821
Margaret, that I should find no 
friend on the wide ocean; yet I 

00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:24.881
have found a man who, before his
spirit had been broken by 

00:38:24.882 --> 00:38:27.305
misery, I should have been happy
to have possessed as the brother

00:38:27.306 --> 00:38:29.306
of my heart.

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:34.683
concerning the stranger at 
intervals, should I have any 

00:38:34.684 --> 00:38:36.684
fresh incidents to record.

00:38:46.726 --> 00:38:48.726
pity to an astonishing degree.

00:38:50.399 --> 00:38:52.399
destroyed by misery without 
feeling the most poignant grief?

00:38:57.042 --> 00:38:57.988
his mind is so cultivated, and 
when he speaks, although his 

00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:01.556
words are culled with the 
choicest art, yet they flow with

00:39:01.557 --> 00:39:03.557
rapidity and unparalleled 
eloquence.

on the deck, apparently watching

00:39:11.971 --> 00:39:14.818

himself deeply in the projects 

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.830
of others.

to him 

00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:27.205
without 

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.870
disguise.

00:40:23.887 --> 00:40:25.199
Nor have I believed it 
impossible to find a true 

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.630
friend. I agree with you, and 
believing that 

00:40:30.886 --> 00:40:32.886
friendship is not only 
desirable, but a 

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.378
possessable acquisition. To 
judge respecting friendship.

00:40:39.434 --> 00:40:41.519
You have hope in the world 
before you, and have no cause 

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.603
for despair. But I? I have lost 
everything, and cannot begin 

00:40:46.604 --> 00:40:48.604
life anew.

00:40:52.078 --> 00:40:55.041
As he said this, his countenance
become expressive of grief.

00:40:58.925 --> 00:41:01.574
Broken in spirit as he is, no 
one can feel more deeply than he

00:41:01.575 --> 00:41:04.781
does the beauties of nature. 

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:16.705
can feel more deeply than he 
does the beauties of nature.

00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:20.142

wonderful regions seem still to 

00:41:20.143 --> 00:41:22.143

00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:24.452
elevating his soul from earth.
may suffer misery and be 

00:41:24.453 --> 00:41:24.856
overwhelmed by disappointments, 
yet when he has retired into 

00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:25.283
himself, he will be like a 
celestial spirit that has a halo

00:41:25.284 --> 00:41:27.284
around him, within whose circle 
no grief or folly ventures.

00:41:27.516 --> 00:41:29.516
express concerning this divine 
wanderer?

00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:39.703
Yet, if you will, smile at the 
warmth 

00:41:40.836 --> 00:41:41.667
of my expression, while I find 
every day new causes for 

00:41:41.668 --> 00:41:43.668
repeating them.

00:41:57.511 --> 00:41:58.324
may easily perceive, Captain 
Walton, that I have suffered 

00:41:58.325 --> 00:42:00.194
great and unparalleled 
misfortunes.memory of these 

00:42:00.195 --> 00:42:00.600
evils should die with me, but 
you have won me to alter my

determination.once did; and I 
ardently hope that the 

00:42:03.842 --> 00:42:04.662
gratification of your wishes may
not be a serpent to sting you, 

00:42:04.663 --> 00:42:06.663
as mine has been.

00:42:12.387 --> 00:42:14.387
disasters will be useful 

00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:18.731
To you.

00:42:19.804 --> 00:42:22.802
Yell yet if you are inclined, 
listen to my tale. 

00:42:32.335 --> 00:42:34.592
Internal evidence of the truth 
of the events of which it is 

00:42:34.593 --> 00:42:36.593
composed.

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:40.053
You may easily concede that I 
was much gratified by the 

00:42:40.054 --> 00:42:42.054
awkward communication, 

00:42:43.292 --> 00:42:45.292
yet I could not concur that he 
should renew his grief.

00:42:58.799 --> 00:43:02.999
the promised narrative, partly 
from curiosity and partly from a

00:42:58.799 --> 00:43:02.423
strong desire to ameliorate his 
fate if it were I wait but for 

00:43:02.424 --> 00:43:04.424
one event, and then I shall 
repose in peace.

00:43:07.524 --> 00:43:09.985
he, perceiving that I wished to 
interrupt him; “but you are 

00:43:09.986 --> 00:43:13.254
mistaken, my friend, if thus you
will allow me to name you; 

00:43:13.255 --> 00:43:15.895
nothing can alter my destiny; 
listen to my history, and you 

00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:17.896
will perceive how irrevocably it
is determined.

”his narrative the next day when
I should be at leisure.

when I am not imperatively 
occupied by my duties, to 

00:43:31.915 --> 00:43:33.754
record, as nearly as possible in
his own words, what he has 

00:43:33.755 --> 00:43:35.755
related during the day.

to me, 

00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:45.753
who know him, and who hear it 
from his own lips—with what 

00:43:45.754 --> 00:43:47.754
interest and sympathy shall I 
read it in some future day!

00:44:11.964 --> 00:44:13.297
my family is one of the most 
distinguished of that republic.

00:44:13.298 --> 00:44:13.848
counsellors and syndics, and my 
father had filled several public

00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:16.334
situations He was respected by 
all who knew him for his 

00:44:16.335 --> 00:44:18.335
integrity and indefatigable 
attention to public business.

00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:22.633
occupied by the affairs of his 
country; 

00:44:23.641 --> 00:44:25.364
a variety of circumstances had 
prevented his marrying early, 

00:44:25.365 --> 00:44:27.365
nor was it until the decline of 
life that he became a husband 

00:44:28.846 --> 00:44:30.846
and the father of a family.

cannot refrain from relating

flourishing state, fell, through

00:44:45.977 --> 00:44:47.977
numerous mischances, into 
poverty.

00:44:51.745 --> 00:44:54.190
of a proud and unbending 
disposition and could not bear 

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.827
to live in poverty and oblivion 
in the same country where he had

00:44:55.828 --> 00:44:57.828
formerly been distinguished for 
his rank and magnificence.

00:45:01.997 --> 00:45:03.997

retreated 

00:45:06.085 --> 00:45:07.122
with his daughter to the town of
Lucerne, where he lived unknown 

00:45:07.123 --> 00:45:09.123
and in wretchedness.

unfortunate circumstances.

conduct so little worthy of the

affection that united them.him

00:45:23.296 --> 00:45:24.498

through his credit and

assistance.

ten months before my father

hastened to the house, which was

00:45:44.561 --> 00:45:46.561
situated in a mean street near 
the Reuss.

00:45:48.539 --> 00:45:50.539
despair alone welcomed him.

of money from the wreck of his 
fortunes, 

00:45:58.947 --> 00:45:59.159
but it was sufficient to provide
him with sustenance for some 

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.492
months, and in the meantime he 
hoped to procure some 

00:46:00.493 --> 00:46:02.493
respectable employment in a 
merchant's house.

00:46:04.608 --> 00:46:06.818
in inaction; his grief only 
became more deep and rankling 

00:46:06.819 --> 00:46:08.819
when he had leisure 

00:46:11.338 --> 00:46:14.182
for reflection, and at length it
took so fast hold of his mind 

00:46:14.183 --> 00:46:19.327
that at the end of three months 
he lay on a bed of sickness, 

00:46:19.328 --> 00:46:21.328
incapable of any exertion.

with despair that their little

that there was no other prospect

the chamber.

to his care; and after the 

00:47:18.659 --> 00:47:20.720
interment of his friend he 
conducted her to Geneva and 

00:47:20.721 --> 00:47:23.412
placed her under the protection 
of a relation.

00:47:37.694 --> 00:47:39.726
circumstance seemed to unite 
them only closer in bonds of

from the doting fondness of age,

00:47:59.055 --> 00:48:00.481
for it was inspired by reverence
for her virtues and a desire to 

00:48:00.482 --> 00:48:00.886
be the means of, in some degree,
recompensing her for the sorrows

00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:02.719

inexpressible grace to his

pleasurable emotion in her soft 
and benevolent mind.of her 

00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:22.167
hitherto constant spirit, had 
been shaken by what she had gone

00:48:22.168 --> 00:48:25.031
through.previous to their 
marriage my father had gradually

00:48:25.032 --> 00:48:26.056
relinquished all his public 
functions; and immediately after

00:48:26.057 --> 00:48:28.057
their 

00:48:29.095 --> 00:48:31.749
union they sought the pleasant 
climate of Italy, and the change

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.781
of scene and interest attendant 
on a tour through that land of 

00:48:33.782 --> 00:48:36.259
wonders, as a restorative for 
her weakened frame.

00:48:39.913 --> 00:48:40.105
Naples, and as an infant Fe 
accompanied them in their 

00:48:40.106 --> 00:48:42.106
rambles.other, they seemed to 
draw inexhaustible 

00:48:44.138 --> 00:48:46.138
stores of 

00:48:52.703 --> 00:48:54.703
affection from a very mine of 

00:48:58.806 --> 00:48:59.825
love to bestow them upon me.
father's smile of benevolent 

00:48:59.826 --> 00:49:01.826
pleasure while regarding me are 
my first recollections.

00:49:59.179 --> 00:50:01.179
no one could submit more 
gracefully to constraint.

00:50:02.302 --> 00:50:05.127
Her person was the image of her 
mind. Her hazel eyes, although 

00:50:05.128 --> 00:50:07.975
as lively as a bird's, possessed
an attractive softness.

00:50:11.017 --> 00:50:13.017
Her figure was light and airy, 
and 

00:50:14.283 --> 00:50:16.283
though capable of enduring great

00:50:18.343 --> 00:50:20.343
fatigue, she appeared the most 
fragile 

00:50:21.548 --> 00:50:23.548
creature in

00:50:25.052 --> 00:50:27.052
the world.

00:50:32.732 --> 00:50:34.732
I never saw so

00:50:50.304 --> 00:50:52.304
much grace.

00:50:53.775 --> 00:50:55.775
I was more calm and 
philosophical than 

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.090
my companion, yet me temper was 
not so yielding.

00:51:00.564 --> 00:51:02.199
My application was of longer 
endurance, but it was not so 

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.484
severe. I delighted in 
investigating the facts relative

00:51:06.485 --> 00:51:09.335
to the actual world. She busied 
herself in following the 

00:51:13.358 --> 00:51:15.358
aerial creations of the

00:51:17.727 --> 00:51:19.727
The world was to me a secret 
which I desired to divine.

00:51:29.634 --> 00:51:32.118
My brothers were considerably 
younger than myself. But I had a

00:51:32.119 --> 00:51:34.119
friend.

00:51:35.803 --> 00:51:37.812
Henry was the son of a merchant 
of Geneva, an intimate friend of

00:51:37.813 --> 00:51:43.335
my father. He was a boy of 
singular talent and fancy. I 

00:51:43.336 --> 00:51:45.336
remember when he was 9 years 
old, he 

00:51:47.805 --> 00:51:49.805
wrote a fairy tail, which was 
the 

00:51:52.046 --> 00:51:54.491
delight and amazement of all of 
his companions. When I was very 

00:51:54.492 --> 00:51:56.492
young, I remember that 

00:51:57.988 --> 00:51:59.988
we used to act plays composed by
him out of these favorite books.

00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:06.491
The principle characters were 
Orlando, 

00:52:08.113 --> 00:52:10.113
Robin hood, 

00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:13.904
Amades, and St. George. Our 
studies were never forced.

00:52:17.591 --> 00:52:19.437
And by some means we always had 
an end placed in view which 

00:52:19.438 --> 00:52:23.131
excited us in the prosecution of
them. It was by this method, and

00:52:23.132 --> 00:52:25.370
not by emulation that we were 
urged to application.

00:52:28.535 --> 00:52:30.765
Elizabeth was not incited to 
apply herself to drawing that 

00:52:30.766 --> 00:52:32.766
her companions 

00:52:33.814 --> 00:52:36.434
might not outstrip her, but 
through her desire of pleasing 

00:52:36.435 --> 00:52:39.315
her aunt by the reputation of 
some favorite scene done by her 

00:52:39.316 --> 00:52:41.964
own hand.  We learned Latin and 
English that we 

00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:50.143
might read the writings in those
languages. We loved application,

00:52:50.144 --> 00:52:52.144
and our 

00:52:54.563 --> 00:52:56.563
amusements would have been the 
labors of other children.

00:52:59.172 --> 00:53:01.206
Perhaps we did not learn 
languages so quickly as those 

00:53:01.207 --> 00:53:03.460
who are disciplined by the 
ordinary methods, but what we 

00:53:06.729 --> 00:53:09.779
learned was impressed more 
deeply on our memories.  In this

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.050
description, I include Henry, 
for he was constantly with us.He

00:53:14.051 --> 00:53:15.100
went to school with me and 
generally passed the afternoon 

00:53:15.101 --> 00:53:17.101
at our house.

00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:21.609
For being an only child and 
destitute of our companions at 

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.884
home -- that he should find 
associates at our house, and 

00:53:28.343 --> 00:53:30.343
we were never completely happy 
when he 

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.350
was

00:53:34.884 --> 00:53:36.884
absent.

00:53:41.348 --> 00:53:43.348
I feel pleasure when recounting 
my

00:53:52.685 --> 00:53:54.685
childhood.

00:53:55.761 --> 00:53:57.761
For when I would account to 
myself for 

00:54:00.688 --> 00:54:03.126
the birth of my passion, I find 
it arise like a mountain river 

00:54:03.127 --> 00:54:05.127
from a noble and 

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:08.617
almost forgotten sources. But 
swelling, it became the torrent,

00:54:11.044 --> 00:54:13.699
which in its course, has swept 
away all of my hopes and joys.

00:54:17.188 --> 00:54:19.188
Natural philosophy is the genius
that 

00:54:21.236 --> 00:54:25.567
has regulated my fate. I desire 
to state those facts.

00:54:29.029 --> 00:54:31.029
When I was 13 years of age, we 
all 

00:54:33.865 --> 00:54:36.360
went on a party of pleasure.

00:54:41.041 --> 00:54:43.041
In this house, I chanced to find
a 

00:54:49.464 --> 00:54:52.103
volume of the works of  of 
Cornelius Agripa. The wonderful 

00:54:52.104 --> 00:54:54.104
facts he would relate 

00:54:55.721 --> 00:54:57.721
changed the feeling

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.043
I opened it with apathy; the 
theory which he attempts to 

00:55:08.044 --> 00:55:09.471
demonstrate and the wonderful 
facts which he relates soon 

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:10.480
changed this feeling into 
enthusiasm.mind, and bounding 

00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:12.481
with joy, I communicated my 
discovery to my father.

00:55:14.196 --> 00:55:16.196
title page of my book and said, 
“Ah!

00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:22.731
upon this; it is sad trash.

00:55:25.795 --> 00:55:27.795
If, instead of this remark, my 

00:55:29.098 --> 00:55:29.505
father had taken the pains to 
explain to me that the 

00:55:29.506 --> 00:55:30.918
principles of Agrippa had been 
entirely exploded and that a 

00:55:30.919 --> 00:55:35.004
modern system of science had 
been introduced which possessed 

00:55:35.005 --> 00:55:37.005
much greater powers than 

00:55:38.876 --> 00:55:40.876
the ancient, because the powers 
of the 

00:55:41.892 --> 00:55:43.818
latter were chimerical, while 
those of the former were real 

00:55:43.819 --> 00:55:46.860
and practical, under such 
circumstances I should certainly

00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:48.861
have thrown Agrippa aside and 
have contented my imagination, 

00:55:51.743 --> 00:55:52.776
warmed as it was, by returning 
with greater ardour to my former

00:55:52.777 --> 00:55:54.777
studies.

00:56:00.105 --> 00:56:02.564
my ideas would never have 
received the fatal impulse that 

00:56:02.565 --> 00:56:04.565
led to my ruin.

00:56:07.893 --> 00:56:10.888
taken of my volume by no means 
assured me that he was 

00:56:14.384 --> 00:56:15.483
acquainted with its contents, 
and I continued to read with the

00:56:15.484 --> 00:56:17.484
greatest avidity.

00:56:26.338 --> 00:56:31.357
to procure the whole works of 
this author, and afterwards of 

00:56:31.358 --> 00:56:33.358
Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.

00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:41.214
these writers with delight; they
appeared to me treasures known 

00:56:41.215 --> 00:56:43.215
to few besides myself.

00:56:50.544 --> 00:56:52.544
these secret stores of knowledge
my 

00:56:55.632 --> 00:56:57.254
father, yet his indefinite 
sincere of my favorite always 

00:56:57.255 --> 00:56:59.255
withheld me.

00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:02.959
I disclosed my discoveries to 
Elizabeth, therefore, under a 

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.960
promise of 

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.960
strict

00:57:13.216 --> 00:57:15.216
secrecy.

00:57:17.511 --> 00:57:19.511
It may appear strange that a 
discipline 

00:57:22.645 --> 00:57:24.645
of Albetus Magnus should arise.

00:57:35.307 --> 00:57:37.307
I entered where the greatest 
diligence 

00:57:39.777 --> 00:57:42.013
into the search of the 
philosopher's stone and the 

00:57:42.014 --> 00:57:44.014
elixir of life.

00:57:45.468 --> 00:57:48.792
But the latter obtained my most 
undivided attention. Wealth was 

00:57:48.793 --> 00:57:50.793
an inferior object.

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.420
But what glory would attend the

00:58:12.348 --> 00:58:12.758
Wealth was an inferior object, 
but what glory would attend the 

00:58:12.759 --> 00:58:13.369
discovery if I could banish 
disease from the human frame and

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:14.996
render man invulnerable to any 
but a violent death!promise 

00:58:14.997 --> 00:58:15.197
liberally accorded by my 
favourite authors, the 

00:58:15.198 --> 00:58:17.198
fulfilment of which I most 
eagerly sought; and if my 

00:58:18.042 --> 00:58:20.042
incantations were always 
unsuccessful, I 

00:58:22.551 --> 00:58:24.389
attributed the failure rather to
my own inexperience and mistake 

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.390
than to a want of skill or 
fidelity in my instructors.

00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:30.829
exploded systems, 

00:58:38.555 --> 00:58:38.972
mingling, like an unadept, a 
thousand contradictory theories 

00:58:38.973 --> 00:58:39.975
and floundering desperately in a
very slough of multifarious 

00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:41.620
knowledge, guided by an ardent 
imagination and childish 

00:58:41.621 --> 00:58:43.621
reasoning, till an accident

changed the current of my ideas.

00:58:47.591 --> 00:58:48.603
Belrive, when we witnessed a 
most violent and terrible 

00:58:48.604 --> 00:58:50.604
thunderstorm.

00:58:54.933 --> 00:58:56.582
of Jura, and the thunder burst

00:58:56.583 --> 00:58:56.987

delight.beheld a stream of fire 
issue from an old and beautiful 

00:58:59.234 --> 00:59:00.272
oak which stood about twenty 
yards from our house; and so 

00:59:00.273 --> 00:59:01.878
soon as the dazzling light 
vanished, the oak had 

00:59:01.879 --> 00:59:03.313
disappeared, and nothing 
remained but a blasted stump.

00:59:03.314 --> 00:59:05.314
found the tree shattered in a 
singular manner.

00:59:07.615 --> 00:59:10.881
Before this I was not 
unacquainted with the more 

00:59:07.615 --> 00:59:09.615
obvious laws of electricity.

00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:13.453
research in natural philosophy 
was with us, and excited by this

00:59:13.454 --> 00:59:15.079
catastrophe, he entered on the 
explanation of a theory which he

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.484
had formed on the subject of 
electricity and galvanism, which

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.485
was at once new and astonishing 
to me.

00:59:40.152 --> 00:59:40.797

00:59:40.798 --> 00:59:42.162

thunderstorm.of Jura, and the 

00:59:42.163 --> 00:59:43.812
thunder burst at once I 
remained, while the storm 

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.813
lasted, watching its progress 
with curiosity and delight.

00:59:47.678 --> 00:59:50.433
beheld a stream of fire issue 
from an old and beautiful oak 

00:59:50.434 --> 00:59:52.434
which stood about 

00:59:53.447 --> 00:59:55.447
twenty 

00:59:56.852 --> 00:59:59.426
yards from our house; and so 
soon as the dazzling light 

00:59:59.427 --> 01:00:01.427
vanished, the oak had 

01:00:02.442 --> 01:00:04.442
disappeared, and nothing 
remained but a blasted stump.

01:00:05.157 --> 01:00:07.157
found the tree shattered in a 
singular manner.

01:00:10.267 --> 01:00:12.267
entirely reduced to thin ribbons
of wood.

01:00:18.603 --> 01:00:18.803
research in natural philosophy 
was with us, and excited by this

01:00:18.804 --> 01:00:19.685
catastrophe, he entered on the 
explanation of a theory which he

01:00:19.686 --> 01:00:21.071
had formed on the subject of 
electricity and galvanism, which

01:00:21.072 --> 01:00:23.072
was at once new and astonishing 
to me.

01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:07.125
He made a kite with a wire and 
string, 

01:01:08.593 --> 01:01:10.593
which drew down that fluid from 
the clouds.

01:01:14.577 --> 01:01:17.448
This last stroke completed the 
overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa, 

01:01:17.449 --> 01:01:18.686
Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus,
the lords of my imagination; but

01:01:18.687 --> 01:01:20.757
by some fatality the overthrow 
of these men disinclined me to 

01:01:21.162 --> 01:01:23.162
pursue my accustomed studies.

01:01:30.389 --> 01:01:33.647
inclined to commence the study 
of any modern system. And this 

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.648
disinclination was influenced 

01:01:38.147 --> 01:01:40.797
by the following circumstance: 
My father expressed a wish that 

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.798
I should attend a 

01:01:43.863 --> 01:01:45.863
course of lectures upon natural 

01:01:48.907 --> 01:01:50.907
philosophy, to which I 
cheerfully

01:01:56.128 --> 01:01:58.575
consented. The lecture, being 
therefore one of the 

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.052
last, was entirely 
incomprehensible to me.

01:02:05.052 --> 01:02:07.052
The professor discoursed with 
the 

01:02:11.915 --> 01:02:14.374
greatest fluency of potassium, 
Boran, and terms to which I 

01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:17.525
could have fixed no idea. And I 
became disgusted with the 

01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:19.526
science 

01:02:20.928 --> 01:02:22.928
of natural

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.914
philosophy. My occupations at 
this age were principally the 

01:02:33.915 --> 01:02:35.915
mathematics.

01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:39.585
And most of the branchs of study
are pertaining to that science.

01:02:44.446 --> 01:02:46.446
I was busily employed in 
learning

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.504
languages. Latin was already 
familiar to me, and I 

01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:56.192
began to read some of the 
easiest Greek authors without 

01:02:56.193 --> 01:02:58.439
the help of a lexicon. I also 
perfectly understood English and

01:02:58.628 --> 01:03:00.628
German.

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:03.713
This is the list of my 
accomplishments at the age of 

01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:05.714
17.

01:03:07.226 --> 01:03:09.226
And you may conceive that my 
hours were 

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.328
fully employed in acquireg and 

01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:15.787
maintaining a knowledge of this 
various literature.

01:03:17.216 --> 01:03:19.216
Another task also devolved upon 
me when I 

01:03:23.078 --> 01:03:25.078
became the instructor of my

01:03:39.807 --> 01:03:41.807
brothers.

01:03:44.304 --> 01:03:46.735
William, the youngest of our 
family, was yet an infant, and 

01:03:46.736 --> 01:03:48.736
the most 

01:03:51.496 --> 01:03:53.496
beautiful little fellow in

01:03:58.332 --> 01:04:00.332
the world.

01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:04.404
Such was the domestic circle 
from which 

01:04:06.354 --> 01:04:08.354
the care and pain seemed forever
vanished.

01:04:10.066 --> 01:04:12.066
My father directed our studies, 
and my 

01:04:13.527 --> 01:04:15.527
mother partook of our 
enjoyments.

01:04:18.611 --> 01:04:20.611
Neither of us possessed the 
slightest 

01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:24.247
preeminence over the other.  The
voices of command was never 

01:04:24.248 --> 01:04:26.248
heard amongst us.

01:04:28.672 --> 01:04:30.672
But mutual affection 

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:34.630
gaged us all to comply with and 
obey the 

01:04:36.317 --> 01:04:38.317
slightest desire of

01:04:40.528 --> 01:04:42.528
each other.

01:04:43.802 --> 01:04:45.802
&gt;&gt; When I attained the sage of 
17, my 

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.680
parents resolved that I should 
become

01:04:58.418 --> 01:04:58.607
Geneva, but my father thought it
necessary for the completion of 

01:04:58.608 --> 01:04:59.228
my education that I should be 
made acquainted with other 

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.229
customs than those of my native 
country.

01:05:04.822 --> 01:05:07.759
early date, but before the day 
resolved upon could arrive, the 

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.760
first misfortune 

01:05:10.761 --> 01:05:12.761
of my life 

01:05:14.228 --> 01:05:16.228
occurred—an omen, as it were, of
my future misery.

01:05:21.803 --> 01:05:23.803
her illness was severe, and she 
was in the greatest danger.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960
quickly recovered.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.513
During her confinement many 
arguments had been urged to 

01:05:36.514 --> 01:05:38.514
persuade my mother to refrain 
from attending upon her.

01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:44.292
entreaties, but when she heard 

01:05:47.509 --> 01:05:48.501
that the life of her favourite 
was menaced, she could no longer

01:05:48.502 --> 01:05:50.502
control her anxiety.

01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:56.253
attentions triumphed over the 
malignity 

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:01.412
of the distemper—Elizabeth was 
saved, but the consequences of 

01:06:01.413 --> 01:06:03.630
this imprudence were fatal to 
her preserver.her fever was 

01:06:03.631 --> 01:06:05.631
accompanied by the most alarming
symptoms, and the looks of her 

01:06:07.535 --> 01:06:09.535
medical attendants 
prognosticated the worst event.

01:06:17.659 --> 01:06:19.659
and benignity of this best of 
women did not desert her.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:29.315
hopes of future happiness were 
placed on the prospect of your 

01:06:29.316 --> 01:06:31.316
union.

01:06:35.962 --> 01:06:36.858
Elizabeth, my love, you must 
supply my place to my younger 

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.859
children.

01:06:52.899 --> 01:06:54.935
you; and, happy and beloved as I
have been, is it not hard to 

01:06:54.936 --> 01:06:56.936
quit you all?

01:07:00.945 --> 01:07:03.604
me; I will endeavour to resign 
myself cheerfully to death and 

01:07:03.605 --> 01:07:05.605
will indulge a 

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:08.610
hope of

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.229
meeting you in another world.

01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:18.249
”

01:07:23.144 --> 01:07:25.441
countenance expressed affection 
even in death.those whose 

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:27.442
dearest ties are rent by 

01:07:28.456 --> 01:07:30.456
that most irreparable 

01:07:34.206 --> 01:07:36.206
evil, the void that presents 

01:07:39.038 --> 01:07:41.038
itself to the soul, and the 

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.214
despair that is exhibited on the
countenance.persuade itself that

01:07:46.215 --> 01:07:47.243
she whom we saw every day and 
whose very existence appeared a 

01:07:47.244 --> 01:07:50.240
part of our own can have 
departed for

01:07:56.794 --> 01:07:58.794
ever—that the brightness of a 

01:08:00.264 --> 01:08:02.264
beloved eye can have been 

01:08:05.046 --> 01:08:05.862
extinguished and the sound of a 
voice so familiar and dear to 

01:08:05.863 --> 01:08:07.863
the ear can be hushed, never 
more to be heard.

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:14.945
first days; but when the lapse 
of time proves the reality of 

01:08:14.946 --> 01:08:16.946
the evil, then the actual 
bitterness of grief commences.

01:08:21.316 --> 01:08:23.316
hand rent away some dear 
connection?

01:08:29.482 --> 01:08:31.482
which all have felt, and must 
feel?

01:08:36.193 --> 01:08:37.801
grief is rather an indulgence 
than a necessity; and the smile 

01:08:37.802 --> 01:08:39.802
that plays upon 

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:43.827
the lips, although it may be 
deemed a 

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:46.955
sacrilege, is not banished.

01:08:53.532 --> 01:08:55.532
still duties which we ought to 

01:09:00.247 --> 01:09:02.247
perform; we must continue our 
course 

01:09:03.268 --> 01:09:04.961
with the rest and learn to think
ourselves fortunate whilst one 

01:09:04.962 --> 01:09:06.962
remains whom the spoiler has not
seized.

01:09:10.868 --> 01:09:12.094
which had been deferred by these
events, was now again determined

01:09:12.095 --> 01:09:14.095
upon.

01:09:23.853 --> 01:09:25.077
leave the repose, akin to death,
of the house of mourning and to 

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.078
rush into the thick of life.

01:09:32.058 --> 01:09:32.464
those that remained to me, and 
above all, I desired to see my 

01:09:32.465 --> 01:09:34.465
sweet Elizabeth in some degree 
consoled.

01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:39.521
to act the comforter to us all.
its duties with courage and 

01:09:39.522 --> 01:09:41.522
zeal.

whom she had been taught to call
her uncle and cousins.

time, when she recalled 

01:10:16.783 --> 01:10:17.393
She forgot even her own regret 
in her endeavours to make us 

01:10:17.394 --> 01:10:19.394
forget.

accompany me and to become my 

01:10:33.302 --> 01:10:35.129
fellow student, but in vain.and 
saw idleness and ruin in the 

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.130
aspirations and ambition of his 
son.

01:10:45.015 --> 01:10:47.015
being debarred from a liberal 
education.

01:10:53.981 --> 01:10:55.200
read in his kindling eye and in 
his animated glance a restrained

01:10:55.201 --> 01:10:57.201
but firm resolve not to be 
chained to the 

01:10:59.225 --> 01:11:01.225
miserable details of commerce.

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:25.322
each other nor persuade 
ourselves to say the word 

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:25.930
“Farewell!” It was said, and we 
retired under the pretence of 

01:11:25.931 --> 01:11:27.349
seeking repose, each fancying 
that the other was deceived; but

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.761
when at morning's dawn I 
descended to the carriage which 

01:11:27.762 --> 01:11:29.762
was to convey me 

01:11:30.763 --> 01:11:32.763
away, they were

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:40.339
all there—my father again to 
bless me, Clerval to press my 

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.558
hand once more, my Elizabeth to 
renew her entreaties that I 

01:11:41.559 --> 01:11:41.976
would write often and to bestow 
the last feminine attentions on 

01:11:41.977 --> 01:11:43.630
her playmate and friend.to 
convey me away and indulged in 

01:11:43.631 --> 01:11:45.933
the most melancholy reflections.

01:11:52.698 --> 01:11:55.366
by amiable companions, 
continually engaged in 

01:11:55.367 --> 01:11:58.013
endeavouring to bestow mutual 
pleasure—I was now alone.

01:12:04.546 --> 01:12:06.546
must form my own friends and be 
my own protector.

01:12:15.299 --> 01:12:15.330
remarkably secluded and 
domestic, and this had given me 

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:18.299
invincible repugnance to new 

01:12:21.812 --> 01:12:23.812
countenances.

Clerval; these were “old 

01:12:30.338 --> 01:12:32.338
familiar faces,” but I believed 

01:12:36.172 --> 01:12:38.003
myself totally unfitted for the 
company of strangers.my journey;

01:12:38.004 --> 01:12:41.001
but as I proceeded, my spirits 
and hopes 

01:12:44.995 --> 01:12:46.995
rose.

youth cooped up in one place and

01:12:57.119 --> 01:12:59.966
had longed to enter the world 
and take my station among other 

01:12:59.967 --> 01:13:01.967
human beings.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.900
it would, indeed, have been 
folly to repent.

01:13:14.366 --> 01:13:14.570
these and many other reflections
during my journey to Ingolstadt,

01:13:14.571 --> 01:13:16.571
which was long and fatiguing.

01:13:25.603 --> 01:13:27.603
I alighted and was conducted to

the evening as I pleased.of

some of the principal 

01:13:36.974 --> 01:13:38.803
professors.the Angel of 
Destruction, which asserted 

01:13:38.804 --> 01:13:38.999
omnipotent sway over me from the
moment I turned my reluctant 

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.433
steps from my father's door—led 
me first to M. Krempe, professor

01:13:40.434 --> 01:13:42.434
of natural philosophy.

01:13:44.919 --> 01:13:46.919
imbued in the secrets of his 
science.

01:14:03.413 --> 01:14:03.825

different branches of science

philosophy.contempt, mentioned 

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.691
the names of my 

01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:11.001
time in studying such nonsense?

”

01:14:25.574 --> 01:14:25.976
instant that you have wasted on 
those books is utterly and 

01:14:25.977 --> 01:14:28.380
entirely lost.exploded systems 
and useless names.

01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:41.521
lived, where no one was kind 

01:14:45.667 --> 01:14:47.412
enough to inform you that these 
fancies which you have so 

01:14:47.413 --> 01:14:48.420
greedily imbibed are a thousand 
years old and as I little 

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:52.421
expected, in this enlightened 
and scientific age, to find a 

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:50.421
disciple of Albertus Magnus and 
Paracelsus.

01:14:56.479 --> 01:14:57.116
So saying, he stepped aside and 
wrote down a list of several 

01:14:57.117 --> 01:14:59.117
books treating of 

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.073
natural philosophy which he 
desired me to procure, and 

01:15:04.074 --> 01:15:05.877
dismissed me after mentioning 
that in the beginning of the 

01:15:05.878 --> 01:15:07.878
following week he intended to 
commence a 

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.022
course of lectures upon natural 
philosophy in its general 

01:15:12.023 --> 01:15:14.023
relations, and that M.

01:15:15.422 --> 01:15:17.422
Waldman, 

01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:21.519
a fellow professor, would 

01:15:23.865 --> 01:15:25.865
lecture upon chemistry the 
alternate days that he omitted.

01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:28.957
have said that I had long 
considered those authors useless

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.958
whom the professor 

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:33.961
reprobated; but I 

01:15:35.642 --> 01:15:36.251
returned not at all the more 
inclined to recur to these 

01:15:36.252 --> 01:15:38.252
studies in any shape.

01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:42.261
Krempe was a little squat man 
with a gruff voice and a 

01:15:42.262 --> 01:15:44.262
repulsive countenance; 

01:15:47.948 --> 01:15:50.804
the teacher, therefore, did not 
prepossess me in favour of his 

01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:52.805
pursuits.

01:15:56.539 --> 01:15:57.545
connected a strain, perhaps, I 
have given an account of the 

01:15:57.546 --> 01:15:59.546
conclusions I 

01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:04.171
had come to concerning them in 
my early years.

01:16:09.355 --> 01:16:09.657
the results promised by the 
modern professors of natural 

01:16:09.658 --> 01:16:11.658
science.

01:16:13.768 --> 01:16:14.591
accounted for by my extreme 
youth and my want of a guide on 

01:16:14.592 --> 01:16:16.592
such matters, I had retrod the 
steps of knowledge along the 

01:16:18.205 --> 01:16:21.324
paths of time and exchanged the 
discoveries of recent inquirers 

01:16:21.325 --> 01:16:23.325
for the dreams of forgotten 
alchemists.

01:16:26.413 --> 01:16:28.413

immortality and power; such Fe 

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:34.009
views, although futile, The 
ambition of the inquirer seemed 

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.843
to limit itself to the 
annihilation of those visions on

01:16:34.844 --> 01:16:35.655
which my interest in science was
chiefly founded.boundless

worth.first two or three days of

01:16:37.505 --> 01:16:39.033
my residence at Ingolstadt, 
which were chiefly spent in 

01:16:39.034 --> 01:16:39.246
becoming acquainted with the 
localities and the principal 

01:16:39.247 --> 01:16:39.861
residents in my new abode.

M. Krempe had given me 
concerning the lectures.and hear

pulpit, I recollected what he 
had said of M.

seen, as he had hitherto been 
out of town.idleness, I went 

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:54.968
into the lecturing room, which 
M. Waldman entered shortly

after.

01:17:04.407 --> 01:17:05.230

expressive of the greatest 

01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:08.226
benevolence; a few grey hairs 

01:17:11.896 --> 01:17:13.896
covered his temples, but those 

01:17:17.302 --> 01:17:17.493
His person was short but 
remarkably erect and his voice 

01:17:17.494 --> 01:17:19.494
the sweetest I had ever heard.

01:17:21.307 --> 01:17:22.343
recapitulation of the history of
chemistry and the various 

01:17:22.344 --> 01:17:26.719
improvements made by different 
men of learning, pronouncing 

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.720
with fervour the names of the 
most distinguished discoverers.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.816
present state of the science and
explained many of its elementary

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.817
terms.

01:17:42.697 --> 01:17:46.657
experiments, he concluded with a
panegyric upon modern chemistry,

01:17:46.658 --> 01:17:48.658
the terms of which I shall 

01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:54.432
“The ancient teachers of this 
science,” said he, “promised 

01:17:54.433 --> 01:17:56.433
impossibilities and performed 
nothing.

01:18:02.593 --> 01:18:04.464
little; they know that metals 
cannot be transmuted and that 

01:18:04.465 --> 01:18:06.465
the elixir of life is a chimera 
but these philosophers, 

01:18:07.948 --> 01:18:09.810
whose hands seem only made to 
dabble in dirt, and their eyes 

01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:10.312
to pore over the microscope or 
crucible, have indeed performed 

01:18:10.313 --> 01:18:12.313
miracles.

01:18:16.382 --> 01:18:18.382
nature and show how she works in
her hiding-places.

01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:26.615
discovered how the blood 
circulates, and the nature of 

01:18:26.616 --> 01:18:28.616
the air we breathe.

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:30.329
unlimited powers; they can 
command the thunders of heaven, 

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:31.433
mimic the earthquake, and even 
mock the invisible world with 

01:18:31.434 --> 01:18:34.770
its own shadows.Such were the 
professor's words—rather let me 

01:18:34.771 --> 01:18:36.771
say such the words of the 
fate—enounced to destroy me.

01:18:39.296 --> 01:18:41.296
grappling with a palpable enemy;
one by 

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:45.428
one the various keys were 
touched which formed the 

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:45.629
mechanism of my being; chord 
after chord was sounded, and 

01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:48.078
soon my mind was filled with one
thought, one conception, one 

01:18:48.079 --> 01:18:50.079
purpose.

01:18:53.199 --> 01:18:53.601
soul of Frankenstein—more, far 
more, will I achieve; treading 

01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:55.030
in the steps already marked, I 
will pioneer a new way, explore 

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:55.434
unknown powers, and unfold to 
the world the deepest mysteries 

01:18:55.435 --> 01:18:57.435
of creation.

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:06.228
insurrection and turmoil; I felt
that order would thence arise, 

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:03.429
but I had no power to produce 
it.There only remained a 

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.832
resolution to return to my 
ancient studies and to devote 

01:19:03.833 --> 01:19:04.455
myself to a science for which I 
believed myself to possess a 

01:19:04.456 --> 01:19:06.456
natural talent.mild and 
attractive than in public, for 

01:19:06.506 --> 01:19:06.705
there was a certain dignity in 
his mien during his lecture 

01:19:06.706 --> 01:19:07.734
which in his own house was 
replaced by the greatest 

01:19:07.735 --> 01:19:08.801
affability and kindness.account 
of my former pursuits as I had 

01:19:08.802 --> 01:19:10.802
given to his fellow professor.

01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:14.445
narration concerning my studies 
and smiled at the names of 

01:19:14.446 --> 01:19:16.642
Cornelius Agrippa and 
Paracelsus, but without the 

01:19:16.643 --> 01:19:18.643
contempt that M. Krempe had 
exhibited.

01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:27.474
indefatigable zeal modern 
philosophers were indebted for 

01:19:27.475 --> 01:19:29.714
most of the foundations of their
knowledge.to give new names and 

01:19:29.715 --> 01:19:31.594
arrange in connected 
classifications the facts which 

01:19:31.595 --> 01:19:32.609
they in a great degree had been 
the instruments of bringing to 

01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:34.610
light.

01:19:40.461 --> 01:19:40.926
erroneously directed, scarcely 
ever fail in ultimately turning 

01:19:40.927 --> 01:19:43.120
to the solid advantage of 
mankind.” I listened to his 

01:19:43.121 --> 01:19:46.070
statement, which was delivered 
without any presumption or 

01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:49.331
affectation, and then added that
his lecture had removed my 

01:19:49.332 --> 01:19:53.131
prejudices against modern 
chemists; I expressed myself in 

01:19:53.132 --> 01:19:55.132
measured terms, with the 

01:19:58.829 --> 01:20:00.829
modesty and deference due from a
youth 

01:20:09.261 --> 01:20:10.079
to his instructor, without 
letting escape any of the 

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.080
enthusiasm which stimulated my 
intended labours.

01:20:16.005 --> 01:20:17.041
Chemistry is that branch of 
natural philosophy in which the 

01:20:17.042 --> 01:20:17.645
greatest improvements have been 
and may be made; it is on that 

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.646
account that I have made it my 
peculiar study; but at the same 

01:20:22.087 --> 01:20:24.087
time, I have not neglected the 

01:20:28.677 --> 01:20:29.479
A man would make but a very 
sorry chemist if he attended to 

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.314
that department of human 
knowledge alone.of science and 

01:20:32.315 --> 01:20:34.315
not merely a petty 

01:20:35.783 --> 01:20:37.783
experimentalist, I 

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.755
should advise you to apply to 
every branch of natural 

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:44.976
philosophy, including 
mathematics.He then took me into

01:20:44.977 --> 01:20:46.977
his laboratory and explained to 
me the uses of his various 

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:50.092
machines, instructing me as to 
what I ought to procure and 

01:20:50.093 --> 01:20:52.093
promising me the 

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:54.338
use of his own when I should 
have advanced far enough in the 

01:20:54.339 --> 01:20:56.339
science not to derange their 
mechanism.

01:21:00.692 --> 01:21:02.692
I had requested, and I took my 
leave.

01:21:08.548 --> 01:21:10.548
me; it decided my future 
destiny.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:22.929
particularly chemistry, in the 
most comprehensive sense of the 

01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:24.167
term, became nearly my sole 
occupation.of genius and 

01:21:24.168 --> 01:21:25.185
discrimination, which modern 
inquirers have written on these 

01:21:25.186 --> 01:21:27.186
subjects.

01:21:31.525 --> 01:21:32.331
cultivated the acquaintance of 
the men of science of the 

01:21:32.332 --> 01:21:35.381
university, and I found even in 
M. Krempe a great deal of sound 

01:21:35.382 --> 01:21:37.637
sense and real information, 
combined, it is true, 

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.442
with a repulsive physiognomy and
manners, but not on that account

01:21:44.443 --> 01:21:46.443
the less valuable. Waldman I 
found a true friend.

01:21:53.031 --> 01:21:54.873
by dogmatism, and his 
instructions were given with an 

01:21:54.874 --> 01:21:57.555
air of frankness and good nature
that banished every idea of 

01:21:57.556 --> 01:21:59.556
pedantry.

01:22:08.277 --> 01:22:10.108
inclined me more to that branch 
of philosophy than the love for 

01:22:10.109 --> 01:22:12.109
the science itself.

01:22:19.112 --> 01:22:21.774
The more fully I entered into 
science, the more I pursued it 

01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:23.775
for its own sake.

01:22:28.332 --> 01:22:31.163
That application now became so 
aridenned and eager that the 

01:22:31.164 --> 01:22:36.500
stars often disappeared in the 
light of morning. As I applied 

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:38.501
so closely, and maybe 

01:22:44.355 --> 01:22:45.012
easily conceived that I improved
My ardour was indeed the 

01:22:45.013 --> 01:22:46.229
astonishment of the students, 
and my proficiency that of the 

01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:48.230
masters.

01:22:51.761 --> 01:22:53.761
sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa
went on, whilst M.

01:22:55.235 --> 01:22:55.840
Waldman expressed the most 
heartfelt exultation in my 

01:22:55.841 --> 01:22:57.841
progress.

01:23:03.331 --> 01:23:03.930
which I paid no visit to Geneva,
but was engaged, heart and soul,

01:23:03.931 --> 01:23:05.576
in the pursuit of some 
discoveries which I hoped to 

01:23:05.577 --> 01:23:07.577
make.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.280
them can conceive of the 
enticements of science.

01:23:17.547 --> 01:23:19.168
others have gone before you, and
there is nothing more to know; 

01:23:19.169 --> 01:23:22.674
but in a scientific pursuit 
there is continual food for 

01:23:22.675 --> 01:23:24.675
discovery and wonder.

01:23:31.033 --> 01:23:33.033
which closely pursues one study 
must 

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.040
infallibly arrive at great 

01:23:41.071 --> 01:23:43.071
proficiency in that study; and 

01:23:51.084 --> 01:23:52.778
I, who continually sought the 
attainment of one object of 

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:53.785
pursuit and was solely wrapped 
Fe up in this, improved so 

01:23:53.786 --> 01:23:54.002
rapidly that at the end of two 
years I made some discoveries in

01:23:54.003 --> 01:23:55.816
the improvement of some chemical
instruments, which procured me 

01:23:55.817 --> 01:23:57.817
great esteem and admiration at 
the university.

01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:00.520
had become as well acquainted 
with the theory and practice of 

01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:02.521
natural philosophy as depended 
on the lessons of 

01:24:06.595 --> 01:24:08.595
any of the professors at 
Ingolstadt, my 

01:24:09.616 --> 01:24:10.636
residence there being no longer 
conducive to my improvements, I 

01:24:10.637 --> 01:24:14.718
thought of returning to my 
friends and my native town, when

01:24:14.719 --> 01:24:16.719
an incident happened that 
protracted my stay.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.853
peculiarly attracted my 
attention was the structure of 

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:29.090
the human frame, and, indeed, 
any animal endued with life.

01:24:33.987 --> 01:24:35.987
principle of life proceed?

01:24:37.836 --> 01:24:38.460
has ever been considered as a 
mystery; yet with how many 

01:24:38.461 --> 01:24:40.461
things are we upon the 

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:42.874
brink of becoming acquainted, if
cowardice or carelessness did 

01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:44.875
not restrain our inquiries.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:55.338
mind and determined thenceforth 
to apply myself more 

01:24:55.339 --> 01:24:55.541
particularly to those branches 
of natural philosophy which 

01:24:55.542 --> 01:24:57.542
relate to physiology.

01:25:01.322 --> 01:25:03.322
supernatural enthusiasm, my 
application 

01:25:04.325 --> 01:25:06.325
to this study would have been 
irksome and almost intolerable.

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:15.342
first have recourse to death.

01:25:20.362 --> 01:25:21.307
anatomy, but this was not 
sufficient; I must also observe 

01:25:21.308 --> 01:25:23.308
the natural decay and corruption
of the human body.

01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:31.420
taken the greatest precautions 
that my mind should be impressed

01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:39.574
with no supernatural horrors.at 
a tale of superstition or to 

01:25:39.575 --> 01:25:41.575
have feared the apparition of a 
spirit.

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:44.914
and a churchyard was to me 
merely the receptacle of bodies 

01:25:44.915 --> 01:25:46.915
deprived of life, 

01:25:49.014 --> 01:25:50.676
which, from being the seat of 
beauty and strength, had become 

01:25:50.677 --> 01:25:52.677
food for the worm.

01:26:01.549 --> 01:26:03.576
cause and progress of this decay
and forced to spend days and 

01:26:03.577 --> 01:26:05.577
nights in vaults and 
charnel-houses.

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:11.931
object the most insupportable to
the 

01:26:12.937 --> 01:26:14.937
delicacy of the human feelings.

01:26:19.554 --> 01:26:21.554
degraded and wasted; I beheld 
the 

01:26:22.561 --> 01:26:25.301
corruption of death succeed to 
the blooming cheek of life; I 

01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:29.330
saw how the worm inherited the 
wonders 

01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:32.342
of the eye and brain.

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:41.636
the minutiae of causation, as 
exemplified in the change from 

01:26:41.637 --> 01:26:43.637
life to death, and death to 
life, 

01:26:44.662 --> 01:26:50.234
until from the midst of this 
darkness a sudden light broke in

01:26:50.235 --> 01:26:52.990
upon me—a light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that 

01:26:52.991 --> 01:26:55.027
while I became dizzy with the 
immensity of the prospect which 

01:26:55.028 --> 01:26:57.028
it illustrated, I was surprised 
that among so many men of 

01:26:58.452 --> 01:27:01.346
genius who had directed their 
inquiries towards the same 

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.828
science, that I alone should be 
reserved to discover so 

01:27:06.829 --> 01:27:08.829
astonishing a secret.

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:20.290
shine in the heavens than that 
which I now affirm is true.

01:27:25.834 --> 01:27:27.865
it, yet the stages of the 
discovery were distinct and 

01:27:27.866 --> 01:27:29.866
probable.

01:27:33.602 --> 01:27:35.875
labour and fatigue, I succeeded 
in discovering the cause of 

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.876
generation and 

01:27:38.878 --> 01:27:41.048
life; nay, more, I became myself
capable of 

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:46.058
bestowing animation upon 
lifeless matter.

01:27:50.655 --> 01:27:51.886
experienced on this discovery 
soon gave place to delight and 

01:27:51.887 --> 01:27:55.022
rapture.labour, to arrive at 
once at the summit of my desires

01:27:55.023 --> 01:27:57.023
was the most gratifying 
consummation of my toils.

01:28:02.832 --> 01:28:04.832
overwhelming that all the steps 
by which 

01:28:08.882 --> 01:28:10.010
I had been progressively led to 
it were obliterated, and I 

01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:12.011
beheld only the result.

01:28:15.865 --> 01:28:18.170
the wisest men since the 
creation of the world was now 

01:28:18.171 --> 01:28:20.171
within my grasp.

01:28:25.574 --> 01:28:28.573
opened upon me at once:  The 
information I had obtained was 

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.977
of a nature rather to direct my 
endeavours so soon as I should 

01:28:33.978 --> 01:28:35.978
point 

01:28:36.988 --> 01:28:39.926
them towards the object of my 
search than to exhibit that 

01:28:39.927 --> 01:28:41.927
object already accomplished.

01:28:47.757 --> 01:28:49.757
been buried with the dead and 
found a 

01:28:50.764 --> 01:28:53.048
passage to life, aided only by 
one glimmering and seemingly 

01:28:53.049 --> 01:28:55.049
ineffectual light.

01:28:56.327 --> 01:28:56.932
and hope which your eyes 
express, my friend, that you 

01:28:56.933 --> 01:28:58.933
expect to be informed of the 
secret with which I am 

01:29:00.963 --> 01:29:03.315
acquainted; that cannot be; 
listen patiently until the end 

01:29:03.316 --> 01:29:08.927
of my story, and you will easily
perceive why I am reserved upon 

01:29:09.072 --> 01:29:11.072
that subject.

01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:17.556
ardent as I then was, to your 
destruction and infallible 

01:29:17.557 --> 01:29:19.557
misery.

01:29:23.912 --> 01:29:25.912
at least by my example, how 
dangerous is 

01:29:29.211 --> 01:29:31.860
the acquirement of knowledge and
how much happier that man is who

01:29:31.861 --> 01:29:34.520
believes his native town to be 
the world, than he 

01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:41.631
who aspires to become greater 
than his nature will allow.

01:29:46.919 --> 01:29:49.718
placed within my hands, I 
hesitated a long time concerning

01:29:49.719 --> 01:29:52.077
the manner in which I should 
employ it.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.660
bestowing animation, yet to 
prepare a 

01:30:00.676 --> 01:30:02.676
frame for the 

01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:06.115
reception of it, with all its 
intricacies of fibres, muscles, 

01:30:06.116 --> 01:30:08.116
and 

01:30:09.122 --> 01:30:12.094
veins, still remained a work of 
inconceivable difficulty and 

01:30:12.095 --> 01:30:14.095
labour.

01:30:18.852 --> 01:30:20.852
attempt the creation of a

01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:25.108
being like myself, or one of 
simpler organization; but my 

01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.506
imagination was too much exalted
by my first success to permit me

01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:25.932
to doubt of my ability to give 
life to an animal as complex and

01:30:25.933 --> 01:30:29.638
wonderful as man.command hardly 
appeared adequate to so arduous 

01:30:29.639 --> 01:30:31.639
an undertaking, but I doubted 

01:30:32.651 --> 01:30:34.651
not that I should ultimately 
succeed.

01:30:42.309 --> 01:30:44.344
reverses; my operations might be
incessantly baffled, and at last

01:30:44.345 --> 01:30:46.345
my work 

01:30:49.576 --> 01:30:52.467
be imperfect, yet when I 
considered the improvement which

01:30:52.468 --> 01:30:54.468
every day takes 

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.384
place in science and mechanics, 
I was encouraged to hope my 

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:57.989
present attempts would at least 
lay the foundations of future 

01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:59.990
success.

01:31:08.865 --> 01:31:11.714
magnitude and complexity of my 
plan as any argument of its 

01:31:11.715 --> 01:31:13.759
impracticability.the creation of
a human being.

01:31:20.722 --> 01:31:22.722
great hindrance to my speed, I 
resolved, 

01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:28.068
contrary to my first intention, 
to make the being of a gigantic 

01:31:28.069 --> 01:31:30.069
stature, that is to say, 

01:31:31.073 --> 01:31:33.073
about eight feet

01:31:34.335 --> 01:31:37.060
in height, and proportionably 
After having formed this 

01:31:37.061 --> 01:31:39.951
determination and having spent 
some months in successfully 

01:31:39.952 --> 01:31:42.008
collecting and arranging my 
materials, I began.

01:31:47.739 --> 01:31:49.739
feelings which bore me onwards, 
like a 

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.740
hurricane, in the first 
enthusiasm of success.

01:31:58.023 --> 01:32:00.073
bounds, which I should first 
break through, and pour a 

01:32:00.074 --> 01:32:02.074
torrent of light into our dark 
world.

01:32:09.788 --> 01:32:11.068
creator and source; many happy 
and excellent natures would owe 

01:32:11.069 --> 01:32:13.069
their being to me.

01:32:16.925 --> 01:32:18.925
his child so completely as I 
should deserve theirs.

01:32:23.532 --> 01:32:24.477
that if I could bestow animation
upon lifeless matter, I might in

01:32:24.478 --> 01:32:27.477
process of time renew

01:32:32.690 --> 01:32:34.690
life where death had apparently 
devoted the body to corruption.

01:32:41.593 --> 01:32:43.700
while I pursued my undertaking 
with unremitting ardour.

01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:53.601
my person had become emaciated 
with confinement.

01:32:58.844 --> 01:33:00.678
certainty, I failed; yet still I
clung to the hope which the next

01:33:00.679 --> 01:33:02.718
day or the next hour might 
realise.

01:33:07.872 --> 01:33:10.838
possessed was the hope to which 
I had dedicated myself; and the 

01:33:10.839 --> 01:33:12.887
moon gazed on my midnight 
labours, while, with 

01:33:15.895 --> 01:33:17.895
unrelaxed 

01:33:19.059 --> 01:33:22.055
and breathless eagerness, I 
pursued nature to her 

01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:24.310
hiding-places.

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:33.118
secret toil as I dabbled among 
the unhallowed damps of the 

01:33:33.119 --> 01:33:34.549
grave or tortured the living 
animal to animate the lifeless 

01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:36.550
clay?

01:33:39.288 --> 01:33:40.905
with the remembrance; but then a
resistless and almost frantic 

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:42.906
impulse 

01:33:43.917 --> 01:33:45.917
urged me 

01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.854
forward; I seemed to have lost 
all soul or sensation but for 

01:33:50.855 --> 01:33:52.855
this one pursuit.

01:33:57.084 --> 01:33:59.084
that only made me feel with 
renewed 

01:34:00.317 --> 01:34:02.317
acuteness so soon 

01:34:03.753 --> 01:34:04.579
as, the unnatural stimulus 
ceasing to operate, I had 

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:06.580
returned to my old habits.

01:34:08.878 --> 01:34:10.878
and disturbed, with profane 
fingers, the 

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.240
tremendous secrets of the human 
frame.

01:34:20.596 --> 01:34:23.586
at the top of the house, and 
separated from all the other 

01:34:25.638 --> 01:34:27.638
apartments by a gallery and 
staircase, I 

01:34:28.658 --> 01:34:30.658
kept my workshop of

01:34:31.805 --> 01:34:33.837
filthy creation; my eyeballs 
were starting from their sockets

01:34:33.838 --> 01:34:35.838
in attending 

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:39.053
The dissecting room and the 
slaughter-house furnished many 

01:34:39.054 --> 01:34:40.891
of my materials; and often did 
my human nature turn with 

01:34:40.892 --> 01:34:42.892
loathing from my occupation, 

01:34:43.917 --> 01:34:45.917
whilst, still urged on by an 

01:34:47.024 --> 01:34:49.397
eagerness which perpetually 
increased, I brought my work 

01:34:49.398 --> 01:34:51.398
near to a conclusion.

01:34:58.103 --> 01:35:00.103
was thus engaged, heart and 
soul, in one pursuit.

01:35:05.170 --> 01:35:07.170
did the fields bestow a 

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:10.453
more plentiful harvest or the 

01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:14.212
vines yield a more luxuriant 
vintage, but my eyes were 

01:35:14.213 --> 01:35:16.245
insensible to the charms of 
nature.

01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:24.210
neglect the scenes around me 
caused me 

01:35:25.213 --> 01:35:27.213
also to forget those 

01:35:28.327 --> 01:35:31.325
friends who were so many miles 
absent, and whom I had not seen 

01:35:31.874 --> 01:35:33.874
for so long a time.

01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.486
I well remembered the words of 
my father:  “I know that while 

01:35:40.487 --> 01:35:42.487
you are 

01:35:43.502 --> 01:35:45.502
pleased with 

01:35:46.528 --> 01:35:48.538
yourself you will think of us 
with affection, and we shall 

01:35:48.539 --> 01:35:50.539
hear regularly from you.

01:35:56.497 --> 01:35:58.749
any interruption in your 
correspondence as a proof that 

01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:00.750
your other duties are 

01:36:01.765 --> 01:36:03.765
equally neglected.

01:36:05.641 --> 01:36:07.641
I knew well therefore what would

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:11.760
be my father's feelings, but I 
could not tear my thoughts from 

01:36:15.855 --> 01:36:16.926
my employment, loathsome in 
itself, but which had taken an 

01:36:16.927 --> 01:36:18.962
irresistible hold of my 
imagination.

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:24.909
all that related to my feelings 
of affection until the great 

01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:29.043
object, which swallowed up every
habit of my nature, should be 

01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:26.910
completed.

01:36:30.869 --> 01:36:32.759
unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice or faultiness on my 

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.760
part, but I am now convinced 
that he was justified in 

01:36:35.006 --> 01:36:37.006
conceiving that I should not be 
altogether free from blame.

01:36:44.122 --> 01:36:45.744
ought always to preserve a calm 
and peaceful mind and never to 

01:36:45.745 --> 01:36:47.745
allow passion 

01:36:48.753 --> 01:36:50.779
or a transitory desire to 
disturb his tranquillity.

01:36:57.349 --> 01:36:59.349
of knowledge is an exception to 
this rule.

01:37:03.428 --> 01:37:06.331
yourself has a tendency to 
weaken your affections and to 

01:37:06.332 --> 01:37:08.332
destroy your taste for 

01:37:11.024 --> 01:37:13.267
those simple pleasures in which 
no alloy can possibly mix, then 

01:37:13.268 --> 01:37:15.268
that study is 

01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:21.570
certainly unlawful, that is to 
say, not befitting the human 

01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:19.570
mind.

01:37:25.705 --> 01:37:27.705
observed; if no man allowed any 
pursuit 

01:37:28.711 --> 01:37:31.502
whatsoever to interfere with the
tranquillity of his domestic 

01:37:33.762 --> 01:37:35.762
affections, Greece had not been 

01:37:37.386 --> 01:37:39.699
enslaved, Caesar would have 
spared his country, America 

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.733
would have been discovered more 
gradually, and the 

01:37:44.757 --> 01:37:46.757
empires of 

01:37:50.925 --> 01:37:53.397
But I forget that I am 
moralizing in the most 

01:37:53.398 --> 01:37:55.398
interesting part of my tale, and
your looks remind me to proceed.

01:37:55.854 --> 01:37:57.890
letters and only took notice of 
my silence by inquiring into my 

01:37:57.891 --> 01:38:01.956
occupations more particularly 
than before.during my labours; 

01:38:01.957 --> 01:38:03.957
but I did not watch 

01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:06.970
the blossom 

01:38:08.546 --> 01:38:12.812
or the expanding leaves—sights 
which before always yielded me 

01:38:08.546 --> 01:38:10.845
supreme delight—so deeply was I 
engrossed in my occupation.

01:38:19.818 --> 01:38:20.216
before my work drew near to a 
close, and now every day showed 

01:38:20.217 --> 01:38:22.217
me more plainly how 

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.220
well I had succeeded.

01:38:28.264 --> 01:38:29.455
anxiety, and I appeared rather 
like one doomed by slavery to 

01:38:29.456 --> 01:38:31.456
toil in the mines, 

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:36.405
or any other unwholesome trade 
than an artist occupied by his 

01:38:36.406 --> 01:38:38.406
favourite employment.

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:45.484
fever, and I became nervous

01:38:46.573 --> 01:38:48.418
to a most painful degree; the 
fall of a leaf startled me, and 

01:38:48.419 --> 01:38:50.419
I shunned my 

01:38:51.436 --> 01:38:53.436
fellow creatures as if I had 
been guilty of a crime.

01:39:00.065 --> 01:39:02.704
perceived that I had become; the
energy of my purpose alone 

01:39:02.705 --> 01:39:04.705
sustained me:  My 

01:39:07.868 --> 01:39:10.835
labours would soon end, and I 
believed that exercise and 

01:39:10.836 --> 01:39:12.836
amusement would then drive away 
incipient disease; and I 

01:39:12.867 --> 01:39:13.803
promised myself both of these 
when my creation should be 

01:39:13.804 --> 01:39:15.804
complete.

01:39:19.914 --> 01:39:21.914
that I beheld the accomplishment
of my toils.

01:39:22.975 --> 01:39:23.984
agony, I collected the 
instruments of life around me, 

01:39:23.985 --> 01:39:25.985
that I might infuse a 

01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.874
It was already one in the 
morning; the rain pattered 

01:39:28.875 --> 01:39:30.875
dismally against the 

01:39:31.892 --> 01:39:33.892
panes, and 

01:39:34.928 --> 01:39:36.976
my candle was nearly burnt out, 
when, by the glimmer of the 

01:39:36.977 --> 01:39:38.977
half-extinguished 

01:39:42.024 --> 01:39:44.024
light, I saw the dull yellow eye
of the 

01:39:45.162 --> 01:39:47.182
creature open; it breathed hard,
and a convulsive motion agitated

01:39:47.183 --> 01:39:49.183
its limbs.

01:39:55.182 --> 01:39:58.180
at this catastrophe, or how 
delineate the wretch whom with 

01:40:01.298 --> 01:40:03.298
such infinite pains and care I 
had endeavoured to form?

01:40:09.312 --> 01:40:11.312
and I had selected his features 
as beautiful.

01:40:17.516 --> 01:40:20.511
the work of muscles and arteries
beneath; his hair was of a 

01:40:23.455 --> 01:40:25.455
lustrous black, and flowing; his
teeth 

01:40:26.459 --> 01:40:28.459
of a pearly whiteness; but

01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.637
these luxuriances only formed a 
more horrid contrast with his 

01:40:31.638 --> 01:40:33.638
watery eyes, 

01:40:34.642 --> 01:40:37.606
that seemed almost of the same 
colour as the dun-white 

01:40:40.608 --> 01:40:43.123
sockets in which they were set, 
his shrivelled complexion and 

01:40:45.765 --> 01:40:47.765
straight black lips.

01:40:51.904 --> 01:40:53.904
are not so changeable as the 
feelings of human nature.

01:41:00.013 --> 01:41:03.305
for the sole purpose of infusing
life into an inanimate body.

01:41:07.835 --> 01:41:09.835
of rest and health.

01:41:15.473 --> 01:41:18.126
far exceeded moderation; but now
that I had finished, the beauty 

01:41:18.127 --> 01:41:20.127
of the dream 

01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:25.170
vanished, and breathless horror 
and disgust filled my heart.

01:41:30.148 --> 01:41:32.148
being I had created, I rushed 
out of the 

01:41:33.154 --> 01:41:35.154
room and 

01:41:36.295 --> 01:41:38.345
continued a long time traversing
my bed-chamber, unable to 

01:41:38.346 --> 01:41:40.346
compose my mind to sleep.

01:41:47.092 --> 01:41:50.016
the tumult I had before endured,
and I threw myself on the bed in

01:41:50.017 --> 01:41:52.467
my clothes, endeavouring to seek
a few moments of forgetfulness.

01:42:00.635 --> 01:42:02.635
but I was disturbed by the 
wildest dreams.

01:42:08.744 --> 01:42:10.744
of health, walking in the 
streets of Ingolstadt.

01:42:15.622 --> 01:42:17.622
her, but as I imprinted

01:42:18.742 --> 01:42:20.742
the first kiss on her lips, they
became 

01:42:21.748 --> 01:42:26.785
livid with the hue of death; her
features appeared to change, and

01:42:26.786 --> 01:42:28.786
I thought that I held the corpse
of 

01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:32.850
my dead mother in my arms; a 
shroud 

01:42:34.869 --> 01:42:37.384
enveloped her form, and I saw 
the grave-worms crawling in the 

01:42:37.385 --> 01:42:39.385
folds of the flannel.

01:42:46.074 --> 01:42:48.074
cold dew covered my 

01:42:49.097 --> 01:42:51.097
forehead, my teeth chattered, 
and every 

01:42:52.111 --> 01:42:57.097
limb became convulsed; when, by 
the dim and yellow light of the 

01:42:57.098 --> 01:42:59.098
moon, as it forced its way 
through 

01:43:00.110 --> 01:43:02.110
the window 

01:43:03.135 --> 01:43:05.156
shutters, I beheld the 
wretch—the miserable monster 

01:43:05.157 --> 01:43:07.157
whom I had created.

01:43:13.366 --> 01:43:15.366
bed; and his eyes, if eyes they 
may be called, were fixed on me.

01:43:22.754 --> 01:43:24.754
some inarticulate sounds, while 
a grin wrinkled his cheeks.

01:43:30.457 --> 01:43:32.457
hear; one hand was stretched

01:43:33.551 --> 01:43:35.551
out, seemingly to detain me, but
I escaped and rushed downstairs.

01:43:43.384 --> 01:43:45.579
belonging to the house which I 
inhabited, where I remained 

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.652
during the rest of the night, 
walking up and down 

01:43:53.859 --> 01:43:55.892
in the greatest agitation, 
listening attentively, catching 

01:43:55.893 --> 01:43:57.893
and fearing each 

01:43:58.901 --> 01:44:01.844
sound as if it were to announce 
the approach of the demoniacal 

01:44:01.845 --> 01:44:03.845
corpse to which I had so 
miserably given life.

01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:08.070
No mortal could support the 
horror of that countenance.

01:44:15.417 --> 01:44:17.417
was ugly then, but when those 
muscles 

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:21.953
and joints were rendered capable
of 

01:44:22.958 --> 01:44:25.837
motion, it became a thing such 
as even Dante could not have 

01:44:25.838 --> 01:44:27.838
conceived.

01:44:37.432 --> 01:44:40.325
hardly that I felt the 
palpitation of every artery; at 

01:44:40.326 --> 01:44:42.326
others, I nearly sank 

01:44:43.332 --> 01:44:45.332
to the 

01:44:46.444 --> 01:44:48.444
ground through languor and 

01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:52.111
Mingled with this horror, I felt
the bitterness of 

01:44:52.112 --> 01:44:54.112
disappointment; dreams 

01:44:57.366 --> 01:44:59.366
that had been my food and 
pleasant rest 

01:45:00.386 --> 01:45:02.769
for so long a space were now 
become a hell to me; and the 

01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:04.770
change was so rapid, the 
overthrow so complete!

01:45:11.556 --> 01:45:13.556
dawned and discovered to 

01:45:15.084 --> 01:45:18.053
my sleepless and aching eyes the
church of Ingolstadt, its white 

01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:22.620
steeple and clock, which 
indicated the sixth hour.

01:45:28.813 --> 01:45:30.840
the court, which had that night 
been my asylum, and I issued 

01:45:30.841 --> 01:45:33.840
into the streets, pacing them 

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.974
with quick steps, as if I sought
to avoid the wretch whom I 

01:45:39.975 --> 01:45:42.442
feared every turning of the 
street would present to my view.

01:45:49.956 --> 01:45:51.956
which I inhabited, but

01:45:53.099 --> 01:45:55.099
felt impelled to hurry on, 
although 

01:45:56.112 --> 01:45:59.093
drenched by the rain which 
poured from a black and 

01:45:59.094 --> 01:46:01.094
comfortless sky.

01:46:04.646 --> 01:46:06.646
some time, endeavouring by 
bodily 

01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:13.810
exercise to ease the load that 
weighed upon my mind.

01:46:17.361 --> 01:46:19.361
clear conception of where I was 
or what I was doing.

01:46:25.323 --> 01:46:27.323
sickness of fear, and I hurried 
on with 

01:46:28.532 --> 01:46:31.433
irregular steps, not daring to 
look Like one who, on a lonely 

01:46:31.434 --> 01:46:33.498
road, Doth walk in fear and 
dread, And, having once turned 

01:46:33.499 --> 01:46:34.514
round, walks on, And turns no 
more his head; Because he knows 

01:46:34.515 --> 01:46:36.515
a 

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:39.591
frightful fiend Doth close 
behind him tread.

01:46:47.642 --> 01:46:49.642
length opposite to the inn at 
which the 

01:46:50.642 --> 01:46:52.642
various diligences and carriages
usually stopped.

01:46:57.045 --> 01:46:57.660
remained some minutes with my 
eyes fixed on a coach that was 

01:46:57.661 --> 01:46:59.661
coming towards me 

01:47:01.351 --> 01:47:03.351
from the other end of the 
street.

01:47:11.438 --> 01:47:14.196
was the Swiss diligence; it 
stopped just where I was 

01:47:14.197 --> 01:47:16.025
standing, and on the door being 
opened, I perceived Henry 

01:47:16.026 --> 01:47:18.026
Clerval, who, on seeing me, 
instantly sprung out.

01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:23.589
“how glad I am to see you!

01:47:31.037 --> 01:47:33.037
at the very moment of my 

01:47:35.322 --> 01:47:38.164
alighting!Nothing could equal my
delight on seeing Clerval; his 

01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:42.098
presence brought back to my 
thoughts my father, Elizabeth, 

01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:40.208
and all those scenes of home so 
dear to my recollection.

01:47:43.318 --> 01:47:45.318
forgot my horror and misfortune;
I felt 

01:47:46.324 --> 01:47:47.905
suddenly, and for the first time
during many months, calm and 

01:47:47.906 --> 01:47:49.906
serene joy.

01:47:57.504 --> 01:47:59.504
in the most cordial manner, and 
we walked towards my college.

01:48:04.142 --> 01:48:05.212
about our mutual friends and his
own good fortune in being 

01:48:05.213 --> 01:48:08.070
permitted to come to Ingolstadt.

01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:19.590
great was the 

01:48:21.684 --> 01:48:22.917
difficulty to persuade my father
that all necessary knowledge was

01:48:22.918 --> 01:48:23.929
not comprised in the noble art 
of book-keeping; and, indeed, I 

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:28.786
believe I left him incredulous 
to the last, for his constant 

01:48:28.787 --> 01:48:30.787
answer to my unwearied 

01:48:33.784 --> 01:48:35.866
entreaties was the same as that 
of the Dutch schoolmaster in The

01:48:35.867 --> 01:48:38.471
Vicar of Wakefield:  ‘I have ten
thousand florins a year without 

01:48:38.472 --> 01:48:40.472
Greek, I eat heartily without 
Greek.

01:48:43.952 --> 01:48:45.952
overcame his dislike of 

01:48:46.971 --> 01:48:49.022
learning, and he has permitted 
me to undertake a voyage of 

01:48:49.023 --> 01:48:51.023
discovery to the land of 
knowledge.

01:48:55.557 --> 01:48:57.557
“It gives me the greatest 

01:49:05.114 --> 01:49:07.195
delight to see you; but tell me 
how you left my father, 

01:49:07.196 --> 01:49:09.196
brothers, and Elizabeth.

01:49:10.634 --> 01:49:12.634
”

01:49:16.494 --> 01:49:18.494
little uneasy that they hear 
from you so seldom.

01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:25.229
a little upon their account 
myself.

01:49:29.403 --> 01:49:31.403
he, stopping short and gazing 
full in my 

01:49:32.407 --> 01:49:34.407
face, “I did 

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:39.842
not before remark how very ill 
you appear; so thin and pale; 

01:49:39.843 --> 01:49:41.843
you look as if you had been 
watching for several nights.

01:49:46.439 --> 01:49:48.439
“You have guessed right; I have 

01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:52.329
lately been so deeply engaged in
one occupation that I have not 

01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:54.330
allowed 

01:49:55.335 --> 01:49:57.673
myself sufficient rest, as you 
see; but I hope, I sincerely 

01:50:00.679 --> 01:50:02.679
hope, that all these 

01:50:03.825 --> 01:50:06.824
employments are now at an end 
and that I am at length free.”

01:50:14.304 --> 01:50:15.303
endure to think of, and far less
to allude to, the occurrences of

01:50:15.304 --> 01:50:17.304
the preceding 

01:50:21.199 --> 01:50:23.199
I walked with a quick pace, and 
we soon arrived at my college.

01:50:29.792 --> 01:50:35.105
me shiver, that the creature 
whom I had left in my apartment 

01:50:35.106 --> 01:50:37.106
might still be there, alive and 
walking about.

01:50:43.824 --> 01:50:45.824
feared still more that Henry 
should see him.

01:50:51.271 --> 01:50:53.271
few minutes at the 

01:50:54.286 --> 01:50:56.286
bottom of the stairs, I darted 
up towards my own room.

01:51:03.221 --> 01:51:05.221
door before I recollected 
myself.

01:51:12.472 --> 01:51:14.472
children are accustomed to do 
when they 

01:51:15.472 --> 01:51:17.472
expect a spectre to 

01:51:18.618 --> 01:51:21.433
stand in waiting for them on the
other side; but nothing 

01:51:21.434 --> 01:51:23.434
appeared.

01:51:26.519 --> 01:51:28.554
was empty, and my bedroom was 
also freed from its hideous 

01:51:28.555 --> 01:51:30.555
guest.

01:51:36.224 --> 01:51:38.688
good fortune could have befallen
me, but when I became assured 

01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:40.689
that my enemy had 

01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:43.701
indeed

01:51:44.739 --> 01:51:46.739
fled, I clapped my hands for joy
and ran down to Clerval.

01:51:52.947 --> 01:51:54.980
the servant presently brought 
breakfast; but I was unable to 

01:51:54.981 --> 01:51:56.981
contain myself.

01:52:02.046 --> 01:52:04.046
I felt my flesh tingle with 
excess of sensitiveness, and 

01:52:06.032 --> 01:52:08.032
my pulse beat rapidly.

01:52:12.002 --> 01:52:14.002
instant in the same 

01:52:15.106 --> 01:52:17.149
place; I jumped over the chairs,
clapped my hands, and laughed 

01:52:17.150 --> 01:52:19.150
aloud.

01:52:24.236 --> 01:52:27.051
spirits to joy on his arrival, 
but when he observed me more 

01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:31.329
attentively, he saw a wildness 
in my eyes for which he could 

01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:34.329
not account, and my loud, 

01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:39.375
unrestrained, heartless laughter
frightened and astonished him.

01:52:45.565 --> 01:52:47.565
God's sake, is the matter?

01:52:50.537 --> 01:52:51.555
“Do not ask me,” cried I, 
putting my hands before my eyes,

01:52:51.556 --> 01:52:54.637
for I thought I saw the dreaded 
spectre glide into the room; “he

01:52:54.638 --> 01:52:56.638
can tell.

01:52:59.319 --> 01:52:59.518
” I imagined that the monster 
seized me; I struggled furiously

01:52:59.519 --> 01:53:01.519
and fell down in a fit.

01:53:12.856 --> 01:53:14.856
such joy, so strangely turned to
bitterness.

01:53:19.848 --> 01:53:21.848
grief, for I was lifeless and 
did not 

01:53:22.851 --> 01:53:24.851
recover my senses for a long, 
long time.

01:53:29.953 --> 01:53:31.953
fever which confined me for 
several months.

01:53:40.892 --> 01:53:42.892
father's advanced age and 
unfitness for so long a journey,

01:53:45.549 --> 01:53:50.209
and how wretched my sickness 
would make Elizabeth, he spared 

01:53:50.210 --> 01:53:52.256
them this grief by concealing 
the extent of my disorder.

01:53:58.319 --> 01:54:04.252
kind and attentive nurse than 
himself; and, firm in the hope 

01:54:04.253 --> 01:54:06.253
he felt of my recovery, he did 
not 

01:54:07.266 --> 01:54:09.656
doubt that, instead of doing 
harm, he performed the kindest 

01:54:12.108 --> 01:54:14.108
action that he could towards 
them.

01:54:18.165 --> 01:54:20.394
and surely nothing but the 
unbounded and unremitting 

01:54:20.395 --> 01:54:22.448
attentions of my friend could 
have restored me to life.

01:54:30.618 --> 01:54:32.618
bestowed existence was for ever 
before 

01:54:33.630 --> 01:54:35.630
my eyes, and I raved incessantly
concerning him.

01:54:41.496 --> 01:54:43.753
at first believed them to be the
wanderings of my disturbed 

01:54:43.754 --> 01:54:45.754
imagination, 

01:54:48.887 --> 01:54:50.930
but the pertinacity with which I
continually recurred to the same

01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:52.931
subject 

01:54:53.932 --> 01:54:56.878
persuaded him that my disorder 
indeed owed its origin to some 

01:54:59.865 --> 01:55:01.865
uncommon and terrible event.

01:55:06.928 --> 01:55:08.954
frequent relapses that alarmed 
and grieved my friend, I 

01:55:08.955 --> 01:55:10.955
recovered.

01:55:14.711 --> 01:55:16.711
capable of observing outward 
objects 

01:55:17.719 --> 01:55:23.112
with any kind of pleasure, I 
perceived that the fallen leaves

01:55:23.113 --> 01:55:25.140
had disappeared and that the 
young buds were shooting forth 

01:55:25.141 --> 01:55:27.141
from the 

01:55:28.147 --> 01:55:30.147
trees that shaded my window.

01:55:35.272 --> 01:55:37.272
season contributed greatly to my
convalescence.

01:55:41.414 --> 01:55:43.414
affection revive in my bosom; my
gloom 

01:55:44.414 --> 01:55:49.592
disappeared, and in a short time
I became as cheerful as before I

01:55:49.593 --> 01:55:51.593
was attacked by the fatal 
passion.

01:55:57.568 --> 01:55:59.568
“how kind, how very good you are
to me.

01:56:03.486 --> 01:56:05.518
spent in study, as you promised 
yourself, has been consumed in 

01:56:05.519 --> 01:56:07.519
my sick room.

01:56:17.515 --> 01:56:18.946
the disappointment of which I 
have been the occasion, but you 

01:56:18.947 --> 01:56:20.947
will forgive me.

01:56:22.766 --> 01:56:24.766
“You will repay me entirely if 

01:56:25.909 --> 01:56:27.786
you do not discompose yourself, 
but get well as fast as you can;

01:56:27.787 --> 01:56:29.787
and since you 

01:56:30.788 --> 01:56:32.788
appear in such 

01:56:35.118 --> 01:56:37.118
good spirits, I may speak to you
on one subject, may I not?

01:56:48.953 --> 01:56:50.953
observed my change 

01:56:52.618 --> 01:56:54.618
of colour, “I will not mention 

01:57:00.122 --> 01:57:02.122
it if it agitates you; but your 
father 

01:57:03.137 --> 01:57:05.137
and cousin would be very 

01:57:06.281 --> 01:57:08.351
happy if they received a letter 
from you in your own 

01:57:08.352 --> 01:57:10.352
handwriting.

01:57:14.302 --> 01:57:16.302
and are uneasy at your long 
silence.

01:57:23.963 --> 01:57:25.963
first thought would not fly 
towards 

01:57:28.532 --> 01:57:29.531
those dear, dear friends whom I 
love and who are so deserving of

01:57:29.532 --> 01:57:31.532
my love?

01:57:32.589 --> 01:57:34.008
“If this is your present temper,
my friend, you will perhaps be 

01:57:34.009 --> 01:57:36.009
glad to see a letter that has 
been lying here some 

01:57:38.075 --> 01:57:40.075
days for you; it is from your 
cousin, I believe.

01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:43.761
”

01:57:52.883 --> 01:57:54.883
very ill, and even the constant 
letters 

01:57:58.237 --> 01:58:00.498
of dear kind Henry are not 
sufficient to reassure me on 

01:58:00.499 --> 01:58:02.499
your account.

01:58:06.817 --> 01:58:09.811
hold a pen; yet one word from 
you, dear Victor, is necessary 

01:58:10.473 --> 01:58:12.473
to calm our apprehensions.

01:58:17.988 --> 01:58:19.988
each post would bring this 

01:58:21.145 --> 01:58:23.145
line, and my persuasions have 
restrained 

01:58:26.005 --> 01:58:28.005
my uncle from undertaking a 
journey to Ingolstadt.

01:58:31.156 --> 01:58:34.148
inconveniences and perhaps 
dangers of so long a

01:58:37.278 --> 01:58:39.278
journey, yet how often have I 
regretted 

01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:42.790
not being able to perform it 
myself!

01:58:52.442 --> 01:58:53.459
Yet that is over now:  Clerval 
writes that indeed you are 

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:55.460
getting better.

01:58:56.514 --> 01:58:58.514
this intelligence soon in your 
own handwriting.

01:59:00.637 --> 01:59:03.516
and friends who love you dearly.
he asks but to see you, but to 

01:59:03.517 --> 01:59:06.583
be assured that you are well; 
and not a care will ever cloud 

01:59:06.584 --> 01:59:08.584
his benevolent countenance.

improvement of our Ernest!

01:59:14.613 --> 01:59:15.637
to enter into foreign service, 
but we cannot part with him, at 

01:59:15.638 --> 01:59:17.638
least until his elder brother 
returns to us.

01:59:19.745 --> 01:59:21.755
of a military career in a 
distant country, but Ernest 

01:59:21.756 --> 01:59:23.756
never had your powers of 
application.

open air, climbing the hills or 

01:59:27.717 --> 01:59:29.717
rowing on the lake.

01:59:34.597 --> 01:59:36.597
unless we yield the point 

01:59:37.823 --> 01:59:39.823
and permit him to enter on the 

01:59:40.831 --> 01:59:42.831
profession which he has 
selected.

02:01:03.263 --> 02:01:03.666
This girl had always been the 
favourite of her father, but 

02:01:03.667 --> 02:01:05.847
through a strange perversity, 
her mother could not endure her,

02:01:05.848 --> 02:01:07.383
and after the death of M.My aunt
observed this, and when Justine 

02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:08.015
was twelve years of age, 
prevailed on her mother to allow

02:01:08.016 --> 02:01:10.016
her to live at our house.country
have produced simpler and 

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.750
happier manners than those which
prevail Hence there is less 

02:01:11.751 --> 02:01:13.813
distinction between the several 
classes of its inhabitants; and 

02:01:13.814 --> 02:01:15.814
the lower orders, being neither 
so 

02:01:16.873 --> 02:01:20.673
poor nor so despised, their 
manners are more refined and 

02:01:16.873 --> 02:01:18.873
moral.

02:01:21.744 --> 02:01:23.744
same thing as a servant in 
France and England.

02:01:31.059 --> 02:01:33.878
family, learned the duties of a 
servant, a condition which, in 

02:01:33.879 --> 02:01:35.879
our 

02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:39.763
fortunate country, does not 
include the idea of ignorance 

02:01:39.764 --> 02:01:41.764
and a 

02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:44.795
sacrifice of the dignity of a 
human being.

02:01:49.627 --> 02:01:52.441
favourite of yours; and I 
recollect you once remarked that

02:01:52.442 --> 02:01:57.607
if you were in an ill humour, 
one glance from Justine could 

02:01:57.608 --> 02:01:59.608
dissipate it, for the 

02:02:00.614 --> 02:02:02.614
same

02:02:04.071 --> 02:02:04.976
reason that Ariosto gives 
concerning the beauty of 

02:02:04.977 --> 02:02:08.867
Angelica—she My aunt conceived a
great attachment for her, by 

02:02:08.868 --> 02:02:10.868
which she was induced to give 

02:02:12.902 --> 02:02:14.678
her an education superior to 
that which she had at first 

02:02:14.679 --> 02:02:16.679
intended.

02:02:18.189 --> 02:02:20.189
was the most grateful little 
creature in 

02:02:21.407 --> 02:02:23.407
the world:  I do not mean that 
she made 

02:02:24.614 --> 02:02:26.394
any professions I never heard 
one pass her lips, but you could

02:02:26.395 --> 02:02:28.395
see by her eyes that she almost 
adored her protectress.

02:02:34.605 --> 02:02:36.605
many respects inconsiderate, yet
she 

02:02:37.616 --> 02:02:39.892
paid the greatest attention to 
every gesture of my aunt.

02:02:47.836 --> 02:02:49.836
excellence and endeavoured to 

02:02:50.848 --> 02:02:52.700
imitate her phraseology and 
manners, so that even now she 

02:02:52.701 --> 02:02:54.701
often reminds me of her.

02:03:00.061 --> 02:03:01.686
was too much occupied in their 
own grief to notice poor 

02:03:01.687 --> 02:03:02.085
Justine, who had attended her 
during her illness with the most

02:03:02.086 --> 02:03:04.086
anxious affection.

02:03:06.055 --> 02:03:08.103
“One by one, her brothers and 
sister died; and her mother, 

02:03:08.104 --> 02:03:10.104
with the exception 

02:03:13.230 --> 02:03:15.230
of her neglected daughter, was 
left childless.

02:03:18.383 --> 02:03:19.833
troubled; she began to think 
that the deaths of her 

02:03:19.834 --> 02:03:21.834
favourites was a judgement 

02:03:22.843 --> 02:03:25.061
from heaven to chastise her 
partiality.

02:03:30.426 --> 02:03:32.865
her confessor confirmed the idea
which she had conceived.

02:03:38.403 --> 02:03:40.403
departure for Ingolstadt, 
Justine was 

02:03:41.408 --> 02:03:43.408
called home by her repentant 
mother.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.487
She wept when she quitted our 
house; she was much altered 

02:03:48.488 --> 02:03:53.149
since the death of my aunt; 
grief had given softness and a 

02:03:53.150 --> 02:03:55.851
winning mildness to her manners,
which had before been 

02:03:58.856 --> 02:04:00.856
remarkable for vivacity.

02:04:04.690 --> 02:04:06.690
house of a nature to restore her
gaiety.

02:04:09.296 --> 02:04:10.297
her unkindness, but much oftener
accused Perpetual fretting at 

02:04:10.298 --> 02:04:10.913
length threw Madame Moritz into 
a decline, which at first 

02:04:10.914 --> 02:04:12.914
increased her irritability, but 
she is now at peace for ever.

extremely pretty; as I mentioned
before, 

02:04:26.771 --> 02:04:28.962
her mien and her expression 
continually remind me of my dear

02:04:28.963 --> 02:04:30.963
aunt.

darling William.

tall of his age, with sweet 
laughing blue eyes, dark 

02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:47.930
eyelashes, and curling hair.

gossip concerning the The pretty
Miss Mansfield has already 

02:05:16.677 --> 02:05:17.747
received the congratulatory 
visits on her approaching 

02:05:17.748 --> 02:05:19.748
marriage with a young 
Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.

spirits, and is reported to be 
on the point of marrying a

lively pretty Frenchwoman,

02:05:55.338 --> 02:05:57.537
is very much admired, “I have

grateful.I entreat you, write!

02:06:08.349 --> 02:06:10.349
” I 

02:06:20.185 --> 02:06:22.185
exclaimed, when I had read her 
letter:  

02:06:23.186 --> 02:06:24.902
“I will write instantly and 
relieve them from the anxiety 

02:06:24.903 --> 02:06:26.944
they must feel.” I wrote, and 
this exertion greatly fatigued 

02:06:26.945 --> 02:06:28.945
me; but my convalescence had 

02:06:29.957 --> 02:06:31.957
commenced, and proceeded 
regularly.

02:06:37.567 --> 02:06:39.567
to leave my chamber.

02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:50.495
was to introduce Clerval to the 
several professors of the 

02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:48.629
university.

02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:55.426
rough usage, ill befitting the 
wounds that my mind had 

02:06:55.427 --> 02:06:57.427
sustained.

02:07:02.317 --> 02:07:04.317
my labours, and the beginning of
my 

02:07:07.233 --> 02:07:09.233
misfortunes, I had conceived a 
violent 

02:07:10.238 --> 02:07:12.238
antipathy even to the name of 
natural philosophy.

02:07:17.245 --> 02:07:19.283
health, the sight of a chemical 
instrument would renew all the 

02:07:19.284 --> 02:07:21.384
agony of my nervous symptoms.

02:07:33.018 --> 02:07:35.018
he perceived that I had acquired
a 

02:07:36.762 --> 02:07:38.995
dislike for the room which had 
previously been my laboratory.

02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:48.926
no avail when I visited the 
professors. Waldman inflicted 

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:50.927
torture when he 

02:07:51.941 --> 02:07:54.191
praised, with kindness and 
warmth, the astonishing progress

02:07:54.192 --> 02:07:56.454
I had made in the sciences.

02:08:02.238 --> 02:08:04.238
subject; but not guessing the 
real 

02:08:08.615 --> 02:08:09.648
cause, he attributed my feelings
to modesty, and changed the 

02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:14.830
subject from my improvement, to 
the science itself, with a 

02:08:14.831 --> 02:08:16.831
desire, as I evidently saw, of 
drawing 

02:08:18.093 --> 02:08:20.093
me out.

02:08:27.616 --> 02:08:29.616
one by one, in my view those 
instruments 

02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:35.528
which were to be afterwards used
in putting me to a slow and 

02:08:35.529 --> 02:08:37.529
cruel death.

02:08:41.274 --> 02:08:43.274
dared not exhibit the pain I 
felt.

02:08:50.054 --> 02:08:51.128
were always quick in discerning 
the sensations of others, 

02:08:51.129 --> 02:08:53.129
declined the subject, alleging, 
in excuse, his total 

02:08:55.369 --> 02:08:58.324
ignorance; and the conversation 
took a more general turn.

02:09:03.485 --> 02:09:04.088
but he never attempted to draw 
my secret from me; and although 

02:09:04.089 --> 02:09:06.089
I loved him with a mixture of 
affection and reverence that 

02:09:06.315 --> 02:09:07.378
knew no bounds, yet I could 
never persuade myself to confide

02:09:07.379 --> 02:09:10.779
in him that event which was so 
often present to my 

02:09:07.379 --> 02:09:09.245
recollection, but which I feared
the detail to another would only

02:09:09.246 --> 02:09:11.246
impress more deeply.

02:09:16.185 --> 02:09:18.185
Krempe was not equally docile; 
and in 

02:09:20.423 --> 02:09:23.112
my condition at that time, of 
almost insupportable 

02:09:23.113 --> 02:09:25.113
sensitiveness, his harsh 

02:09:26.117 --> 02:09:28.449
blunt encomiums gave me even 
more pain than the benevolent 

02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:30.450
approbation of M.

02:09:33.171 --> 02:09:36.438
” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I 
assure you he has outstript us 

02:09:36.439 --> 02:09:38.439
all.

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.149
believed in Cornelius Agrippa as
firmly as in the gospel, has now

02:09:50.150 --> 02:09:52.150
set himself at 

02:09:56.055 --> 02:09:58.522
the head of the university; and 
if he is not soon pulled down, 

02:09:58.523 --> 02:10:00.523
we shall all be out of 
countenance.

02:10:06.237 --> 02:10:09.170
face expressive of suffering, 
“M. Frankenstein is modest; an 

02:10:09.171 --> 02:10:11.832
excellent quality in a young 
man.

02:10:16.031 --> 02:10:18.031
themselves, you know, M.

02:10:20.297 --> 02:10:22.947
Clerval:  I was myself when 
young; but that wears out in a 

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:24.948
very short time.

02:10:26.982 --> 02:10:29.818
Krempe had now commenced an 
eulogy on himself, which happily

02:10:29.819 --> 02:10:35.007
turned the conversation from a 
subject that was so annoying to 

02:10:35.008 --> 02:10:37.008
me.

02:10:40.956 --> 02:10:43.808
tastes for natural science; and 
his literary pursuits differed 

02:10:43.809 --> 02:10:46.273
wholly from those which had 
occupied me.

02:10:51.987 --> 02:10:54.635
design of making himself 
complete master of the oriental 

02:10:54.636 --> 02:10:56.636
languages, and thus he 

02:10:57.645 --> 02:10:59.645
should 

02:11:01.456 --> 02:11:02.468
open a field for the plan of 
life he had marked out for 

02:11:02.469 --> 02:11:04.469
himself.

02:11:07.783 --> 02:11:10.420
career, he turned his eyes 
toward the East, as affording 

02:11:10.421 --> 02:11:12.683
scope for his spirit of 
enterprise.

02:11:18.327 --> 02:11:20.532
languages engaged his attention,
and I was easily induced to 

02:11:22.577 --> 02:11:24.577
enter on the same studies.

02:11:28.853 --> 02:11:31.692
and now that I wished to fly 
from reflection, and hated my 

02:11:31.693 --> 02:11:37.343
former studies, I felt great 
relief in being the fellow-pupil

02:11:40.133 --> 02:11:43.003
with my friend, and found not 
only instruction but consolation

02:11:43.004 --> 02:11:45.004
in the works of the 
orientalists.

02:11:52.795 --> 02:11:54.795
from Greece

02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:05.707
Summer passed away in these 
occupations, and my return to 

02:12:05.708 --> 02:12:08.397
Geneva was fixed for the latter 
end of autumn; but being 

02:12:11.407 --> 02:12:16.253
delayed by several accidents, 
winter and snow arrived, the 

02:12:16.254 --> 02:12:18.288
roads were deemed impassable, 
and my journey was retarded 

02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:23.290
until the ensuing spring.

02:12:27.916 --> 02:12:28.720
longed to see my native town and
my beloved friends.long, from an

02:12:28.721 --> 02:12:29.559
unwillingness to leave Clerval 
in a strange place, before he 

02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.560
had become acquainted with any 
of its inhabitants.

02:12:35.943 --> 02:12:38.592
cheerfully; and although the 
spring was uncommonly late, when

02:12:38.593 --> 02:12:41.273
it came its beauty compensated 
for its dilatoriness.

02:12:48.047 --> 02:12:50.713
commenced, and I expected the 
letter daily which was to fix 

02:12:50.714 --> 02:12:52.714
the date of my 

02:12:53.719 --> 02:12:59.197
departure, when Henry proposed a
pedestrian tour in the environs 

02:12:59.198 --> 02:13:01.434
of Ingolstadt, that I might bid 
a personal farewell to the 

02:13:01.435 --> 02:13:03.435
country I had 

02:13:04.451 --> 02:13:06.451
so long inhabited.

02:13:12.746 --> 02:13:13.768
proposition:  I was fond of 
exercise, and Clerval had always

02:13:13.769 --> 02:13:18.786
been my favourite companion in 
the ramble of this nature that I

02:13:18.787 --> 02:13:21.427
had taken among the scenes of my
native country.

02:13:28.297 --> 02:13:30.944
perambulations:  My health and 
spirits had long been restored, 

02:13:30.945 --> 02:13:36.019
and they gained additional 
strength from the salubrious air

02:13:38.355 --> 02:13:40.355
I breathed, the natural 
incidents of 

02:13:41.368 --> 02:13:43.368
our progress, and the 
conversation of my friend.

02:13:48.517 --> 02:13:51.172
intercourse of my 
fellow-creatures, and rendered 

02:13:51.173 --> 02:13:53.173
me unsocial; but Clerval called 

02:13:56.836 --> 02:13:58.981
forth the better feelings of my 
heart; he again taught me to 

02:13:58.982 --> 02:14:01.661
love the aspect of nature, and 
the cheerful faces of children.

02:14:08.375 --> 02:14:09.225
How sincerely you did love me, 
and endeavour to elevate my mind

02:14:09.226 --> 02:14:10.504
until it was on a level with 
your own.narrowed me, until your

02:14:10.505 --> 02:14:11.314
gentleness and affection warmed 
and opened my senses; I became 

02:14:11.315 --> 02:14:11.508
the same happy creature who, a 
few years ago, loved and beloved

02:14:11.509 --> 02:14:13.509
by all, had no sorrow or care.

02:14:15.034 --> 02:14:17.034
power of bestowing on me the 
most delightful sensations.

02:14:20.921 --> 02:14:22.921
filled me with ecstasy.

02:14:27.241 --> 02:14:29.340
the flowers of spring bloomed in
the hedges, while those of 

02:14:29.341 --> 02:14:31.970
summer were already in bud.

02:14:37.892 --> 02:14:39.321
during the preceding year had 
pressed upon me, notwithstanding

02:14:39.322 --> 02:14:41.322
my endeavours 

02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:47.220
to throw them off, with an 
invincible burden.

02:14:50.489 --> 02:14:53.478
sincerely sympathised in my 
feelings:  He exerted himself to

02:14:56.259 --> 02:14:58.259
amuse me, while he expressed the
sensations that filled his soul.

02:15:03.177 --> 02:15:05.806
occasion were truly astonishing:
His conversation was full of 

02:15:05.807 --> 02:15:07.807
imagination; 

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:13.240
and very often, in imitation of 
the Persian and Arabic writers, 

02:15:13.241 --> 02:15:15.871
he invented tales of wonderful 
fancy and passion.

02:15:23.155 --> 02:15:24.920
poems, or drew me out into 
arguments, which he supported 

02:15:24.921 --> 02:15:26.921
with great ingenuity.

02:15:31.235 --> 02:15:33.274
afternoon:  The peasants were 
dancing, and every one we met 

02:15:33.275 --> 02:15:35.275
appeared gay and happy.

02:15:41.756 --> 02:15:43.756
along with feelings of unbridled
joy and hilarity.

02:15:52.708 --> 02:15:54.708
—

02:15:57.215 --> 02:15:59.215
“My dear Victor, “You have 
probably 

02:16:00.234 --> 02:16:02.234
waited 

02:16:03.777 --> 02:16:04.817
impatiently for a letter to fix 
the date of your return to us; 

02:16:04.818 --> 02:16:06.818
and I was at first tempted to 
write only a few lines, 

02:16:11.334 --> 02:16:13.334
merely mentioning the day on 
which I 

02:16:21.204 --> 02:16:21.611
What would be your surprise, my 
son, when you expected a happy 

02:16:21.612 --> 02:16:22.627
and glad welcome, to behold, on 
the contrary, tears and 

02:16:22.628 --> 02:16:24.628
wretchedness?

02:16:32.609 --> 02:16:35.061
callous to our joys and griefs; 
and how shall I inflict pain on 

02:16:35.062 --> 02:16:37.062
my long absent son?

02:16:44.745 --> 02:16:46.372
news, but I know it is 
impossible; even now your eye 

02:16:46.373 --> 02:16:47.805
skims over the page to seek the 
words which are to convey to you

02:16:47.806 --> 02:16:49.806
the horrible tidings.

02:16:56.785 --> 02:16:58.785
delighted and warmed my heart, 
who was so gentle, yet so gay!

02:17:03.271 --> 02:17:05.563
will simply relate the 
circumstances of the 

02:17:05.564 --> 02:17:07.564
transaction.

02:17:10.925 --> 02:17:12.925
two brothers, went to walk in 
Plainpalais.

02:17:16.018 --> 02:17:18.018
prolonged our walk farther than 
usual.

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:25.602
of returning; and then we 
discovered 

02:17:27.628 --> 02:17:29.491
that William and Ernest, who had
gone on before, were not to be 

02:17:29.492 --> 02:17:31.492
found.

02:17:34.307 --> 02:17:36.307
until they should return.

02:17:39.949 --> 02:17:41.949
we had seen his brother; he 
said, that 

02:17:44.722 --> 02:17:46.775
he had been playing with him, 
that William had run away to 

02:17:46.776 --> 02:17:49.011
hide himself, and that he vainly
sought for him, and 

02:17:52.041 --> 02:17:54.786
afterwards waited for a long 
time, but that he did not 

02:17:54.787 --> 02:17:56.787
return.

02:18:03.707 --> 02:18:05.707
continued to search for him 
until night fell, when Elizabeth

02:18:06.426 --> 02:18:08.500
conjectured that he might have 
returned to the house.

02:18:14.819 --> 02:18:17.464
could not rest, when I thought 
that my sweet boy had lost 

02:18:17.465 --> 02:18:19.465
himself, and was 

02:18:21.249 --> 02:18:23.249
exposed to all the damps and 
dews of 

02:18:25.546 --> 02:18:27.546
night; Elizabeth also suffered 
extreme anguish.

02:18:30.795 --> 02:18:32.795
my lovely boy, whom the night 
before I 

02:18:35.453 --> 02:18:37.685
had seen blooming and active in 
health, stretched on the grass 

02:18:37.686 --> 02:18:39.732
livid and motionless; the print 
of the murder's finger was on 

02:18:39.733 --> 02:18:41.733
his neck.

02:18:48.713 --> 02:18:50.330
that was visible in my 
countenance betrayed the secret 

02:18:50.331 --> 02:18:52.331
to Elizabeth.

02:18:59.359 --> 02:19:02.049
she persisted, and entering the 
room where it lay, hastily 

02:19:02.050 --> 02:19:04.050
examined the neck 

02:19:07.099 --> 02:19:09.099
of the victim, and clasping her 
hands exclaimed, ‘O God!

02:19:15.878 --> 02:19:16.087
William had teased her to let 
him wear a very valuable 

02:19:16.088 --> 02:19:17.502
miniature that she possessed of 
your mother.the temptation which

02:19:17.503 --> 02:19:19.340
urged the murderer to the deed.
although our exertions to 

02:19:19.341 --> 02:19:20.359
discover him are unremitted; but
they will not restore my beloved

02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.360
William!

02:19:33.084 --> 02:19:35.740
herself unjustly as the cause of
his death; her words pierce my 

02:19:35.741 --> 02:19:37.741
heart.

02:19:42.146 --> 02:19:44.822
be an additional motive for you,
my son, to return and be our 

02:19:44.823 --> 02:19:46.823
comforter?

02:19:52.136 --> 02:19:54.778
to witness the cruel, miserable 
death of her youngest darling!

02:20:00.103 --> 02:20:02.103
vengeance against the assassin, 
but with 

02:20:05.416 --> 02:20:08.060
feelings of peace and 
gentleness, that will heal, 

02:20:08.061 --> 02:20:10.061
instead of festering, the wounds
of our minds.

02:20:14.819 --> 02:20:17.061
but with kindness and affection 
for those who love you, and not 

02:20:17.062 --> 02:20:19.112
with hatred for your enemies.

02:20:23.245 --> 02:20:25.245
father, “Alphonse Frankenstein.

02:20:29.134 --> 02:20:31.188
Clerval, who had watched my 
countenance as I read this 

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:32.603
letter, was surprised to observe
the despair that succeeded the 

02:20:32.604 --> 02:20:33.425
joy I at first expressed on 
receiving new from my friends.

02:20:33.426 --> 02:20:35.426
covered my face with my hands.

02:20:37.934 --> 02:20:40.647
Henry, when he perceived me weep
with bitterness, “are you always

02:20:40.648 --> 02:20:42.648
to be unhappy?

02:20:46.581 --> 02:20:49.034
I motioned him to take up the 
letter, while I walked up and 

02:20:49.035 --> 02:20:51.713
down the room in the extremest 
agitation.

02:20:57.098 --> 02:20:59.098
Clerval, as he read the account 
of my misfortune.

02:21:03.452 --> 02:21:05.452
friend,” said he; “your disaster
is irreparable.

02:21:12.452 --> 02:21:14.452
come with me, Henry, to order 
the horses.

02:21:15.559 --> 02:21:18.234
During our walk, Clerval 
endeavoured to say a few words 

02:21:18.235 --> 02:21:20.889
of consolation; he could only 
express his heartfelt sympathy.

02:21:26.502 --> 02:21:28.319
” said he, “dear lovely child, 
he now sleeps with his angel 

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:30.320
mother!

02:21:34.604 --> 02:21:36.630
in his young beauty, but must 
weep over his untimely loss!

02:21:52.717 --> 02:21:54.717
friends mourn and weep, but he 
is at rest.

02:22:07.423 --> 02:22:09.423
we must reserve that for his 
miserable survivors.

02:22:11.739 --> 02:22:14.202
Clerval spoke thus as we hurried
through the streets; the words 

02:22:14.203 --> 02:22:19.768
impressed themselves on my mind 
and I remembered them afterwards

02:22:19.769 --> 02:22:21.185
in solitude.I hurried into a 
cabriolet, and bade farewell to 

02:22:21.186 --> 02:22:24.890
my friend.longed to console and 
sympathise with my loved and 

02:22:24.891 --> 02:22:25.289
sorrowing friends; but when I 
drew near my native town, I 

02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:27.290
slackened my progress.

02:22:31.237 --> 02:22:33.237
feelings that crowded into my 
mind.

02:22:39.718 --> 02:22:41.718
youth, but which I had not seen 
for nearly six years.

02:22:49.141 --> 02:22:51.383
taken place; but a thousand 
little circumstances might have 

02:22:51.384 --> 02:22:55.506
by degrees worked other 
alterations, which, although 

02:22:55.507 --> 02:22:58.146
they were done more tranquilly, 
might not be the less decisive.

02:23:05.072 --> 02:23:07.072
dreading a thousand nameless 
evils that 

02:23:09.777 --> 02:23:11.777
made me tremble, although I was 
unable to define them.

02:23:21.333 --> 02:23:23.333
were placid; all around was 
calm; and 

02:23:24.799 --> 02:23:28.732
the snowy mountains, “the 
palaces of nature,” were not 

02:23:24.799 --> 02:23:26.024
changed.restored me, and I 
continued my journey towards 

02:23:26.025 --> 02:23:28.025
Geneva.

02:23:31.754 --> 02:23:33.754
which became narrower as I 
approached my native town.

02:23:38.757 --> 02:23:40.757
sides of Jura, and the bright 
summit of Mont Blanc.

02:23:55.558 --> 02:23:57.187
I fear, my friend, that I shall 
render myself tedious by 

02:23:57.188 --> 02:23:59.188
dwelling on these 

02:24:00.205 --> 02:24:04.166
preliminary circumstances; but 
they were days of comparative 

02:24:04.167 --> 02:24:06.230
happiness, and I think of them 
with pleasure.

02:24:13.174 --> 02:24:15.174
took in again beholding thy 
streams, thy 

02:24:17.933 --> 02:24:19.933
mountains, and, more than all, 
thy lovely lake!

02:24:23.064 --> 02:24:25.064
fear again overcame me.

02:24:28.390 --> 02:24:30.019
could hardly see the dark 
mountains, I felt still more 

02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:32.020
gloomily.

02:24:37.557 --> 02:24:38.805
scene of evil, and I foresaw 
obscurely that I was destined to

02:24:38.806 --> 02:24:40.806
become 

02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:48.766
one single circumstance, that in
all the misery I imagined and 

02:24:48.767 --> 02:24:50.767
dreaded, I did not 

02:24:52.908 --> 02:24:54.982
conceive the hundredth part of 
the anguish I was destined to 

02:24:54.983 --> 02:24:56.983
endure.

02:25:00.732 --> 02:25:02.732
in the environs of Geneva; the 
gates of 

02:25:05.019 --> 02:25:06.855
the town were already shut; and 
I was obliged to pass the night 

02:25:06.856 --> 02:25:11.219
at Secheron, a village at the 
distance of half a league from 

02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:13.220
the city.

02:25:16.953 --> 02:25:19.841
unable to rest, I resolved to 
visit the spot where my poor 

02:25:19.842 --> 02:25:21.842
William had been murdered.

02:25:25.366 --> 02:25:27.404
was obliged to cross the lake in
a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.

02:25:33.361 --> 02:25:35.393
lightning playing on the summit 
of Mont Blanc in the most 

02:25:35.394 --> 02:25:37.394
beautiful figures.

02:25:41.527 --> 02:25:43.114
and, on landing, I ascended a 
low hill, that I might observe 

02:25:43.115 --> 02:25:46.637
its progress.and I soon felt the
rain coming slowly in large 

02:25:46.638 --> 02:25:48.638
drops, but its violence quickly 
increased.

02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:53.563
although the darkness and storm 
increased every minute, and the 

02:25:53.564 --> 02:25:55.564
thunder burst with a terrific 
crash over my head.

02:25:59.144 --> 02:26:01.592
and the Alps of Savoy; vivid 
flashes of lightning dazzled my 

02:26:01.593 --> 02:26:03.593
eyes, illuminating the lake, 
making it appear like a vast 

02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:05.408
sheet of fire; then for an 
instant every thing seemed of a 

02:26:05.409 --> 02:26:07.409
pitchy darkness, until 

02:26:11.031 --> 02:26:11.828
The storm, as is often the case 
in Switzerland, appeared at once

02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:13.829
in various parts of the heavens.

02:26:17.838 --> 02:26:19.859
north of the town, over the part
of the lake which lies between 

02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:21.860
the promontory 

02:26:24.239 --> 02:26:26.239
of Belrive and the village of 
Copêt.

02:26:29.825 --> 02:26:32.071
faint flashes; and another 
darkened and sometimes disclosed

02:26:32.072 --> 02:26:34.099
the Môle, a peaked mountain to 
the east of the lake.

02:26:40.058 --> 02:26:42.058
beautiful yet terrific, I 
wandered on with a hasty step.

02:26:47.118 --> 02:26:49.563
spirits; I clasped my hands, and
exclaimed aloud, “William, dear 

02:26:49.564 --> 02:26:51.564
angel!

02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:58.221
dirge!” As I said these words, I
perceived in the gloom a figure 

02:26:58.222 --> 02:27:00.285
which stole from behind a clump 
of trees near me; I stood 

02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:07.320
fixed, gazing intently:  I could
not be mistaken.

02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:12.469
object, and discovered its shape
plainly 

02:27:15.837 --> 02:27:17.013
to me; its gigantic stature, and
the deformity of its aspect more

02:27:17.014 --> 02:27:19.014
hideous than belongs to 
humanity, instantly 

02:27:22.605 --> 02:27:25.510
informed me that it was the 
wretch, the filthy daemon, to 

02:27:25.511 --> 02:27:27.511
whom I had given life.

02:27:34.736 --> 02:27:36.782
imagination, than I became 
convinced of its truth; my teeth

02:27:36.783 --> 02:27:38.783
chattered, and I was 

02:27:39.794 --> 02:27:41.794
forced to lean against a tree 
for support.

02:27:55.849 --> 02:27:58.699
The mere presence of the idea 
was an irresistible proof of the

02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:00.700
fact.

02:28:04.919 --> 02:28:06.160
but it would have been in vain, 
for another flash discovered him

02:28:06.161 --> 02:28:08.161
to me 

02:28:09.167 --> 02:28:11.014
hanging among the rocks of the 
nearly perpendicular ascent of 

02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:13.127
Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds 
Plainpalais on the south.

02:28:25.154 --> 02:28:27.399
continued, and the scene was 
enveloped in an impenetrable 

02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.400
darkness.

02:28:32.715 --> 02:28:35.350
I had until now sought to 
forget:  The whole train of my 

02:28:35.351 --> 02:28:37.417
progress toward the creation; 
the appearance of the works of 

02:28:42.124 --> 02:28:44.124
my own hands at my bedside; its 
departure.

02:28:47.416 --> 02:28:49.057
the night on which he first 
received life; and was this his 

02:28:49.058 --> 02:28:51.058
first crime?

02:28:55.379 --> 02:28:57.035
depraved wretch, whose delight 
was in carnage and misery; had 

02:28:57.036 --> 02:28:59.535
he not murdered my brother?

02:29:04.879 --> 02:29:06.900
suffered during the remainder of
the night, which I spent, cold 

02:29:06.901 --> 02:29:08.901
and wet, in the open air.

02:29:12.884 --> 02:29:15.535
the weather; my imagination was 
busy in scenes of evil and 

02:29:15.536 --> 02:29:17.536
despair.

02:29:21.369 --> 02:29:24.032
had cast among mankind, and 
endowed with the will and power 

02:29:24.033 --> 02:29:26.033
to effect purposes of 

02:29:28.667 --> 02:29:30.667
horror, such as the deed which 
he had 

02:29:31.805 --> 02:29:33.459
now done, nearly in the light of
my own vampire, my own spirit 

02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:38.211
let loose from the grave, and 
forced to destroy all that was 

02:29:38.212 --> 02:29:40.212
dear to me.

02:29:51.556 --> 02:29:53.556
knew of the murderer, and cause 
instant 

02:29:56.295 --> 02:29:58.295
But I paused when I reflected on
the story that I had to tell.

02:30:02.542 --> 02:30:04.542
endued with life, had met me at 
midnight 

02:30:07.390 --> 02:30:09.390
among the precipices of an 
inaccessible mountain.

02:30:12.125 --> 02:30:14.790
with which I had been seized 
just at the time that I dated my

02:30:14.791 --> 02:30:16.791
creation, and which 

02:30:18.747 --> 02:30:19.353
would give an air of delirium to
a tale I well knew that if any 

02:30:19.354 --> 02:30:19.761
other had communicated such a 
relation to me, I should have 

02:30:19.762 --> 02:30:21.183
looked upon it as the ravings of
insanity.animal would elude all 

02:30:21.184 --> 02:30:21.791
pursuit, even if I were so far 
credited as to persuade my 

02:30:21.792 --> 02:30:23.792
relatives to commence it.

02:30:32.085 --> 02:30:34.085
scaling the overhanging sides of
Mont Salêve?

02:30:42.124 --> 02:30:44.124
entered my father's house.

02:30:46.241 --> 02:30:48.443
family, and went into the 
library to attend their usual 

02:30:48.444 --> 02:30:50.444
hour of rising.

02:30:54.826 --> 02:30:57.457
dream but for one indelible 
trace, and I stood in the same 

02:30:57.458 --> 02:30:59.458
place where I had last 

02:31:02.182 --> 02:31:04.182
embraced my father before my 
departure for Ingolstadt.

02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:12.830
which stood over the 
mantel-piece.

02:31:16.543 --> 02:31:18.582
at my father's desire, and 
represented Caroline Beaufort in

02:31:18.583 --> 02:31:20.583
an agony of 

02:31:23.290 --> 02:31:25.290
despair, kneeling by the coffin 
of her dead father.

02:31:28.653 --> 02:31:30.701
pale; but there was an air of 
dignity and beauty, that hardly 

02:31:30.702 --> 02:31:32.739
permitted the sentiment of pity.

02:31:37.066 --> 02:31:39.710
William; and my tears flowed 
when I looked upon it.

02:31:44.414 --> 02:31:46.414
entered:  He had heard me 
arrive, and 

02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:49.420
hastened to welcome 

02:31:52.199 --> 02:31:54.535
me:  “Welcome, my dearest 
Victor,” said he.

02:32:07.126 --> 02:32:09.353
ago, and then you would have 
found us all joyous and 

02:32:09.354 --> 02:32:11.354
delighted.

02:32:14.576 --> 02:32:16.576
which nothing can alleviate; yet
your 

02:32:18.746 --> 02:32:20.746
presence will, I hope, revive 
our father,

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:27.736
Grief on the death of mamma.

02:32:29.257 --> 02:32:31.257
Poor Elizabeth is also quite 
inconsolable.

02:32:32.324 --> 02:32:34.324
Do not, said I, welcome me thus.

02:32:35.413 --> 02:32:37.515
Try to be more calm that I may 
not be absolutely miserable the 

02:32:37.516 --> 02:32:39.516
moment I enter 

02:32:41.186 --> 02:32:43.186
my father's house after so long 
an absence.

02:32:44.649 --> 02:32:47.553
But tell me, how does my father 
support his misfortune? And how 

02:32:47.554 --> 02:32:50.548
is my poor Elizabeth? 

02:32:55.524 --> 02:32:57.524
She requires consolation.

02:32:58.544 --> 02:33:01.874
She accused herself of having 
caused the death. But since the 

02:33:01.875 --> 02:33:05.343
murderer had been discovered -- 
the murderer discovered? Good 

02:33:05.344 --> 02:33:07.344
God! How can that be?

02:33:11.666 --> 02:33:13.666
Who can attempt to pursue him? 
It is impossible.

02:33:21.449 --> 02:33:21.857
One might as well try to 
overtake the winds, or confine a

02:33:21.858 --> 02:33:23.084
mountain-stream with a straw.“I 
do not know what you mean,” 

02:33:23.085 --> 02:33:23.682
replied my brother, in accents 
of wonder, “but to us the 

02:33:23.683 --> 02:33:25.106
discovery we have made completes
our misery.even now Elizabeth 

02:33:25.107 --> 02:33:26.553
will not be convinced, 
notwithstanding all the 

02:33:26.554 --> 02:33:28.554
evidence.

02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:33.542
Justine Moritz, who was so 
amiable, and fond of all the 

02:33:33.543 --> 02:33:34.556
family, could suddenly become so
capable of so frightful, so 

02:33:34.557 --> 02:33:37.554
appalling a crime?”

02:33:49.081 --> 02:33:51.081
that; no one believes it, 
surely, Ernest?

02:33:52.081 --> 02:33:54.081
”

02:34:00.884 --> 02:34:01.531
circumstances came out, that 
have almost forced conviction 

02:34:01.532 --> 02:34:03.532
upon 

02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:06.550
us; and her own 

02:34:08.934 --> 02:34:09.136
behaviour has been so confused, 
as to add to the evidence of 

02:34:09.137 --> 02:34:11.137
facts a weight that, I fear, 
leaves no hope for doubt.

02:34:13.969 --> 02:34:18.442
”which the murder of poor 
William had been discovered, 

02:34:18.443 --> 02:34:20.485
Justine had been taken ill, and 
confined to her bed for several 

02:34:20.486 --> 02:34:22.486
days.

02:34:26.193 --> 02:34:28.651
servants, happening to examine 
the apparel she had worn on the 

02:34:28.652 --> 02:34:30.652
night of the 

02:34:31.672 --> 02:34:33.672
murder, had 

02:34:40.287 --> 02:34:42.287
discovered in her pocket the 

02:34:43.634 --> 02:34:45.634
picture of my mother, which had 
been 

02:34:46.646 --> 02:34:48.646
judged to be the temptation of 
the murderer.

02:34:53.467 --> 02:34:56.462
of the others, who, without 
saying a word to any of 

02:35:00.417 --> 02:35:01.442
the family, went to a 
magistrate; and, upon their 

02:35:01.443 --> 02:35:02.879
deposition, Justine was 
apprehended.poor girl confirmed 

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:03.291
the suspicion in a great measure
by her extreme confusion of 

02:35:03.292 --> 02:35:05.292
manner.shake my faith; and I 
replied earnestly, 

02:35:07.715 --> 02:35:09.715
“You are all mistaken; I know 
the murderer.

02:35:16.975 --> 02:35:18.975
At that instant my father 
entered.

02:35:22.303 --> 02:35:24.782
his countenance, but he 
endeavoured to welcome me 

02:35:24.783 --> 02:35:26.783
cheerfully; and, after we had 

02:35:30.162 --> 02:35:32.829
exchanged our mournful greeting,
would have introduced some other

02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:35.492
topic than that of our disaster,
had not Ernest 

02:35:38.501 --> 02:35:40.501
exclaimed, “Good God, papa!

02:35:43.936 --> 02:35:46.541
murderer of poor William.“We do 
also, unfortunately,” replied my

02:35:49.533 --> 02:35:54.834
father, “for indeed I had rather
have been for ever ignorant than

02:35:54.835 --> 02:35:57.107
have discovered so much 
depravity and ungratitude in one

02:35:57.108 --> 02:35:59.108
I valued so highly.

02:36:01.929 --> 02:36:03.929
“My dear father, you are 
mistaken; Justine is innocent.

02:36:07.238 --> 02:36:09.238
“If she is, God forbid that she 
should suffer as guilty.

02:36:14.638 --> 02:36:16.638
sincerely hope, that she will be
acquitted.

02:36:23.294 --> 02:36:26.211
that Justine, and indeed every 
human being, was guiltless of 

02:36:26.212 --> 02:36:28.212
this murder.

02:36:31.945 --> 02:36:34.584
circumstantial evidence could be
brought forward strong enough to

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:36.585
convict her.

02:36:41.553 --> 02:36:44.241
publicly; its astounding horror 
would be looked upon as madness 

02:36:44.242 --> 02:36:46.242
by the vulgar.

02:36:50.617 --> 02:36:52.617
creator, who would believe, 
unless his 

02:36:55.214 --> 02:36:57.446
senses convinced him, in the 
existence of the living monument

02:36:57.447 --> 02:37:00.105
of presumption and rash 
ignorance which I had let loose 

02:37:02.772 --> 02:37:04.772
upon the world?

02:37:10.553 --> 02:37:13.204
beheld her; it had endowed her 
with loveliness surpassing the 

02:37:13.205 --> 02:37:15.463
beauty of her childish years.

02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:23.764
vivacity, but it was allied to 
an expression more full of 

02:37:23.765 --> 02:37:25.765
sensibility and intellect.

02:37:42.376 --> 02:37:44.376
justify my poor guiltless 
Justine.

02:37:56.568 --> 02:37:58.799
have not only lost that lovely 
darling boy, but this poor girl,

02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:03.470
whom I sincerely love, is to be 
torn away by even a worse fate.

02:38:14.166 --> 02:38:16.806
not; and then I shall be happy 
again, even after the sad death 

02:38:16.807 --> 02:38:18.807
of my little William.

02:38:21.573 --> 02:38:23.620
“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,”
said I, “and that shall be 

02:38:23.621 --> 02:38:25.621
proved; fear nothing, 

02:38:29.288 --> 02:38:31.287
but let your spirits be cheered 
by the assurance of her 

02:38:31.288 --> 02:38:33.288
acquittal.

02:38:38.985 --> 02:38:41.635
and that made me wretched, for I
knew that it was impossible:  

02:38:41.636 --> 02:38:43.636
And to see 

02:38:46.946 --> 02:38:49.842
every one else prejudiced in so 
deadly a manner rendered me 

02:38:49.843 --> 02:38:51.843
hopeless and despairing.” She 
wept.

02:39:00.662 --> 02:39:02.662
rely on the justice of our laws,
and the 

02:39:05.374 --> 02:39:09.374
activity with which I shall 
prevent the slightest shadow of 

02:39:05.374 --> 02:39:07.374
partiality.

02:39:16.496 --> 02:39:17.107
We passed a few sad hours until 
eleven o'clock, when the trial 

02:39:17.108 --> 02:39:19.108
was to commence.being obliged to
attend as witnesses, I 

02:39:19.155 --> 02:39:20.777
accompanied them to the court.
mockery of justice I suffered 

02:39:20.778 --> 02:39:22.778
living torture.

02:39:33.505 --> 02:39:36.150
of my curiosity and lawless 
devices would cause the death of

02:39:36.151 --> 02:39:38.151
two of my 

02:39:41.242 --> 02:39:43.995
fellow beings:  One a smiling 
babe full of innocence and joy, 

02:39:43.996 --> 02:39:49.328
the other far more dreadfully 
murdered, with every aggravation

02:39:49.329 --> 02:39:51.366
of infamy that could make the 
murder memorable in horror.

02:39:58.367 --> 02:40:00.393
possessed qualities which 
promised to render her life 

02:40:00.394 --> 02:40:02.394
happy; now all was to be 

02:40:05.665 --> 02:40:07.665
obliterated in an ignominious 
grave, and I the cause!

02:40:12.913 --> 02:40:14.913
confessed myself guilty of 

02:40:22.109 --> 02:40:24.814
the crime ascribed to Justine, 
but I was absent when it was 

02:40:24.815 --> 02:40:26.815
committed, and such a 

02:40:28.901 --> 02:40:31.539
declaration would have been 
considered as the ravings of a 

02:40:31.540 --> 02:40:33.540
madman and would not 

02:40:37.328 --> 02:40:39.328
have exculpated her who suffered
through me.

02:40:45.892 --> 02:40:48.540
countenance, always engaging, 
was rendered, by the solemnity 

02:40:48.541 --> 02:40:50.541
of her 

02:40:52.864 --> 02:40:54.864
feelings, exquisitely beautiful.

02:40:58.879 --> 02:41:01.811
and did not tremble, although 
gazed on and execrated by 

02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:06.460
thousands, for all the kindness 
which 

02:41:07.481 --> 02:41:09.622
her beauty might otherwise have 
excited was obliterated 

02:41:12.635 --> 02:41:14.635
in the minds of the 

02:41:15.894 --> 02:41:18.668
spectators by the imagination of
the enormity she was supposed to

02:41:18.669 --> 02:41:20.669
have committed.

02:41:27.072 --> 02:41:29.710
was evidently constrained; and 
as her confusion had before been

02:41:29.711 --> 02:41:35.064
adduced as a proof of her guilt,
she worked up her mind to an 

02:41:35.065 --> 02:41:37.065
appearance of courage.

02:41:42.430 --> 02:41:45.355
her eyes round it and quickly 
discovered where we were seated.

02:41:51.355 --> 02:41:54.040
saw us, but she quickly 
recovered herself, and a look of

02:41:57.050 --> 02:41:59.050
sorrowful affection seemed to 
attest her utter guiltlessness.

02:42:06.147 --> 02:42:08.147
against her had stated 

02:42:09.461 --> 02:42:11.461
the charge, several witnesses 
were called.

02:42:16.251 --> 02:42:18.910
against her, which might have 
staggered anyone who had not 

02:42:18.911 --> 02:42:20.911
such proof of her 

02:42:21.915 --> 02:42:23.915
innocence as I had.

02:42:28.432 --> 02:42:30.432
on which the murder 

02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:34.301
had been committed and towards 
morning had been perceived by a 

02:42:34.302 --> 02:42:36.302
market-woman not 

02:42:37.317 --> 02:42:42.350
far from the spot where the body
of the murdered child had been 

02:42:42.351 --> 02:42:44.351
afterwards found.

02:42:49.082 --> 02:42:51.799
there, but she looked very 
strangely and only returned a 

02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:54.493
confused and unintelligible 
answer.

02:43:00.248 --> 02:43:03.242
eight o'clock, and when one 
inquired where she had passed 

02:43:06.390 --> 02:43:09.318
the night, she replied that she 
had been looking for the child 

02:43:09.319 --> 02:43:13.922
and demanded earnestly if 
anything had been heard 

02:43:13.923 --> 02:43:15.923
concerning him.

02:43:21.254 --> 02:43:23.254
violent hysterics and kept her 
bed for several days.

02:43:29.766 --> 02:43:31.766
servant had found in 

02:43:33.002 --> 02:43:35.844
her pocket; and when Elizabeth, 
in a faltering voice, proved 

02:43:35.845 --> 02:43:40.961
that it was the same which, an 
hour before the child had been 

02:43:40.962 --> 02:43:42.962
missed, she had placed round 

02:43:43.972 --> 02:43:46.896
his neck, a murmur of horror and
indignation filled the court.

02:43:52.046 --> 02:43:54.046
defence.

02:43:55.734 --> 02:43:57.734
countenance had altered.

02:44:08.825 --> 02:44:11.161
tears, but when she was desired 
to plead, she collected her 

02:44:11.162 --> 02:44:13.162
powers and 

02:44:14.167 --> 02:44:16.167
spoke in an audible although 
variable voice.

02:44:26.257 --> 02:44:29.156
protestations should acquit me; 
I rest my innocence on a plain 

02:44:29.157 --> 02:44:31.157
and 

02:44:32.167 --> 02:44:34.167
simple explanation of the 

02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:37.585
facts which have been adduced 
against me, and I hope the 

02:44:37.586 --> 02:44:39.586
character I 

02:44:40.592 --> 02:44:43.357
have always borne will incline 
my judges to a favourable 

02:44:46.005 --> 02:44:48.670
interpretation where any 
circumstance appears doubtful or

02:44:48.671 --> 02:44:50.671
suspicious.

02:44:53.735 --> 02:44:55.735
She then related that, by the 

02:44:57.073 --> 02:44:59.828
permission of Elizabeth, she had
passed the evening of the night 

02:44:59.829 --> 02:45:05.505
on which the murder had been 
committed at the house of an 

02:45:07.299 --> 02:45:09.299
aunt at Chêne, a village 
situated at 

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:12.978
about a league from On her 
return, at about nine o'clock, 

02:45:15.973 --> 02:45:17.973
she met a man who asked

02:45:19.335 --> 02:45:21.335
her if she had seen anything of 
the child who was lost.

02:45:26.121 --> 02:45:28.121
and passed several hours in 
looking for 

02:45:29.124 --> 02:45:31.124
him, when the gates 

02:45:32.371 --> 02:45:35.172
of Geneva were shut, and she was
forced to remain several hours 

02:45:35.173 --> 02:45:38.170
of the night in a barn belonging

02:45:41.473 --> 02:45:44.290
to a cottage, being unwilling to
call up the inhabitants, to whom

02:45:44.291 --> 02:45:46.291
she was well known.

02:45:51.982 --> 02:45:53.982
watching; towards morning she 

02:45:55.227 --> 02:45:57.503
believed that she slept for a 
few minutes; some steps 

02:45:57.504 --> 02:45:59.504
disturbed her, and she awoke.

02:46:05.285 --> 02:46:07.285
asylum, that she might again 
endeavour to find my brother.

02:46:13.248 --> 02:46:15.248
body lay, it was without her 
knowledge.

02:46:19.487 --> 02:46:22.382
when questioned by the 
market-woman was not surprising,

02:46:22.383 --> 02:46:27.534
since she had passed a sleepless
night and the fate of poor 

02:46:27.535 --> 02:46:29.535
William was yet uncertain.

02:46:40.317 --> 02:46:43.008
“how heavily and fatally this 
one circumstance weighs against 

02:46:43.009 --> 02:46:45.652
me, but I have no power of 
explaining it; and when 

02:46:50.418 --> 02:46:53.052
I have expressed my utter 
ignorance, I am only left to 

02:46:53.053 --> 02:46:55.053
conjecture concerning 

02:46:58.105 --> 02:46:58.209
the probabilities by which it 
might have been placed in my 

02:46:58.210 --> 02:47:00.210
pocket.

02:47:09.617 --> 02:47:11.910
on earth, and none surely would 
have been so wicked as to 

02:47:11.911 --> 02:47:13.911
destroy me wantonly.

02:47:22.406 --> 02:47:24.606
for so doing; or, if I had, why 
should he have stolen the 

02:47:27.619 --> 02:47:29.619
jewel, to part with it again so 
soon?

02:47:32.418 --> 02:47:36.151
witnesses examined concerning my
character, and if their 

02:47:32.418 --> 02:47:34.418
testimony shall not overweigh my
supposed guilt, I must 

02:47:36.331 --> 02:47:39.215
Several witnesses were called 
who had known her for many 

02:47:39.216 --> 02:47:41.866
years, and they spoke well of 
her; but fear and 

02:47:44.874 --> 02:47:46.874
hatred of the 

02:47:47.972 --> 02:47:50.813
crime of which they supposed her
guilty rendered them timorous 

02:47:50.814 --> 02:47:52.814
and unwilling to come forward.

02:47:58.176 --> 02:48:00.809
her excellent dispositions and 
irreproachable conduct, about to

02:48:00.810 --> 02:48:02.810
fail 

02:48:05.535 --> 02:48:07.535
the accused, when, although 
violently 

02:48:08.626 --> 02:48:10.626
agitated, she desired permission
to address the court.

02:48:16.828 --> 02:48:18.892
unhappy child who was murdered, 
or rather his sister, for I was 

02:48:18.893 --> 02:48:20.893
educated by 

02:48:21.908 --> 02:48:26.665
and have lived with his parents 
ever since and even long before 

02:48:26.666 --> 02:48:28.666
his birth.

02:48:32.596 --> 02:48:34.596
me to come forward on this 
occasion, but 

02:48:37.293 --> 02:48:39.293
when I see a fellow creature 
about to 

02:48:40.321 --> 02:48:43.095
perish through the cowardice of 
her pretended friends, I wish to

02:48:43.096 --> 02:48:47.993
be allowed to speak, that I may 
say what I know of her 

02:48:47.994 --> 02:48:49.994
character.

02:48:57.161 --> 02:48:59.161
her, at one time for five 

02:49:00.390 --> 02:49:02.390
and at another for nearly two 
years.

02:49:05.656 --> 02:49:07.987
me the most amiable and 
benevolent of human creatures.

02:49:14.266 --> 02:49:17.066
aunt, in her last illness, with 
the greatest affection and care 

02:49:17.067 --> 02:49:19.544
and afterwards attended her own 
mother 

02:49:23.493 --> 02:49:25.493
during a tedious illness, in a 
manner 

02:49:26.993 --> 02:49:29.640
that excited the admiration of 
all who knew her, after which 

02:49:29.641 --> 02:49:35.402
she again lived in my uncle's 
house, where she was beloved by 

02:49:35.403 --> 02:49:37.403
all the family.

02:49:41.691 --> 02:49:43.691
who is now dead and acted 

02:49:45.753 --> 02:49:47.753
towards him like a most 
affectionate mother.

02:49:49.767 --> 02:49:52.439
say that, notwithstanding all 
the evidence produced against 

02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:54.440
her, I believe 

02:49:57.729 --> 02:49:59.729
and rely on her perfect 
innocence.

02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:06.609
action; as to the bauble on 
which the chief proof rests, if 

02:50:06.610 --> 02:50:11.922
she had earnestly desired it, I 
should have willingly given it 

02:50:11.923 --> 02:50:13.923
to her, so much do I 

02:50:14.927 --> 02:50:16.927
esteem and value her.

02:50:19.507 --> 02:50:20.940
A murmur of approbation followed
Elizabeth's simple and powerful 

02:50:20.941 --> 02:50:22.941
appeal, 

02:50:23.963 --> 02:50:26.871
but it was excited by her 
generous interference, and not 

02:50:26.872 --> 02:50:28.872
in 

02:50:29.894 --> 02:50:31.894
favour of poor Justine, 

02:50:33.706 --> 02:50:34.725
on whom the public indignation 
was turned with renewed 

02:50:34.726 --> 02:50:37.371
violence, charging her with the 
blackest ingratitude.

02:50:42.075 --> 02:50:44.075
spoke, but she did not answer.

02:50:59.393 --> 02:51:02.289
brother also in his hellish 
sport have betrayed the innocent

02:51:02.290 --> 02:51:04.290
to death and ignominy?

02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:11.709
situation, and when I perceived 
that the popular voice and the 

02:51:11.710 --> 02:51:13.710
countenances of 

02:51:16.981 --> 02:51:19.714
the judges had already condemned
my unhappy victim, I rushed out 

02:51:19.715 --> 02:51:21.715
of the court in agony.

02:51:26.629 --> 02:51:31.915
equal mine; she was sustained by
innocence, but the fangs of 

02:51:31.916 --> 02:51:33.916
remorse tore my bosom and would 
not forgo their hold.

02:51:43.938 --> 02:51:45.938
lips and throat were parched.

02:51:49.246 --> 02:51:51.246
I was known, and the officer 
guessed the 

02:51:52.268 --> 02:51:54.268
cause of my visit.

02:51:57.735 --> 02:51:59.735
all black, and Justine was 
condemned.

02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:10.546
horror, and I have endeavoured 
to bestow upon them adequate 

02:52:10.547 --> 02:52:12.547
expressions, but 

02:52:15.262 --> 02:52:17.262
words cannot convey an idea of 
the 

02:52:18.267 --> 02:52:20.267
heart-sickening despair that I 
then endured.

02:52:25.006 --> 02:52:27.006
added that Justine had already 
confessed her guilt.

02:52:32.198 --> 02:52:34.852
hardly required in so glaring a 
case, but I am glad of it, and, 

02:52:34.853 --> 02:52:36.853
indeed, none 

02:52:39.617 --> 02:52:41.654
of our judges like to condemn a 
criminal upon circumstantial 

02:52:41.655 --> 02:52:43.692
evidence, be it ever so 
decisive.

02:52:47.313 --> 02:52:50.046
This was strange and unexpected 
intelligence; what could it 

02:52:50.047 --> 02:52:52.047
mean?

02:52:57.585 --> 02:53:00.780
world would believe me to be if 
I disclosed the object of my 

02:53:00.781 --> 02:53:02.781
suspicions?

02:53:07.460 --> 02:53:09.460
Elizabeth eagerly demanded the 
result.

02:53:12.786 --> 02:53:18.764
as you may have expected; all 
judges had rather that ten 

02:53:18.765 --> 02:53:20.784
innocent should suffer than that
one guilty should escape.

02:53:25.536 --> 02:53:28.178
This was a dire blow to poor 
Elizabeth, who had relied with 

02:53:28.179 --> 02:53:30.465
firmness upon Justine's 
innocence.

02:53:35.034 --> 02:53:37.034
in human goodness?

02:53:41.461 --> 02:53:44.393
my sister, how could she put on 
those smiles of innocence only 

02:53:44.394 --> 02:53:46.394
to betray?

02:53:51.554 --> 02:53:51.958
severity or guile, and yet she 
has committed a murder.Soon 

02:53:51.959 --> 02:53:52.160
after we heard that the poor 
victim had expressed a desire to

02:53:52.161 --> 02:53:52.980
see my cousin.that he left it to
her own judgment and feelings to

02:53:52.981 --> 02:53:54.985
decide.” The idea of this visit 
was torture to We entered the 

02:53:54.986 --> 02:53:55.188
gloomy prison chamber and beheld
Justine sitting on some straw at

02:53:55.189 --> 02:53:55.381
the farther end; her hands were 
manacled, and her head rested on

02:53:55.382 --> 02:53:57.382
her knees.

02:54:00.745 --> 02:54:01.637
when we were left alone with 
her, she threw herself at the 

02:54:01.638 --> 02:54:03.638
feet of Elizabeth, weeping 
bitterly.

02:54:15.494 --> 02:54:18.438
although I was then very 
wretched, I was not so miserable

02:54:18.439 --> 02:54:20.439
as I am now.

02:54:22.262 --> 02:54:24.262
“And do you also believe that I 
am so very, very wicked?

02:54:29.773 --> 02:54:32.427
crush me, to condemn me as a 
murderer?” Her voice was 

02:54:32.428 --> 02:54:34.428
suffocated with sobs.

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:40.768
“why do you kneel, if you are 
innocent?

02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:47.751
believed you guiltless, 
notwithstanding every evidence, 

02:54:47.752 --> 02:54:50.400
until I heard that you had 
yourself declared your guilt.

02:54:58.105 --> 02:55:00.408
assured, dear Justine, that 
nothing can shake my confidence 

02:55:00.409 --> 02:55:03.091
in you for a moment, but your 
own confession.

02:55:11.499 --> 02:55:13.764
I confessed, that I might obtain
absolution; but now that 

02:55:13.765 --> 02:55:16.217
falsehood lies heavier at my 
heart than all my other sins.

02:55:26.255 --> 02:55:28.255
confessor has besieged me; he 

02:55:31.113 --> 02:55:32.265
threatened and menaced, until I 
almost began to think that I was

02:55:32.266 --> 02:55:34.266
the monster that he said I was.

02:55:40.005 --> 02:55:42.005
fire in my last moments if I 
continued obdurate.

02:55:47.967 --> 02:55:49.617
all looked on me as a wretch 
doomed to ignominy and 

02:55:49.618 --> 02:55:51.618
perdition.

02:55:57.086 --> 02:55:59.086
and now only am I truly 
miserable.

02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:02.809
She paused, weeping, and then 
continued, “I thought with 

02:56:02.810 --> 02:56:04.810
horror, my 

02:56:05.974 --> 02:56:07.974
sweet lady, that you should 
believe your Justine, whom your 

02:56:10.626 --> 02:56:13.439
blessed aunt had so highly 
honoured, and whom you loved, 

02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:15.786
was a creature capable of a 
crime which none but the devil 

02:56:15.787 --> 02:56:17.763
himself could have perpetrated.
where we shall all be happy; and

02:56:17.764 --> 02:56:19.764
that consoles me, going as I am 
to suffer ignominy and death.

02:56:23.342 --> 02:56:25.342
moment distrusted you.

02:56:32.738 --> 02:56:34.738
your innocence.

02:56:36.604 --> 02:56:38.604
enemies by my tears and prayers.

02:56:40.262 --> 02:56:42.262
Justine shook her head 
mournfully.

02:56:56.474 --> 02:56:59.142
you remember me and think of me 
as of one unjustly condemned, I 

02:56:59.143 --> 02:57:01.815
am resigned to the fate awaiting
me.

02:57:08.771 --> 02:57:10.771
submit in patience to the will 
of heaven!

02:57:11.776 --> 02:57:13.776
”

02:58:02.350 --> 02:58:04.350
to the corner of the prison room
where I 

02:58:06.022 --> 02:58:08.454
could conceal the anguish that 
possessed me. Despair? Who dare 

02:58:08.455 --> 02:58:10.455
talk of that?

02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:17.235
The poor victim who on thehe 
morrow was to die felt not as I 

02:58:17.236 --> 02:58:19.904
did. I gnashed my teeth and 
ground them 

02:58:23.344 --> 02:58:26.125
together, uttering a groan that 
came from my inmost soul. 

02:58:26.126 --> 02:58:28.126
Justine started.

02:58:30.871 --> 02:58:32.123
She approached me and said, 
"Dear sir, you are very kind of 

02:58:32.124 --> 02:58:34.124
visit me.

02:58:35.179 --> 02:58:39.099
You do not believe they am 
guilty?" I could not answer. "No

02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:41.100
Justine.

02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:46.447
He is more convinced of your 
innocence than I was." I truly 

02:58:46.448 --> 02:58:48.448
thank him.

02:58:50.670 --> 02:58:52.292
In these last moments, I feel 
the sincerest gratitude towards 

02:58:52.293 --> 02:58:54.293
those who think of me with 
kindness.

02:59:06.198 --> 02:59:06.808
misfortune, and I feel as if I 
could die in peace now that my 

02:59:06.809 --> 02:59:08.809
innocence is acknowledged by 
you, dear lady, and your cousin.

02:59:08.844 --> 02:59:10.844
Thus the poor sufferer tried to 
comfort others and herself.

02:59:16.234 --> 02:59:16.840
never-dying worm alive in my 
bosom, which allowed of no hope 

02:59:16.841 --> 02:59:18.841
or consolation.

02:59:23.943 --> 02:59:25.170
but hers also was the misery of 
innocence, which, like a cloud 

02:59:25.171 --> 02:59:30.126
that passes over the fair moon, 
for a while hides but cannot 

02:59:30.127 --> 02:59:32.127
tarnish its brightness.

02:59:36.543 --> 02:59:38.055
the core of my heart; I bore a 
hell within me which nothing 

02:59:38.056 --> 02:59:40.056
could extinguish.

02:59:41.157 --> 02:59:41.763
and it was with great difficulty
that Elizabeth could tear 

02:59:41.764 --> 02:59:43.764
herself away.

03:00:14.324 --> 03:00:15.495
die with you; I cannot live in 
this world of misery.Justine 

03:00:15.496 --> 03:00:17.347
assumed an air of cheerfulness, 
She embraced Elizabeth and said 

03:00:17.348 --> 03:00:18.546
in a voice of half-suppressed 
emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, 

03:00:18.547 --> 03:00:20.131
dearest Elizabeth, my beloved 
and only friend; may heaven, in 

03:00:20.132 --> 03:00:22.132
its bounty, bless and preserve 
you; may this be the last 

03:00:24.071 --> 03:00:25.096
failed to move the judges from 
their settled conviction in the 

03:00:25.097 --> 03:00:27.619
criminality of the saintly 
sufferer.and heard the harsh, 

03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:29.620
unfeeling reasoning 

03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:33.524
of these men, my purposed avowal
died away on my lips.

03:00:40.961 --> 03:00:42.961
but not revoke the sentence 
passed upon my wretched victim.

03:00:55.128 --> 03:00:56.101
heart, I turned to contemplate 
the deep and voiceless grief of 

03:00:56.102 --> 03:00:58.102
my Elizabeth.

03:01:11.161 --> 03:01:12.127
mind than, after the feelings 
have been worked up by a quick 

03:01:12.128 --> 03:01:15.384
succession of events, the dead 
calmness of inaction and 

03:01:15.385 --> 03:01:16.398
certainty which follows and 
deprives the soul both of hope 

03:01:16.399 --> 03:01:18.399
and fear.

03:01:28.507 --> 03:01:30.507
but a weight of despair and 
remorse 

03:01:31.516 --> 03:01:33.516
pressed on my heart which 
nothing could remove.

03:01:39.689 --> 03:01:41.689
like an evil spirit, for I had 
committed 

03:01:43.384 --> 03:01:45.384
deeds of mischief beyond 
description 

03:01:46.409 --> 03:01:48.409
horrible, and more, much more 
was yet behind.

03:02:00.311 --> 03:02:03.310
intentions and thirsted for the 
moment when I should put them in

03:02:08.136 --> 03:02:10.136
practice and make myself useful 
to my fellow beings.

03:02:15.044 --> 03:02:17.044
serenity of conscience which 
allowed me 

03:02:20.541 --> 03:02:22.510
to look back upon the past with 
self-satisfaction, and from 

03:02:22.511 --> 03:02:27.784
thence to gather promise of new 
hopes, I was seized by remorse 

03:02:27.785 --> 03:02:29.785
and the sense of 

03:02:30.816 --> 03:02:35.753
guilt, which hurried me away to 
a hell of intense tortures such 

03:02:35.754 --> 03:02:37.754
as no language can describe.

03:02:42.538 --> 03:02:44.538
health, which had perhaps never 
entirely 

03:02:47.067 --> 03:02:49.067
recovered from the first shock 
it had sustained.

03:02:54.599 --> 03:02:56.289
joy or complacency was torture 
to me; solitude was my only 

03:02:56.290 --> 03:02:58.529
consolation—deep, dark, 
deathlike solitude.

03:03:06.487 --> 03:03:07.909
alteration perceptible in my 
disposition and habits and 

03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:09.910
endeavoured by arguments 

03:03:13.567 --> 03:03:16.499
deduced from the feelings of his
serene conscience and guiltless 

03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:18.656
life to inspire me with 
fortitude and awaken in me the 

03:03:18.657 --> 03:03:20.698
courage to dispel the dark cloud
which brooded over me.loved your

03:03:20.699 --> 03:03:21.116
brother”—tears came into his 
eyes as he spoke—“but is it not 

03:03:21.117 --> 03:03:21.942
a duty to the survivors that we 
should refrain from augmenting 

03:03:21.943 --> 03:03:23.943
their unhappiness by an 
appearance of immoderate grief?

03:03:29.012 --> 03:03:31.012
excessive sorrow prevents 
improvement or 

03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:35.750
enjoyment, or even the discharge
of 

03:03:36.765 --> 03:03:38.765
daily usefulness, without which 
no man is fit for society.

03:03:41.655 --> 03:03:44.329
This advice, although good, was 
totally inapplicable to my case;

03:03:44.330 --> 03:03:47.014
I should have been the first to 
hide my grief and 

03:03:51.915 --> 03:03:53.915
console my friends if remorse 
had not 

03:03:55.419 --> 03:03:56.656
mingled its bitterness, and 
terror its alarm, with my other 

03:03:56.657 --> 03:03:58.657
sensations.

03:04:01.818 --> 03:04:03.873
a look of despair and endeavour 
to hide myself from his view.

03:04:08.613 --> 03:04:10.613
our house at Belrive.

03:04:17.789 --> 03:04:20.308
ten o'clock and the 
impossibility of remaining on 

03:04:20.309 --> 03:04:22.309
the lake after that hour 

03:04:25.558 --> 03:04:28.335
had rendered our residence 
within the walls of Geneva very 

03:04:28.336 --> 03:04:30.336
irksome to me.

03:04:34.050 --> 03:04:36.050
retired for the night, I took 
the boat 

03:04:38.342 --> 03:04:40.342
and passed many hours upon the 
water.

03:04:44.130 --> 03:04:46.782
was carried by the wind; and 
sometimes, after rowing into the

03:04:46.783 --> 03:04:49.444
middle of the lake, I left the 
boat to pursue its own 

03:04:54.786 --> 03:04:56.786
course and gave way to my own 
miserable reflections.

03:05:01.535 --> 03:05:03.790
peace around me, and I the only 
unquiet thing that wandered 

03:05:03.791 --> 03:05:05.791
restless in a scene 

03:05:08.494 --> 03:05:11.142
so beautiful and heavenly—if I 
except some bat, or the frogs, 

03:05:11.143 --> 03:05:13.789
whose harsh and interrupted 
croaking was heard only when 

03:05:19.116 --> 03:05:21.298
I approached the shore—often, I 
say, I was tempted to plunge 

03:05:21.299 --> 03:05:26.427
into the silent lake, that the 
waters might close over me and 

03:05:26.428 --> 03:05:28.428
my calamities for ever.

03:05:32.796 --> 03:05:34.796
the heroic and suffering 
Elizabeth, whom 

03:05:37.087 --> 03:05:39.087
I tenderly loved, and whose 
existence was bound up in mine.

03:05:45.302 --> 03:05:47.634
surviving brother; should I by 
my base desertion leave them 

03:05:47.635 --> 03:05:52.973
exposed and unprotected to the 
malice of the fiend whom I had 

03:05:52.974 --> 03:05:56.020
let loose among them?wished that
peace would revisit my mind only

03:05:56.021 --> 03:05:58.021
that I might afford them 
consolation and happiness.

03:06:06.613 --> 03:06:08.613
evils, and I lived in daily fear
lest 

03:06:11.339 --> 03:06:15.205
the monster whom I had created 
should perpetrate some new 

03:06:11.339 --> 03:06:13.339
wickedness.

03:06:19.891 --> 03:06:21.949
not over and that he would still
commit some signal crime, which 

03:06:21.950 --> 03:06:23.950
by its enormity 

03:06:26.188 --> 03:06:28.188
should almost efface the 
recollection of the past.

03:06:33.622 --> 03:06:35.622
as anything I loved remained 
behind.

03:06:43.164 --> 03:06:45.840
teeth, my eyes became inflamed, 
and I ardently wished to 

03:06:45.841 --> 03:06:47.841
extinguish that life 

03:06:48.850 --> 03:06:50.850
which I had so thoughtlessly 
bestowed.

03:06:56.386 --> 03:06:58.444
malice, my hatred and revenge 
burst all bounds of moderation.

03:07:03.656 --> 03:07:05.656
highest peak of the Andes, could
I, when 

03:07:06.663 --> 03:07:08.663
there, have precipitated him to 
their base.

03:07:14.788 --> 03:07:17.497
wreak the utmost extent of 
abhorrence on his head and 

03:07:17.498 --> 03:07:20.096
avenge the deaths of William and
Justine.

03:07:28.527 --> 03:07:30.527
the horror of the recent events.

03:07:35.966 --> 03:07:37.966
no longer took delight in her 
ordinary 

03:07:38.969 --> 03:07:41.303
occupations; all pleasure seemed
to her sacrilege toward the 

03:07:41.304 --> 03:07:43.955
dead; eternal woe and tears she 
then thought 

03:07:48.251 --> 03:07:50.351
was the just tribute she should 
pay to innocence so blasted and 

03:07:50.352 --> 03:07:52.352
destroyed.

03:07:56.145 --> 03:07:58.796
who in earlier youth wandered 
with me on the banks of the lake

03:07:58.797 --> 03:08:01.289
and talked with ecstasy of our 
future prospects.

03:08:08.233 --> 03:08:10.233
sent to wean us from the earth 
had 

03:08:11.233 --> 03:08:14.020
visited her, and its dimming 
influence quenched her dearest 

03:08:14.021 --> 03:08:16.021
smiles.

03:08:21.426 --> 03:08:22.450
she, “on the miserable death of 
Justine Moritz, I no longer see 

03:08:22.451 --> 03:08:23.252
the world and its works as they 
before appeared to me.vice and 

03:08:23.253 --> 03:08:23.694
injustice that I read in books 
or heard from others as tales of

03:08:23.695 --> 03:08:26.150
ancient days or imaginary evils;
at least they 

03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:34.585
were remote and more familiar to
reason than to the imagination; 

03:08:34.586 --> 03:08:37.238
but now misery has come home, 
and men appear to me as monsters

03:08:39.885 --> 03:08:41.885
thirsting for each other's 
blood.

03:08:48.306 --> 03:08:50.306
guilty; and if she could have 
committed 

03:08:52.993 --> 03:08:55.700
the crime for which she 
suffered, assuredly she would 

03:08:55.701 --> 03:08:57.938
have been the most depraved of 
human creatures.

03:09:03.638 --> 03:09:06.297
have murdered the son of her 
benefactor and friend, a child 

03:09:06.298 --> 03:09:08.298
whom she had nursed 

03:09:10.976 --> 03:09:12.976
from its birth, and appeared to 
love as if it had been her own!

03:09:18.017 --> 03:09:20.017
human being, but certainly I 
should have 

03:09:23.187 --> 03:09:25.187
thought such a creature unfit to
remain in the society of men.

03:09:32.139 --> 03:09:34.139
are of the same opinion, and 
that confirms me.

03:09:38.602 --> 03:09:40.624
the truth, who can assure 
themselves of certain happiness?

03:09:46.579 --> 03:09:48.579
of a precipice, towards which 
thousands 

03:09:49.608 --> 03:09:52.396
are crowding and endeavouring to
plunge me into the abyss.

03:09:57.703 --> 03:09:59.703
and the murderer escapes; he 
walks about 

03:10:01.832 --> 03:10:03.832
the world free, and perhaps 
respected.

03:10:08.233 --> 03:10:10.872
suffer on the scaffold for the 
same crimes, I would not change 

03:10:10.873 --> 03:10:12.873
places with such a wretch.

03:10:15.038 --> 03:10:17.038
I listened to this discourse 
with the extremest agony.

03:10:20.369 --> 03:10:22.369
was the true murderer.

03:10:27.129 --> 03:10:29.421
countenance, and kindly taking 
my hand, said, “My dearest 

03:10:29.422 --> 03:10:31.422
friend, you must calm yourself.

03:10:37.536 --> 03:10:39.536
knows how deeply; but I am not 
so wretched as you are.

03:10:44.139 --> 03:10:46.184
sometimes of revenge, in your 
countenance that makes me 

03:10:46.185 --> 03:10:48.185
tremble.

03:10:56.837 --> 03:10:58.837
who centre all their hopes in 
you.

03:11:06.863 --> 03:11:09.550
each other, here in this land of
peace and beauty, your native 

03:11:09.551 --> 03:11:11.385
country, we may reap every 
tranquil blessing—what can 

03:11:11.386 --> 03:11:13.386
disturb our peace?

03:11:15.203 --> 03:11:17.835
And could not such words from Fe
her whom I fondly prized before 

03:11:17.836 --> 03:11:19.265
every other gift of fortune 
suffice to chase away the fiend 

03:11:19.266 --> 03:11:20.481
that lurked in my heart?as if in
terror, lest at that very moment

03:11:20.482 --> 03:11:21.496
the destroyer had been near to 
rob me of her.nor the beauty of 

03:11:21.497 --> 03:11:23.559
earth, nor of heaven, could 
redeem my soul from woe; the 

03:11:23.560 --> 03:11:25.560
very accents of love were 
ineffectual.

03:11:30.297 --> 03:11:32.297
beneficial influence could 
penetrate.

03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:36.628
limbs to some untrodden brake, 
there to gaze upon the arrow 

03:11:36.629 --> 03:11:38.629
which had pierced it, and to 
die, was but a type of me.

03:11:51.826 --> 03:11:53.826
But Elizabeth and Ernest never 
had.

03:11:54.903 --> 03:11:57.378
This place had been described to
them as so wonderful and 

03:11:57.379 --> 03:11:59.379
sublime.

03:12:01.872 --> 03:12:03.872
We departed from Geneva on this 
tour 

03:12:05.365 --> 03:12:07.365
about the middle of the month of
August.

03:12:09.872 --> 03:12:12.514
The weather was uncommonly fine,
and it might have been sorrow to

03:12:12.515 --> 03:12:16.844
have been chased away by any 
fleeting circumstance, this 

03:12:16.845 --> 03:12:20.114
excursion would certainly have 
had the effect intended by my 

03:12:20.115 --> 03:12:22.115
father.

03:12:27.223 --> 03:12:29.223
As it was, I was somewhat

03:12:48.799 --> 03:12:50.799
interested.

03:12:51.811 --> 03:12:54.131
We followed.

03:12:58.817 --> 03:13:01.689
When the sun had set, we beheld 
mountains overhanging us on 

03:13:01.690 --> 03:13:07.309
every side, and heard the sound 
of the river raging among rocks 

03:13:07.310 --> 03:13:09.310
and the dashing of water falls 
around.

03:13:10.997 --> 03:13:12.997
The next day we pursued our 
journey, 

03:13:14.916 --> 03:13:16.916
and as we ascended still higher,
the 

03:13:18.628 --> 03:13:20.628
valley appeared more magnificent
and 

03:13:21.683 --> 03:13:22.098
Ruined castles hanging on the 
precipices of piny mountains, 

03:13:22.099 --> 03:13:26.993
the impetuous Arve, and cottages
every here and there peeping 

03:13:26.994 --> 03:13:28.417
forth from among the trees 
formed a scene of singular 

03:13:28.418 --> 03:13:30.418
beauty.

03:13:37.054 --> 03:13:39.054
sublime by the mighty Alps, 
whose white 

03:13:40.067 --> 03:13:41.196
and shining pyramids and domes 
towered above all, as belonging 

03:13:41.197 --> 03:13:42.215
to another earth, the 
habitations of another race of 

03:13:42.216 --> 03:13:44.216
beings.

03:13:52.832 --> 03:13:53.839
Pélissier, where the ravine, 
which the river forms, opened 

03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:56.133
before me, and I began to ascend
the mountain that overhangs it.

03:14:00.854 --> 03:14:02.854
of Chamounix.

03:14:15.726 --> 03:14:16.164
sublime, but not so beautiful 
and picturesque as that of 

03:14:16.165 --> 03:14:21.881
Servox, through which I had just
passed.immediate boundaries, but

03:14:21.882 --> 03:14:23.882
I saw no more ruined castles and
fertile fields.

03:14:26.764 --> 03:14:27.782
heard the rumbling thunder of 
the falling avalanche and marked

03:14:27.783 --> 03:14:29.783
the smoke of its passage.

03:14:41.820 --> 03:14:43.820
Mont Blanc, raised itself from 
the 

03:14:49.501 --> 03:14:50.108
Surround ing aiguilles, and its 
tremendousdôme overlooked the 

03:14:50.109 --> 03:14:52.109
valley.

03:15:06.362 --> 03:15:08.362
At other times, I brought the 
animals 

03:15:09.587 --> 03:15:11.587
before my

03:15:15.790 --> 03:15:17.790
companion.

03:15:20.007 --> 03:15:22.007
At a distance, I

03:15:24.217 --> 03:15:26.217
, weighted down by despair.

03:15:30.726 --> 03:15:32.726
At 8:00 in the evening, I 
arrived at Chamounix.

03:15:38.135 --> 03:15:40.135
Ernest was delighted and in high

03:15:42.330 --> 03:15:44.330
spirits.

03:15:45.578 --> 03:15:48.029
The rain seemed to promise for 
the next day. We returned to our

03:15:48.030 --> 03:15:50.118
apartment, but not to sleep. At 
least I did not.

03:15:54.605 --> 03:15:57.481
I remained many hours at the 
window, watching the lightning 

03:15:57.482 --> 03:15:59.482
that played above, and listening
to the rushing of 

03:16:04.846 --> 03:16:06.846
the Arve, which runs below my

03:16:12.955 --> 03:16:14.955
I spent the following day 
roaming through the valley.

03:16:15.515 --> 03:16:16.124
Arveiron, which take their rise 
in a glacier, that with slow 

03:16:16.125 --> 03:16:17.573
pace is advancing down from the 
summit of the hills to barricade

03:16:17.574 --> 03:16:19.574
the valley.

03:16:25.026 --> 03:16:27.026
although they did not remove my 
grief, 

03:16:29.093 --> 03:16:31.093
they subdued and

03:16:32.994 --> 03:16:34.994
tranquilized it.

03:16:37.833 --> 03:16:40.308
I returned in the evening 
fatigued but less unhappy and 

03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:42.309
conversed with my 

03:16:44.185 --> 03:16:45.628
family with more cheerfulness 
than had been my custom for some

03:16:45.629 --> 03:16:47.629
time.

03:16:51.913 --> 03:16:53.913
My father was pleased, and 
Elizabeth 

03:17:00.023 --> 03:17:02.023
overjoyed.

03:17:03.285 --> 03:17:05.285
The following morning, rain full
down 

03:17:06.289 --> 03:17:08.289
in

03:17:21.858 --> 03:17:26.573
torrents. The feelings 
overpowered me. I knew that they

03:17:26.574 --> 03:17:28.574
would remain that day 

03:17:30.884 --> 03:17:33.343
at the end, and as I had ever 
endeared myself to the rain, 

03:17:33.344 --> 03:17:35.344
moisture, and cold, 

03:17:38.841 --> 03:17:40.841
I resolved to go alone to the 
summit of

03:18:01.650 --> 03:18:02.076
It had then filled me with a 
sublime ecstasy that gave wings 

03:18:02.077 --> 03:18:02.895
to the soul and allowed it to 
soar from the obscure world to 

03:18:02.896 --> 03:18:04.747
light and joy.nature had indeed 
always the effect of solemnising

03:18:04.748 --> 03:18:06.748
my mind and causing me to forget
the passing cares of life.

03:18:09.237 --> 03:18:11.237
I was well acquainted with the 
path, and 

03:18:12.255 --> 03:18:14.255
the presence 

03:18:17.025 --> 03:18:18.649
of another would destroy the 
solitary grandeur of the scene.

03:18:18.650 --> 03:18:18.821
is cut into continual and short 
windings, which enable you to 

03:18:18.822 --> 03:18:20.822
surmount 

03:18:22.196 --> 03:18:24.196
the perpendicularity of the 
mountain.

03:18:46.617 --> 03:18:47.012
of the winter avalanche may be 
perceived, where trees lie 

03:18:47.013 --> 03:18:49.926
broken and strewed on the 
ground, some entirely destroyed,

03:18:49.927 --> 03:18:50.737
others bent, leaning upon the 
jutting rocks of the mountain or

03:18:50.738 --> 03:18:52.738
transversely upon other trees.

03:18:54.027 --> 03:18:56.027
intersected by ravines of snow, 
down 

03:18:57.034 --> 03:18:59.034
which stones 

03:19:04.695 --> 03:19:05.099
continually roll from above; one
of them is particularly 

03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:07.100
dangerous, as the slightest 
sound, such as even speaking 

03:19:09.649 --> 03:19:10.897
in a loud voice, produces a 
concussion of air sufficient to 

03:19:10.898 --> 03:19:12.898
draw destruction upon the head 
of the speaker.

03:19:17.244 --> 03:19:19.244
but they are sombre and add an 
air of severity to the scene.

03:19:26.665 --> 03:19:29.316
vast mists were rising from the 
rivers which ran through it and 

03:19:29.317 --> 03:19:31.166
curling in thick wreaths around 
the opposite mountains, whose 

03:19:31.167 --> 03:19:33.167
summits were hid in the 

03:19:34.846 --> 03:19:36.875
uniform clouds, while rain 
poured from the dark sky and 

03:19:36.876 --> 03:19:37.694
added to the melancholy 
impression I received from the 

03:19:37.695 --> 03:19:39.695
objects around me.

03:19:43.656 --> 03:19:45.656
superior to those apparent in 
the brute; 

03:19:46.659 --> 03:19:48.659
it only renders them more 
necessary beings.

03:19:56.122 --> 03:19:58.122
hunger, thirst, and desire, we 

03:20:06.783 --> 03:20:07.376
might be nearly free; but now we
are moved by every wind that 

03:20:07.377 --> 03:20:09.377
blows and a chance word or scene
that that word may convey to us.

03:20:12.715 --> 03:20:14.715
pollutes the day.

03:20:21.453 --> 03:20:23.453
weep,

03:20:38.094 --> 03:20:39.105
Embrace fond woe, or cast our 
cares away; It is the same:  

03:20:39.106 --> 03:20:40.768
For, be it joy or sorrow, The 
path of its departure still is 

03:20:40.769 --> 03:20:44.444

but mutability!the top of the 

03:20:44.445 --> 03:20:46.445
ascent.

03:20:52.842 --> 03:20:54.842
cloud, and I descended upon the 
glacier.

03:20:59.798 --> 03:21:01.798
the waves of a troubled sea, 
descending 

03:21:02.867 --> 03:21:04.867
low, and interspersed by rifts 
that sink deep.

03:21:12.510 --> 03:21:14.510
width, but I spent nearly two 
hours in crossing it.

03:21:22.295 --> 03:21:24.295
Montanvert was exactly opposite,

03:21:25.837 --> 03:21:27.265
at the distance of a league; and
above it rose Mont Blanc, in 

03:21:27.266 --> 03:21:29.266
awful majesty.

03:21:36.285 --> 03:21:38.285
gazing on this wonderful and 
stupendous scene.

03:21:43.046 --> 03:21:45.313
ice, wound among its dependent 
mountains, whose aerial summits 

03:21:45.314 --> 03:21:47.351
hung over its recesses.

03:21:53.074 --> 03:21:55.074
the sunlight over the clouds.

03:21:58.420 --> 03:22:01.104
now swelled with something like 
joy; I exclaimed, “Wandering 

03:22:01.105 --> 03:22:03.105
spirits, if indeed 

03:22:06.413 --> 03:22:09.080
ye wander, and do not rest in 
your narrow beds, allow me this 

03:22:09.081 --> 03:22:11.081
faint 

03:22:12.093 --> 03:22:14.904
happiness, or take me, as your 
companion, away from the joys of

03:22:14.905 --> 03:22:16.905
life.

03:22:17.992 --> 03:22:20.214
As I said this I suddenly beheld
the figure of a man, at some 

03:22:20.215 --> 03:22:22.870
distance, advancing towards me 
with superhuman speed.

03:22:29.805 --> 03:22:31.830
ice, among which I had walked 
with caution; his stature, also,

03:22:31.831 --> 03:22:34.490
as he approached, seemed to 
exceed that of man.

03:22:41.915 --> 03:22:44.611
eyes, and I felt a faintness 
seize me, but I was quickly 

03:22:44.612 --> 03:22:47.060
restored by the cold gale of the
mountains.

03:22:52.993 --> 03:22:54.993
that it was the wretch whom I 
had created.

03:22:59.953 --> 03:23:02.617
resolving to wait his approach 
and then close with him in 

03:23:02.618 --> 03:23:04.618
mortal combat.

03:23:08.950 --> 03:23:11.004
bitter anguish, combined with 
disdain and malignity, while its

03:23:11.005 --> 03:23:15.721
unearthly ugliness rendered it 
almost too horrible for human 

03:23:15.722 --> 03:23:17.722
eyes.

03:23:22.151 --> 03:23:24.818
hatred had at first deprived me 
of utterance, and I recovered 

03:23:24.819 --> 03:23:29.996
only to overwhelm him with words
expressive of furious 

03:23:29.997 --> 03:23:31.997
detestation and contempt.

03:23:35.384 --> 03:23:37.384
dare approach me?

03:23:41.535 --> 03:23:43.535
vengeance of my arm wreaked on 
your miserable head?

03:23:53.231 --> 03:23:55.231
your miserable existence, 
restore those 

03:23:58.584 --> 03:24:01.270
victims whom you have so 
diabolically murdered!“I 

03:24:01.271 --> 03:24:03.271
expected this reception,” said 
the daemon.

03:24:08.104 --> 03:24:10.153
then, must I be hated, who am 
miserable beyond all living 

03:24:10.154 --> 03:24:12.154
things!

03:24:16.143 --> 03:24:18.180
me, thy creature, to whom thou 
art bound by ties only 

03:24:18.181 --> 03:24:20.181
dissoluble by the 

03:24:21.194 --> 03:24:23.194
annihilation of one of us.

03:24:31.798 --> 03:24:33.798
mine towards you and the rest of
mankind.

03:24:37.768 --> 03:24:40.250
I will leave them and you at 
peace; but if you refuse, I will

03:24:40.251 --> 03:24:40.652
glut the maw of death, until it 
be satiated with the blood of 

03:24:40.653 --> 03:24:42.653
your remaining friends.

03:24:44.572 --> 03:24:44.965
come on, then, that I may 
extinguish the spark which I so 

03:24:44.966 --> 03:24:46.966
negligently bestowed.

03:24:50.268 --> 03:24:52.932
My rage was without bounds; I 
sprang on him, impelled by all 

03:24:52.933 --> 03:24:58.053
the feelings which can arm one 
being against the existence of 

03:24:58.054 --> 03:25:00.054
another.

03:25:07.143 --> 03:25:09.143
you give vent to your hatred on 
my devoted head.

03:25:18.689 --> 03:25:20.689
accumulation of anguish, is dear
to me, and I will defend it.

03:25:26.727 --> 03:25:29.386
powerful than thyself; my height
is superior to thine, my joints 

03:25:29.387 --> 03:25:31.387
more supple.

03:25:40.449 --> 03:25:43.112
even mild and docile to my 
natural lord and king if thou 

03:25:43.113 --> 03:25:45.804
wilt also perform thy part, the 
which thou owest me.

03:25:52.156 --> 03:25:54.156
every other and trample upon me 
alone, 

03:25:56.871 --> 03:25:59.574
to whom thy justice, and even 
thy clemency and affection, is 

03:25:59.575 --> 03:26:01.575
most due.

03:26:05.308 --> 03:26:07.966
ought to be thy Adam, but I am 
rather the fallen angel, whom 

03:26:07.967 --> 03:26:10.065
thou drivest from joy for no 
misdeed.

03:26:15.419 --> 03:26:17.419
alone am irrevocably excluded.

03:26:30.108 --> 03:26:32.108
and me; we are enemies.

03:26:35.405 --> 03:26:37.405
fight, in which one must fall.

03:26:43.367 --> 03:26:46.088
favourable eye upon thy 
creature, who implores thy 

03:26:46.089 --> 03:26:48.089
goodness and compassion?

03:26:53.434 --> 03:26:56.089
benevolent; my soul glowed with 
love and humanity; but am I not 

03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:58.090
alone, miserably alone?

03:27:03.064 --> 03:27:05.091
can I gather from your fellow 
creatures, who owe me nothing?

03:27:16.744 --> 03:27:18.744
caves of ice, which I only do 
not fear, 

03:27:19.748 --> 03:27:22.483
are a dwelling to me, and the 
only one which man does not 

03:27:22.484 --> 03:27:24.484
grudge.

03:27:28.850 --> 03:27:30.850
kinder to me than your fellow 
beings.

03:27:35.575 --> 03:27:38.352
existence, they would do as you 
do, and arm themselves for my 

03:27:38.353 --> 03:27:40.353
destruction.

03:27:55.420 --> 03:27:57.420
me, and deliver them from an 
evil which 

03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:01.818
it only remains for you to make 
so great, that not only you and 

03:28:01.819 --> 03:28:04.305
your family, but thousands of 
others, shall 

03:28:07.316 --> 03:28:09.316
be swallowed up in the 
whirlwinds of its rage.

03:28:18.033 --> 03:28:20.284
that, abandon or commiserate me,
as you shall judge that I 

03:28:20.285 --> 03:28:22.285
deserve.

03:28:28.101 --> 03:28:30.348
bloody as they are, to speak in 
their own defence before they 

03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:32.349
are condemned.

03:28:39.735 --> 03:28:41.975
would, with a satisfied 
conscience, destroy your own 

03:28:41.976 --> 03:28:43.976
creature.

03:28:50.907 --> 03:28:53.564
to me, and then, if you can, and
if you will, destroy the work of

03:28:53.565 --> 03:28:55.565
your hands.

03:28:57.853 --> 03:28:59.853
“Why do you call to my 
remembrance,” I 

03:29:01.944 --> 03:29:04.591
rejoined, “circumstances of 
which I shudder to reflect, that

03:29:04.592 --> 03:29:07.262
I have been the miserable origin
and author?

03:29:12.916 --> 03:29:14.916
which you first saw light!

03:29:24.765 --> 03:29:26.765
whether I am just to you or not.

03:29:32.153 --> 03:29:34.787
“Thus I relieve thee, my 
creator,” he said, and placed 

03:29:34.788 --> 03:29:36.788
his hated hands before 

03:29:39.552 --> 03:29:42.211
my eyes, which I flung from me 
with violence; “thus I take from

03:29:42.212 --> 03:29:44.212
thee a sight which you abhor.

03:29:54.444 --> 03:29:56.444
demand this from you.

place is not 

03:30:02.599 --> 03:30:04.900

said this he led the way across 
the ice; I followed.him, but as 

03:30:13.993 --> 03:30:14.400
I proceeded, I weighed the 
various arguments that he had 

03:30:14.401 --> 03:30:16.637
used and determined at least to 
listen to his tale.compassion 

03:30:16.638 --> 03:30:18.638
confirmed my resolution.

murderer of my brother, and I 
eagerly 

03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:28.710
sought a confirmation or denial 
of this opinion.

03:30:32.485 --> 03:30:35.137
the duties of a creator towards 
his creature were, and that I 

03:30:35.138 --> 03:30:39.842
ought to render him happy before
I complained of his wickedness.

03:30:54.807 --> 03:30:57.455
began to descend; we entered the
hut, the fiend with an air of 

03:30:57.456 --> 03:30:59.456
exultation, I 

03:31:00.473 --> 03:31:02.682
with a heavy heart and depressed
spirits.

03:31:08.432 --> 03:31:10.432
myself by the fire which my 
odious 

03:31:11.435 --> 03:31:13.435
companion had lighted, he thus 
began his tale.

that period appear confused and 
indistinct.seized me, and I saw,

03:31:19.525 --> 03:31:21.525
felt, heard, and 

03:31:22.532 --> 03:31:24.532
smelt at the 

03:31:41.848 --> 03:31:44.527
same time; and it was, indeed, a
long time before I learned to 

03:31:44.528 --> 03:31:46.528
distinguish between the 
operations of my various senses.

03:31:58.667 --> 03:31:59.286
light pressed upon my nerves, so
that I was obliged to shut my 

03:31:59.287 --> 03:32:01.287
eyes.

03:32:05.110 --> 03:32:07.562
me, but hardly had I felt this 
when, by opening my eyes, as I 

03:32:07.563 --> 03:32:09.815
now suppose, the light poured in
upon me again.I presently found 

03:32:09.816 --> 03:32:11.816
a great alteration in my 
sensations.

03:32:16.322 --> 03:32:18.645
surrounded me, impervious to my 
touch or sight; but I now found 

03:32:18.646 --> 03:32:23.859
that I could wander on at 
liberty, with no obstacles which

03:32:23.860 --> 03:32:26.497
I could not either surmount or 
avoid.

03:32:32.765 --> 03:32:34.970
oppressive to me, and the heat 
wearying me as I walked, I 

03:32:34.971 --> 03:32:37.220
sought a place where I could 
receive shade.

03:32:42.989 --> 03:32:44.989
and here I lay by the side of a 
brook 

03:32:48.302 --> 03:32:52.368
resting from my fatigue, until I
felt tormented by hunger and 

03:32:48.302 --> 03:32:50.302
thirst.

03:32:56.268 --> 03:32:58.947
state, and I ate some berries 
which I found hanging on the 

03:32:58.948 --> 03:33:00.997
trees or lying on the ground.

03:33:06.771 --> 03:33:08.771
and then lying down, was 
overcome by sleep.

03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:17.448
also, and half frightened, as it
were, instinctively, finding 

03:33:17.449 --> 03:33:19.449
myself so desolate.

03:33:22.565 --> 03:33:25.225
a sensation of cold, I had 
covered myself with some 

03:33:25.226 --> 03:33:27.226
clothes, but these were 

03:33:30.164 --> 03:33:32.164
insufficient to secure me from 
the dews of night.

03:33:36.378 --> 03:33:38.378
wretch; I knew, and could 
distinguish, 

03:33:39.396 --> 03:33:42.185
nothing; but feeling pain invade
me on all sides, I sat down and 

03:33:42.186 --> 03:33:44.186
wept.

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:51.840
heavens and gave me a sensation 
of pleasure.rise from among the 

03:33:51.841 --> 03:33:53.687
trees.path, and I again went out
in search of berries.trees I 

03:33:53.688 --> 03:33:54.285
found a huge cloak, with which I
covered myself, and sat down 

03:33:54.286 --> 03:33:56.286
upon the ground.

03:34:03.923 --> 03:34:05.923
and darkness; innumerable sounds
rang in 

03:34:09.228 --> 03:34:11.273
my ears, and on all sides 
various scents saluted me; the 

03:34:11.274 --> 03:34:13.956
only object that I could 
distinguish was the bright moon,

03:34:13.957 --> 03:34:15.957
and I 

03:34:16.957 --> 03:34:18.957
fixed my eyes on that with 
pleasure.

03:34:24.026 --> 03:34:26.675
passed, and the orb of night had
greatly lessened, when I began 

03:34:26.676 --> 03:34:28.715
to distinguish my sensations 
from each other.

03:34:36.283 --> 03:34:38.934
stream that supplied me with 
drink and the trees that shaded 

03:34:38.935 --> 03:34:40.935
me with their foliage.

03:34:45.103 --> 03:34:47.103
that a pleasant sound, which 
often 

03:34:48.109 --> 03:34:53.690
saluted my ears, proceeded from 
the throats of the little winged

03:34:53.691 --> 03:34:56.353
animals who had often 
intercepted the light from my 

03:34:56.354 --> 03:34:58.354
eyes.

03:35:02.741 --> 03:35:05.737
accuracy, the forms that 
surrounded me and to perceive 

03:35:08.535 --> 03:35:10.535
the boundaries of the radiant 
roof of light which canopied me.

03:35:16.420 --> 03:35:18.420
pleasant songs of the birds but 
was unable.

03:35:22.792 --> 03:35:24.875
sensations in my own mode, but 
the uncouth and inarticulate 

03:35:24.876 --> 03:35:26.944
sounds which broke from me 
frightened me into silence 

03:35:29.182 --> 03:35:31.182
again.

03:35:34.382 --> 03:35:36.220
night, and again, with a 
lessened form, showed itself, 

03:35:36.221 --> 03:35:37.256
while I still remained in the 
forest.distinct, and my mind 

03:35:37.257 --> 03:35:39.257
received every day additional 
ideas.

03:35:42.367 --> 03:35:44.367
and to perceive objects in their
right 

03:35:45.620 --> 03:35:46.035
forms; I distinguished the 
insect from the herb, and by 

03:35:46.036 --> 03:35:48.036
degrees, one herb from another.

03:35:50.122 --> 03:35:50.522
none but harsh notes, whilst 
those of the blackbird and 

03:35:50.523 --> 03:35:51.152
thrush were sweet and enticing.I
found a fire which had been left

03:35:51.153 --> 03:35:51.761
by some wandering beggars, and 
was overcome with delight at the

03:35:51.762 --> 03:35:52.368
warmth I experienced from it.
live embers, but quickly drew it

03:35:52.369 --> 03:35:54.369
out 

03:35:55.574 --> 03:35:58.491
How strange, I thought, that the
same cause should produce such 

03:35:58.492 --> 03:36:00.492
opposite effects!

03:36:04.891 --> 03:36:06.891
and to my joy found it to be 
composed of wood.

03:36:11.627 --> 03:36:13.627
branches, but they were wet and 
would not burn.

03:36:17.416 --> 03:36:19.416
watching the operation of the 
fire.

03:36:23.334 --> 03:36:25.334
the heat dried and itself became
inflamed.

03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:32.419
the various branches, I 
discovered the cause and busied 

03:36:32.420 --> 03:36:37.099
myself in collecting a great 
quantity of wood, that I might 

03:36:37.100 --> 03:36:39.558
dry it and have a plentiful 
supply of fire.with it, I was in

03:36:39.559 --> 03:36:41.817
the greatest fear lest my fire 
should be extinguished.

03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:50.865
and leaves and placed wet 
branches upon it; and then, 

03:36:50.866 --> 03:36:53.549
spreading my cloak, I lay on the
ground and sank into sleep.

03:37:00.925 --> 03:37:02.925
first care was to visit the 
fire.

03:37:06.249 --> 03:37:08.249
quickly fanned it into a flame.

03:37:10.996 --> 03:37:13.046
fan of branches, which roused 
the embers when they were nearly

03:37:13.047 --> 03:37:15.047
extinguished.

03:37:20.019 --> 03:37:22.528
pleasure, that the fire gave 
light as well as heat and that 

03:37:22.529 --> 03:37:24.529
the discovery of 

03:37:27.252 --> 03:37:29.924
this element was useful to me in
my food, for I found some of the

03:37:29.925 --> 03:37:34.646
offals that the travellers had 
left had been roasted, and 

03:37:34.647 --> 03:37:36.647
tasted much more savoury 

03:37:39.995 --> 03:37:41.995
than the berries I gathered from
the trees.

03:37:45.733 --> 03:37:47.733
the same manner, placing it on 
the live embers.

03:37:52.718 --> 03:37:54.772
by this operation, and the nuts 
and roots much improved.

03:38:00.722 --> 03:38:00.920
often spent the whole day 
searching in vain for a few 

03:38:00.921 --> 03:38:02.147
acorns to assuage the pangs of 
hunger.the place that I had 

03:38:02.148 --> 03:38:02.759
hitherto inhabited, to seek for 
one where the few wants I 

03:38:02.760 --> 03:38:03.373
experienced would be more easily
satisfied.lamented the loss of 

03:38:03.374 --> 03:38:03.774
the fire which I had obtained 
through accident and knew not 

03:38:03.775 --> 03:38:04.594
how to reproduce it.
consideration of this 

03:38:04.595 --> 03:38:06.082
difficulty, but I was obliged to
relinquish all attempt to supply

03:38:06.083 --> 03:38:07.727
it, and wrapping myself up in my
cloak, I struck across the wood 

03:38:07.728 --> 03:38:09.728
towards the setting sun.

03:38:14.696 --> 03:38:16.696
and at length discovered the 
open country.

03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:23.000
the night before, and the fields
were of 

03:38:25.149 --> 03:38:27.396
one uniform white; the 
appearance was disconsolate, and

03:38:27.397 --> 03:38:32.118
I found my feet chilled by the 
cold damp substance that covered

03:38:32.119 --> 03:38:34.119
the ground.

03:38:37.290 --> 03:38:39.290
I longed to obtain food and 
shelter; at 

03:38:42.193 --> 03:38:44.234
length I perceived a small hut, 
on a rising ground, which had 

03:38:44.235 --> 03:38:46.295
doubtless been built for the 
convenience of some shepherd.

03:38:48.743 --> 03:38:50.743
examined the structure with 
great curiosity.

03:38:52.195 --> 03:38:54.195
which he was preparing his 
breakfast.

03:38:58.984 --> 03:39:01.234
perceiving me, shrieked loudly, 
and quitting the hut, ran across

03:39:01.235 --> 03:39:03.235
the fields 

03:39:05.323 --> 03:39:09.189
with a speed of which his 
debilitated form hardly appeared

03:39:05.323 --> 03:39:07.323
capable.

03:39:12.285 --> 03:39:14.963
had ever before seen, and his 
flight somewhat surprised me.

03:39:19.726 --> 03:39:21.726
of the hut; here the snow and 
rain could 

03:39:23.785 --> 03:39:26.428
not penetrate; the ground was 
dry; and it presented to me then

03:39:26.429 --> 03:39:31.204
as exquisite and divine a 
retreat as Pandaemonium appeared

03:39:31.205 --> 03:39:32.834
to the daemons of hell after 
their sufferings in the lake of 

03:39:32.835 --> 03:39:34.835
fire.

03:39:39.774 --> 03:39:41.599
shepherd's breakfast, which 
consisted of bread, cheese, 

03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:43.293
milk, and wine; the latter, 
however, I did not like.among 

03:39:43.294 --> 03:39:45.294
some straw and fell asleep.

03:39:48.018 --> 03:39:50.742
by the warmth of the sun, which 
shone brightly on the white 

03:39:50.743 --> 03:39:52.782
ground, I determined to 
recommence my travels; 

03:39:57.554 --> 03:39:59.789
and, depositing the remains of 
the peasant's breakfast in a 

03:39:59.790 --> 03:40:04.486
wallet I found, I proceeded 
across the fields for several 

03:40:04.487 --> 03:40:06.516
hours, until at sunset I arrived
at a village.

03:40:13.923 --> 03:40:15.923
stately houses engaged my 
admiration by turns.

03:40:20.274 --> 03:40:22.935
and cheese that I saw placed at 
the windows of some of the 

03:40:22.936 --> 03:40:24.936
cottages, allured my appetite.

03:40:29.925 --> 03:40:31.967
I had hardly placed my foot 
within the door before the 

03:40:31.968 --> 03:40:34.684
children shrieked, and one of 
the women fainted.

03:40:40.438 --> 03:40:42.056
fled, some attacked me, until, 
grievously bruised by stones and

03:40:42.057 --> 03:40:46.746
many other kinds of missile 
weapons, I escaped to the open 

03:40:46.747 --> 03:40:48.747
country and 

03:40:51.462 --> 03:40:53.093
fearfully took refuge in a low 
hovel, quite bare, and making a 

03:40:53.094 --> 03:40:57.420
wretched appearance after the 
palaces I had beheld in the 

03:40:57.421 --> 03:40:59.421
village.

03:41:02.148 --> 03:41:04.811
a neat and pleasant appearance, 
but after my late dearly bought 

03:41:04.812 --> 03:41:06.845
experience, I dared not enter 
it.

03:41:12.128 --> 03:41:14.369
wood, but so low that I could 
with difficulty sit upright in 

03:41:14.370 --> 03:41:16.370
it.

03:41:19.529 --> 03:41:21.770
earth, which formed the floor, 
but it was dry; and although the

03:41:21.771 --> 03:41:23.771
wind entered 

03:41:26.495 --> 03:41:28.519
it by innumerable chinks, I 
found it an agreeable asylum 

03:41:28.520 --> 03:41:30.520
from the snow and rain.

03:41:33.856 --> 03:41:35.921
happy to have found a shelter, 
however miserable, from the 

03:41:35.922 --> 03:41:37.922
inclemency of the 

03:41:40.220 --> 03:41:42.220
season, and still more from the 
barbarity of man.

03:41:44.970 --> 03:41:47.640
my kennel, that I might view the
adjacent cottage and discover if

03:41:47.641 --> 03:41:50.321
I could remain in the habitation
I had found.

03:41:57.126 --> 03:41:59.764
cottage and surrounded on the 
sides which were exposed by a 

03:41:59.765 --> 03:42:01.822
pig sty and a clear pool of 
water.

03:42:07.125 --> 03:42:09.762
crept in; but now I covered 
every crevice by which I might 

03:42:09.763 --> 03:42:14.046
be perceived with stones and 
wood, yet in such a manner that 

03:42:14.047 --> 03:42:16.047
I might move them on 

03:42:18.346 --> 03:42:21.001
occasion to pass out; all the 
light I enjoyed came through the

03:42:21.002 --> 03:42:23.002
sty, and that was sufficient for
me.

03:42:27.355 --> 03:42:29.355
carpeted it with clean straw, I 
retired, 

03:42:32.051 --> 03:42:34.163
for I saw the figure of a man at
a distance, and I remembered too

03:42:34.164 --> 03:42:38.473
well my treatment the night 
before to trust myself in his 

03:42:38.474 --> 03:42:40.474
power.

03:42:43.583 --> 03:42:46.224
sustenance for that day by a 
loaf of coarse bread, which I 

03:42:46.225 --> 03:42:48.225
purloined, and a 

03:42:49.948 --> 03:42:52.613
cup with which I could drink 
more conveniently than from my 

03:42:52.614 --> 03:42:54.684
hand of the pure water which 
flowed by my retreat.

03:43:00.653 --> 03:43:03.303
it was kept perfectly dry, and 
by its vicinity to the chimney 

03:43:03.304 --> 03:43:05.384
of the cottage it was tolerably 
warm.

03:43:11.140 --> 03:43:13.180
reside in this hovel until 
something should occur which 

03:43:13.181 --> 03:43:15.181
might alter my determination.

03:43:19.562 --> 03:43:21.562
the bleak forest, my former 
residence, 

03:43:23.285 --> 03:43:25.285
the rain-dropping branches, and 
dank earth.

03:43:28.604 --> 03:43:31.294
was about to remove a plank to 
procure myself a little water 

03:43:31.295 --> 03:43:36.019
when I heard a step, and looking
through a small chink, I beheld 

03:43:36.020 --> 03:43:38.020
a young creature, with a pail 

03:43:40.342 --> 03:43:42.342
on her head, passing before my 
hovel.

03:43:45.444 --> 03:43:47.686
demeanour, unlike what I have 
since found cottagers and 

03:43:47.687 --> 03:43:49.687
farmhouse servants to be.

03:43:53.412 --> 03:43:55.691
blue petticoat and a linen 
jacket being her only garb; her 

03:43:55.692 --> 03:43:57.692
fair hair was plaited 

03:43:59.822 --> 03:44:01.822
but not adorned:  She looked 
patient yet sad.

03:44:05.176 --> 03:44:07.834
quarter of an hour she returned 
bearing the pail, which was now 

03:44:07.835 --> 03:44:09.835
partly filled with milk.

03:44:14.168 --> 03:44:16.234
incommoded by the burden, a 
young man met her, whose 

03:44:16.235 --> 03:44:18.890
countenance expressed a deeper 
despondence.

03:44:24.604 --> 03:44:26.848
melancholy, he took the pail 
from her head and bore it to the

03:44:26.849 --> 03:44:28.849
cottage himself.

03:44:35.873 --> 03:44:37.903
with some tools in his hand, 
cross the field behind the 

03:44:37.904 --> 03:44:39.904
cottage; and the girl 

03:44:42.611 --> 03:44:46.677
was also busied, sometimes in 
the house and sometimes in the 

03:44:42.611 --> 03:44:44.611
yard.

03:44:48.992 --> 03:44:50.992
one of the windows of the 
cottage had 

03:44:53.275 --> 03:44:55.958
formerly occupied a part of it, 
but the panes had been filled up

03:44:55.959 --> 03:44:57.959
with wood.

03:45:00.722 --> 03:45:02.745
imperceptible chink through 
which the eye could just 

03:45:02.746 --> 03:45:04.746
penetrate.

03:45:07.426 --> 03:45:09.714
visible, whitewashed and clean 
but very bare of furniture.

03:45:14.416 --> 03:45:16.448
an old man, leaning his head on 
his hands in a disconsolate 

03:45:16.449 --> 03:45:18.449
attitude.

03:45:22.377 --> 03:45:24.407
arranging the cottage; but 
presently she took something out

03:45:24.408 --> 03:45:26.408
of a drawer, which 

03:45:27.428 --> 03:45:31.797
employed her hands, and she sat 
down beside the old man, who, 

03:45:31.798 --> 03:45:34.036
taking up an instrument, began 
to play and to produce sounds 

03:45:34.037 --> 03:45:36.037
sweeter 

03:45:38.791 --> 03:45:40.791
than the voice of the thrush or 
the nightingale.

03:45:44.541 --> 03:45:46.541
wretch who had never beheld 
aught beautiful before.

03:45:51.334 --> 03:45:53.573
countenance of the aged cottager
won my reverence, while the 

03:45:53.574 --> 03:45:55.574
gentle manners of the girl 
enticed my love.

03:46:00.899 --> 03:46:02.524
perceived drew tears from the 
eyes of his amiable companion, 

03:46:02.525 --> 03:46:04.525
of which the old 

03:46:07.251 --> 03:46:09.902
man took no notice, until she 
sobbed audibly; he then 

03:46:09.903 --> 03:46:13.657
pronounced a few sounds, and the
fair creature, leaving her work,

03:46:13.658 --> 03:46:15.658
knelt at his feet.

03:46:20.011 --> 03:46:22.048
kindness and affection that I 
felt sensations of a peculiar 

03:46:22.049 --> 03:46:26.948
and overpowering nature; they 
were a mixture of pain and 

03:46:26.949 --> 03:46:28.949
pleasure, such as I had 

03:46:31.689 --> 03:46:33.754
never before experienced, either
from hunger or cold, warmth or 

03:46:33.755 --> 03:46:36.411
food; and I withdrew from the 
window, unable to bear these 

03:46:36.412 --> 03:46:38.412
emotions.

03:46:43.238 --> 03:46:45.238
returned, bearing on his 
shoulders a load of wood.

03:46:49.015 --> 03:46:51.680
relieve him of his burden, and 
taking some of the fuel into the

03:46:51.681 --> 03:46:53.681
cottage, 

03:46:56.607 --> 03:46:59.084
placed it on the fire; then she 
and the youth went apart into a 

03:46:59.085 --> 03:47:03.400
nook of the cottage, and he 
showed her a large loaf and a 

03:47:03.401 --> 03:47:05.401
piece of cheese.

03:47:08.575 --> 03:47:10.225
garden for some roots and 
plants, which she placed in 

03:47:10.226 --> 03:47:12.226
water, and then upon the fire.

03:47:17.173 --> 03:47:19.226
whilst the young man went into 
the garden and appeared busily 

03:47:19.227 --> 03:47:21.283
employed in digging and pulling 
up roots.

03:47:27.267 --> 03:47:29.730
an hour, the young woman joined 
him and they entered the cottage

03:47:29.731 --> 03:47:31.731
together.

03:47:35.107 --> 03:47:37.154
pensive, but on the appearance 
of his companions he assumed a 

03:47:37.155 --> 03:47:39.816
more cheerful air, and they sat 
down to eat.

03:47:47.806 --> 03:47:49.806
arranging the cottage, the old 
man 

03:47:52.563 --> 03:47:54.622
walked before the cottage in the
sun for a few minutes, leaning 

03:47:54.623 --> 03:47:56.623
on the arm of the youth.

03:48:00.962 --> 03:48:02.962
contrast between these two 
excellent creatures.

03:48:07.319 --> 03:48:08.958
countenance beaming with 
benevolence and love; the 

03:48:08.959 --> 03:48:11.596
younger was slight and graceful 
in his figure, and his features 

03:48:15.890 --> 03:48:17.932
were moulded with the finest 
symmetry, yet his eyes and 

03:48:17.933 --> 03:48:19.982
attitude expressed the utmost 
sadness and despondency.

03:48:25.955 --> 03:48:27.955
and the youth, with tools 
different from 

03:48:30.105 --> 03:48:32.779
those he had used in the 
morning, directed his steps 

03:48:32.780 --> 03:48:34.780
across the fields.

03:48:38.082 --> 03:48:40.165
extreme wonder, I found that the
cottagers had a means of 

03:48:40.166 --> 03:48:44.298
prolonging light by the use of 
tapers, and was delighted to 

03:48:44.299 --> 03:48:46.299
find that the setting of 

03:48:48.672 --> 03:48:50.731
the sun did not put an end to 
the pleasure I experienced in 

03:48:50.732 --> 03:48:52.732
watching my human neighbours.

03:48:57.073 --> 03:48:59.729
companion were employed in 
various occupations which I did 

03:48:59.730 --> 03:49:00.551
not understand; and the old man 
again took up the instrument 

03:49:00.552 --> 03:49:00.953
which produced the divine sounds
that had enchanted me in the 

03:49:00.954 --> 03:49:02.954
morning.

03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:08.550
began, not to play, but to utter
sounds 

03:49:10.237 --> 03:49:12.280
that were monotonous, and 
neither resembling the harmony 

03:49:12.281 --> 03:49:14.362
of the old man's instrument nor 
the songs of the birds; I 

03:49:17.694 --> 03:49:18.100
since found that he read aloud, 
but at that time I knew nothing 

03:49:18.101 --> 03:49:20.786
of the science of words or 
letters.occupied for a short 

03:49:20.787 --> 03:49:24.463
time, extinguished their lights 
and retired, as I conjectured, 

03:49:24.464 --> 03:49:26.464
to rest.

03:49:27.482 --> 03:49:29.482
”

03:49:46.632 --> 03:49:48.881
manners of these people, and I 
longed to join them, but dared 

03:49:48.882 --> 03:49:50.882
not.

03:49:53.572 --> 03:49:55.572
had suffered the night before 
from the 

03:49:57.850 --> 03:49:59.291
barbarous villagers, and 
resolved, whatever course of 

03:49:59.292 --> 03:50:04.220
conduct I might hereafter think 
it right to pursue, that for the

03:50:04.221 --> 03:50:06.221
present I would remain quietly 

03:50:08.933 --> 03:50:10.981
in my hovel, watching and 
endeavouring to discover the 

03:50:10.982 --> 03:50:12.982
motives which influenced their 
actions.

03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:23.651
and prepared the food, and the 
youth departed after the first 

03:50:23.652 --> 03:50:25.652
meal.

03:50:28.986 --> 03:50:30.986
routine as that which preceded 
it.

03:50:33.681 --> 03:50:35.354
out of doors, and the girl in 
various laborious occupations 

03:50:35.355 --> 03:50:37.355
within.

03:50:41.075 --> 03:50:43.180
be blind, employed his leisure 
hours on his instrument or in 

03:50:43.181 --> 03:50:45.181
contemplation.

03:50:50.748 --> 03:50:52.182
respect which the younger 
cottagers exhibited towards 

03:50:52.183 --> 03:50:54.183
their venerable companion.

03:50:59.153 --> 03:51:01.219
office of affection and duty 
with gentleness, and he rewarded

03:51:01.220 --> 03:51:03.297
them by his benevolent smiles.

03:51:11.287 --> 03:51:13.287
went apart and appeared to weep.

03:51:16.024 --> 03:51:18.024
but I was deeply affected by it.

03:51:21.948 --> 03:51:23.360
miserable, it was less strange 
that I, an imperfect and 

03:51:23.361 --> 03:51:25.622
solitary being, should be 
wretched.

03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:35.689
every luxury; they had a fire to
warm them when chill and 

03:51:35.690 --> 03:51:37.690
delicious viands 

03:51:39.372 --> 03:51:42.048
when hungry; they were dressed 
in excellent clothes; and, still

03:51:42.049 --> 03:51:44.080
more, they enjoyed one another's
company and 

03:51:48.395 --> 03:51:50.395
speech, interchanging each day 
looks of affection and kindness.

03:51:58.431 --> 03:52:00.487
questions, but perpetual 
attention and time explained to 

03:52:00.488 --> 03:52:03.142
me many appearances which were 
at first enigmatic.

03:52:09.511 --> 03:52:11.547
discovered one of the causes of 
the uneasiness of this amiable 

03:52:11.548 --> 03:52:16.284
family:  It was poverty, and 
they suffered that evil in a 

03:52:16.285 --> 03:52:18.285
very distressing degree.

03:52:22.693 --> 03:52:24.693
the vegetables of their garden 
and the 

03:52:27.011 --> 03:52:29.034
milk of one cow, which gave very
little during the winter, when 

03:52:29.035 --> 03:52:31.673
its masters could scarcely 
procure food to support it.

03:52:37.506 --> 03:52:39.609
pangs of hunger very poignantly,
especially the two younger 

03:52:39.610 --> 03:52:42.275
cottagers, for several times 
they placed food 

03:52:47.028 --> 03:52:49.028
before the old man when they 
reserved none for themselves.

03:52:56.037 --> 03:52:57.667
night, to steal a part of their 
store for my own consumption, 

03:52:57.668 --> 03:52:59.668
but when I found 

03:53:02.359 --> 03:53:04.377
that in doing this I inflicted 
pain on the cottagers, I 

03:53:04.378 --> 03:53:06.378
abstained and satisfied 

03:53:09.281 --> 03:53:10.740
myself with berries, nuts, and 
roots which I gathered from a 

03:53:10.741 --> 03:53:12.741
neighbouring wood.

03:53:17.265 --> 03:53:19.265
through which I was enabled to 
assist their labours.

03:53:22.982 --> 03:53:24.982
part of each day in collecting 
wood for 

03:53:27.143 --> 03:53:29.811
the family fire, and during the 
night I often took his tools, 

03:53:29.812 --> 03:53:32.062
the use of which I quickly 
discovered, and brought home 

03:53:34.564 --> 03:53:36.807
firing sufficient for the 
consumption of several days.

03:53:41.516 --> 03:53:43.625
this, the young woman, when she 
opened the door in the morning, 

03:53:43.626 --> 03:53:45.626
appeared 

03:53:47.916 --> 03:53:51.716
greatly astonished on seeing a 
great pile of wood on the 

03:53:47.916 --> 03:53:49.916
outside.

03:53:54.260 --> 03:53:56.260
and the youth joined her, who 
also expressed surprise.

03:54:01.062 --> 03:54:03.736
not go to the forest that day, 
but spent it in repairing the 

03:54:03.737 --> 03:54:05.830
cottage and cultivating the 
garden.

03:54:14.285 --> 03:54:16.285
method of communicating their 
experience 

03:54:19.006 --> 03:54:21.006
and feelings to one another by 
articulate sounds.

03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:26.800
sometimes produced pleasure or 
pain, 

03:54:28.684 --> 03:54:30.684
smiles or sadness, in the minds 
and countenances of the hearers.

03:54:34.889 --> 03:54:36.889
I ardently desired to become 
acquainted with it.

03:54:46.005 --> 03:54:48.255
words they uttered, not having 
any apparent connection with 

03:54:48.256 --> 03:54:50.317
visible objects, I was unable to
discover any 

03:54:54.599 --> 03:54:56.599
clue by which I could unravel 
the mystery of their reference.

03:55:01.462 --> 03:55:05.128
after having remained during 
676767676767 the space of 

03:55:01.462 --> 03:55:03.129
several revolutions of the moon 
in my hovel, I discovered the 

03:55:03.130 --> 03:55:03.731
names that were given to some of
the most familiar objects of 

03:55:03.732 --> 03:55:04.151
discourse; I learned and applied
the words,fire, milk, bread, 

03:55:04.152 --> 03:55:06.152
andwood.

03:55:13.965 --> 03:55:16.250
them several names, but the old 
man had only one, which 

03:55:16.251 --> 03:55:18.251
wasfather.

03:55:20.335 --> 03:55:22.335
the youthFelix, brother, orson.

03:55:26.683 --> 03:55:29.327
when I learned the ideas 
appropriated to each of these 

03:55:29.328 --> 03:55:31.328
sounds and was able to 

03:55:32.336 --> 03:55:34.336
pronounce

03:55:46.603 --> 03:55:47.655
The gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared  

03:55:47.656 --> 03:55:49.902
them to me; when they were  
unhappy, I felt depressed; when 

03:55:49.903 --> 03:55:52.161
they rejoiced, I sympathised in 
their joys. 

03:55:53.783 --> 03:55:55.831
I saw few human beings besides  
them, and if any other happened 

03:55:55.832 --> 03:55:57.832
to enter the cottage, their  
harsh manners and rude 

03:56:01.143 --> 03:56:05.209
gait only enhanced to me the 
superior  accomplishments of my 

03:56:01.143 --> 03:56:05.975
friends. 
The old man, I could perceive,  

03:56:05.976 --> 03:56:11.139
often endeavoured to encourage  
his children, as sometimes I  

03:56:11.140 --> 03:56:14.435
found that he called them, to  
cast off their melancholy. 

03:56:15.870 --> 03:56:17.870
He would talk in a cheerful  
accent, 

03:56:18.886 --> 03:56:20.886
with an expression of  

03:56:24.224 --> 03:56:26.224
goodness that bestowed pleasure 
even upon me. 

03:56:28.246 --> 03:56:29.827
Agatha listened with respect,  
her eyes sometimes filled with  

03:56:29.828 --> 03:56:32.289
tears, which she endeavoured to 
wipe away unperceived; but I  

03:56:32.290 --> 03:56:34.539
generally found that her  
countenance and tone were more  

03:56:35.763 --> 03:56:36.987
cheerful after having listened  
to the exhortations of her  

03:56:36.988 --> 03:56:40.312
father. 
It was not thus with Felix. 

03:56:42.763 --> 03:56:44.828
He was always the saddest of the
group, and even to my  

03:56:44.829 --> 03:56:47.715
unpractised senses, he appeared 
to have suffered more deeply  

03:56:47.716 --> 03:56:52.466
than his friends. 
But if his countenance was more 

03:56:54.092 --> 03:56:55.953
sorrowful, his voice was more  
cheerful than that of his  

03:56:55.954 --> 03:57:02.146
sister, especially when he  
addressed the old man. 

03:57:04.190 --> 03:57:06.654
“I could mention innumerable  
instances which, although  

03:57:06.655 --> 03:57:09.927
slight, marked the dispositions 
of these amiable cottagers. 

03:57:11.986 --> 03:57:13.820
In the midst of poverty and  
want, Felix carried with  

03:57:13.821 --> 03:57:16.483
pleasure to his sister the first
little white flower that peeped 

03:57:17.966 --> 03:57:19.966
out from beneath the snowy  
ground. 

03:57:21.216 --> 03:57:22.639
Early in the morning, before she
had risen, he cleared away the  

03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:26.125
snow that obstructed her path to
the milk-house, drew water from 

03:57:26.126 --> 03:57:28.374
the well, and brought the wood  
from the outhouse, where, to 

03:57:32.124 --> 03:57:33.159
his perpetual astonishment, he 
found his store always 

03:57:33.160 --> 03:57:35.160
replenished by  an invisible 
hand.

03:57:37.282 --> 03:57:40.366
In the day, I believe, he worked
sometimes for a neighbouring  

03:57:40.367 --> 03:57:42.367
farmer, 

03:57:43.367 --> 03:57:45.892
because he often went  forth and
did not return until  dinner, 

03:57:46.929 --> 03:57:49.418
yet brought no wood with him. 
At other times he worked in the 

03:57:49.419 --> 03:57:51.871
garden, but as there was little 
to do in the frosty season, he  

03:57:51.872 --> 03:57:55.356
read to the old man and Agatha. 
“This reading had puzzled me  

03:57:55.357 --> 03:57:58.637
extremely at first, but by  
degrees I discovered that he  

03:57:58.638 --> 03:58:00.638
uttered many of the same sounds 

03:58:05.492 --> 03:58:07.946
when he read as when he talked. 
I conjectured, therefore, that  

03:58:07.947 --> 03:58:11.480
he found on the paper signs for 
speech which he understood, and 

03:58:11.481 --> 03:58:15.599
I ardently longed to comprehend 
these also; but how was that  

03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:16.410
possible when I did not even  
understand the sounds for which 

03:58:16.411 --> 03:58:21.317
they stood as signs? 
I improved, however, sensibly in

03:58:21.318 --> 03:58:25.003
this science, but not  
sufficiently to follow up any  

03:58:25.004 --> 03:58:27.004
kind of conversation, although I

03:58:28.496 --> 03:58:29.963
applied my whole mind to the  
endeavour, for I easily  

03:58:29.964 --> 03:58:32.412
perceived that, although I  
eagerly longed to discover  

03:58:32.413 --> 03:58:36.506
myself to the cottagers, I ought
not to make the attempt until I 

03:58:36.507 --> 03:58:38.764
had first become master of their
language, which knowledge might 

03:58:43.288 --> 03:58:44.937
enable me to make them overlook 
the deformity of my figure, for 

03:58:44.938 --> 03:58:47.615
with this also the contrast  
perpetually presented to my eyes

03:58:47.616 --> 03:58:52.932
had made me acquainted. 
“I had admired the perfect forms

03:58:52.933 --> 03:58:54.976
of my cottagers—their grace,  
beauty, and 

03:59:00.410 --> 03:59:02.255
delicate  complexions; but how 
was I  terrified when I viewed 

03:59:02.256 --> 03:59:06.958
myself  in a transparent pool! 
At first I started back, unable 

03:59:06.959 --> 03:59:10.823
to believe that it was indeed I 
who was reflected in the mirror;

03:59:10.824 --> 03:59:12.824
and when I became fully  
convinced that I was in 

03:59:16.151 --> 03:59:17.357
reality  the monster that I am, 
I was  filled with the bitterest

03:59:17.358 --> 03:59:20.244
sensations of despondence and  
mortification. 

03:59:20.245 --> 03:59:23.309
Alas! 
I did not yet entirely know the 

03:59:23.310 --> 03:59:27.009
fatal effects of this miserable 
deformity. 

03:59:29.041 --> 03:59:30.683
“As the sun became warmer and  
the light of day longer, the  

03:59:30.684 --> 03:59:34.782
snow vanished, and I beheld the 
bare trees and the black earth. 

03:59:34.783 --> 03:59:37.656
From this time Felix was more  
employed, and the heart-moving  

03:59:37.657 --> 03:59:41.355
indications of impending famine 
disappeared. 

03:59:43.231 --> 03:59:45.683
Their food, as I afterwards  
found, was coarse, but it was  

03:59:45.684 --> 03:59:49.144
wholesome; and they procured a  
sufficiency of it. 

03:59:50.989 --> 03:59:53.226
Several new kinds of plants  
sprang up in the garden, which  

03:59:53.227 --> 03:59:55.670
they dressed; and these signs of
comfort increased daily as the  

03:59:55.671 --> 03:59:59.772
season advanced. 
“The old man, leaning on his  

03:59:59.773 --> 04:00:04.067
son, walked each day at noon,  
when it did not rain, as I found

04:00:04.068 --> 04:00:07.586
it was called when the heavens  
poured forth its waters. 

04:00:09.232 --> 04:00:11.052
This frequently took place, but 
a high wind quickly dried the  

04:00:11.053 --> 04:00:13.053
earth, and the season became far
more pleasant than it had been.

04:00:15.983 --> 04:00:18.858
“My mode of life in my hovel was
uniform. 

04:00:19.906 --> 04:00:21.337
During the morning I attended  
the motions of the cottagers,  

04:00:21.338 --> 04:00:23.338
and when they were dispersed in 
various occupations, 

04:00:26.435 --> 04:00:30.568
I slept;  the remainder of the 
day was  spent in observing my 

04:00:26.435 --> 04:00:30.561
friends. 
When they had retired to rest,  

04:00:30.562 --> 04:00:34.829
if there was any moon or the  
night was star-light, I went  

04:00:34.830 --> 04:00:36.830
into the woods and collected my 
own food and fuel for the  

04:00:37.451 --> 04:00:41.817
cottage. 
When I returned, as often as it 

04:00:41.818 --> 04:00:45.320
was necessary, I cleared their  
path from the snow and performed

04:00:45.321 --> 04:00:48.800
those offices that I had seen  
done by Felix. 

04:00:50.652 --> 04:00:52.119
I afterwards found that these  
labours, performed by an  

04:00:52.120 --> 04:00:54.120
invisible hand, greatly 

04:00:56.009 --> 04:00:58.009
astonished them; and once or  
twice I 

04:00:59.018 --> 04:01:01.018
heard them, on these  

04:01:03.175 --> 04:01:04.389
occasions, utter the words good 
spirit, wonderful; but I did not

04:01:04.390 --> 04:01:06.390
then understand the  
signification of these terms.

04:01:10.122 --> 04:01:12.205
“My thoughts now became more  
active, and I longed to discover

04:01:12.206 --> 04:01:15.682
the motives and feelings of  
these lovely creatures; I was  

04:01:15.683 --> 04:01:16.920
inquisitive to know why Felix  
appeared so miserable and Agatha

04:01:16.921 --> 04:01:21.274
so sad. 
I thought that it might be in my

04:01:21.275 --> 04:01:25.798
power to restore happiness to  
these deserving people. 

04:01:26.847 --> 04:01:29.329
When I slept or was absent, the 
forms of the venerable blind  

04:01:29.330 --> 04:01:33.213
father, the gentle Agatha, and  
the excellent Felix flitted  

04:01:33.214 --> 04:01:35.214
before me. 

04:01:37.235 --> 04:01:38.579
I looked upon them as superior  
beings who would be the arbiters

04:01:38.580 --> 04:01:40.580
of my future destiny.

04:01:41.727 --> 04:01:44.988
I formed in my imagination a  
thousand pictures of presenting 

04:01:44.989 --> 04:01:47.654
myself to them, and their  
reception of me. 

04:01:49.125 --> 04:01:51.125
I imagined that they would be  
disgusted, until, by my gentle  

04:01:53.239 --> 04:01:54.877
demeanour and conciliating  
words, I should first win their 

04:01:54.878 --> 04:01:58.199
favour and afterwards their  
love. 

04:02:01.262 --> 04:02:02.117
These thoughts exhilarated me 
and led me to apply with fresh  

04:02:02.118 --> 04:02:04.566
ardour to the acquiring the art 
of language. 

04:02:06.190 --> 04:02:07.631
My organs were indeed harsh, but
supple; and although my voice  

04:02:07.632 --> 04:02:11.525
was very unlike the soft music  
of their tones, yet I pronounced

04:02:11.526 --> 04:02:13.526
such words as I understood with 
tolerable ease.

04:02:15.405 --> 04:02:18.263
It was as the ass and the  
lap-dog; yet surely the gentle  

04:02:18.264 --> 04:02:20.264
ass whose intentions 

04:02:21.564 --> 04:02:22.623
were  affectionate, although his
manners were rude, deserved  

04:02:22.624 --> 04:02:24.624
better treatment than blows and 
execration.

04:02:30.667 --> 04:02:32.894
"The pleasant showers and genial
warmth of spring greatly altered

04:02:32.895 --> 04:02:35.578
the aspect of the earth. 
Men who before this change  

04:02:35.579 --> 04:02:38.458
seemed to have been hid in caves
dispersed themselves and were  

04:02:38.459 --> 04:02:40.917
employed in various arts of  
cultivation. 

04:02:42.155 --> 04:02:43.373
The birds sang in more cheerful 
notes, and the leaves began to  

04:02:43.374 --> 04:02:46.234
bud forth on the trees. 
Happy, happy earth! 

04:02:48.902 --> 04:02:50.121
Fit habitation for gods, which, 
so short a time before, was  

04:02:50.122 --> 04:02:54.218
bleak, damp, and unwholesome. 
My spirits were elevated by the 

04:02:57.217 --> 04:02:59.573
enchanting appearance of nature;
the past was blotted from my  

04:02:59.574 --> 04:03:04.289
memory, the present was  
tranquil, and the future gilded 

04:03:04.290 --> 04:03:06.290
by bright rays of hope 

04:03:09.662 --> 04:03:12.637
and  AntsAnticipations of joy."

04:03:42.668 --> 04:03:44.668
&gt;&gt; I replied in the affirmative.

04:03:45.873 --> 04:03:47.873
Every minute

04:03:56.178 --> 04:03:58.178
continued you have burdened your
memory 

04:04:00.626 --> 04:04:02.626
with exploded systems and

04:04:04.011 --> 04:04:05.845
useless names Good God! 
In what desert land have you  

04:04:05.846 --> 04:04:08.094
lived, where no one was kind  
enough to inform you that these 

04:04:08.095 --> 04:04:10.740
fancies which you have so  
greedily imbibed are a thousand 

04:04:11.557 --> 04:04:13.557
years old and as musty as they  
are ancient?

04:04:17.888 --> 04:04:20.609
I little expected, in this  
enlightened and scientific age, 

04:04:20.610 --> 04:04:25.512
to find a disciple of Albertus  
Magnus and Paracelsus. 

04:04:28.516 --> 04:04:30.516
My dear sir, you must begin your

04:04:32.102 --> 04:04:34.169
studies entirely anew. 
So saying, he stepped aside and 

04:04:34.170 --> 04:04:36.643
wrote down a list of several  
books treating of natural  

04:04:36.644 --> 04:04:39.160
philosophy which he desired me  
to procure, and dismissed me  

04:04:39.161 --> 04:04:41.621
after mentioning that in the  
beginning of the following week 

04:04:41.622 --> 04:04:44.521
he intended to commence a course
of lectures upon natural  

04:04:46.171 --> 04:04:48.171
philosophy in its general  
relations, and that M.

04:04:49.454 --> 04:04:50.893
Waldman,  a fellow professor, 
would  lecture upon chemistry 

04:04:50.894 --> 04:04:52.894
the  alternate days that he 
omitted. 

04:04:55.736 --> 04:04:58.016
I returned home not  
Disapointed.

04:05:02.144 --> 04:05:05.122
Beg, pardon.  

04:05:37.345 --> 04:05:39.198
My senses were gratified and  
refreshed by a thousand scents  

04:05:39.199 --> 04:05:42.543
of delight and a thousand sights
of beauty. 

04:05:44.177 --> 04:05:45.411
It was on one of these days, 
when my cottagers periodically  

04:05:45.412 --> 04:05:49.697
rested from labour—the old man  
played on his guitar, and the  

04:05:49.698 --> 04:05:51.698
children listened to him—that I 
observed the countenance of  

04:05:54.676 --> 04:05:56.710
Felix was melancholy beyond  
expression; he sighed  

04:05:56.711 --> 04:05:58.711
frequently, and once his 

04:06:00.633 --> 04:06:02.471
father  paused in his music, and
I  conjectured by his manner 

04:06:02.472 --> 04:06:05.771
that  he inquired the cause of 
his  son's sorrow. 

04:06:06.989 --> 04:06:08.823
Felix replied in a cheerful  
accent, and the old man was  

04:06:08.824 --> 04:06:12.887
recommencing his music when  
someone tapped at the door. 

04:06:15.134 --> 04:06:16.149
It was a lady on horseback, 
accompanied by a country-man as 

04:06:16.150 --> 04:06:19.851
a guide. 
The lady was dressed in a dark  

04:06:19.852 --> 04:06:21.909
suit and covered with a thick  
black veil.

04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:27.898
Agatha asked a question, to  
which the stranger only replied 

04:06:27.899 --> 04:06:31.960
by pronouncing, in a sweet  
accent, the name of Felix. 

04:06:34.002 --> 04:06:36.647
Her voice was musical but unlike
that of either of my friends. 

04:06:36.648 --> 04:06:39.938
On hearing this word, Felix came
up hastily to the lady, who,  

04:06:39.939 --> 04:06:41.939
when she saw him, threw up her  
veil, and I beheld a 

04:06:44.441 --> 04:06:46.479
countenance of angelic beauty 
and  expression. 

04:06:49.477 --> 04:06:52.249
Her hair of a shining raven  
black, and curiously braided;  

04:06:52.250 --> 04:06:56.402
her eyes were dark, but gentle, 
although animated; her features 

04:06:56.403 --> 04:06:59.302
of a regular proportion, and her
complexion 

04:07:02.324 --> 04:07:04.324
wondrously fair, each cheek 
tinged with a lovely pink.

04:07:10.864 --> 04:07:12.999
Felix seemed ravished with  
delight when he saw her, every  

04:07:13.000 --> 04:07:15.846
trait of sorrow vanished from  
his face, and it instantly  

04:07:15.847 --> 04:07:18.289
expressed a degree of ecstatic  
joy, of which I could hardly  

04:07:20.115 --> 04:07:22.553
have believed it capable; his  
eyes sparkled, as his cheek  

04:07:22.554 --> 04:07:25.875
flushed with pleasure; and at  
that moment I thought him as  

04:07:25.876 --> 04:07:31.309
beautiful as the stranger. 
She appeared affected by  

04:07:33.476 --> 04:07:35.119
different feelings; wiping a few
tears from her lovely eyes, she 

04:07:35.120 --> 04:07:38.526
held out her hand to Felix, who 
kissed it rapturously and called

04:07:38.527 --> 04:07:42.943
her, as well as I could  
distinguish, his sweet Arabian. 

04:07:42.944 --> 04:07:46.252
She did not appear to understand
him, but smiled. 

04:07:48.295 --> 04:07:49.313
He assisted her to dismount, and
dismissing her guide, conducted 

04:07:49.314 --> 04:07:53.603
her into the cottage. 
Some conversation took place  

04:07:53.604 --> 04:07:56.898
between him and his father, and 
the young stranger knelt at the 

04:07:56.899 --> 04:08:01.059
old man's feet and would have  
kissed his hand, but he raised  

04:08:01.060 --> 04:08:03.781
her and embraced her  
affectionately. 

04:08:06.471 --> 04:08:07.491
I soon perceived that although 
the stranger uttered articulate 

04:08:07.492 --> 04:08:12.393
sounds and appeared to have a  
language of her own, she was  

04:08:12.394 --> 04:08:13.674
neither understood by nor  
herself understood the  

04:08:13.675 --> 04:08:17.771
cottagers. 
They made many signs which I did

04:08:17.772 --> 04:08:19.772
not comprehend, but I saw that  
her presence 

04:08:22.410 --> 04:08:24.747
diffused gladness  through the 
cottage, dispelling  their 

04:08:26.192 --> 04:08:29.037
sorrow as the sun  dissipates 
the morning mists. 

04:08:30.882 --> 04:08:32.752
Felix seemed peculiarly happy  
and with smiles of delight  

04:08:32.753 --> 04:08:37.232
welcomed his Arabian. 
Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, 

04:08:37.233 --> 04:08:40.507
kissed the hands of the lovely  
stranger, and pointing to her  

04:08:40.508 --> 04:08:42.508
brother, made signs 

04:08:44.591 --> 04:08:45.620
which  appeared to me to mean 
that he  had been sorrowful 

04:08:45.621 --> 04:08:47.621
until she  came.

04:08:48.899 --> 04:08:53.417
Some hours passed thus, while  
they, by their countenances,  

04:08:53.418 --> 04:08:56.488
expressed joy, the cause of  
which I did not comprehend. 

04:08:58.146 --> 04:08:59.788
Presently I found, by the  
frequent recurrence of some  

04:08:59.789 --> 04:09:01.789
sound which the stranger  
repeated after them, that she  

04:09:05.294 --> 04:09:07.294
was endeavouring to learn their 

04:09:08.307 --> 04:09:10.029
language; and the idea instantly
occurred to me that I should  

04:09:10.030 --> 04:09:12.030
make use of the same  
instructions to the same end.

04:09:14.206 --> 04:09:17.274
The stranger learned about  
twenty words at the first  

04:09:17.275 --> 04:09:20.119
lesson; most of them, indeed,  
were those which I had before  

04:09:21.150 --> 04:09:23.150
understood, but I profited by  
the others.

04:09:28.090 --> 04:09:30.090
As night came on, Agatha and the
Arabian retired early. 

04:09:30.589 --> 04:09:33.584
When they separated Felix kissed
the hand of the stranger and  

04:09:34.457 --> 04:09:36.905
said, ‘Good night sweet Safie. 
' He sat up much longer,  

04:09:36.906 --> 04:09:40.041
conversing with his father, and 
by the frequent repetition of  

04:09:40.042 --> 04:09:42.060
her name I conjectured that  
their lovely guest was the  

04:09:42.061 --> 04:09:46.419
subject of their conversation. 
I ardently desired to understand

04:09:46.420 --> 04:09:49.704
them, and bent every faculty  
towards that purpose, but found 

04:09:49.705 --> 04:09:51.705
it utterly impossible.

04:09:57.476 --> 04:09:58.502
The next morning Felix went out 
to his work, and after the usual

04:09:58.503 --> 04:10:00.503
occupations of Agatha were  
finished, the Arabian sat 

04:10:03.251 --> 04:10:05.713
at the feet of the old man, and 
taking  his guitar, played some 

04:10:05.714 --> 04:10:10.413
airs so  entrancingly beautiful 
that they at once drew tears of 

04:10:10.414 --> 04:10:15.366
sorrow and delight from my eyes.
She sang, and her voice flowed  

04:10:15.367 --> 04:10:19.227
in a rich cadence, swelling or  
dying away like a nightingale of

04:10:19.228 --> 04:10:24.393
the woods. 
When she had finished, she gave 

04:10:24.394 --> 04:10:28.100
the guitar to Agatha, who at  
first declined it. 

04:10:29.320 --> 04:10:31.559
She played a simple air, and her
voice accompanied it in sweet  

04:10:31.560 --> 04:10:35.852
accents, but unlike the wondrous
strain of the stranger. 

04:10:37.293 --> 04:10:40.285
The old man appeared enraptured 
and said some words which Agatha

04:10:44.254 --> 04:10:45.284
endeavoured to explain to Safie,
and by which he appeared to wish

04:10:45.285 --> 04:10:47.932
to express that she bestowed on 
him the greatest delight by her 

04:10:47.933 --> 04:10:51.018
music. 
The days now passed as peaceably

04:10:51.019 --> 04:10:53.701
as before, with the  sole 
alteration that 

04:10:57.400 --> 04:11:01.333
joy had  taken place of sadness 
in the  countenances of my 

04:10:57.400 --> 04:10:59.400
friends.

04:11:03.759 --> 04:11:05.761
Safie was always gay and happy; 
she and I improved rapidly in  

04:11:05.762 --> 04:11:09.222
the knowledge of language, so  
that in two months I began to  

04:11:09.223 --> 04:11:11.223
comprehend most of the words  
uttered by my protectors.

04:11:17.407 --> 04:11:18.446
In the meanwhile also the black 
ground was covered with herbage,

04:11:18.447 --> 04:11:21.734
and the green banks interspersed
with innumerable flowers, sweet 

04:11:21.735 --> 04:11:23.735
to the scent and the 

04:11:25.220 --> 04:11:26.809
eyes, stars of pale radiance 
among the  moonlight woods; the 

04:11:26.810 --> 04:11:29.763
sun became  warmer, the nights 
clear and  balmy; and my 

04:11:31.846 --> 04:11:33.733
nocturnal rambles  were an 
extreme pleasure to me,  

04:11:33.734 --> 04:11:37.247
although they were considerably 
shortened by the late setting  

04:11:37.248 --> 04:11:39.248
and early rising of the sun, 

04:11:41.940 --> 04:11:43.577
for I never ventured abroad 
during  daylight, fearful of 

04:11:43.578 --> 04:11:46.519
meeting  with the same treatment
I had  formerly endured in the 

04:11:46.520 --> 04:11:48.520
first  village which I entered.

04:12:10.646 --> 04:12:12.646
&gt;&gt; We'll now take a short 
15-minute break.  Thank you.

04:30:45.832 --> 04:30:49.378
My days were spent in close  
attention, that I might more  

04:30:49.379 --> 04:30:52.486
speedily master the language;  
and I may boast that I improved 

04:30:52.487 --> 04:30:55.184
more rapidly than the Arabian,  
who understood very little and  

04:30:57.647 --> 04:30:59.270
conversed in broken accents,  
whilst I comprehended and could 

04:30:59.271 --> 04:31:02.357
imitate almost every word that  
was spoken. 

04:31:05.441 --> 04:31:06.481
While I improved in speech, I 
also learned the science of  

04:31:06.482 --> 04:31:10.168
letters as it was taught to the 
stranger, and this opened before

04:31:10.169 --> 04:31:12.836
me a wide field for wonder and  
delight. 

04:31:14.695 --> 04:31:15.931
The book from which Felix 
instructed Safie was  

04:31:15.932 --> 04:31:19.604
Volney'sRuins of Empires. 
I should not have understood the

04:31:19.605 --> 04:31:22.707
purport of this book had not  
Felix, in reading it, given very

04:31:22.708 --> 04:31:27.177
minute explanations. 
He had chosen this work, he  

04:31:27.178 --> 04:31:30.723
said, because the declamatory  
style was framed in imitation of

04:31:30.724 --> 04:31:35.412
the Eastern authors. 
Through this work I obtained a  

04:31:35.413 --> 04:31:39.661
cursory knowledge of history and
a view of the several empires at

04:31:39.662 --> 04:31:43.997
present existing in the world;  
it gave me an insight into the  

04:31:43.998 --> 04:31:45.012
manners, governments, and  
religions of the different  

04:31:45.013 --> 04:31:48.526
nations of the earth. 
I heard of the slothful  

04:31:48.527 --> 04:31:52.818
Asiatics, of the stupendous  
genius and mental activity of  

04:31:52.819 --> 04:31:54.819
the Grecians, of the wars 

04:31:56.201 --> 04:31:58.441
and  wonderful virtue of the 
early  Romans—of their 

04:31:58.442 --> 04:32:02.099
subsequent  degenerating—of the 
decline of  that mighty empire, 

04:32:02.100 --> 04:32:04.100
of chivalry, Christianity, and 
kings. 

04:32:04.948 --> 04:32:06.577
I heard of the discovery of the 
American hemisphere and wept  

04:32:06.578 --> 04:32:11.997
with Safie over the hapless fate
of its original inhabitants. 

04:32:16.276 --> 04:32:18.326
These wonderful narrations  
inspired me with strange  

04:32:18.327 --> 04:32:20.560
feelings. 
Was man, indeed, at once so  

04:32:20.561 --> 04:32:22.799
powerful, so virtuous and  
magnificent, yet so vicious and 

04:32:22.800 --> 04:32:26.880
base? 
He appeared at one time a mere  

04:32:26.881 --> 04:32:30.975
scion of the evil principle and 
at another as all that can be  

04:32:30.976 --> 04:32:35.428
conceived of noble and godlike. 
To be a great and virtuous man  

04:32:35.429 --> 04:32:38.917
appeared the highest honour that
can befall a sensitive being; to

04:32:38.918 --> 04:32:41.169
be base and vicious, as many on 
record have been, appeared 

04:32:46.063 --> 04:32:47.690
the  lowest degradation, a 
condition  more abject than that

04:32:47.691 --> 04:32:50.365
of the  blind mole or harmless 
worm. 

04:32:52.227 --> 04:32:54.064
For a long time I could not  
conceive how one man could go  

04:32:54.065 --> 04:32:56.065
forth to murder his fellow, or  
even why there were laws 

04:32:59.310 --> 04:33:01.948
and  governments; but when I 
heard  details of vice and 

04:33:01.949 --> 04:33:03.173
bloodshed,  my wonder ceased and
I turned  away with disgust and 

04:33:03.174 --> 04:33:05.174
loathing.

04:33:08.891 --> 04:33:11.714
Every conversation of the 
cottagers now opened new wonders

04:33:11.715 --> 04:33:14.023
to me. 
While I listened to the  

04:33:14.024 --> 04:33:17.683
instructions which Felix  
bestowed upon the Arabian, the  

04:33:17.684 --> 04:33:19.684
strange system of human society 
was explained to me. 

04:33:21.183 --> 04:33:23.046
I heard of the division of  
property, of immense wealth and 

04:33:23.047 --> 04:33:27.531
squalid poverty, of rank,  
descent, and noble blood. 

04:33:34.671 --> 04:33:34.690
The words induced me in turn 
towards myself. 

04:33:34.691 --> 04:33:35.729
I learned that the possessions  
most esteemed by your fellow  

04:33:35.730 --> 04:33:36.553
creatures were high and  
unsullied descent united with  

04:33:36.554 --> 04:33:39.191
riches. 
A man might be respected with  

04:33:39.192 --> 04:33:42.243
only one of these advantages,  
but without either he was  

04:33:42.244 --> 04:33:44.244
considered, except in very rare 

04:33:46.611 --> 04:33:47.844
instances, as a vagabond and a  
slave, doomed to waste his  

04:33:47.845 --> 04:33:50.434
powers for the profits of the  
chosen few! 

04:33:50.635 --> 04:33:52.635
And what was I?

04:33:55.806 --> 04:33:59.896
Of my creation and creator I was
absolutely ignorant, but I knew 

04:33:59.897 --> 04:34:03.357
that I possessed no money, no  
friends, no kind of property. 

04:34:03.358 --> 04:34:07.810
I was, besides, endued with a  
figure hideously deformed and  

04:34:07.811 --> 04:34:11.069
loathsome; I was not even of the
same nature as man. 

04:34:12.778 --> 04:34:14.213
I was more agile than they and  
could subsist upon coarser diet;

04:34:14.214 --> 04:34:17.861
I bore the extremes of heat and 
cold with less injury to my  

04:34:17.862 --> 04:34:20.673
frame; my stature far exceeded  
theirs. 

04:34:22.712 --> 04:34:24.712
When I looked around I saw and  
heard of none like me.

04:34:30.636 --> 04:34:32.793
Was I, then, a monster, a blot  
upon the earth, from which all  

04:34:32.794 --> 04:34:36.910
men fled and whom all men  
disowned? 

04:34:39.222 --> 04:34:41.222
I cannot describe to you the 
agony that 

04:34:42.229 --> 04:34:44.599
these reflections  inflicted 
upon me; I tried to  dispel 

04:34:46.241 --> 04:34:48.718
them, but sorrow only  increased
with knowledge. 

04:34:51.718 --> 04:34:52.843
Oh, that I had for ever remained
in my native wood, nor known nor

04:34:52.844 --> 04:34:54.844
felt beyond the sensations of  
hunger, thirst, and heat!

04:34:57.970 --> 04:35:01.728
Of what a strange nature is 
knowledge! 

04:35:02.958 --> 04:35:03.972
It clings to the mind when it  
has once seized on it like a  

04:35:03.973 --> 04:35:06.219
lichen on the rock. 
I wished sometimes to shake off 

04:35:06.220 --> 04:35:08.475
all thought and feeling, but I  
learned that there was but one  

04:35:08.476 --> 04:35:10.476
means to overcome the 

04:35:11.479 --> 04:35:13.479
sensation  

04:35:14.658 --> 04:35:15.439
Of pain and that was death -- a 
state which I feared yet did not

04:35:15.440 --> 04:35:18.688
understand. 
I admired virtue and good  

04:35:18.689 --> 04:35:21.747
feelings and loved the gentle  
manners and amiable qualities of

04:35:21.748 --> 04:35:24.222
my cottagers, but I was shut out
from intercourse with them,  

04:35:27.084 --> 04:35:29.121
except through means which I  
obtained by stealth, when I was 

04:35:29.122 --> 04:35:32.367
unseen and unknown, and which  
rather increased than satisfied 

04:35:32.368 --> 04:35:34.368
the desire I had of 

04:35:35.437 --> 04:35:39.242
becoming one Of my fellows.  
The gentle words of Agatha and  

04:35:39.243 --> 04:35:41.509
the animated smiles of the  
charming Arabian were not for  

04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:43.510
me.

04:35:44.630 --> 04:35:48.829
The mild exhortations of the old
man and the lively conversation 

04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:51.480
of the loved Felix were not for 
me. 

04:35:51.481 --> 04:35:53.481
Miserable, unhappy wretch!

04:35:54.806 --> 04:35:58.146
Other lessons were impressed 
upon me even more deeply. 

04:36:00.250 --> 04:36:01.259
I heard of the difference of  
sexes, and the birth and growth 

04:36:01.260 --> 04:36:03.979
of children, how the father  
doted on the smiles of the  

04:36:06.207 --> 04:36:07.263
infant, and the lively sallies  
of the older child, how all the 

04:36:07.264 --> 04:36:10.922
life and cares of the mother  
were wrapped up in the precious 

04:36:10.923 --> 04:36:12.923
charge, how the mind of youth  

04:36:14.837 --> 04:36:16.262
expanded and gained knowledge,  
of brother, sister, and all the 

04:36:16.263 --> 04:36:18.942
various relationships which bind
one human being to another in  

04:36:18.943 --> 04:36:20.943
mutual bonds.

04:36:22.058 --> 04:36:27.695
Where were my friends relations?
No father had watched my infant 

04:36:27.696 --> 04:36:31.755
days, no mother had blessed me  
with smiles and caresses; or if 

04:36:31.756 --> 04:36:36.540
they had, all my past life was  
now a blot, a blind vacancy in  

04:36:36.541 --> 04:36:38.541
which I distinguished nothing.

04:36:43.068 --> 04:36:44.195
From my earliest remembrance I  
had been as I then was in height

04:36:44.196 --> 04:36:47.454
and proportion. 
I had never yet seen a being  

04:36:47.455 --> 04:36:52.262
resembling me or who claimed any
intercourse with me. 

04:36:52.263 --> 04:36:54.307
What was I? 

04:36:57.511 --> 04:37:00.575
The question again recurred, to 
be answered only with groans. 

04:37:00.576 --> 04:37:03.057
I will soon explain to what 
these feelings tended, but allow

04:37:03.058 --> 04:37:07.120
me now to return to the  
cottagers, whose story excited  

04:37:07.121 --> 04:37:09.121
in me such various feelings of  

04:37:10.407 --> 04:37:12.228
indignation, delight, and  
wonder, but which all terminated

04:37:12.229 --> 04:37:14.229
in additional love 

04:37:19.362 --> 04:37:21.362
and reverence For my protectors"
for so 

04:37:23.955 --> 04:37:24.992
I loved in a innocent half 
painful, half deceit to call 

04:37:24.993 --> 04:37:26.993
them."

04:37:42.620 --> 04:37:43.880
Chapter 6. 
Some time elapsed before I  

04:37:43.881 --> 04:37:45.881
learned the 

04:37:47.015 --> 04:37:47.513
history of my  friends. 
It was one which could not fail 

04:37:47.514 --> 04:37:51.269
to impress itself deeply on my  
mind, unfolding as it did a  

04:37:51.270 --> 04:37:54.135
number of circumstances, each  
interesting and wonderful to one

04:37:54.136 --> 04:37:58.016
so utterly inexperienced as I  
was. 

04:38:01.542 --> 04:38:03.542
The name of the old man was De 
Lacey. 

04:38:03.856 --> 04:38:05.065
He was descended from a good  
family in France, where he had  

04:38:05.066 --> 04:38:07.066
lived for many 

04:38:09.037 --> 04:38:10.042
years in  affluence, respected 
by his  superiors and beloved by

04:38:10.043 --> 04:38:14.330
his  equals. 
His son was bred in the service 

04:38:14.331 --> 04:38:18.728
of his country, and Agatha had  
ranked with ladies of the  

04:38:18.729 --> 04:38:22.417
highest distinction. 
A few months before my arrival  

04:38:22.418 --> 04:38:25.889
they had lived in a large and  
luxurious city called Paris,  

04:38:25.890 --> 04:38:27.890
surrounded by friends and 

04:38:30.583 --> 04:38:33.078
possessed of every enjoyment  
which virtue, refinement of  

04:38:33.079 --> 04:38:36.042
intellect, or taste, accompanied
by a moderate fortune, could  

04:38:36.043 --> 04:38:41.461
afford. 
The father of Safie had been the

04:38:41.462 --> 04:38:44.091
cause of their ruin. 
He was a Turkish merchant and  

04:38:44.092 --> 04:38:48.339
had inhabited Paris for many  
years, when, for some reason  

04:38:48.340 --> 04:38:50.384
which I could not learn, he  
became obnoxious to the  

04:38:50.385 --> 04:38:52.385
government.

04:38:53.493 --> 04:38:56.359
He was seized and cast into  
prison the very day that Safie  

04:38:56.360 --> 04:38:58.360
arrived from Constantinople to  
join him.

04:39:02.339 --> 04:39:04.339
He was tried and condemned to  
death. 

04:39:05.412 --> 04:39:07.435
The injustice of his sentence  
was very flagrant; all Paris was

04:39:07.436 --> 04:39:09.436
indignant; and it was judged  
that his religion and 

04:39:12.794 --> 04:39:14.011
wealth  rather than the crime 
alleged  against him had been 

04:39:14.012 --> 04:39:16.012
the cause  of his condemnation.

04:39:17.840 --> 04:39:21.946
Felix had been present at the 
trial; his horror and 

04:39:21.947 --> 04:39:23.377
indignation were  uncontrollable
when he heard the decision of 

04:39:23.378 --> 04:39:27.102
the court. 
He made, at that moment, a  

04:39:27.103 --> 04:39:30.805
solemn vow to deliver him and  
then looked around for the  

04:39:30.806 --> 04:39:33.678
means. 
After many fruitless attempts to

04:39:33.679 --> 04:39:36.951
gain admittance to the prison,  
he found a strongly grated  

04:39:36.952 --> 04:39:38.952
window in an unguarded part of  
the building, which lighted the 

04:39:42.893 --> 04:39:44.540
dungeon of the unfortunate  
Muhammadan, who, loaded with  

04:39:44.541 --> 04:39:46.541
chains, waited in despair the  
execution of the barbarous  

04:39:47.000 --> 04:39:49.000
sentence.

04:39:50.129 --> 04:39:53.388
Felix visited the grate at night
and made known to the prisoner  

04:39:53.389 --> 04:39:58.512
his intentions in his favour. 
The Turk, amazed and delighted, 

04:40:00.543 --> 04:40:02.175
endeavoured to kindle the zeal  
of his deliverer by promises of 

04:40:02.176 --> 04:40:04.176
reward and wealth.

04:40:05.870 --> 04:40:10.162
Felix rejected his offers with  
contempt, yet when he saw the  

04:40:10.163 --> 04:40:13.738
lovely Safie, who was allowed to
visit her father and who by her 

04:40:13.739 --> 04:40:17.817
gestures expressed her lively  
gratitude, the youth could not  

04:40:17.818 --> 04:40:22.554
help owning to his own mind that
the captive possessed a treasure

04:40:22.555 --> 04:40:24.555
which would fully reward his  
toil and hazard.

04:40:27.442 --> 04:40:30.312
The Turk quickly perceived the  
impression that his daughter had

04:40:30.313 --> 04:40:32.751
made on the heart of Felix and  
endeavoured to secure him more  

04:40:32.752 --> 04:40:35.619
entirely in his interests by the
promise of her hand in marriage 

04:40:35.620 --> 04:40:37.620
so soon as he should be conveyed
to a place of safety.

04:40:39.693 --> 04:40:44.036
Felix was too delicate to accept
this offer, yet he looked  

04:40:44.037 --> 04:40:47.307
forward to the probability of  
the event as to the consummation

04:40:47.308 --> 04:40:52.438
of his happiness. 
During the ensuing days, when 

04:40:52.439 --> 04:40:55.713
the preparations were going  
forward for the escape of the  

04:40:55.714 --> 04:41:00.654
merchant, the zeal of Felix was 
warmed by several letters that  

04:41:00.655 --> 04:41:02.065
he received from this lovely  
girl, who found means to express

04:41:02.066 --> 04:41:06.542
her thoughts in the language of 
her lover by the aid of an old  

04:41:06.543 --> 04:41:09.817
man, a servant of her father who
understood French. 

04:41:10.856 --> 04:41:12.856
She thanked him in the most  
ardent 

04:41:13.873 --> 04:41:16.574
terms for his intended  Services
towards her father, and at the 

04:41:17.406 --> 04:41:19.406
same time she gently  deplored 
her own fate. 

04:41:20.462 --> 04:41:22.933
I have copies of these letters, 
for I found means, during my  

04:41:22.934 --> 04:41:25.780
residence in the hovel, to  
procure the implements of  

04:41:27.011 --> 04:41:27.844
writing; and the letters were  
often in the hands of Felix or  

04:41:27.845 --> 04:41:32.752
Agatha. 
Before I depart I will give them

04:41:32.753 --> 04:41:35.042
to you; they will prove the  
truth of my tale; 

04:41:39.529 --> 04:41:40.787
but at  present, as the sun is 
already  far declined, I shall 

04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:42.788
only have  time to repeat the 
substance of  them to you.

04:41:46.941 --> 04:41:49.633
Safie related that her mother  
was a Christian Arab, seized and

04:41:49.634 --> 04:41:52.941
made a slave by the Turks;  
recommended by her beauty, she  

04:41:52.942 --> 04:41:54.942
had won the heart of the father 
of Safie, who married her.

04:41:57.847 --> 04:42:00.953
The young girl spoke in high and
enthusiastic terms of her  

04:42:00.954 --> 04:42:04.242
mother, who, born in freedom,  
spurned the bondage to which she

04:42:04.243 --> 04:42:07.325
was now reduced. 
She instructed her daughter in  

04:42:07.326 --> 04:42:11.828
the tenets of her religion and  
taught her to aspire to higher  

04:42:11.829 --> 04:42:14.101
powers of intellect and an  
independence of spirit forbidden

04:42:15.751 --> 04:42:17.751
to the female followers of  
Muhammad.

04:42:18.864 --> 04:42:22.138
This lady died, but her lessons 
were indelibly impressed on the 

04:42:22.139 --> 04:42:27.039
mind of Safie, who sickened at  
the prospect of again returning 

04:42:27.040 --> 04:42:29.278
to Asia and being immured within
the walls of a harem, 

04:42:33.193 --> 04:42:35.258
allowed  only to occupy herself 
with  infantile amusements, 

04:42:35.259 --> 04:42:38.524
ill-suited to the temper of her 
soul, now  accustomed to grand 

04:42:38.525 --> 04:42:40.525
ideas and a  noble emulation for
virtue.

04:42:42.219 --> 04:42:44.862
The prospect of marrying a  
Christian and remaining in a  

04:42:44.863 --> 04:42:47.118
country where women were allowed
to take a rank in society was  

04:42:47.119 --> 04:42:49.119
enchanting to her.

04:42:51.260 --> 04:42:54.316
The day for the execution of the
Turk was fixed, but on the  

04:42:54.317 --> 04:42:59.204
night previous to it he quitted 
his prison and before morning  

04:42:59.205 --> 04:43:01.465
was distant many leagues from  
Paris. 

04:43:03.295 --> 04:43:04.106
Felix had procured passports in 
the name of his father, sister, 

04:43:04.107 --> 04:43:08.006
and himself. 
He had previously communicated  

04:43:08.007 --> 04:43:11.482
his plan to the former, who  
aided the deceit by quitting his

04:43:11.483 --> 04:43:13.483
house, under the pretence 

04:43:15.165 --> 04:43:16.622
of a  journey and concealed 
himself,  with his daughter, in 

04:43:16.623 --> 04:43:18.623
an obscure part of Paris.

04:43:23.158 --> 04:43:26.623
Felix conducted the fugitives 
through France to Lyons and  

04:43:26.624 --> 04:43:29.703
across Mont Cenis to Leghorn,  
where the merchant had decided  

04:43:29.704 --> 04:43:32.796
to wait a favourable opportunity
of passing into some part of the

04:43:32.797 --> 04:43:34.797
Turkish dominions.

04:43:38.358 --> 04:43:40.392
Safie resolved to remain with  
her father until the moment of  

04:43:40.393 --> 04:43:42.645
his departure, before which time
the Turk renewed his promise  

04:43:42.646 --> 04:43:47.357
that she should be united to his
deliverer; and Felix remained  

04:43:47.358 --> 04:43:49.358
with them in expectation of 

04:43:50.695 --> 04:43:52.136
that event; and in the meantime 
he  enjoyed the society of the  

04:43:52.137 --> 04:43:55.450
Arabian, who exhibited towards  
him the simplest and tenderest  

04:43:55.451 --> 04:43:59.851
affection. 
They conversed with one another 

04:43:59.852 --> 04:44:02.903
through the means of an  
interpreter, and sometimes with 

04:44:02.904 --> 04:44:04.904
the interpretation of looks; and
Safie sang to him the divine  

04:44:06.384 --> 04:44:11.846
airs of her native country. 
The Turk allowed this intimacy 

04:44:11.847 --> 04:44:14.905
to take place and encouraged the
hopes of the youthful lovers,  

04:44:14.906 --> 04:44:18.796
while in his heart he had formed
far other plans. 

04:44:20.636 --> 04:44:23.121
He loathed the idea that his  
daughter should be united to a  

04:44:23.122 --> 04:44:25.122
Christian, but he feared the  
resentment of Felix if he 

04:44:29.384 --> 04:44:30.797
should appear lukewarm, for he 
knew  that he was still in the 

04:44:30.798 --> 04:44:32.798
power  of his deliverer if he 
should  choose to betray 

04:44:35.119 --> 04:44:37.596
him to the  Italian state which 
they  inhabited. 

04:44:39.217 --> 04:44:41.074
He revolved a thousand plans by 
which he should be enabled to  

04:44:41.075 --> 04:44:43.105
prolong the deceit until it  
might be no longer 

04:44:46.896 --> 04:44:48.125
necessary,  and secretly to take
his  daughter with him when he  

04:44:48.126 --> 04:44:51.821
departed. 
His plans were facilitated by  

04:44:51.822 --> 04:44:54.511
the news which arrived from  
Paris. 

04:44:56.539 --> 04:44:58.383
The government of France were 
greatly enraged at the escape of

04:44:58.384 --> 04:45:00.633
their victim and spared no pains
to detect and punish his  

04:45:00.634 --> 04:45:05.766
deliverer. 
The plot of Felix was quickly  

04:45:06.784 --> 04:45:09.511
discovered, and De Lacey and  
Agatha were thrown into prison. 

04:45:09.512 --> 04:45:11.770
The news reached Felix and  
roused him from his dream of  

04:45:11.771 --> 04:45:16.840
pleasure. 
His blind and aged father and  

04:45:16.841 --> 04:45:19.132
his gentle sister lay in a  
noisome dungeon while he enjoyed

04:45:19.133 --> 04:45:21.133
the free air and the society of 
her whom he loved.

04:45:23.677 --> 04:45:27.773
This idea was torture to him. 
He quickly arranged with the  

04:45:27.774 --> 04:45:31.308
Turk that if the latter should  
find a favourable opportunity  

04:45:31.309 --> 04:45:33.309
for escape before Felix 

04:45:34.313 --> 04:45:39.504
could  return to Italy, Safie 
should  remain as a boarder at a

04:45:39.505 --> 04:45:41.505
convent at Leghorn; and then, 
quitting  the lovely Arabian, he

04:45:42.816 --> 04:45:44.816
hastened  to Paris and delivered
himself 

04:45:47.702 --> 04:45:49.533
up to the vengeance of the law, 
hoping to free De Lacey and  

04:45:49.534 --> 04:45:54.634
Agatha by this proceeding. 
He did not succeed.  

04:45:56.100 --> 04:45:58.147
They remained confined for five 
months before the trial took  

04:45:58.148 --> 04:46:00.148
place, the result of which  
deprived them of their fortune 

04:46:05.863 --> 04:46:09.396
and condemned them to a  
perpetual exile from their  

04:46:05.863 --> 04:46:09.186
native country. 
They found a miserable asylum in

04:46:09.187 --> 04:46:11.227
the cottage in Germany, where I 
discovered them. 

04:46:12.907 --> 04:46:14.941
Felix soon learned that the  
treacherous Turk, for whom he  

04:46:14.942 --> 04:46:17.191
and his family endured such  
unheard-of oppression, on  

04:46:20.851 --> 04:46:22.911
discovering that his deliverer  
was thus reduced to poverty and 

04:46:22.912 --> 04:46:24.912
ruin, became a traitor to good  
feeling and honour and 

04:46:28.287 --> 04:46:31.211
had  quitted Italy with his 
daughter, insultingly sending 

04:46:31.212 --> 04:46:33.283
Felix a  pittance of money to 
aid him, as he said, in some 

04:46:34.721 --> 04:46:36.721
plan of future  maintenance.

04:46:37.844 --> 04:46:41.146
Such were the events that preyed
on the heart of Felix and 

04:46:41.147 --> 04:46:44.633
rendered him, when I first saw  
him, the most miserable of his  

04:46:44.634 --> 04:46:49.333
family. 
He could have endured poverty,  

04:46:49.334 --> 04:46:51.597
and while this distress had been
the meed of 

04:46:55.705 --> 04:46:57.544
his virtue, he  gloried in it; 
but the  ingratitude of the Turk

04:46:57.545 --> 04:47:00.021
and the  loss of his beloved 
Safie were  misfortunes more 

04:47:01.347 --> 04:47:06.858
bitter and  irreparable. 
The arrival of the Arabian now  

04:47:06.859 --> 04:47:08.859
infused new life into his soul. 

04:47:12.179 --> 04:47:13.398
When the news reached Leghorn 
that Felix was deprived of his  

04:47:13.399 --> 04:47:18.509
wealth and rank, the merchant  
commanded his daughter to think 

04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:19.738
no more of her lover, but to  
prepare to return to her native 

04:47:19.739 --> 04:47:23.873
country. 
The generous nature of Safie was

04:47:26.717 --> 04:47:27.936
outraged by this command; she  
attempted to expostulate with  

04:47:27.937 --> 04:47:29.937
her father, but he 

04:47:31.262 --> 04:47:33.721
left her  angrily, reiterating 
his  tyrannical mandate. 

04:47:36.597 --> 04:47:37.623
A few days later, the Turk 
entered his daughter's apartment

04:47:37.624 --> 04:47:41.105
and told her hastily that he had
reason to believe that his  

04:47:41.106 --> 04:47:43.106
residence at Leghorn had been  

04:47:45.806 --> 04:47:48.275
divulged and that he should  
speedily be delivered up to the 

04:47:48.276 --> 04:47:51.164
French government; he had  
consequently hired a vessel to  

04:47:53.406 --> 04:47:54.229
convey him to Constantinople,  
for which city he should sail in

04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:58.121
a few hours. 
He intended to leave his  

04:47:58.122 --> 04:48:01.795
daughter under the care of a  
confidential servant, to follow 

04:48:01.796 --> 04:48:03.796
at her leisure with the greater 

04:48:05.107 --> 04:48:07.878
part of his property, which had 
not yet arrived at Leghorn. 

04:48:10.736 --> 04:48:11.953
When alone, Safie resolved in 
her own mind the plan of conduct

04:48:11.954 --> 04:48:15.072
that it would become her to  
pursue in this emergency. 

04:48:17.709 --> 04:48:19.364
A residence in Turkey was  
abhorrent to her; her religion  

04:48:19.365 --> 04:48:21.852
and her feelings were alike  
averse to it. 

04:48:23.707 --> 04:48:25.355
By some papers of her father  
which fell into her hands she  

04:48:25.356 --> 04:48:29.020
heard of the exile of her lover 
and learnt the name of the spot 

04:48:29.021 --> 04:48:31.021
where he then resided.

04:48:33.544 --> 04:48:35.988
She hesitated some time, but at 
length she formed her  

04:48:35.989 --> 04:48:39.076
determination. 
Taking with her some jewels that

04:48:41.112 --> 04:48:43.337
belonged to her and a sum of  
money, she quitted Italy with an

04:48:43.338 --> 04:48:47.467
attendant, a native of Leghorn, 
but who understood the common  

04:48:47.468 --> 04:48:50.568
language of Turkey, and departed
for Germany. 

04:48:53.020 --> 04:48:54.646
She arrived in safety at a town 
about twenty leagues from the  

04:48:54.647 --> 04:48:58.117
cottage of De Lacey, when her  
attendant fell dangerously ill. 

04:49:01.323 --> 04:49:03.323
Safie nursed her with the most  

04:49:04.448 --> 04:49:07.092
devoted affection, but the poor 
girl died, and the Arabian was  

04:49:07.093 --> 04:49:10.134
left alone, unacquainted with  
the language of the country and 

04:49:10.135 --> 04:49:13.628
utterly ignorant of the customs 
of the world. 

04:49:15.331 --> 04:49:17.331
She fell, however, into good  
hands. 

04:49:18.180 --> 04:49:20.181
The Italian had mentioned the  
name of the spot for which they 

04:49:20.182 --> 04:49:23.863
were bound, and after her death 
the woman of the house in which 

04:49:23.864 --> 04:49:25.864
they had lived took care that  

04:49:28.302 --> 04:49:30.302
Safie should arrive in safety at
the cottage of her lover.

04:49:32.558 --> 04:49:36.045
Chapter 7.  Such was the history
of my beloved cottagers. 

04:49:36.256 --> 04:49:38.256
It impressed me deeply.

04:49:39.733 --> 04:49:42.981
I learned, from the views of  
social life which it developed, 

04:49:42.982 --> 04:49:47.893
to admire their virtues and to  
deprecate the vices of mankind. 

04:49:47.894 --> 04:49:51.958
As yet I looked upon crime as a 
distant evil, benevolence and  

04:49:51.959 --> 04:49:54.003
generosity were ever present  
before me, inciting within 

04:49:57.265 --> 04:49:58.885
me a  desire to become an actor 
in the busy scene where so many 

04:49:58.886 --> 04:50:00.886
admirable qualities were called 
forth and displayed.

04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:08.830
But in giving an account of the 

04:50:10.341 --> 04:50:11.766
progress of my intellect, I must
not omit a circumstance which  

04:50:11.767 --> 04:50:14.417
occurred in the beginning of the
month of August of the same  

04:50:14.418 --> 04:50:18.534
year. 
One night during my accustomed 

04:50:18.535 --> 04:50:21.184
visit to the neighbouring wood  
where I collected my own food  

04:50:21.185 --> 04:50:23.185
and brought home firing for 

04:50:26.867 --> 04:50:27.865
my  protectors, I found on the  
ground a leathern portmanteau  

04:50:27.866 --> 04:50:29.866
containing several articles of  
dress and some books.

04:50:31.733 --> 04:50:33.762
I eagerly seized the prize and  
returned with it to my hovel.

04:50:36.875 --> 04:50:39.948
Fortunately the books were  
written in the language, the  

04:50:39.949 --> 04:50:41.949
elements of which I had acquired
at the cottage; they 

04:50:44.380 --> 04:50:46.380
consisted  

04:50:51.018 --> 04:50:51.830
of Paradise Lost, a volume  
ofPlutarch's Lives, and  

04:50:51.831 --> 04:50:54.484
theSorrows of Werter. 
The possession of these  

04:50:54.485 --> 04:50:56.753
treasures gave me extreme  
delight; I now continually  

04:50:58.796 --> 04:51:01.066
studied and exercised my mind  
upon these histories, whilst my 

04:51:01.067 --> 04:51:05.378
friends were employed in their  
ordinary occupations. 

04:51:07.023 --> 04:51:09.023
I can hardly describe to you the
effect of these books.

04:51:10.137 --> 04:51:13.877
They produced in me an infinity 
of new images and feelings, that

04:51:13.878 --> 04:51:19.340
sometimes raised me to ecstasy, 
but more frequently sunk me into

04:51:19.341 --> 04:51:23.609
the lowest dejection. 
In theSorrows of Werter, besides

04:51:23.610 --> 04:51:27.934
the interest of its simple and  
affecting story, so many  

04:51:27.935 --> 04:51:30.194
opinions are canvassed and so  
many lights thrown upon what had

04:51:35.651 --> 04:51:37.766
hitherto been to me obscure  
subjects that I found in it a  

04:51:38.796 --> 04:51:41.790
never-ending source of  
speculation and astonishment. 

04:51:41.897 --> 04:51:46.849
The gentle and domestic manners 
it described, combined with  

04:51:46.850 --> 04:51:50.376
lofty sentiments and feelings,  
which had for their object  

04:51:50.377 --> 04:51:52.377
something out of self, accorded 
well with my experience among 

04:51:56.900 --> 04:51:58.128
my protectors and with the wants
which were for ever alive in my 

04:51:58.129 --> 04:52:02.815
own bosom. 
But I thought Werter himself a  

04:52:02.816 --> 04:52:05.279
more divine being than I had  
ever beheld or 

04:52:08.354 --> 04:52:12.154
imagined; his  character 
contained no  pretension, but it

04:52:08.354 --> 04:52:10.354
sank deep.

04:52:12.184 --> 04:52:14.834
The disquisitions upon death and
suicide were calculated to fill 

04:52:14.835 --> 04:52:16.835
me with wonder.

04:52:17.942 --> 04:52:21.828
I did not pretend to enter into 
the merits of the case, yet I  

04:52:21.829 --> 04:52:23.829
inclined 

04:52:25.838 --> 04:52:27.852
towards the opinions of the 
hero, whose extinction I  wept, 

04:52:27.853 --> 04:52:30.285
without precisely  understanding
it. 

04:52:32.975 --> 04:52:34.395
As I read, however, I applied 
much personally to my own  

04:52:34.396 --> 04:52:36.396
feelings and condition.

04:52:38.301 --> 04:52:40.301
I found myself similar yet at  
the same 

04:52:42.960 --> 04:52:45.084
time strangely unlike  to the 
beings concerning whom I  read 

04:52:46.297 --> 04:52:48.382
and to whose conversation I was 
a listener. 

04:52:51.050 --> 04:52:53.906
I sympathised with and partly  
understood them, but I was  

04:52:53.907 --> 04:52:58.877
unformed in mind; I was  
dependent on none and related to

04:52:58.878 --> 04:53:00.878
none. 

04:53:04.942 --> 04:53:05.966
The path of my departure was 
free, and there was none to 

04:53:05.967 --> 04:53:09.262
lament my annihilation. 
My person was hideous and my  

04:53:09.263 --> 04:53:13.129
stature gigantic. 
What did this mean? 

04:53:13.130 --> 04:53:16.370
Who was I? 
What was I? 

04:53:16.371 --> 04:53:21.307
Whence did I come? 
What was my destination? 

04:53:23.138 --> 04:53:24.580
These questions continually  
recurred, but I was unable to  

04:53:24.581 --> 04:53:26.581
solve them.

04:53:30.619 --> 04:53:32.244
The volume ofPlutarch's  Lives 
which I possessed  contained the

04:53:32.245 --> 04:53:36.344
histories of the  first founders
of the ancient  republics. 

04:53:37.779 --> 04:53:38.885
This book had a far different  
effect upon me from theSorrows  

04:53:38.886 --> 04:53:41.759
of Werter. 
I learned from Werter's  

04:53:41.760 --> 04:53:43.760
imaginations 

04:53:44.773 --> 04:53:47.684
despondency and  gloom, but 
Plutarch taught me  high 

04:53:49.721 --> 04:53:51.721
thoughts; he elevated me  above 
the 

04:53:52.737 --> 04:53:54.890
wretched sphere of my  own 
reflections, to admire and  love

04:53:54.891 --> 04:53:56.891
the heroes of past ages.

04:54:00.340 --> 04:54:01.780
Many things I read surpassed my 
understanding and experience. 

04:54:01.781 --> 04:54:03.781
I had a very confused knowledge 
of 

04:54:06.233 --> 04:54:07.993
kingdoms, wide extents of  
country, mighty rivers, and  

04:54:07.994 --> 04:54:11.644
boundless seas. 
But I was perfectly unacquainted

04:54:11.645 --> 04:54:13.645
with towns and large assemblages
of men.

04:54:19.609 --> 04:54:22.311
The cottage of my protectors had
been the only school in which I 

04:54:22.312 --> 04:54:24.818
had studied human nature, but  
this book developed new and  

04:54:24.819 --> 04:54:28.110
mightier scenes of action. 
I read of men concerned in  

04:54:28.111 --> 04:54:32.647
public affairs, governing or  
massacring their species. 

04:54:35.083 --> 04:54:37.083
I felt the greatest ardour for  
virtue 

04:54:38.092 --> 04:54:43.172
rise within me, and  abhorrence 
for vice, as far as I understood

04:54:43.173 --> 04:54:45.410
the signification of  those 
terms, relative as they  were, 

04:54:45.411 --> 04:54:49.496
as I applied them, to  pleasure 
and pain alone. 

04:54:51.755 --> 04:54:54.463
Induced by these feelings, I was
of course led to admire  

04:54:54.464 --> 04:54:56.732
peaceable lawgivers, Numa,  
Solon, and Lycurgus, 

04:54:59.958 --> 04:55:04.149
in  preference to Romulus and  
Theseus. 

04:55:06.602 --> 04:55:07.821
The patriarchal lives of my  
protectors caused these  

04:55:07.822 --> 04:55:09.822
impressions to take a firm 

04:55:10.833 --> 04:55:14.556
hold  on my mind; perhaps, if my
first introduction to humanity 

04:55:14.557 --> 04:55:19.042
had  been made by a young 
soldier,  burning for glory and 

04:55:19.043 --> 04:55:20.691
slaughter, I should have been 
imbued with  different 

04:55:20.692 --> 04:55:22.751
sensations. 

04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:29.744
But Paradise Lost excited 
different and far deeper  

04:55:29.745 --> 04:55:32.187
emotions. 
I read it, as I had read the  

04:55:32.188 --> 04:55:34.817
other volumes which had fallen  
into my hands, as a true  

04:55:34.818 --> 04:55:37.676
history. 
It moved every feeling of wonder

04:55:37.677 --> 04:55:40.550
and awe that the picture of an  
omnipotent God warring with his 

04:55:40.551 --> 04:55:42.551
creatures was capable 

04:55:43.561 --> 04:55:47.099
of  Having.  
I often referred the several  

04:55:49.802 --> 04:55:51.802
situations, as their similarity 
struck me, to my own.

04:55:57.786 --> 04:56:00.780
Like Adam I was created 
apparently united by no link to 

04:56:00.781 --> 04:56:03.751
any other  being in existence; 
but his  state was far different

04:56:03.752 --> 04:56:05.752
from  mine in every other 
respect.

04:56:07.025 --> 04:56:10.705
He had come forth from the hands
of God a perfect creature, happy

04:56:10.706 --> 04:56:14.804
and prosperous, guarded by the  
especial care of his Creator; he

04:56:14.805 --> 04:56:16.805
was allowed to converse with and
acquire knowledge from 

04:56:19.658 --> 04:56:21.962
beings of a superior nature, but
I was  wretched, helpless, and 

04:56:21.963 --> 04:56:23.963
alone.

04:56:25.501 --> 04:56:29.395
Many times I considered Satan as
the fitter emblem of my  

04:56:29.396 --> 04:56:33.510
condition, for often, like him, 
when I viewed the bliss of my  

04:56:33.511 --> 04:56:35.511
protectors, the bitter gall of  
envy rose within me.

04:56:46.283 --> 04:56:48.167
Another circumstance 
strengthened and confirmed these

04:56:48.168 --> 04:56:50.599
feelings. 
Soon after my arrival in the  

04:56:50.600 --> 04:56:54.055
hovel I discovered some papers  
in the pocket of the dress which

04:56:54.056 --> 04:56:56.056
I had taken from your  
laboratory. 

04:56:58.370 --> 04:57:00.197
At first I had neglected them,  
but now that I was able to  

04:57:00.198 --> 04:57:02.647
decipher the characters in which
they were written, I began to  

04:57:02.648 --> 04:57:04.648
study them with diligence.

04:57:06.352 --> 04:57:09.690
It was your journal of the four 
months that preceded my  

04:57:09.691 --> 04:57:12.760
creation. 
You minutely described in these 

04:57:12.761 --> 04:57:16.039
papers every step you took in  
the progress of your work; this 

04:57:16.040 --> 04:57:18.040
history was mingled 

04:57:23.846 --> 04:57:25.846
with  accounts of domestic  
occurrences.

04:57:33.401 --> 04:57:36.001
You doubtless recollect these  
papers. 

04:57:33.401 --> 04:57:34.338
Here they are. 
Everything is related in them  

04:57:34.339 --> 04:57:36.050
which bears reference to my  
accursed origin; the whole  

04:57:36.051 --> 04:57:39.917
detail of that series of  
disgusting circumstances which  

04:57:36.051 --> 04:57:37.313
produced it is set in view; the 
minutest description of my  

04:57:37.314 --> 04:57:39.314
odious and loathsome person is  
given, in language which 

04:57:43.606 --> 04:57:44.632
painted your own horrors and 
rendered  mine indelible. 

04:57:44.633 --> 04:57:46.924
I sickened as I read. 

04:57:53.599 --> 04:57:55.599
Hateful day when I received life
I

04:57:58.369 --> 04:58:00.419
exclaimed in agony. 
‘Accursed creator! 

04:58:01.635 --> 04:58:02.876
Why did you form a monster so  
hideous that evenyou turned from

04:58:02.877 --> 04:58:05.512
me in disgust? 
God, in pity, made man beautiful

04:58:05.513 --> 04:58:07.982
and alluring, after his own  
image; but my form is a filthy  

04:58:07.983 --> 04:58:10.864
type of yours, more horrid even 
from the very resemblance. 

04:58:12.107 --> 04:58:13.309
Satan had his companions, fellow
devils, to admire and encourage 

04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:15.310
him, but I am 

04:58:16.523 --> 04:58:18.523
solitary and  

04:58:21.809 --> 04:58:22.626
Detested" these were the 
reflections of my hours of 

04:58:22.627 --> 04:58:23.837
despondency and  solitude; but 
when I  contemplated the virtues

04:58:23.838 --> 04:58:25.838
of 

04:58:27.928 --> 04:58:29.547
the  cottagers, their amiable 
and  benevolent dispositions, I 

04:58:29.548 --> 04:58:32.599
persuaded myself that when they 
should become acquainted with my

04:58:32.600 --> 04:58:35.276
admiration of their virtues they
would compassionate me and  

04:58:37.724 --> 04:58:43.242
overlook my personal deformity. 
Could they turn from their door 

04:58:43.243 --> 04:58:46.288
one, however monstrous, who  
solicited their compassion and  

04:58:46.289 --> 04:58:49.375
friendship? 
I resolved, at least, not to  

04:58:49.376 --> 04:58:52.647
despair, but in every way to fit
myself for an interview with  

04:58:52.648 --> 04:58:57.548
them which would decide my fate.
I postponed this attempt for  

04:58:57.549 --> 04:59:00.633
some months longer, for the  
importance attached to its  

04:59:00.634 --> 04:59:04.321
success inspired me with a dread
lest I should fail. 

04:59:06.177 --> 04:59:08.213
Besides, I found that my  
understanding improved so much  

04:59:08.214 --> 04:59:12.089
with every day's experience that
I was unwilling to commence this

04:59:12.090 --> 04:59:14.090
undertaking until a few 

04:59:16.344 --> 04:59:20.547
more  months should have added 
to my  Wisdom.   Several changes

04:59:20.548 --> 04:59:23.471
in the meantime, took place in 
the cottage. 

04:59:25.325 --> 04:59:27.989
The presence of Safie diffused  
happiness among its inhabitants,

04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:31.659
and I also found that a greater 
degree of plenty reigned there. 

04:59:31.660 --> 04:59:34.759
Felix and Agatha spent more time
in amusement and conversation,  

04:59:34.760 --> 04:59:36.760
and were assisted in their  
labours by servants.

04:59:39.098 --> 04:59:42.374
They did not appear rich, but  
they were contented and happy;  

04:59:42.375 --> 04:59:45.218
their feelings were serene and  
peaceful, while mine became  

04:59:45.219 --> 04:59:49.840
every day more tumultuous. 
Increase of knowledge only  

04:59:49.841 --> 04:59:55.058
discovered to me more clearly  
what a wretched outcast I was. 

04:59:58.904 --> 05:00:00.842
I cherished hope, it is true,  
but it vanished when I beheld my

05:00:00.843 --> 05:00:03.903
person reflected in water or my 
shadow in the moonshine, even as

05:00:03.904 --> 05:00:05.904
that frail image and that  
inconstant shade.

05:00:09.408 --> 05:00:11.240
“I endeavoured to crush these  
fears and to fortify myself for 

05:00:11.241 --> 05:00:13.474
the trial which in a few months 
I resolved to undergo; 

05:00:17.579 --> 05:00:19.215
and  sometimes I allowed my 
thoughts, unchecked by reason, 

05:00:19.216 --> 05:00:21.216
to ramble  in the fields of 
Paradise, and  dared to fancy 

05:00:22.503 --> 05:00:24.563
amiable and  lovely creatures 
sympathising  with my feelings 

05:00:24.564 --> 05:00:26.564
and 

05:00:28.467 --> 05:00:29.493
cheering my gloom; their angelic
countenances breathed smiles of 

05:00:29.494 --> 05:00:31.494
consolation.

05:00:32.984 --> 05:00:36.252
But it was all a dream; no Eve  
soothed my sorrows nor shared my

05:00:36.253 --> 05:00:38.253
thoughts; I was alone.

05:00:39.533 --> 05:00:41.828
I remembered Adam's supplication
to his Creator. 

05:00:41.829 --> 05:00:45.290
But where was mine? 
He had abandoned me, and in the 

05:00:46.546 --> 05:00:48.546
bitterness of my heart I cursed 
him.

05:00:50.420 --> 05:00:54.292
Autumn passed thus.  
I saw, with surprise and grief, 

05:00:54.293 --> 05:00:57.983
the leaves decay and fall, and  
nature again assume the barren  

05:00:57.984 --> 05:01:00.227
and bleak appearance it had worn
when I first beheld the woods  

05:01:00.228 --> 05:01:04.343
and the lovely moon. 
Yet I did not heed the bleakness

05:01:04.344 --> 05:01:06.344
of the 

05:01:07.353 --> 05:01:09.268
weather; I was better  Yet I did
not heed the bleakness of the 

05:01:09.269 --> 05:01:09.871
weather; I was better fitted by 
my conformation for the 

05:01:09.872 --> 05:01:11.961
endurance of cold than heat.the 
flowers, the birds, and all the 

05:01:11.962 --> 05:01:14.027
gay apparel of summer; when 
those deserted me, I turned with

05:01:14.028 --> 05:01:16.028
more attention towards the 
cottagers.

05:01:17.707 --> 05:01:19.707
the absence of summer.

05:01:24.008 --> 05:01:26.008
another; and their joys, 

05:01:28.134 --> 05:01:29.830
depending on each other, were 
not interrupted by the 

05:01:29.831 --> 05:01:31.831
casualties that took place 
around them.

05:01:36.787 --> 05:01:37.201
became my desire to claim their 
protection and kindness; my 

05:01:37.202 --> 05:01:41.423
heart yearned to be known and 
loved by these amiable

05:01:45.550 --> 05:01:48.487
creatures; to see their sweet 
looks directed towards me with 

05:01:48.488 --> 05:01:50.488
affection was the utmost limit 
of my ambition.

05:01:59.149 --> 05:02:01.149
them from me with disdain and 
horror.

05:02:09.662 --> 05:02:11.730
treasures than a little food or 
rest:  I required kindness and 

05:02:11.731 --> 05:02:14.448
sympathy; but I did not believe 
myself utterly unworthy of it.

05:02:20.779 --> 05:02:23.447
revolution of the seasons had 
taken place since I awoke into 

05:02:23.448 --> 05:02:25.448
life.

05:02:28.755 --> 05:02:31.412
directed towards my plan of 
introducing myself into the 

05:02:31.413 --> 05:02:33.413
cottage of my protectors.

05:02:37.768 --> 05:02:40.446
which I finally fixed was to 
enter the dwelling when the 

05:02:40.447 --> 05:02:42.521
blind old man should be alone.

05:02:46.827 --> 05:02:49.525
the unnatural hideousness of my 
person was the chief object of 

05:02:49.526 --> 05:02:50.142
horror with My voice, although 
harsh, had nothing terrible in 

05:02:50.143 --> 05:02:52.824
it; I thought, therefore, that 
if in the absence of his 

05:02:52.825 --> 05:02:54.825
children I 

05:02:57.344 --> 05:02:59.244
could gain the good will and 
mediation of the old De Lacey, I

05:02:59.245 --> 05:03:03.527
might by his means be tolerated 
by my younger protectors.

05:03:20.224 --> 05:03:22.224
of about 20 minutes. Thank you.

05:20:50.227 --> 05:20:52.407
“One day, when the sun shone on 
the red leaves that strewed the 

05:20:52.408 --> 05:20:54.408
ground and diffused 
cheerfulness, although it 

05:20:57.629 --> 05:21:00.278
denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, 
and Felix departed on a long 

05:21:00.279 --> 05:21:01.963
country walk, and the old man, 
at his own desire, was left 

05:21:01.964 --> 05:21:03.964
alone in the cottage.

05:21:09.220 --> 05:21:10.848
up his guitar and played several
mournful but sweet airs, more 

05:21:10.849 --> 05:21:12.849
sweet and mournful than I had 
ever heard him play before.

05:21:19.321 --> 05:21:21.422
illuminated with pleasure, but 
as he continued, thoughtfulness 

05:21:21.423 --> 05:21:23.423
and sadness 

05:21:25.684 --> 05:21:27.718
succeeded; at length, laying 
aside the instrument, he sat 

05:21:27.719 --> 05:21:29.719
absorbed in reflection.

05:21:33.026 --> 05:21:35.669
and moment of trial, which would
decide my hopes or realise my 

05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:37.670
fears.

05:21:44.105 --> 05:21:46.357
cottage; it was an excellent 
opportunity; yet, when I 

05:21:46.358 --> 05:21:51.034
proceeded to execute my plan, my
limbs failed me and I sank to 

05:21:51.035 --> 05:21:53.035
the ground.

05:21:55.738 --> 05:21:57.812
firmness of which I was master, 
removed the planks which I had 

05:21:57.813 --> 05:22:00.503
placed before my hovel to 
conceal my retreat.

05:22:06.443 --> 05:22:08.489
renewed determination I 
approached the door of their 

05:22:08.490 --> 05:22:10.490
cottage.

05:22:18.066 --> 05:22:20.092
a traveller in want of a little 
rest; you would greatly oblige 

05:22:20.093 --> 05:22:22.093
me if you would 

05:22:24.802 --> 05:22:26.802
allow me to remain a few minutes
before the fire.

05:22:30.798 --> 05:22:32.232
try in what manner I can to 
relieve your wants; but, 

05:22:32.233 --> 05:22:34.233
unfortunately, my children 

05:22:37.133 --> 05:22:39.257
are from home, and as I am 
blind, I am afraid I shall find 

05:22:39.258 --> 05:22:41.865
it difficult to procure food for
you.

05:22:47.598 --> 05:22:49.598
host; I have food; it is warmth 
and rest only that I need.

05:22:56.622 --> 05:22:58.687
to me, yet I remained irresolute
in what manner to commence the 

05:22:58.688 --> 05:23:01.340
interview, when the old man 
addressed me.

05:23:07.283 --> 05:23:09.283
you are my countryman; are you 
French?

05:23:13.062 --> 05:23:15.062
family and understand that 
language only.

05:23:18.814 --> 05:23:20.856
of some friends, whom I 
sincerely love, and of whose 

05:23:20.857 --> 05:23:22.857
favour I have some hopes.

05:23:33.648 --> 05:23:36.300
creature, I look around and I 
have no relation or friend upon 

05:23:36.301 --> 05:23:38.301
earth.

05:23:41.622 --> 05:23:43.622
never seen me and know little of
me.

05:23:46.919 --> 05:23:48.919
there, I am an outcast in the 
world for ever.

05:23:54.418 --> 05:23:56.493
unfortunate, but the hearts of 
men, when unprejudiced by any 

05:23:56.494 --> 05:23:58.971
obvious self-interest, are full 
of brotherly love and charity.

05:24:06.041 --> 05:24:08.041
and if these friends are good 
and amiable, do not despair.

05:24:12.758 --> 05:24:14.799
excellent creatures in the 
world; but, unfortunately, they 

05:24:14.800 --> 05:24:16.800
are prejudiced against me.

05:24:21.337 --> 05:24:23.982
been hitherto harmless and in 
some degree beneficial; but a 

05:24:23.983 --> 05:24:25.983
fatal prejudice 

05:24:28.095 --> 05:24:29.723
clouds their eyes, and where 
they ought to see a feeling and 

05:24:29.724 --> 05:24:31.764
kind friend, they behold only a 
detestable monster.

05:24:38.732 --> 05:24:40.732
you are really blameless, cannot
you undeceive them?

05:24:45.527 --> 05:24:47.768
and it is on that account that I
feel so many overwhelming 

05:24:47.769 --> 05:24:49.769
terrors.

05:24:53.084 --> 05:24:55.127
unknown to them, been for many 
months in the habits of daily 

05:24:55.128 --> 05:24:57.128
kindness towards 

05:24:59.424 --> 05:25:01.550
them; but they believe that I 
wish to injure them, and it is 

05:25:01.551 --> 05:25:03.551
that prejudice which I wish to 
overcome.

05:25:11.543 --> 05:25:13.611
continued, ‘If you will 
unreservedly confide to me the 

05:25:13.612 --> 05:25:15.612
particulars of your 

05:25:17.938 --> 05:25:19.938
tale, I perhaps may be of use in
undeceiving them.

05:25:23.641 --> 05:25:25.888
countenance, but there is 
something in your words which 

05:25:25.889 --> 05:25:27.924
persuades me that you are 
sincere.

05:25:33.221 --> 05:25:35.337
afford me true pleasure to be in
any way serviceable to a human 

05:25:35.338 --> 05:25:37.338
creature.

05:25:45.365 --> 05:25:47.401
kindness; and I trust that, by 
your aid, I shall not be driven 

05:25:47.402 --> 05:25:49.402
from the society 

05:25:51.105 --> 05:25:53.105
and sympathy of your fellow 
creatures.

05:25:56.890 --> 05:25:59.150
that can only drive you to 
desperation, and not instigate 

05:25:59.151 --> 05:26:01.151
you to virtue.

have been condemned, although 
innocent; 

05:26:09.566 --> 05:26:11.566
judge, therefore, if I do not 
feel for your misfortunes.

05:26:18.603 --> 05:26:20.603
voice of kindness directed 
towards me; I 

05:26:22.898 --> 05:26:25.585
shall be for ever grateful; and 
your present humanity assures me

05:26:25.586 --> 05:26:27.603
of success with those friends 
whom I am on the point of 

05:26:27.604 --> 05:26:29.604
meeting.

05:26:39.790 --> 05:26:41.864
decision, which was to rob me of
or bestow happiness on me for 

05:26:41.865 --> 05:26:43.865
ever.

05:26:47.163 --> 05:26:49.343
sufficient to answer him, but 
the effort destroyed all my 

05:26:49.344 --> 05:26:51.375
remaining strength; I sank on 
the chair and sobbed aloud.

cried, ‘Now is the time!

Agatha entered.

have torn him limb from limb, as
the lion rends the antelope.

05:27:30.703 --> 05:27:32.703
bitter sickness, and I 
refrained.

05:27:34.622 --> 05:27:34.827
blow, when, overcome by pain and
anguish, I quitted the cottage, 

05:27:34.828 --> 05:27:36.828
and in the general tumult 
escaped unperceived to my hovel.

05:27:53.053 --> 05:27:55.053
wantonly bestowed?

05:27:59.386 --> 05:28:01.386

were those of rage and revenge.

the cottage and its inhabitants 
and have 

05:28:10.463 --> 05:28:12.463
glutted myself with their 
shrieks and misery.

05:28:15.372 --> 05:28:17.372
and wandered in the wood; and 
now, no 

05:28:19.108 --> 05:28:21.131
longer restrained by the fear of
discovery, I gave vent to my 

05:28:21.132 --> 05:28:23.132
anguish in fearful howlings.

the toils, destroying the 
objects that obstructed me and 

05:28:30.095 --> 05:28:32.753
ranging through the wood with a 
stag-like swiftness.

05:28:41.314 --> 05:28:43.956
the bare trees waved their 
branches above me; now and then 

05:28:43.957 --> 05:28:48.047
the sweet voice of a bird burst 
forth amidst the universal 

05:28:48.048 --> 05:28:50.048
stillness.

05:28:52.318 --> 05:28:54.318
enjoyment; I, like the 
arch-fiend, bore 

05:28:56.636 --> 05:28:58.686
a hell within me, and finding 
myself unsympathised with, 

05:28:58.687 --> 05:29:01.329
wished to tear up the trees,

around me, and then to have sat 
down and enjoyed the ruin.that 

05:29:02.759 --> 05:29:03.172
could not endure; I became 
fatigued with excess of bodily 

05:29:03.173 --> 05:29:03.768

grass in the sick impotence of

against him who had 

05:29:14.468 --> 05:29:16.468
formed me and sent me forth to 
this insupportable misery.

impossible to return to my 

05:29:22.422 --> 05:29:24.422
retreat during that day.

05:29:28.792 --> 05:29:30.872
underwood, determining to devote
the ensuing hours to reflection 

05:29:30.873 --> 05:29:32.873
on my situation.

05:29:37.199 --> 05:29:39.257
of day restored me to some 
degree of tranquillity; and when

05:29:39.258 --> 05:29:41.258
I considered what 

05:29:43.582 --> 05:29:45.647
had passed at the cottage, I 
could not help believing that I 

05:29:45.648 --> 05:29:47.648
had been too hasty in my 
conclusions.

05:29:54.627 --> 05:29:56.889
had interested the father in my 
behalf, and I was a fool in 

05:29:56.890 --> 05:29:59.361

horror of his children.

have been prepared for my 
approach.irretrievable, and 

05:30:13.492 --> 05:30:14.112
after much consideration I 
resolved to return to the 

05:30:14.113 --> 05:30:14.745
cottage, seek the old man, and 
by my representations win him to

05:30:14.746 --> 05:30:15.967
my party.afternoon I sank into a
profound sleep; but the fever of

05:30:15.968 --> 05:30:18.236
my blood did not allow me to be 
visited by peaceful dreams.

05:30:24.943 --> 05:30:26.588
was for ever acting before my 
eyes; the females were flying 

05:30:26.589 --> 05:30:28.818
and the enraged Felix tearing me
from his father's feet.

05:30:33.504 --> 05:30:35.504
was already night, I crept forth
from my 

05:30:36.605 --> 05:30:38.605
hiding-place, and went in search
of food.

05:30:41.538 --> 05:30:43.578
directed my steps towards the 
well-known path that conducted 

05:30:43.579 --> 05:30:45.579
to the cottage.

05:30:49.475 --> 05:30:51.534
silent expectation of the 
accustomed hour when the family 

05:30:51.535 --> 05:30:53.535
arose.

05:30:56.213 --> 05:30:58.213
in the heavens, but the 
cottagers did not appear.

05:31:04.344 --> 05:31:05.302
The inside of the cottage was 
dark, and I heard no motion; I 

05:31:05.303 --> 05:31:07.303
cannot describe the agony of 
this suspense.

05:31:11.640 --> 05:31:13.271
but pausing near the cottage, 
they entered into conversation, 

05:31:13.272 --> 05:31:15.272
using violent 

05:31:16.793 --> 05:31:18.867
gesticulations; but I did not 
understand what they said, as 

05:31:18.868 --> 05:31:22.132
they spoke the language of the 
country, which differed from 

05:31:22.133 --> 05:31:24.974
that of my protectors.with 
another man; I was surprised, as

05:31:24.975 --> 05:31:25.578
I knew that he had not quitted 
the cottage that morning, and 

05:31:25.579 --> 05:31:26.193
waited anxiously to discover 
from his discourse the meaning 

05:31:26.194 --> 05:31:28.194
of these unusual appearances.

05:31:30.688 --> 05:31:32.730
to him, ‘that you will be 
obliged to pay three months' 

05:31:32.731 --> 05:31:34.811
rent and to lose the produce of 
your garden?

05:31:39.123 --> 05:31:41.189
advantage, and I beg therefore 
that you will take some days to 

05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:43.190
consider of your determination.

05:31:46.492 --> 05:31:48.492
Felix; ‘we can never again 
inhabit your cottage.

05:31:52.199 --> 05:31:53.856
greatest danger, owing to the 
dreadful circumstance that I 

05:31:53.857 --> 05:31:55.857
have related.

05:32:11.402 --> 05:32:13.402
He and his companion entered the

05:32:15.601 --> 05:32:15.805
For the first time the feelings 
of revenge and hatred filled my 

05:32:15.806 --> 05:32:17.806
bosom, and I did not strive to 
control them, but 

05:32:19.870 --> 05:32:21.947
allowing myself to be borne away
by the stream, I bent my mind 

05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:23.948
towards injury and death.

05:32:26.191 --> 05:32:28.254
mild voice of De Lacey, the 
gentle eyes of Agatha, and the 

05:32:28.255 --> 05:32:30.500
exquisite beauty of the Arabian,
these thoughts vanished and 

05:32:34.176 --> 05:32:36.176
a gush of tears somewhat soothed
me.

05:32:38.473 --> 05:32:40.486
had spurned and deserted me, 
anger returned, a rage of anger,

05:32:40.487 --> 05:32:42.487
and unable to 

05:32:43.766 --> 05:32:47.632
injure anything human, I turned 
my fury towards inanimate 

05:32:43.766 --> 05:32:45.766
objects.

05:32:48.883 --> 05:32:50.883
of combustibles around the 
cottage, and 

05:32:52.765 --> 05:32:54.185
after having destroyed every 
vestige of cultivation in the 

05:32:54.186 --> 05:32:56.426
garden, I waited with forced 
impatience until the moon had 

05:32:58.058 --> 05:33:00.058
sunk to commence my operations.

05:33:02.785 --> 05:33:04.222
arose from the woods and quickly
dispersed the clouds that had 

05:33:04.223 --> 05:33:06.223
loitered 

05:33:07.965 --> 05:33:09.004
in the heavens; the blast tore 
along like a mighty avalanche 

05:33:09.005 --> 05:33:13.313
and produced a kind of insanity 
in my spirits that burst all 

05:33:13.314 --> 05:33:15.314
bounds of reason and reflection.

05:33:18.643 --> 05:33:20.273
danced with fury around the 
devoted cottage, my eyes still 

05:33:20.274 --> 05:33:22.274
fixed on the 

05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:26.350
western horizon, the edge of 
which the moon nearly touched.

05:33:28.649 --> 05:33:30.768
and I waved my brand; it sank, 
and with a loud scream I fired 

05:33:30.769 --> 05:33:32.769
the straw, and heath, and 
bushes, which I had collected.

05:33:38.152 --> 05:33:39.808
cottage was quickly enveloped by
the flames, which clung to it 

05:33:39.809 --> 05:33:41.809
and licked it 

05:33:43.472 --> 05:33:45.472
with their forked and destroying
tongues.

05:33:47.177 --> 05:33:48.803
assistance could save any part 
of the habitation, I quitted the

05:33:48.804 --> 05:33:50.888
scene and sought for refuge in 
the woods.

05:33:56.048 --> 05:33:58.048
whither should I bend my steps?

05:33:59.959 --> 05:34:01.959
my misfortunes; but to me, hated
and 

05:34:03.636 --> 05:34:05.636
despised, every country must be 
equally horrible.

05:34:09.992 --> 05:34:12.035
were my father, my creator; and 
to whom could I apply with more 

05:34:12.036 --> 05:34:14.073
fitness than to him who had 
given me life?

05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:19.943
bestowed upon Safie, geography 
had not been omitted; I had 

05:34:19.944 --> 05:34:21.978
learned from these the relative 
situations of the different 

05:34:23.892 --> 05:34:25.892
countries of the earth.

05:34:29.348 --> 05:34:30.583
your native town, and towards 
this place I resolved to 

05:34:30.584 --> 05:34:32.584
proceed.

05:34:36.933 --> 05:34:38.967
southwesterly direction to reach
my destination, but the sun was 

05:34:38.968 --> 05:34:40.968
my only guide.

05:34:43.258 --> 05:34:45.258
that I was to pass through, nor 
could I 

05:34:46.363 --> 05:34:50.163
ask information from a single 
human being; but I did not 

05:34:46.363 --> 05:34:48.363
despair.

05:34:51.683 --> 05:34:53.719
although towards you I felt no 
sentiment but that of hatred.

05:34:59.076 --> 05:35:01.076
passions and then cast me abroad
an 

05:35:02.349 --> 05:35:04.349
object for the scorn and horror 
of mankind.

05:35:06.450 --> 05:35:08.450
pity and redress, and from you I

05:35:09.459 --> 05:35:11.459
determined to seek that justice 
which I vainly attempted to gain

05:35:12.426 --> 05:35:14.426
from any other being that wore 
the human form.

05:35:20.821 --> 05:35:22.821
the district where I had so long
resided.

05:35:24.492 --> 05:35:26.492
encountering the visage of a 
human being.

05:35:29.831 --> 05:35:31.458
became heatless; rain and snow 
poured around me; mighty rivers 

05:35:31.459 --> 05:35:33.459
were frozen; 

05:35:35.145 --> 05:35:37.195
the surface of the earth was 
hard and chill, and bare, and I 

05:35:37.196 --> 05:35:39.196
found no shelter.

05:35:45.164 --> 05:35:47.164
all within me was turned to gall
and bitterness.

05:35:50.877 --> 05:35:52.877
habitation, the more deeply did 
I feel 

05:35:53.877 --> 05:35:55.877
the spirit of revenge enkindled 
in my heart.

05:36:00.420 --> 05:36:02.696
me, and I possessed a map of the
country; but I often wandered 

05:36:02.697 --> 05:36:04.697
wide from my path.

05:36:07.378 --> 05:36:09.410
respite; no incident occurred 
from which my rage and misery 

05:36:09.411 --> 05:36:11.411
could not extract its 

05:36:12.740 --> 05:36:14.803
food; but a circumstance that 
happened when I arrived on the 

05:36:14.804 --> 05:36:16.854
confines of Switzerland, when 
the sun had recovered 

05:36:20.115 --> 05:36:21.524
its warmth and the earth again 
began to look green, confirmed 

05:36:21.525 --> 05:36:23.792
in an especial manner the 
bitterness and horror of my 

05:36:23.793 --> 05:36:25.793
feelings.

05:36:29.106 --> 05:36:31.194
travelled only when I was 
secured by night from the view 

05:36:31.195 --> 05:36:33.195
of man.

05:36:35.951 --> 05:36:37.570
path lay through a deep wood, I 
ventured to continue my journey 

05:36:37.571 --> 05:36:39.571
after the sun had 

05:36:41.642 --> 05:36:43.307
risen; the day, which was one of
the first of spring, cheered 

05:36:43.308 --> 05:36:46.996
even me by the loveliness of its
sunshine and the balminess of 

05:36:46.997 --> 05:36:48.997
the air.

05:36:50.696 --> 05:36:52.696
pleasure, that had long appeared
dead, revive within me.

05:36:56.614 --> 05:36:58.060
sensations, I allowed myself to 
be borne away by them, and 

05:36:58.061 --> 05:37:00.315
forgetting my solitude and 
deformity, dared to be happy.

05:37:05.006 --> 05:37:07.084
I even raised my humid eyes with
thankfulness towards the blessed

05:37:07.085 --> 05:37:09.085
sun, which bestowed such joy 
upon me.

05:37:13.426 --> 05:37:15.426
the wood, until I came to its 
boundary, 

05:37:16.703 --> 05:37:18.730
which was skirted by a deep and 
rapid river, into which many of 

05:37:18.731 --> 05:37:20.731
the trees bent 

05:37:21.858 --> 05:37:23.858
their branches, now budding with
the fresh spring.

05:37:25.656 --> 05:37:27.656
path to pursue, when I heard the
sound 

05:37:28.719 --> 05:37:30.996
of voices, that induced me to 
conceal myself under the shade 

05:37:30.997 --> 05:37:32.997
of a cypress.

05:37:35.066 --> 05:37:36.705
came running towards the spot 
where I was concealed, laughing,

05:37:36.706 --> 05:37:38.706
as if she ran from someone in 
sport.

05:37:42.620 --> 05:37:44.699
precipitous sides of the river, 
when suddenly her foot slipped, 

05:37:44.700 --> 05:37:46.740
and she fell into the rapid 
stream.

05:37:51.445 --> 05:37:53.065
extreme labour, from the force 
of the current, saved her and 

05:37:53.066 --> 05:37:55.066
dragged her to shore.

05:37:58.403 --> 05:38:00.037
every means in my power to 
restore animation, when I was 

05:38:00.038 --> 05:38:02.094
suddenly interrupted by the 
approach of a rustic, 

05:38:05.884 --> 05:38:07.884
who was probably the person from
whom she had playfully fled.

05:38:11.187 --> 05:38:12.630
tearing the girl from my arms, 
hastened towards the deeper 

05:38:12.631 --> 05:38:14.631
parts of the wood.

05:38:17.944 --> 05:38:20.180
but when the man saw me draw 
near, he aimed a gun, which he 

05:38:20.181 --> 05:38:22.181
carried, at my body and fired.

05:38:25.853 --> 05:38:27.853
with increased swiftness, 
escaped into 

05:38:29.145 --> 05:38:31.145
“This was then the reward of my 
benevolence!

05:38:33.877 --> 05:38:35.498
destruction, and as a recompense
I now writhed under the 

05:38:35.499 --> 05:38:37.540
miserable pain of a wound which 
shattered the flesh and bone.

05:38:41.823 --> 05:38:43.823
which I had entertained but a 
few 

05:38:44.931 --> 05:38:48.797
moments before gave place to 
hellish rage and gnashing of 

05:38:44.931 --> 05:38:46.931
teeth.

05:38:50.247 --> 05:38:52.247
hatred and vengeance to all 
mankind.

05:38:54.566 --> 05:38:56.566
my pulses paused, and I fainted.

05:38:58.351 --> 05:39:00.381
in the woods, endeavouring to 
cure the wound which I had 

05:39:00.382 --> 05:39:02.382
received.

05:39:05.073 --> 05:39:07.073
knew not whether it had remained
there 

05:39:08.745 --> 05:39:10.745
or passed through; at any rate I
had no means of extracting it.

05:39:13.641 --> 05:39:15.076
the oppressive sense of the 
injustice and ingratitude of 

05:39:15.077 --> 05:39:17.077
their infliction.

05:39:19.792 --> 05:39:22.051
and deadly revenge, such as 
would alone compensate for the 

05:39:22.052 --> 05:39:24.052
outrages and anguish I had 
endured.

05:39:27.209 --> 05:39:29.209
I continued my journey.

05:39:31.507 --> 05:39:33.592
be alleviated by the bright sun 
or gentle breezes of spring; all

05:39:33.593 --> 05:39:38.478
joy was but a mockery which 
insulted my desolate state and 

05:39:38.479 --> 05:39:40.512
made me feel more painfully that
I was not made for the enjoyment

05:39:40.513 --> 05:39:42.513
of pleasure.

05:39:46.843 --> 05:39:48.846
and in two months from this time
I reached the environs of 

05:39:48.847 --> 05:39:50.847
Geneva.

05:39:52.690 --> 05:39:54.823
retired to a hiding-place among 
the fields that surround it to 

05:39:54.824 --> 05:39:56.824
meditate in what manner I should
apply to you.

05:40:01.700 --> 05:40:03.330
and far too unhappy to enjoy the
gentle breezes of evening or the

05:40:03.331 --> 05:40:05.331
prospect of 

05:40:06.395 --> 05:40:08.395
the sun setting behind the 
stupendous mountains of Jura.

05:40:10.655 --> 05:40:12.898
me from the pain of reflection, 
which was disturbed by the 

05:40:12.899 --> 05:40:14.947
approach of a beautiful child, 
who came running into 

05:40:19.347 --> 05:40:21.347
the recess I had chosen, with 
all the sportiveness of infancy.

05:40:23.898 --> 05:40:25.934
seized me that this little 
creature was unprejudiced and 

05:40:25.935 --> 05:40:27.935
had lived too short a 

05:40:29.622 --> 05:40:31.622
time to have imbibed a horror of
deformity.

05:40:33.918 --> 05:40:36.182
educate him as my companion and 
friend, I should not be so 

05:40:36.183 --> 05:40:38.183
desolate in this peopled earth.

05:40:41.902 --> 05:40:43.902
boy as he passed and drew him 
towards me.

05:40:47.215 --> 05:40:47.631
his hands before his eyes and 
uttered a shrill scream; I drew 

05:40:47.632 --> 05:40:49.868
his hand forcibly from his face 
and said, ‘Child, what is the 

05:40:49.869 --> 05:40:51.869
meaning of this?

05:40:58.207 --> 05:41:00.207
listen to me.

05:41:01.223 --> 05:41:03.223
'

05:41:17.230 --> 05:41:19.230
papa.'“‘Boy, you will never see 
your father 

05:41:20.860 --> 05:41:22.860
again; you must come

05:41:26.434 --> 05:41:28.434
with me.'“‘Hideous monster!

05:41:34.336 --> 05:41:35.371
towards whom I have sworn 
eternal revenge; you shall be my

05:41:35.372 --> 05:41:37.372
first victim.

05:41:44.367 --> 05:41:44.773
“The child still struggled and 
loaded me with epithets which 

05:41:44.774 --> 05:41:46.414
carried despair to my heart; I 
grasped his throat to silence 

05:41:46.415 --> 05:41:48.415
him, and in a moment he lay dead
at my feet.

05:41:50.471 --> 05:41:52.471
swelled with exultation 

05:41:54.758 --> 05:41:56.758
and hellish triumph; clapping my

05:42:01.191 --> 05:42:01.813
hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can 
create desolation; my enemy is 

05:42:01.814 --> 05:42:03.454
not invulnerable; this death 
will carry despair to him, and a

05:42:03.455 --> 05:42:09.144
thousand other miseries shall 
torment and destroy him.

05:42:13.794 --> 05:42:15.794
“As I fixed my eyes on the 

05:42:21.762 --> 05:42:23.762
child, I saw something 

05:42:29.768 --> 05:42:31.768
glittering on his breast.

05:42:37.793 --> 05:42:39.793
softened and attracted me.

05:42:48.085 --> 05:42:50.085
delight on her dark eyes, 

05:42:54.185 --> 05:42:54.625
fringed by deep lashes, and her 
lovely lips; but presently my 

05:42:54.626 --> 05:42:56.626
rage returned; I remembered that
I was for ever deprived 

05:43:00.289 --> 05:43:02.594
of the delights that such 
beautiful creatures could bestow

05:43:02.595 --> 05:43:03.198
and that she whose resemblance I
contemplated would, in regarding

05:43:03.199 --> 05:43:04.635
me, have changed that air of 
divine benignity to one 

05:43:04.636 --> 05:43:06.636
expressive of 

05:43:07.636 --> 05:43:13.643
disgust and affright.transported
me with rage?instead of venting 

05:43:13.644 --> 05:43:14.853
my sensations in exclamations 
and agony, I did not rush among 

05:43:14.854 --> 05:43:16.315
mankind and perish in the 
attempt to destroy them.

05:43:16.316 --> 05:43:18.316
feelings, I left the spot where 
I had 

05:43:19.328 --> 05:43:21.328
committed the murder, and 

05:43:33.819 --> 05:43:34.360
seeking a more secluded 
hiding-place, I entered a barn 

05:43:34.361 --> 05:43:36.572
which had appeared to me to be 
empty.was young, not indeed so 

05:43:36.573 --> 05:43:38.005
beautiful as her whose portrait 
I held, but of an agreeable 

05:43:38.006 --> 05:43:40.006
aspect and blooming in the 
loveliness of youth and health.

05:43:44.391 --> 05:43:46.391
joy-imparting smiles are 
bestowed on all but me.

05:44:02.961 --> 05:44:03.361
‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is 
near—he who would give his life 

05:44:03.362 --> 05:44:05.362
but to obtain one look of 
affection from thine eyes; 

05:44:06.991 --> 05:44:08.991
my beloved, awake!

murderer?darkened eyes opened

05:44:25.709 --> 05:44:27.709
all that she could give me, she 
shall atone.

05:44:29.794 --> 05:44:31.794
sanguinary laws of man, I had 
learned now to work mischief.

interchange of those sympathies

a right which you must not 

05:44:44.180 --> 05:44:46.180
refuse to concede.

05:44:47.193 --> 05:44:49.193
”

05:44:54.315 --> 05:44:56.315
anew in me the anger that had 
died away 

05:44:57.325 --> 05:44:59.325
while he 

05:45:04.797 --> 05:45:05.410
narrated his peaceful life among
the cottagers, and as he said 

05:45:05.411 --> 05:45:07.411
this I could no longer suppress 
the rage that burned within me.

05:45:07.450 --> 05:45:10.103
torture shall ever extort a 
consent from me.men, but you 

05:45:10.104 --> 05:45:12.104
shall never make me base in my 
own eyes.

05:45:17.062 --> 05:45:19.062
whose joint wickedness might 
desolate the world.

05:45:23.287 --> 05:45:25.939
me, but I will never consent.
“You are in the wrong,” replied 

05:45:25.940 --> 05:45:30.210
the fiend; “and instead of 
threatening, I am content to 

05:45:30.211 --> 05:45:32.211
reason with you.

05:45:41.727 --> 05:45:44.004
pieces and triumph; remember 
that, and tell me why I should

05:45:51.379 --> 05:45:53.001

those ice-rifts and destroy my 

05:45:53.002 --> 05:45:55.665
frame, the work of your own 
hands.

05:46:03.462 --> 05:46:05.733
of kindness, and instead of 
injury I would bestow every 

05:46:05.734 --> 05:46:07.734
benefit upon him with 

05:46:09.431 --> 05:46:11.431
tears of gratitude at his 
acceptance.

05:46:14.168 --> 05:46:16.168
are insurmountable barriers to 
our union.

05:46:24.183 --> 05:46:26.242
inspire love, I will cause fear,
and chiefly towards you my 

05:46:26.243 --> 05:46:28.243
arch-enemy, 

05:46:29.901 --> 05:46:31.901
because my creator, do I swear 
inextinguishable hatred.

05:46:36.887 --> 05:46:39.585
destruction, nor finish until I 
desolate your heart, so that you

05:46:39.586 --> 05:46:41.586
shall curse the hour of your 
birth.

05:46:44.340 --> 05:46:46.340
A fiendish rage animated him as 
he said 

05:46:47.350 --> 05:46:49.350
this; his face was 

05:46:51.849 --> 05:46:52.848
wrinkled into contortions too 
horrible for human eyes to 

05:46:52.849 --> 05:46:54.849
behold; but presently 

05:46:56.499 --> 05:46:58.499
he calmed himself and proceeded—
“I intended to reason.

05:47:10.194 --> 05:47:11.832
you do not reflect that you are 
the cause of its excess.

05:47:11.833 --> 05:47:12.250
benevolence towards me, I should
return them a hundred and a 

05:47:12.251 --> 05:47:14.919
hundredfold; for that one 
creature's sake I would make 

05:47:14.920 --> 05:47:16.920
peace with the whole kind!

05:47:26.003 --> 05:47:28.003
moderate; I demand a creature of
another 

05:47:29.687 --> 05:47:32.372
sex, but as hideous as myself; 
the gratification is small, but 

05:47:32.373 --> 05:47:34.622
it is all that I can receive, 
and it shall content me.

05:47:40.271 --> 05:47:42.906
off from all the world; but on 
that account we shall be more 

05:47:42.907 --> 05:47:45.010
attached to one another.

05:47:50.500 --> 05:47:52.500
will be harmless and free from 
the misery I now feel.

05:47:57.744 --> 05:47:59.744
gratitude towards you for one 
benefit!

05:48:03.037 --> 05:48:05.037
of some existing thing; do not 
deny me my request!

05:48:10.407 --> 05:48:13.191
possible consequences of my 
consent, but I felt that there 

05:48:13.192 --> 05:48:15.192
was some justice in his 
argument.

05:48:19.955 --> 05:48:22.178
expressed proved him to be a 
creature of fine sensations, and

05:48:22.179 --> 05:48:24.868
did I not as his maker owe him 
all the portion of 

05:48:28.564 --> 05:48:30.564
happiness that it was in my 
power to bestow?

05:48:31.778 --> 05:48:33.778
continued, “If you consent, 
neither you 

05:48:36.454 --> 05:48:39.084
nor any other human being shall 
ever see us again; I will go to 

05:48:39.085 --> 05:48:41.085
the vast wilds of South America.

05:48:45.852 --> 05:48:48.093
destroy the lamb and the kid to 
glut my appetite; acorns and 

05:48:48.094 --> 05:48:50.173
berries afford me sufficient 
nourishment.

05:48:55.484 --> 05:48:57.484
as myself and will be content 
with the same fare.

05:49:02.380 --> 05:49:04.380
the sun will shine on us as on 
man and 

05:49:06.573 --> 05:49:09.267
The picture I present to you is 
peaceful and human, and you must

05:49:09.268 --> 05:49:14.002
feel that you could deny it only
in the wantonness of power and 

05:49:14.003 --> 05:49:16.003
cruelty.

05:49:18.784 --> 05:49:20.840
now see compassion in your eyes;
let me seize the favourable 

05:49:20.841 --> 05:49:22.841
moment and persuade 

05:49:25.737 --> 05:49:27.737
you to promise what I so 
ardently desire.

05:49:28.824 --> 05:49:31.475
“You propose,” replied I, “to 
fly from the habitations of man,

05:49:31.476 --> 05:49:36.199
to dwell in those wilds where 
the beasts of the field will be 

05:49:36.200 --> 05:49:38.200
your only companions.

05:49:42.101 --> 05:49:44.101
sympathy of man, persevere in 
this exile?

05:49:47.823 --> 05:49:49.823
kindness, and you will meet with
their 

05:49:52.126 --> 05:49:54.156
detestation; your evil passions 
will be renewed, and you will 

05:49:54.157 --> 05:49:56.807
then have a companion to aid you
in the task of destruction.

05:50:02.850 --> 05:50:04.850
point, for I cannot consent.“How
inconstant are your feelings!

05:50:10.039 --> 05:50:12.714
representations, and why do you 
again harden yourself to my 

05:50:12.715 --> 05:50:14.715
complaints?

05:50:18.065 --> 05:50:20.098
inhabit, and by you that made 
me, that with the companion you 

05:50:20.099 --> 05:50:22.135
bestow, I will quit the 
neighbourhood of man and dwell, 

05:50:26.950 --> 05:50:28.950
as it may chance, in the most 
savage of places.

05:50:37.554 --> 05:50:39.554
my dying moments I shall not 
curse my maker.

05:50:41.266 --> 05:50:43.266
His words had a strange effect 
upon me.

05:50:46.583 --> 05:50:48.642
a wish to console him, but when 
I looked upon him, when I saw 

05:50:48.643 --> 05:50:50.643
the filthy mass 

05:50:52.895 --> 05:50:55.474
that moved and talked, my heart 
sickened and my feelings were 

05:50:55.475 --> 05:50:57.861
altered to those of horror and 
hatred.

05:51:02.518 --> 05:51:05.008
thought that as I could not 
sympathise with him, I had no 

05:51:05.009 --> 05:51:07.009
right to withhold 

05:51:09.316 --> 05:51:12.019
from him the small portion of 
happiness which was yet in my 

05:51:12.020 --> 05:51:14.020
power to bestow.

05:51:16.705 --> 05:51:18.789
but have you not already shown a
degree of malice that should 

05:51:18.790 --> 05:51:21.466
reasonably make me distrust you?

05:51:27.105 --> 05:51:29.105
increase your triumph 

05:51:37.436 --> 05:51:39.436
by affording a wider scope for 
your revenge?

05:51:41.100 --> 05:51:42.111
hatred and vice must be my 
portion; the love of another 

05:51:42.112 --> 05:51:42.861
will destroy the cause of my 
crimes, and I shall become a 

05:51:42.862 --> 05:51:44.862
thing of whose existence 
everyone will be ignorant.

05:51:52.176 --> 05:51:54.176
forced solitude that I abhor, 
and my 

05:51:55.197 --> 05:51:57.197
virtues will necessarily 

05:52:00.503 --> 05:52:02.503
arise when I live in communion 
with an equal.

05:52:06.369 --> 05:52:08.355
sensitive being and become 
linked to the chain of existence

05:52:08.356 --> 05:52:10.356
and events from which I am now 
excluded.

05:52:11.382 --> 05:52:13.382
”

05:52:30.723 --> 05:52:32.723
had related and the various 
arguments which he had employed.

05:52:33.390 --> 05:52:37.523
which he had displayed on the 
opening of his existence and the

05:52:33.390 --> 05:52:35.020
subsequent blight of all kindly 
feeling by the loathing and 

05:52:35.021 --> 05:52:36.461
scorn which his protectors had 
manifested towards him.in my 

05:52:36.462 --> 05:52:37.087
calculations; a creature who 
could exist in the ice-caves of 

05:52:37.088 --> 05:52:39.135
the glaciers and hide himself 
from pursuit among the 

05:52:42.141 --> 05:52:44.141
ridges of inaccessible 

05:52:54.094 --> 05:52:54.526
precipices was a being 
possessing faculties it would be

05:52:54.527 --> 05:52:56.527
vain to cope with.

05:52:58.570 --> 05:53:00.449
concluded that the justice due 
both to him and my fellow 

05:53:00.450 --> 05:53:02.450
creatures demanded of me that I 
should comply with his request.

05:53:08.866 --> 05:53:09.253
“I consent to your demand, on 
your solemn oath to quit Europe 

05:53:09.254 --> 05:53:11.860
for ever, and every other place 
in the neighbourhood of man, as 

05:53:11.861 --> 05:53:11.922
soon as I shall deliver into 
your hands a female who will 

05:53:11.923 --> 05:53:13.055
accompany you in your exile.“I 
swear,” he cried, “by the sun, 

05:53:13.056 --> 05:53:15.056
and by 

05:53:16.069 --> 05:53:18.069
the blue sky of 

05:53:22.347 --> 05:53:22.551
heaven, and by the fire of love 
that burns my heart, that if you

05:53:22.552 --> 05:53:25.543
grant my prayer, while they 

05:53:28.826 --> 05:53:30.826
exist you shall never behold me 
again.

05:53:51.042 --> 05:53:51.647
labours; I shall watch their 
progress with unutterable 

05:53:51.648 --> 05:53:53.292
anxiety; and fear not but that 
when you are ready I shall 

05:53:53.293 --> 05:53:56.291
appear.”

05:54:01.764 --> 05:54:03.764
fearful, perhaps, of any change 
in my sentiments.

05:54:08.663 --> 05:54:11.297
greater speed than the flight of
an eagle, and quickly lost among

05:54:11.298 --> 05:54:13.953
the undulations of the sea of 
ice.

05:54:20.195 --> 05:54:22.436
and the sun was upon the verge 
of the horizon when he departed.

05:54:27.580 --> 05:54:30.291
descent towards the valley, as I
should soon be encompassed in 

05:54:30.292 --> 05:54:32.339
darkness; but my heart was 
heavy, and my steps slow.

05:54:39.763 --> 05:54:41.843
paths of the mountain and fixing
my feet firmly as I advanced 

05:54:41.844 --> 05:54:43.844
perplexed me, 

05:54:47.204 --> 05:54:49.850
occupied as I was by the 
emotions which the occurrences 

05:54:49.851 --> 05:54:51.851
of the day had produced.

05:54:54.592 --> 05:54:57.279
the halfway resting-place and 
seated myself beside the 

05:54:57.280 --> 05:54:59.280
fountain.

05:55:03.586 --> 05:55:06.217
clouds passed from over them; 
the dark pines rose before me, 

05:55:06.218 --> 05:55:08.218
and every here and 

05:55:11.120 --> 05:55:13.179
there a broken tree lay on the 
ground; it was a scene of 

05:55:13.180 --> 05:55:15.683
wonderful solemnity and stirred 
strange thoughts within me.

05:55:22.247 --> 05:55:24.247
in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh!

05:55:27.879 --> 05:55:30.118
about to mock me; if ye really 
pity me, crush sensation and 

05:55:30.119 --> 05:55:32.119
memory; let me 

05:55:34.265 --> 05:55:36.520
become as nought; but if not, 
depart, depart, and leave me in 

05:55:36.521 --> 05:55:38.521
darkness.

05:55:39.629 --> 05:55:42.270
These were wild and miserable 
thoughts, but I cannot describe 

05:55:42.271 --> 05:55:47.572
to you how the eternal twinkling
of the stars weighed upon me and

05:55:47.573 --> 05:55:49.573
how I listened to every 

05:55:52.874 --> 05:55:56.874
blast of wind as if it were a 
dull ugly siroc on its way to 

05:55:52.874 --> 05:55:54.874
consume me.

05:56:00.719 --> 05:56:02.973
village of Chamounix; I took no 
rest, but returned immediately 

05:56:02.974 --> 05:56:04.974
to Geneva.

05:56:08.685 --> 05:56:10.685
expression to my sensations—they
weighed 

05:56:12.713 --> 05:56:14.436
on me with a mountain's weight 
and their excess destroyed my 

05:56:14.437 --> 05:56:16.437
agony beneath them.

05:56:27.814 --> 05:56:29.867
house, presented myself to the 
family.intense alarm, but I 

05:56:29.868 --> 05:56:31.868
answered no question, scarcely 
did I speak.

05:56:43.159 --> 05:56:45.235
ban—as if I had no right to 
claim their sympathies—as if 

05:56:45.236 --> 05:56:47.236
never more might I enjoy 
companionship with them.

05:56:53.014 --> 05:56:53.626
adoration; and to save them, I 
resolved to dedicate myself to 

05:56:53.627 --> 05:56:55.627
my most abhorred task.

05:57:02.658 --> 05:57:04.658
every other circumstance of 
existence 

05:57:05.910 --> 05:57:06.922
pass before me like a dream, and
that thought only had to me the 

05:57:06.923 --> 05:57:08.923
reality of life.

05:57:25.967 --> 05:57:27.967
me and I saw animals inflecting 
torture upon me?

05:57:29.457 --> 05:57:31.457
By degrees, however, these 
feelings became calmed.

05:57:34.587 --> 05:57:37.074
I entered again into the 
everyday scene of life, if not 

05:57:37.075 --> 05:57:39.075
with interest, at least 

05:57:42.461 --> 05:57:44.461
Day after day, week after week, 
passed 

05:57:45.462 --> 05:57:47.786
away on my return to Geneva; and
I could not collect the courage 

05:57:47.787 --> 05:57:49.787
to recommence my work.

05:57:55.366 --> 05:57:57.802
disappointed fiend, yet I was 
unable to overcome my repugnance

05:57:57.803 --> 05:58:00.479
to the task which was enjoined 
me.

05:58:05.861 --> 05:58:08.310
female without again devoting 
several months to profound study

05:58:08.311 --> 05:58:10.311
and laborious disquisition.

05:58:15.867 --> 05:58:17.867
been made by an English 
philosopher, the 

05:58:20.590 --> 05:58:23.245
knowledge of which was material 
to my success, and I sometimes 

05:58:23.246 --> 05:58:27.978
thought of obtaining my father's
consent to visit England for 

05:58:27.979 --> 05:58:29.979
this purpose; but I clung to 

05:58:32.693 --> 05:58:35.410
every pretence of delay and 
shrank from taking the first 

05:58:35.411 --> 05:58:37.568
step in an undertaking whose 
immediate necessity began to 

05:58:40.073 --> 05:58:42.073
appear less absolute to me.

05:58:45.409 --> 05:58:48.064
my health, which had hitherto 
declined, was now much restored;

05:58:48.065 --> 05:58:50.065
and my spirits, 

05:58:53.388 --> 05:58:54.858
when unchecked by the memory of 
my unhappy promise, rose 

05:58:54.859 --> 05:58:56.859
proportionably.

05:59:00.777 --> 05:59:03.438
pleasure, and he turned his 
thoughts towards the best method

05:59:03.439 --> 05:59:08.737
of eradicating the remains of my
melancholy, which every now and 

05:59:08.738 --> 05:59:10.738
then would return by fits, 

05:59:13.414 --> 05:59:15.481
and with a devouring blackness 
overcast the approaching 

05:59:15.482 --> 05:59:17.482
sunshine.

05:59:26.113 --> 05:59:28.352
in a little boat, watching the 
clouds and listening to the 

05:59:28.353 --> 05:59:31.009
rippling of the waves, silent 
and listless.

05:59:37.316 --> 05:59:40.018
failed to restore me to some 
degree of composure, and on my 

05:59:40.019 --> 05:59:44.717
return I met the salutations of 
my friends with a readier smile 

05:59:44.718 --> 05:59:46.718
and a more cheerful heart.

05:59:52.517 --> 05:59:54.517
these rambles that my father, 
calling me 

05:59:55.824 --> 05:59:58.476
aside, thus addressed me, “I am 
happy to remark, my dear son, 

05:59:58.477 --> 06:00:03.175
that you have resumed your 
former pleasures and seem to be 

06:00:03.176 --> 06:00:05.176
returning to yourself.

06:00:14.560 --> 06:00:18.450
as to the cause of this, but 
yesterday an idea struck me, and

06:00:18.451 --> 06:00:21.091
if it is well founded, I conjure
you to avow it.

06:00:27.007 --> 06:00:29.007
only useless, but draw down 
treble misery on us all.

06:00:30.760 --> 06:00:33.414
I trembled violently at his 
exordium, and my father 

06:00:33.415 --> 06:00:35.889
continued— “I confess, my son, 
that I have always looked 

06:00:35.890 --> 06:00:37.890
forward 

06:00:41.187 --> 06:00:43.460
to your marriage with our dear 
Elizabeth as the tie of our 

06:00:43.461 --> 06:00:45.503
domestic comfort and the stay of
my declining years.

06:00:51.873 --> 06:00:54.567
your earliest infancy; you 
studied together, and appeared, 

06:00:54.568 --> 06:00:56.675
in dispositions and tastes, 
entirely suited to one another.

06:01:04.577 --> 06:01:06.624
that what I conceived to be the 
best assistants to my plan may 

06:01:06.625 --> 06:01:09.306
have entirely destroyed it.

sister, without any wish that 
she might become your wife.you 

06:01:15.871 --> 06:01:16.687
may love; and considering 
yourself as bound in honour to 

06:01:16.688 --> 06:01:17.294
Elizabeth, this struggle may 
occasion the poignant misery 

06:01:17.295 --> 06:01:19.295
which you appear to feel.“My 
dear father, reassure yourself.

06:01:19.776 --> 06:01:20.802
Elizabeth does, my warmest 
admiration and affection.

06:01:20.803 --> 06:01:23.250
entirely bound up in the 
expectation of our union.“The 

06:01:23.251 --> 06:01:25.915
expression of your sentiments of
this subject, my dear Victor, 

06:01:25.916 --> 06:01:27.768
gives me more pleasure than I 
have for some time experienced.

06:01:27.769 --> 06:01:29.769
happy, however present events 
may cast a gloom over us.

06:01:33.132 --> 06:01:35.798
have taken so strong a hold of 
your mind that I wish to 

06:01:35.799 --> 06:01:37.799
dissipate.

06:01:41.087 --> 06:01:43.087
to an immediate solemnisation of
the marriage.

06:01:49.041 --> 06:01:51.041
events have drawn us from that 
everyday 

06:01:52.716 --> 06:01:54.716
tranquillity befitting my years 
and infirmities.

06:01:59.021 --> 06:02:01.076
possessed as you are of a 
competent fortune, that an early

06:02:01.077 --> 06:02:03.077
marriage would at 

06:02:05.876 --> 06:02:08.120
all interfere with any future 
plans of honour and utility that

06:02:08.121 --> 06:02:10.121
you may have formed.

a delay on your part would cause

06:02:16.602 --> 06:02:17.420
me any serious uneasiness.answer
me, I conjure you, with 

06:02:17.421 --> 06:02:18.640
confidence and sincerity.I 
listened to my father in silence

06:02:18.641 --> 06:02:20.641
and remained for some time 
incapable of offering any reply.

06:02:24.740 --> 06:02:27.395
multitude of thoughts and 
endeavoured to arrive at some 

06:02:27.396 --> 06:02:29.396
conclusion.

06:02:33.909 --> 06:02:35.909
with my Elizabeth was one of 
horror and dismay.

06:02:40.216 --> 06:02:42.276
had not yet fulfilled and dared 
not break, or if I did, what 

06:02:42.277 --> 06:02:46.966
manifold miseries might not 
impend over me and my devoted 

06:02:46.967 --> 06:02:48.967
family!

06:02:52.878 --> 06:02:55.527
deadly weight yet hanging round 
my neck and bowing me to the 

06:02:55.528 --> 06:02:57.528
ground?

06:03:04.520 --> 06:03:06.562

which I expected peace.

upon me of either journeying to 
England 

06:03:16.686 --> 06:03:18.686
or entering into a long 
correspondence 

06:03:20.969 --> 06:03:23.402
with those philosophers of that 
country whose knowledge and 

06:03:23.403 --> 06:03:26.081
discoveries were of 
indispensable use to me in my 

06:03:26.082 --> 06:03:28.082
present undertaking.

06:03:33.080 --> 06:03:35.118
desired intelligence was 
dilatory and unsatisfactory; 

06:03:35.119 --> 06:03:37.780
besides, I had an insurmountable
aversion to the idea of 

06:03:43.085 --> 06:03:45.103
engaging myself in my loathsome 
task in my father's house while 

06:03:45.104 --> 06:03:47.776
in habits of familiar 
intercourse with those I loved.

06:03:54.284 --> 06:03:56.327
accidents might occur, the 
slightest of which would 

06:03:56.328 --> 06:03:59.027
disclose a tale to thrill all 
connected with me with horror.

capacity of hiding the harrowing

06:04:07.188 --> 06:04:07.838
sensations that would possess me
during the progress of my 

06:04:07.839 --> 06:04:10.279
unearthly occupation.achieved, 
and I might be restored to my 

06:04:10.473 --> 06:04:11.709
family in peace and happiness.to
destroy him and put an end to my

06:04:11.710 --> 06:04:13.710
slavery for ever.but concealing 
the true reasons of this 

06:04:13.955 --> 06:04:15.955
request, I clothed my desires 
under a 

06:04:18.861 --> 06:04:21.501
guise which excited no 
suspicion, while I urged my 

06:04:21.502 --> 06:04:23.542
desire with an earnestness that 
easily induced my father to 

06:04:23.543 --> 06:04:25.543
comply.

06:04:28.863 --> 06:04:30.863

madness in its 

06:04:33.572 --> 06:04:35.572
intensity and effects, he was 
glad to 

06:04:36.584 --> 06:04:38.584
find that I was capable 

06:04:44.780 --> 06:04:45.191
of taking pleasure in the idea 
of such a journey, and he hoped 

06:04:45.192 --> 06:04:46.823
that change of scene and varied 
amusement would, before my 

06:04:46.824 --> 06:04:48.458
return, have restored me 
entirely to myself.my own 

06:04:48.459 --> 06:04:48.862
choice; a few months, or at most
a year, was the period 

06:04:48.863 --> 06:04:50.863
contemplated.

06:04:52.133 --> 06:04:54.168
me, he had, in concert with 
Elizabeth, This interfered with 

06:04:54.169 --> 06:04:56.169
the solitude I coveted for the 
prosecution of my task; 

06:04:57.785 --> 06:05:00.696
yet at the commencement of my 
journey the presence of my 

06:05:00.697 --> 06:05:01.096
friend could in no way be an 
impediment, and truly I rejoiced

06:05:01.097 --> 06:05:02.119
that thus I should be saved many
hours of lonely, maddening 

06:05:02.120 --> 06:05:04.120
reflection.

me to its progress?it was

Elizabeth should take place 

06:05:09.059 --> 06:05:11.059
immediately on my return.

06:05:18.612 --> 06:05:19.030
promised myself from my detested
toils—one consolation for my 

06:05:19.031 --> 06:05:19.645
unparalleled sufferings; it was 
the prospect of that day when, 

06:05:19.646 --> 06:05:23.322
enfranchised from my miserable 
slavery, I might claim Elizabeth

06:05:23.323 --> 06:05:25.556
and forget the past in my union 
with her.but one feeling haunted

06:05:25.557 --> 06:05:27.557
me which filled me with fear and
agitation.

06:05:30.634 --> 06:05:32.634
friends unconscious of the 

06:06:04.697 --> 06:06:05.103
existence of their enemy and 
unprotected from his attacks, 

06:06:05.104 --> 06:06:07.104
exasperated as he might be by my
departure.

06:06:25.375 --> 06:06:27.375
wherever I might go, and would 
he not accompany me to England?

06:06:30.425 --> 06:06:34.491
itself, but soothing inasmuch as
it supposed the safety of my 

06:06:30.425 --> 06:06:33.732
friends.But through the whole 
period during which I was the 

06:06:33.733 --> 06:06:36.721
slave of my creature I allowed 
myself to 

06:06:40.650 --> 06:06:42.650
be governed by the impulses of 
the 

06:06:43.652 --> 06:06:45.652
moment; and my present 

06:06:56.491 --> 06:06:56.896
sensations strongly intimated 
that the fiend would follow me 

06:06:56.897 --> 06:06:58.897
and exempt my family from the 
danger of his machinations.

06:07:01.553 --> 06:07:03.553
that I again quitted 

06:07:05.882 --> 06:07:10.763
my native country.and Elizabeth 
therefore acquiesced, but she 

06:07:10.764 --> 06:07:12.400
was filled with disquiet at the 
idea of my suffering, away from 

06:07:12.401 --> 06:07:15.042
her, the inroads of misery and 
grief.

06:07:20.761 --> 06:07:22.411
a companion in Clerval—and yet a
man is blind to a thousand 

06:07:22.412 --> 06:07:22.820
minute circumstances which call 
forth a woman's sedulous 

06:07:22.821 --> 06:07:25.054

emotions rendered her mute as

she bade me a tearful, silent 
farewell.was to convey me away, 

06:07:27.117 --> 06:07:28.745
hardly knowing whither I was 
going, and careless of what was 

06:07:28.746 --> 06:07:30.746
passing around.

06:07:34.065 --> 06:07:34.468
bitter anguish that I reflected 
on it, to order that my chemical

06:07:34.469 --> 06:07:36.469
instruments should be packed to 
go with me.

06:07:41.463 --> 06:07:45.596
passed through many beautiful 
and majestic scenes, but my eyes

06:07:41.463 --> 06:07:43.463
were fixed and unobserving.

06:07:45.503 --> 06:07:46.763
travels and the work which was 
to occupy me whilst they 

06:07:46.764 --> 06:07:48.764
endured.

06:07:50.428 --> 06:07:53.106
indolence, during which I 
traversed many leagues, I 

06:07:53.107 --> 06:07:55.107
arrived at Strasburgh, where 

06:07:56.112 --> 06:07:58.112
I 

06:08:12.848 --> 06:08:14.848
waited two days for Clerval.

06:08:26.495 --> 06:08:28.517
when he saw the beauties of the 
setting sun, and more happy when

06:08:28.518 --> 06:08:30.518
he beheld it 

06:08:31.540 --> 06:08:33.540

06:08:39.574 --> 06:08:41.574
appearances of the sky.

06:08:46.274 --> 06:08:48.274
wherefore are you desponding and

06:08:51.821 --> 06:08:53.821
sorrowful!” In truth, I was 
occupied by gloomy 

06:08:55.856 --> 06:08:57.856
thoughts and 

06:08:59.542 --> 06:09:01.542
neither saw the descent of the 

06:09:07.380 --> 06:09:09.380
evening star nor the golden 

06:09:10.893 --> 06:09:12.893
sunrise reflected in the Rhine.

06:09:22.545 --> 06:09:23.964
more amused with the journal of 
Clerval, who observed the 

06:09:23.965 --> 06:09:26.202
scenery with an eye of feeling 
and delight, than in I, a 

06:09:26.203 --> 06:09:26.611
miserable wretch, haunted by a 
curse that shut up every avenue

06:10:01.859 --> 06:10:03.859
precipices, surrounded by black 

06:10:08.363 --> 06:10:10.363
woods, high and inaccessible.

06:10:12.650 --> 06:10:14.650
presents a singularly variegated
landscape.

06:10:15.864 --> 06:10:16.886

tremendous precipices, with the 

06:10:16.887 --> 06:10:18.887
dark Rhine rushing beneath; and 
on the sudden turn of a 

06:10:19.909 --> 06:10:21.909
promontory, 

06:10:23.735 --> 06:10:25.735
flourishing vineyards with green

06:10:35.534 --> 06:10:35.936
sloping banks and a meandering 
river and populous towns occupy 

06:10:35.937 --> 06:10:37.937
the scene.

06:10:39.856 --> 06:10:40.875
Even I, depressed in mind, and 
my spirits continually agitated 

06:10:40.876 --> 06:10:42.876
by gloomy feelings, even I was 
pleased.

06:10:46.592 --> 06:10:47.401
and as I gazed on the cloudless 
blue sky, I seemed to drink in a

06:10:47.402 --> 06:10:49.402
tranquillity to which I had long
been a stranger.

06:11:14.923 --> 06:11:16.923

tasted by man.

most beautiful scenes of my own 

06:11:29.880 --> 06:11:31.880
country; I have visited the 
lakes of 

06:11:32.887 --> 06:11:35.819
Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy
mountains descend almost 

06:11:36.228 --> 06:11:38.459
perpendicularly to the water, 
casting black and impenetrable 

06:11:38.460 --> 06:11:40.916
shades, which would cause a 
gloomy and mournful appearance 

06:11:40.917 --> 06:11:42.917
were it not for the most verdant
islands that relieve the eye by 

06:11:45.182 --> 06:11:47.182
their gay appearance; I have 
seen this 

06:11:48.503 --> 06:11:48.904
lake agitated by a tempest, when
the wind tore up whirlwinds of 

06:11:48.905 --> 06:11:50.905
water and 

06:11:51.910 --> 06:11:54.814
gave you an idea of what the 
water-spout must be on the 

06:11:57.827 --> 06:11:59.517
great ocean; and the waves dash 
with fury the base of the 

06:11:59.518 --> 06:12:00.533
mountain, where the priest and 
his mistress were overwhelmed by

06:12:00.534 --> 06:12:01.753
an avalanche and where their 
dying voices are still said to 

06:12:01.754 --> 06:12:02.765
be heard amid the pauses of the 
nightly wind; I have seen the 

06:12:02.766 --> 06:12:03.820
mountains of La Valais, and the 
Pays de Vaud; but this country, 

06:12:03.821 --> 06:12:05.821
Victor, pleases me more than 

06:12:06.822 --> 06:12:08.822
all

06:12:21.772 --> 06:12:23.772
those wonders.

there is a charm in the banks of

before saw equalled.precipice;

almost concealed amongst the 

06:12:37.554 --> 06:12:39.342
foliage of those lovely trees; 
and now that group of labourers 

06:12:39.343 --> 06:12:40.374
coming from among their vines; 
and that village half hid in the

06:12:40.375 --> 06:12:42.375
recess of the mountain.

imagination was chastened by the

06:13:05.584 --> 06:13:07.584
sensibility of his heart.

06:13:12.950 --> 06:13:17.150
affections, and his friendship 
was of that devoted and wondrous

06:13:12.950 --> 06:13:16.204
nature that the worldly-minded 
teach us to look for only in the

06:13:16.205 --> 06:13:18.205
imagination.

mind.

gloomy wood, Their colours and

their forms,

were then to him

06:13:56.456 --> 06:13:58.101
An appetite; a feeling, and a 
love, That had no need of a

magnificent, which formed a 

06:14:13.407 --> 06:14:15.932
world, whose existence depended 
on the life of its creator;—has 

06:14:18.562 --> 06:14:20.562
this mind perished?

06:14:28.263 --> 06:14:30.722
divinely wrought, and beaming 
with beauty, has decayed, but 

06:14:30.723 --> 06:14:32.723
your spirit 

06:14:35.363 --> 06:14:37.363
still visits and consoles your 
unhappy friend.

06:14:39.780 --> 06:14:41.834
ineffectual words are but a 
slight tribute to the unexampled

06:14:41.835 --> 06:14:43.835
worth of 

06:14:46.143 --> 06:14:48.176
Henry, but they soothe my heart,
overflowing with the anguish 

06:14:48.177 --> 06:14:50.177
which his remembrance creates.

06:15:00.382 --> 06:15:03.069
plains of Holland; and we 
resolved to post the remainder 

06:15:03.070 --> 06:15:05.070
of our way, for the 

06:15:07.797 --> 06:15:11.997
wind was contrary and the stream
of the river was too gentle to 

06:15:07.797 --> 06:15:09.797
aid us.

06:15:15.336 --> 06:15:17.835
arising from beautiful scenery, 
but we arrived in a few days at 

06:15:17.836 --> 06:15:20.098
Rotterdam, whence we proceeded 
by sea to England.

06:15:26.856 --> 06:15:28.901
latter days of December, that I 
first saw the white cliffs of 

06:15:28.902 --> 06:15:30.902
Britain.

06:15:35.459 --> 06:15:37.459
scene; they were flat but 
fertile, and 

06:15:39.542 --> 06:15:41.542
almost every town was marked by 
the remembrance of some story.

06:15:46.486 --> 06:15:48.486
Spanish Armada, Gravesend, 
Woolwich, and 

06:15:50.769 --> 06:15:52.769
Greenwich—places which I had 
heard of even in my country.

06:15:56.838 --> 06:15:58.159
Paul's towering above all, and 
the Tower famed in English 

06:15:58.160 --> 06:16:00.160
history.

06:16:07.850 --> 06:16:08.466
London was our present point of 
rest; we determined to remain 

06:16:08.467 --> 06:16:10.467
several months in this wonderful
and celebrated city.

06:16:13.509 --> 06:16:16.209
men of genius and talent who 
flourished at this time, but 

06:16:16.210 --> 06:16:18.479
this was with me a secondary 
object; I was 

06:16:23.386 --> 06:16:26.345
principally occupied with the 
means of obtaining the 

06:16:26.346 --> 06:16:30.137
information necessary for the 
completion of my promise and 

06:16:30.138 --> 06:16:32.190
quickly availed myself of the 
letters of introduction that I 

06:16:32.191 --> 06:16:34.191
had 

06:16:37.494 --> 06:16:39.129
brought with me, addressed to 
the most distinguished natural 

06:16:39.130 --> 06:16:41.130
philosophers.

06:16:44.870 --> 06:16:46.870
my days of study and happiness, 
it would 

06:16:49.131 --> 06:16:51.131
have afforded me inexpressible 
pleasure.

06:16:54.848 --> 06:16:57.512
existence, and I only visited 
these people for the sake of the

06:16:57.513 --> 06:17:00.171
information they might give me 
on the subject in 

06:17:04.471 --> 06:17:06.471
which my interest was so 
terribly profound.

06:17:10.225 --> 06:17:12.874
I could fill my mind with the 
sights of heaven and earth; the 

06:17:12.875 --> 06:17:18.182
voice of Henry soothed me, and I
could thus cheat myself into a 

06:17:18.183 --> 06:17:20.183
transitory peace.

06:17:25.539 --> 06:17:27.539
brought back despair to my 
heart.

06:17:31.481 --> 06:17:32.697
between me and my fellow men; 
this barrier was sealed with the

06:17:32.698 --> 06:17:33.522
blood of William and Justine, 
and to reflect on the events 

06:17:33.523 --> 06:17:35.771
connected with those names 
filled my soul with anguish.

06:17:41.052 --> 06:17:43.718
former self; he was inquisitive 
and anxious to gain experience 

06:17:43.719 --> 06:17:45.719
and instruction.

06:17:50.489 --> 06:17:52.721
observed was to him an 
inexhaustible source of 

06:17:52.722 --> 06:17:54.722
instruction and amusement.

06:18:04.751 --> 06:18:06.987
belief that he had in his 
knowledge of its various 

06:18:06.988 --> 06:18:08.988
languages, and in the views 

06:18:12.191 --> 06:18:14.834
he had taken of its society, the
means of materially assisting 

06:18:14.835 --> 06:18:17.309
the progress of European 
colonization and trade.I tried 

06:18:17.310 --> 06:18:17.723
to conceal this as much as 
possible, that I might not debar

06:18:17.724 --> 06:18:18.342
him from the pleasures natural 
to one who was entering on a new

06:18:18.343 --> 06:18:19.351
scene of life, I often refused 
to accompany him, alleging 

06:18:19.352 --> 06:18:21.352
another engagement, that I might
remain alone.

06:18:25.585 --> 06:18:27.824
materials necessary for my new 
creation, and this was to me 

06:18:27.825 --> 06:18:29.825
like the torture of 

06:18:30.865 --> 06:18:33.090
single drops of water 
continually falling on the head.

06:18:38.981 --> 06:18:41.479
was an extreme anguish, and 
every word that I spoke in 

06:18:41.480 --> 06:18:43.480
allusion to it caused my 

06:18:46.307 --> 06:18:48.307
lips to quiver, and my heart to 
palpitate.

06:18:51.001 --> 06:18:53.658
received a letter from a person 
in Scotland who had formerly 

06:18:53.659 --> 06:18:56.346
been our visitor at Geneva.

06:19:02.842 --> 06:19:04.842
country and asked us if those 
were not 

06:19:05.844 --> 06:19:09.060
sufficient allurements to induce
us to prolong our journey as far

06:19:09.061 --> 06:19:11.061
north as Perth, where he 
resided.

06:19:15.882 --> 06:19:17.882
invitation, and I, although I 
abhorred 

06:19:21.380 --> 06:19:23.400
society, wished to view again 
mountains and streams and all 

06:19:23.401 --> 06:19:25.483
the wondrous works with which 
Nature adorns her chosen 

06:19:25.484 --> 06:19:27.484
dwelling-places.

06:19:32.826 --> 06:19:34.826
beginning of October, and it was
now February.

06:19:38.746 --> 06:19:40.780
our journey towards the north at
the expiration of another month.

06:19:47.074 --> 06:19:49.074
follow the great road to 
Edinburgh, but 

06:19:50.345 --> 06:19:53.945
to visit Windsor, Oxford, 
Matlock, and the Cumberland 

06:19:50.345 --> 06:19:54.211
lakes, resolving to arrive at 
the completion of this tour 

06:19:50.345 --> 06:19:52.350
about the end of July.the 
materials I had collected, 

06:19:52.351 --> 06:19:55.198
resolving to finish my labours 
in some obscure nook in the 

06:19:55.199 --> 06:19:57.199
northern highlands of Scotland.

06:20:02.054 --> 06:20:04.093
and remained a few days at 
Windsor, rambling in its 

06:20:04.094 --> 06:20:06.094
beautiful forest.

06:21:00.678 --> 06:21:01.284
mountaineers; the majestic oaks,
the quantity of game, and the 

06:21:01.285 --> 06:21:03.285
herds of stately deer were all 
novelties to us.

06:21:04.985 --> 06:21:08.718
filled with the remembrance of 
the events that had been 

06:21:04.985 --> 06:21:07.013
transacted there more than a 
century and a half before. Had 

06:21:07.014 --> 06:21:09.014
collected his forces.after the 
whole nation had forsaken his 

06:21:09.081 --> 06:21:11.322
cause to join the standard of 
Parliament and liberty.his 

06:21:11.323 --> 06:21:11.723
companions, the amiable 
Falkland, the insolent Goring, 

06:21:11.724 --> 06:21:13.360
his queen, and son, gave a 
peculiar interest to every part 

06:21:13.361 --> 06:21:15.361
of the city which they might be 
supposed to have inhabited.

06:21:15.447 --> 06:21:17.075
dwelling here, and we delighted 
to trace its footsteps.imaginary

06:21:17.076 --> 06:21:18.113
gratification, the appearance of
the city had yet in itself 

06:21:18.114 --> 06:21:19.741
sufficient beauty to obtain our 
admiration.picturesque; the 

06:21:19.742 --> 06:21:22.736
streets are almost magnificent; 
and the 

06:21:47.161 --> 06:21:47.775
lovely Isis, which flows beside 
it through meadows of exquisite 

06:21:47.776 --> 06:21:48.796
verdure, is spread forth into a 
placid expanse of waters, which 

06:21:48.797 --> 06:21:50.797
reflects its majestic assemblage
of towers, and spires, and 

06:21:51.478 --> 06:21:53.478
domes, embosomed among aged 
trees.

06:21:59.428 --> 06:22:02.134
enjoyment was embittered both by
the memory of the past and the 

06:22:02.135 --> 06:22:04.135
anticipation of the future.

06:22:11.093 --> 06:22:13.093
never visited my mind, and if I 
was ever 

06:22:16.371 --> 06:22:18.995
overcome byennui, the sight of 
what is beautiful in nature or 

06:22:18.996 --> 06:22:24.337
the study of what is excellent 
and sublime in the productions 

06:22:24.338 --> 06:22:26.370
of man could always interest my 
heart and communicate elasticity

06:22:26.371 --> 06:22:28.403
to my spirits.

06:22:33.886 --> 06:22:36.517
entered my soul; and I felt then
that I should survive to exhibit

06:22:36.518 --> 06:22:38.518
what I shall 

06:22:40.661 --> 06:22:43.294
soon cease to be—a miserable 
spectacle of wrecked humanity, 

06:22:43.295 --> 06:22:45.295
pitiable to others and 
intolerable to myself.

06:22:51.298 --> 06:22:53.331
Oxford, rambling among its 
environs and endeavouring to 

06:22:53.332 --> 06:22:55.968
identify every spot which might 
relate to the most animating 

06:22:58.050 --> 06:23:00.050
epoch of English history.

06:23:05.022 --> 06:23:07.053
often prolonged by the 
successive objects that 

06:23:07.054 --> 06:23:09.054
presented themselves.

06:23:12.973 --> 06:23:15.007
Hampden and the field on which 
that patriot fell.

06:23:20.301 --> 06:23:22.953
its debasing and miserable fears
to contemplate the divine ideas 

06:23:22.954 --> 06:23:24.954
of liberty 

06:23:28.352 --> 06:23:30.988
and self-sacrifice of which 
these sights were the monuments 

06:23:30.989 --> 06:23:32.989
and the remembrancers.

06:23:37.730 --> 06:23:40.385
chains and look around me with a
free and lofty spirit, but the 

06:23:40.386 --> 06:23:42.386
iron had eaten 

06:23:45.268 --> 06:23:47.913
into my flesh, and I sank again,
trembling and hopeless, into my 

06:23:47.914 --> 06:23:49.914
miserable self.

06:23:53.629 --> 06:23:55.629
proceeded to Matlock, which was 
our next place of rest.

06:24:00.589 --> 06:24:03.254
this village resembled, to a 
greater degree, the scenery of 

06:24:03.255 --> 06:24:05.928
Switzerland; but everything is 
on a lower scale, and the 

06:24:11.028 --> 06:24:13.725
green hills want the crown of 
distant white Alps which always 

06:24:13.726 --> 06:24:15.752
attend on the piny mountains of 
my native country.

06:24:22.264 --> 06:24:24.906
little cabinets of natural 
history, where the curiosities 

06:24:24.907 --> 06:24:30.023
are disposed in the same manner 
as in the collections at Servox 

06:24:30.024 --> 06:24:32.024
and Chamounix.

06:24:36.571 --> 06:24:39.241
pronounced by Henry, and I 
hastened to quit Matlock, with 

06:24:39.242 --> 06:24:41.242
which that terrible 

06:24:42.390 --> 06:24:44.390
scene was thus associated.

06:24:47.571 --> 06:24:49.571
northwards, we passed two months
in Cumberland and Westmorland.

06:24:59.872 --> 06:25:01.911
lingered on the northern sides 
of the mountains, the lakes, and

06:25:01.912 --> 06:25:03.912
the dashing of 

06:25:07.194 --> 06:25:09.194
the rocky streams were all 
familiar and dear sights to me.

06:25:14.528 --> 06:25:16.528
who almost contrived to cheat me
into happiness.

06:25:19.457 --> 06:25:21.990
proportionably greater than 
mine; his mind expanded in the 

06:25:21.991 --> 06:25:24.654
company of men of talent, and he
found in his own nature 

06:25:29.955 --> 06:25:32.560
greater capacities and resources
than he could have imagined 

06:25:32.561 --> 06:25:34.793
himself to have possessed while 
he associated with his 

06:25:34.794 --> 06:25:36.794
inferiors.

06:25:43.851 --> 06:25:45.898
me; “and among these mountains I
should scarcely 

06:25:49.553 --> 06:25:52.220
But he found that a traveller's 
life is one that includes much 

06:25:52.221 --> 06:25:54.221
pain amidst its enjoyments.

06:25:59.581 --> 06:26:01.890
stretch; and when he begins to 
sink into repose, he finds 

06:26:01.891 --> 06:26:03.891
himself obliged to quit 

06:26:06.936 --> 06:26:09.185
that on which he rests in 
pleasure for something new, 

06:26:09.186 --> 06:26:11.641
which again engages his 
attention, and which also he 

06:26:11.642 --> 06:26:13.889
forsakes for other novelties.

06:26:19.173 --> 06:26:21.173
lakes of Cumberland and 
Westmorland and 

06:26:23.449 --> 06:26:26.076
conceived an affection for some 
of the inhabitants when the 

06:26:26.077 --> 06:26:31.234
period of our appointment with 
our Scotch friend approached, 

06:26:31.235 --> 06:26:33.235
and we left them to travel on.

06:26:40.864 --> 06:26:42.864
time, and I feared the effects 
of the daemon's disappointment.

06:26:48.809 --> 06:26:50.809
wreak his vengeance on my 
relatives.

06:26:53.471 --> 06:26:55.704
at every moment from which I 
might otherwise have snatched 

06:26:55.705 --> 06:26:57.705
repose and peace.

06:27:02.459 --> 06:27:05.112
impatience; if they were delayed
I was miserable and overcome by 

06:27:05.113 --> 06:27:07.113
a thousand 

06:27:10.456 --> 06:27:13.106
fears; and when they arrived and
I saw the superscription of 

06:27:13.107 --> 06:27:15.752
Elizabeth or my father, I hardly
dared to read and ascertain my 

06:27:15.753 --> 06:27:17.753
fate.

06:27:22.077 --> 06:27:24.106
followed me and might expedite 
my remissness by murdering my 

06:27:24.107 --> 06:27:26.107
companion.

06:27:31.871 --> 06:27:33.682
would not quit Henry for a 
moment, but followed him as his 

06:27:33.683 --> 06:27:36.345
shadow, to protect him from the 
fancied rage of his destroyer.

06:27:43.360 --> 06:27:45.371
crime, the consciousness of 
which haunted me.

06:27:50.215 --> 06:27:52.865
down a horrible curse upon my 
head, as mortal as that of 

06:27:52.866 --> 06:27:54.866
crime.

06:28:00.126 --> 06:28:01.868
and mind; and yet that city 
might have interested the most 

06:28:01.869 --> 06:28:03.869
unfortunate being.

06:28:08.625 --> 06:28:09.037
Oxford, for the antiquity of the
latter city was more pleasing to

06:28:09.038 --> 06:28:11.038
him.

06:28:14.536 --> 06:28:14.941
new town of Edinburgh, its 
romantic castle and its 

06:28:14.942 --> 06:28:16.942
environs, the most delightful in
the world, Arthur's Seat, St.

06:28:16.983 --> 06:28:17.391
Bernard's Well, and the Pentland
Hills, compensated him for the 

06:28:17.392 --> 06:28:19.392
change and filled him with 
cheerfulness and admiration.

06:28:20.252 --> 06:28:22.304
Andrew's, and along the banks of
the But I was in no mood to 

06:28:22.305 --> 06:28:26.371
laugh and talk with strangers or
enter into their feelings or 

06:28:22.305 --> 06:28:25.905
plans with the good humour 
expected from a guest; and 

06:28:22.305 --> 06:28:25.557
accordingly I I may be absent a 
month or two; but do not 

06:28:25.558 --> 06:28:26.167
interfere with my motions, I 
entreat you; leave me to peace 

06:28:26.168 --> 06:28:30.654
and solitude for a short time; 
and when I return, I hope it 

06:28:30.655 --> 06:28:31.456
will be with a lighter heart, 
more congenial to your own 

06:28:31.457 --> 06:28:33.457
temper.

06:28:35.339 --> 06:28:37.402
Henry wished to dissuade me, but
seeing me bent on this plan, 

06:28:37.403 --> 06:28:39.403
ceased to remonstrate.

06:28:46.444 --> 06:28:48.520
“in your solitary rambles, than 
with these Scotch people, whom I

06:28:48.521 --> 06:28:50.521
do not know; 

06:28:54.857 --> 06:28:57.510
that I may again feel myself 
somewhat at home, which I cannot

06:28:57.511 --> 06:28:59.511
do in your absence.

06:29:01.234 --> 06:29:03.891
Having parted from my friend, I 
determined to visit some remote 

06:29:03.892 --> 06:29:06.523
spot of Scotland and finish my 
work in solitude.

06:29:11.705 --> 06:29:13.949
followed me and would discover 
himself to me when I should have

06:29:13.950 --> 06:29:16.583
finished, that he might receive 
his companion.

06:29:23.343 --> 06:29:25.986
northern highlands and fixed on 
one of the remotest of the 

06:29:25.987 --> 06:29:27.987
Orkneys as the scene of my 
labours.

06:29:33.535 --> 06:29:35.147
being hardly more than a rock 
whose high sides were 

06:29:35.148 --> 06:29:37.847
continually beaten upon by the 
waves.

06:29:42.506 --> 06:29:45.169
pasture for a few miserable 
cows, and oatmeal for its 

06:29:45.170 --> 06:29:47.203
inhabitants, which consisted of 
five persons, whose gaunt 

06:29:51.909 --> 06:29:53.739
and scraggy limbs gave tokens of
their miserable fare.indulged in

06:29:53.740 --> 06:29:54.147
such luxuries, and even fresh 
water, was to be procured from 

06:29:54.148 --> 06:29:56.148
the mainland, which was about 
five miles distant.

06:30:00.657 --> 06:30:02.698
three miserable huts, and one of
these was vacant when I arrived.

06:30:08.654 --> 06:30:10.691
exhibited all the squalidness of
the most miserable penury.

06:30:16.584 --> 06:30:18.584
were unplastered, and the door 
was off its hinges.

06:30:22.754 --> 06:30:25.606
some furniture, and took 
possession, an incident which 

06:30:25.607 --> 06:30:28.365
would doubtless have occasioned 
some surprise had not all the 

06:30:32.906 --> 06:30:34.536
senses of the cottagers been 
benumbed by want and squalid 

06:30:34.537 --> 06:30:36.537
poverty.

06:30:39.694 --> 06:30:41.944
unmolested, hardly thanked for 
the pittance of food and clothes

06:30:41.945 --> 06:30:46.667
which I gave, so much does 
suffering blunt even the 

06:30:46.668 --> 06:30:48.668
coarsest sensations of men.

06:30:53.615 --> 06:30:55.615
to labour; but in the evening, 
when the 

06:30:57.693 --> 06:31:00.343
weather permitted, I walked on 
the stony beach of the sea to 

06:31:00.344 --> 06:31:02.344
listen to the waves as they 
roared and dashed at my feet.

06:31:12.006 --> 06:31:14.006
different from this desolate and
appalling landscape.

06:31:18.345 --> 06:31:20.345
its cottages are scattered 
thickly in the plains.

06:31:24.776 --> 06:31:26.847
gentle sky, and when troubled by
the winds, their tumult is but 

06:31:26.848 --> 06:31:28.848
as the play 

06:31:31.574 --> 06:31:35.640
of a lively infant when compared
to the roarings of the giant 

06:31:31.574 --> 06:31:33.574
ocean.

06:31:38.528 --> 06:31:40.528
occupations when I first 
arrived, but as 

06:31:41.888 --> 06:31:43.886
I proceeded in my labour, it 
became every day more horrible 

06:31:43.887 --> 06:31:45.887
and irksome to me.

06:31:48.631 --> 06:31:48.843
to enter my laboratory for 
several days, and at other times

06:31:48.844 --> 06:31:50.864
I toiled day and night in order 
to complete my work.enthusiastic

06:31:50.865 --> 06:31:51.275
frenzy had blinded me to the 
horror of my employment; my mind

06:31:51.276 --> 06:31:53.929
was intently fixed on the 
consummation of my 

06:31:58.845 --> 06:32:00.845
labour, and my eyes were shut to
the horror of my proceedings.

06:32:04.593 --> 06:32:06.690
my heart often sickened at the 
work of my hands.

06:32:11.402 --> 06:32:13.453
detestable occupation, immersed 
in a solitude where nothing 

06:32:13.454 --> 06:32:15.454
could for an 

06:32:17.327 --> 06:32:19.361
instant call my attention from 
the actual scene in which I was 

06:32:19.362 --> 06:32:23.090
engaged, my spirits became 
unequal; I grew restless and 

06:32:23.091 --> 06:32:25.091
nervous.

06:32:31.094 --> 06:32:33.142
the ground, fearing to raise 
them lest they should encounter 

06:32:33.143 --> 06:32:35.791
the object which I so much 
dreaded to behold.

06:32:41.137 --> 06:32:43.183
fellow creatures lest when alone
he should come to claim his 

06:32:43.184 --> 06:32:45.184
companion.

06:32:47.908 --> 06:32:49.908
labour was already considerably 
advanced.

06:32:52.589 --> 06:32:53.251
with a tremulous and eager hope,
which I dared not trust myself 

06:32:53.252 --> 06:32:54.867
to question but which was 
intermixed with obscure 

06:32:54.868 --> 06:32:56.868
forebodings of evil that made my
heart sicken in my bosom.

06:33:07.610 --> 06:33:09.628
sun had set, and the moon was 
just rising from the sea; I had 

06:33:09.629 --> 06:33:12.353
not sufficient light for my 
employment, and 

06:33:16.430 --> 06:33:18.667
I remained idle, in a pause of 
consideration of whether I 

06:33:18.668 --> 06:33:23.371
should leave my labour for the 
night or hasten its conclusion 

06:33:23.372 --> 06:33:26.053
by an unremitting attention to 
it.

06:33:31.350 --> 06:33:33.997
occurred to me which led me to 
consider the effects of what I 

06:33:33.998 --> 06:33:35.998
was now doing.

06:33:39.319 --> 06:33:41.319
the same manner and had created 
a fiend 

06:33:42.993 --> 06:33:45.652
whose unparalleled barbarity had
desolated my heart and filled it

06:33:45.653 --> 06:33:47.653
for ever with the bitterest 
remorse.

06:33:53.028 --> 06:33:55.075
of whose dispositions I was 
alike ignorant; she might become

06:33:55.076 --> 06:33:57.076
ten thousand 

06:33:59.984 --> 06:34:01.924
times more malignant than her 
mate and delight, for its own 

06:34:01.925 --> 06:34:03.925
sake, in murder and 
wretchedness.

06:34:08.271 --> 06:34:10.271
of man and hide himself in 
deserts, but 

06:34:13.147 --> 06:34:14.778
she had not; and she, who in all
probability was to become a 

06:34:14.779 --> 06:34:17.416
thinking and reasoning animal, 
might refuse to comply 

06:34:21.523 --> 06:34:23.523
with a compact made before her 
creation.

06:34:27.452 --> 06:34:29.489
creature who already lived 
loathed his own deformity, and 

06:34:29.490 --> 06:34:32.133
might he not conceive a greater 
abhorrence for it when it came 

06:34:36.809 --> 06:34:38.809
before his eyes in the female 
form?

06:34:42.138 --> 06:34:44.792
him to the superior beauty of 
man; she might quit him, and he 

06:34:44.793 --> 06:34:46.793
be again alone, 

06:34:49.844 --> 06:34:51.844
exasperated by the fresh 
provocation of 

06:34:53.855 --> 06:34:56.493
Even if they were to leave 
Europe and inhabit the deserts 

06:34:56.494 --> 06:34:58.494
of the new world, 

06:35:00.171 --> 06:35:02.873
yet one of the first results of 
those sympathies for which the 

06:35:02.874 --> 06:35:04.904
daemon thirsted would be 
children, and a race of devils 

06:35:09.600 --> 06:35:11.827
would be propagated upon the 
earth who might make the very 

06:35:11.828 --> 06:35:14.531
existence of the species of man 
a condition precarious and full 

06:35:14.532 --> 06:35:16.532
of terror.

06:35:21.283 --> 06:35:23.283
inflict this curse upon 
everlasting generations?

06:35:27.706 --> 06:35:29.706
of the being I had created; I 
had been 

06:35:31.406 --> 06:35:34.005
struck senseless by his fiendish
threats; but now, for the first 

06:35:34.006 --> 06:35:36.070
time, the wickedness of my 
promise burst upon 

06:35:40.372 --> 06:35:42.449
me; I shuddered to think that 
future ages might curse me as 

06:35:42.450 --> 06:35:44.568
their pest, whose selfishness 
had not hesitated to buy its 

06:35:49.880 --> 06:35:51.524
own peace at the price, perhaps,
of the existence of the whole 

06:35:51.525 --> 06:35:53.525
human race.

06:35:56.855 --> 06:35:59.491
me, when, on looking up, I saw 
by the light of the moon the 

06:35:59.492 --> 06:36:01.492
daemon at the casement.

06:36:06.425 --> 06:36:08.437
gazed on me, where I sat 
fulfilling the task which he had

06:36:08.438 --> 06:36:10.438
allotted to me.

06:36:13.654 --> 06:36:15.654
he had loitered in forests, hid 
himself 

06:36:18.379 --> 06:36:20.670
in caves, or taken refuge in 
wide and desert heaths; and he 

06:36:20.671 --> 06:36:23.144
now came to mark my progress and
claim the fulfilment of my 

06:36:23.145 --> 06:36:25.145
promise.

06:36:26.867 --> 06:36:27.481
on my promise of creating 
another like to him, and 

06:36:27.482 --> 06:36:27.642
trembling with passion, tore to 
pieces the thing on which I was 

06:36:27.643 --> 06:36:29.935
engaged.on whose future 
existence he depended for 

06:36:29.936 --> 06:36:30.547
happiness, and with a howl of 
devilish despair and revenge, 

06:36:30.548 --> 06:36:32.548
withdrew.

06:36:36.036 --> 06:36:38.036
made a solemn vow in my own 
heart never 

06:36:40.332 --> 06:36:42.332
to resume my labours; and then, 
with 

06:36:45.566 --> 06:36:47.696
I was alone; none were near me 
to dissipate the gloom and 

06:36:47.697 --> 06:36:52.404
relieve me from the sickening 
oppression of the most terrible 

06:36:52.405 --> 06:36:54.405
reveries.

06:36:57.869 --> 06:36:59.869
near my window gazing on the 
sea; it was 

06:37:01.981 --> 06:37:04.023
almost motionless, for the winds
were hushed, and all nature 

06:37:04.024 --> 06:37:06.024
reposed under the eye of the 
quiet moon.

06:37:10.959 --> 06:37:13.605
water, and now and then the 
gentle breeze wafted the sound 

06:37:13.606 --> 06:37:15.665
of voices as the fishermen 
called to one another.

06:37:22.583 --> 06:37:24.654
hardly conscious of its extreme 
profundity, until my ear was 

06:37:24.655 --> 06:37:28.949
suddenly arrested by the 
paddling of oars near the shore,

06:37:28.950 --> 06:37:31.590
and a person landed close to my 
house.

06:37:36.870 --> 06:37:39.550
creaking of my door, as if some 
one endeavoured to open it 

06:37:39.551 --> 06:37:41.551
softly.

06:37:44.794 --> 06:37:47.431
presentiment of who it was and 
wished to rouse one of the 

06:37:47.432 --> 06:37:49.432
peasants who dwelt in a 

06:37:51.702 --> 06:37:54.353
cottage not far from mine; but I
was overcome by the sensation of

06:37:56.381 --> 06:37:59.029
helplessness, so often felt in 
frightful dreams, when you in 

06:37:59.030 --> 06:38:03.780
vain endeavour to fly from an 
impending danger, and was rooted

06:38:03.781 --> 06:38:05.781
to the spot.

06:38:10.380 --> 06:38:12.391
footsteps along the passage; the
door opened, and the wretch whom

06:38:12.392 --> 06:38:14.392
I dreaded appeared.

06:38:18.745 --> 06:38:20.798
said in a smothered voice, “You 
have destroyed the work which 

06:38:20.799 --> 06:38:23.457
you began; what is it that you 
intend?

06:38:31.251 --> 06:38:33.547
Switzerland with you; I crept 
along the shores of the Rhine, 

06:38:33.548 --> 06:38:35.548
among its willow 

06:38:36.548 --> 06:38:38.548
islands and over the summits of 
its hills.

06:38:43.624 --> 06:38:45.624
of England and among the deserts
of Scotland.

06:38:49.367 --> 06:38:51.367
and cold, and hunger; do you 
dare destroy my hopes?

06:38:56.133 --> 06:38:58.355
create another like yourself, 
equal in deformity and 

06:38:58.356 --> 06:39:00.356
wickedness.

06:39:02.027 --> 06:39:04.027
“Slave, I before reasoned with 
you, but 

06:39:05.689 --> 06:39:07.689
you have proved yourself 
unworthy of my condescension.

06:39:11.593 --> 06:39:14.276
yourself miserable, but I can 
make you so wretched that the 

06:39:14.277 --> 06:39:16.942
light of day will be hateful to 
you.

06:39:23.267 --> 06:39:24.726
“The hour of my irresolution is 
past, and the period of your 

06:39:24.727 --> 06:39:26.727
power is arrived.

06:39:30.673 --> 06:39:32.673
act of wickedness; but they 
confirm me 

06:39:34.339 --> 06:39:37.939
in a determination of not 
creating you a companion in 

06:39:34.339 --> 06:39:36.339
vice.

06:39:40.111 --> 06:39:42.111
the earth a daemon whose delight
is in 

06:39:43.127 --> 06:39:45.127
death and wretchedness?

06:39:52.155 --> 06:39:54.155
&gt;&gt; We will now take another 20 
minute break. Thank you.

07:01:45.120 --> 07:01:49.386
The monster saw my determination
in my face and gnashed his teeth

07:01:45.120 --> 07:01:47.120
in the impotence of anger.

07:01:49.027 --> 07:01:50.853
wife for his bosom, and each 
beast have his mate, and I be 

07:01:50.854 --> 07:01:52.854
alone?

07:01:57.193 --> 07:01:59.193
were requited by detestation and
scorn.

07:02:06.216 --> 07:02:08.443
misery, and soon the bolt will 
fall which must ravish from you 

07:02:08.444 --> 07:02:10.444
your happiness for ever.

07:02:14.761 --> 07:02:16.761
the intensity of my 
wretchedness?

07:02:20.063 --> 07:02:22.699
revenge remains—revenge, 
henceforth dearer than light or 

07:02:22.700 --> 07:02:24.700
food!

07:02:26.814 --> 07:02:28.814
tormentor, shall curse the sun 
that 

07:02:29.834 --> 07:02:31.834
gazes on your misery.

07:02:37.985 --> 07:02:39.985
snake, that I may sting with its
venom.

07:02:45.175 --> 07:02:47.022
“Devil, cease; and do not poison
the air with these sounds of 

07:02:47.023 --> 07:02:49.023
malice.

07:02:52.321 --> 07:02:54.321
and I am no coward to bend 
beneath words.

07:03:03.817 --> 07:03:05.817
I started forward and exclaimed,
“Villain!

07:03:11.364 --> 07:03:13.364
sure that you are yourself safe.

07:03:15.639 --> 07:03:18.121
I would have seized him, but he 
eluded me and quitted the house 

07:03:18.122 --> 07:03:20.122
with precipitation.

07:03:24.463 --> 07:03:27.112
which shot across the waters 
with an arrowy swiftness and was

07:03:27.113 --> 07:03:29.366
soon lost amidst the waves.

07:03:38.304 --> 07:03:40.304
murderer of my peace and 
precipitate him into the ocean.

07:03:45.274 --> 07:03:47.295
and perturbed, while my 
imagination conjured up a 

07:03:47.296 --> 07:03:49.358
thousand images to torment and 
sting me.

07:03:54.891 --> 07:03:56.891
with him in mortal strife?

07:03:59.363 --> 07:04:01.363
he had directed his course 
towards the mainland.

07:04:06.896 --> 07:04:08.896
next victim sacrificed to his 
insatiate revenge.

07:04:12.568 --> 07:04:15.250
words—“I will be with you on 
your wedding-night.” That, then,

07:04:15.251 --> 07:04:17.251
was the period fixed for the 
fulfilment of my destiny.

07:04:24.428 --> 07:04:26.428
satisfy and extinguish his 
malice.

07:04:29.479 --> 07:04:32.182
yet when I thought of my beloved
Elizabeth, of her tears and 

07:04:32.183 --> 07:04:34.419
endless sorrow, when she should 
find her lover 

07:04:38.629 --> 07:04:41.307
so barbarously snatched from 
her, tears, the first I had shed

07:04:41.308 --> 07:04:45.997
for many months, streamed from 
my eyes, and I resolved not to 

07:04:45.998 --> 07:04:48.632
fall before my enemy without a 
bitter struggle.

07:04:53.395 --> 07:04:56.048
from the ocean; my feelings 
became calmer, if it may be 

07:04:56.049 --> 07:04:58.692
called calmness when the 
violence of rage sinks into the 

07:05:01.341 --> 07:05:03.341
depths of despair.

07:05:06.620 --> 07:05:08.620
the last night's contention, and
walked 

07:05:11.299 --> 07:05:13.882
on the beach of the sea, which I
almost regarded as an 

07:05:13.883 --> 07:05:18.739
insuperable barrier between me 
and my fellow creatures; nay, a 

07:05:18.740 --> 07:05:20.740
wish that such should prove the 
fact stole across me.

07:05:25.726 --> 07:05:26.331
that barren rock, wearily, it is
true, but uninterrupted by any 

07:05:26.332 --> 07:05:27.557
sudden shock of misery.or to see
those whom I most loved die 

07:05:27.558 --> 07:05:29.558
under the grasp of a daemon whom
I had myself created.

07:05:33.476 --> 07:05:35.504
spectre, separated from all it 
loved and miserable in the 

07:05:35.505 --> 07:05:37.505
separation.

07:05:41.879 --> 07:05:43.914
higher, I lay down on the grass 
and was overpowered by a deep 

07:05:43.915 --> 07:05:45.915
sleep.

07:05:49.825 --> 07:05:51.861
preceding night, my nerves were 
agitated, and my eyes inflamed 

07:05:51.862 --> 07:05:53.862
by watching and misery.

07:05:59.300 --> 07:06:01.943
refreshed me; and when I awoke, 
I again felt as if I belonged to

07:06:01.944 --> 07:06:03.944
a race of human beings like 
myself, and I began to 

07:06:08.244 --> 07:06:10.989
reflect upon what had passed 
with greater composure; yet 

07:06:10.990 --> 07:06:13.106
still the words of the fiend 
rang in my ears like a 

07:06:15.763 --> 07:06:17.763
death-knell; they appeared like 
a dream, 

07:06:20.246 --> 07:06:22.246
yet distinct and oppressive as a
reality.

07:06:24.717 --> 07:06:26.717
sat on the shore, satisfying my 

07:06:27.864 --> 07:06:29.864
appetite, which had become 
ravenous, 

07:06:31.079 --> 07:06:33.738
with an oaten cake, when I saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, 

07:06:33.739 --> 07:06:38.837
and one of the men brought me a 
packet; it contained letters 

07:06:38.838 --> 07:06:40.838
from Geneva, and one 

07:06:42.718 --> 07:06:44.718
from Clerval entreating me to 
join him.

07:06:48.035 --> 07:06:50.100
time fruitlessly where he was, 
that letters from the friends he

07:06:50.101 --> 07:06:52.912
had formed in London desired his
return to complete 

07:06:57.583 --> 07:06:59.583
the negotiation they had entered
into for his Indian enterprise.

07:07:04.434 --> 07:07:06.434
departure; but as his journey to
London 

07:07:09.189 --> 07:07:11.885
might be followed, even sooner 
than he now conjectured, by his 

07:07:11.886 --> 07:07:16.047
longer voyage, he entreated me 
to bestow as much of my society 

07:07:16.048 --> 07:07:18.048
on him as I could spare.

07:07:22.376 --> 07:07:24.376
solitary isle and to meet him at
Perth, 

07:07:25.381 --> 07:07:27.381
that we might proceed southwards
together.

07:07:31.815 --> 07:07:33.235
life, and I determined to quit 
my island at the expiration of 

07:07:33.236 --> 07:07:34.845
two days.task to perform, on 
which I shuddered to reflect; I 

07:07:34.846 --> 07:07:38.246
must pack up my chemical 
instruments, and for that 

07:07:34.846 --> 07:07:36.265
purpose I must The next morning,
at daybreak, I summoned 

07:07:36.266 --> 07:07:37.494
sufficient courage and unlocked 
The remains of the half-finished

07:07:37.495 --> 07:07:37.698
creature, whom I had destroyed, 
lay scattered on the floor, and 

07:07:37.699 --> 07:07:38.098
I almost felt as if I had 
mangled the living flesh of a 

07:07:38.099 --> 07:07:40.099
human being.

07:07:48.074 --> 07:07:50.729
instruments out of the room, but
I reflected that I ought not to 

07:07:50.730 --> 07:07:52.769
leave the relics of my work to 
excite the horror 

07:07:57.047 --> 07:07:59.091
and suspicion of the peasants; 
and I accordingly put them into 

07:07:59.092 --> 07:08:01.172
a basket, with a great quantity 
of stones, and laying 

07:08:05.874 --> 07:08:08.142
them up, determined to throw 
them into the sea that very 

07:08:08.143 --> 07:08:12.218
night; and in the meantime I sat
upon the beach, employed in 

07:08:12.219 --> 07:08:14.219
cleaning and arranging my 
chemical apparatus.

07:08:20.358 --> 07:08:21.888
alteration that had taken place 
in my feelings since the night 

07:08:21.889 --> 07:08:23.889
of the appearance of the daemon.

07:08:29.374 --> 07:08:30.783
gloomy despair as a thing that, 
with whatever consequences, must

07:08:30.784 --> 07:08:33.023
be fulfilled; but I now felt as 
if a film 

07:08:37.711 --> 07:08:40.364
had been taken from before my 
eyes and that I for the first 

07:08:40.365 --> 07:08:42.365
time saw clearly.

07:08:45.707 --> 07:08:47.739
for one instant occur to me; the
threat I had heard weighed on my

07:08:47.740 --> 07:08:49.740
thoughts, but 

07:08:50.754 --> 07:08:52.477
I did not reflect that a 
voluntary act of mine could 

07:08:52.478 --> 07:08:54.478
avert it.

07:08:59.458 --> 07:09:01.526
create another like the fiend I 
had first made would be an act 

07:09:01.527 --> 07:09:04.174
of the basest and most atrocious
selfishness, and I banished from

07:09:04.175 --> 07:09:06.175
my mind every thought that could
lead to a different conclusion.

07:09:08.481 --> 07:09:11.133
the moon rose; and I then, 
putting my basket aboard a 

07:09:11.134 --> 07:09:13.196
little skiff, sailed out about 
four miles from the shore.

07:09:17.795 --> 07:09:19.795
boats were returning towards 
land, but I 

07:09:21.880 --> 07:09:23.880
sailed away from them.

07:09:27.598 --> 07:09:29.227
of a dreadful crime and avoided 
with shuddering anxiety any 

07:09:29.228 --> 07:09:31.916
encounter with my fellow 
creatures.

07:09:37.896 --> 07:09:39.733
been clear, was suddenly 
overspread by a thick cloud, and

07:09:39.734 --> 07:09:41.734
I took advantage of the 

07:09:44.433 --> 07:09:47.114
moment of darkness and cast my 
basket into the sea; I listened 

07:09:47.115 --> 07:09:49.146
to the gurgling sound as it sank
and then sailed away from the 

07:09:49.147 --> 07:09:51.147
spot.

07:09:56.675 --> 07:09:58.719
pure, although chilled by the 
northeast breeze that was then 

07:09:58.720 --> 07:10:00.720
rising.

07:10:03.616 --> 07:10:06.095
such agreeable sensations that I
resolved to prolong my stay on 

07:10:06.096 --> 07:10:08.096
the 

07:10:10.406 --> 07:10:12.450
water, and fixing the rudder in 
a direct position, stretched 

07:10:12.451 --> 07:10:14.451
myself at the bottom of the 
boat.

07:10:19.414 --> 07:10:21.042
obscure, and I heard only the 
sound of the boat as its keel 

07:10:21.043 --> 07:10:25.766
cut through the waves; the 
murmur lulled me, and in a short

07:10:25.767 --> 07:10:27.767
time I slept soundly.

07:10:31.853 --> 07:10:33.853
this situation, but when I awoke
I found 

07:10:35.742 --> 07:10:37.742
that the sun had already mounted
considerably.

07:10:41.056 --> 07:10:43.056
continually threatened the 
safety of my little skiff.

07:10:47.388 --> 07:10:49.614
must have driven me far from the
coast from which I had embarked.

07:10:54.915 --> 07:10:56.940
quickly found that if I again 
made the attempt the boat would 

07:10:56.941 --> 07:10:59.012
be instantly filled with water.

07:11:12.401 --> 07:11:14.484
slenderly acquainted with the 
geography of this part of the 

07:11:14.485 --> 07:11:17.128
world that the sun was of little
benefit to me.

07:11:22.416 --> 07:11:23.850
Atlantic and feel all the 
tortures of starvation or be 

07:11:23.851 --> 07:11:28.721
swallowed up in the immeasurable
waters that roared and buffeted 

07:11:28.722 --> 07:11:30.722
around me.

07:11:34.354 --> 07:11:36.378
felt the torment of a burning 
thirst, a prelude to my other 

07:11:36.379 --> 07:11:38.379
sufferings.

07:11:41.930 --> 07:11:43.555
covered by clouds that flew 
before the wind, only to be 

07:11:43.556 --> 07:11:45.556
replaced by others; I 

07:11:48.265 --> 07:11:50.265
looked upon the sea; it was to 
be my grave.

07:11:53.503 --> 07:11:55.503
” I thought of Elizabeth, of my 
father, 

07:11:58.408 --> 07:12:00.508
and of Clerval—all left behind, 
on whom the monster might 

07:12:00.509 --> 07:12:02.527
satisfy his sanguinary and 
merciless passions.

07:12:06.807 --> 07:12:08.807
despairing and frightful that 
even now, 

07:12:11.088 --> 07:12:13.722
when the scene is on the point 
of closing before me for ever, I

07:12:13.723 --> 07:12:15.723
shudder to reflect on it.

07:12:19.477 --> 07:12:21.477
as the sun declined towards the 
horizon, 

07:12:24.265 --> 07:12:26.298
the wind died away into a gentle
breeze and the sea became free 

07:12:26.299 --> 07:12:28.299
from breakers.

07:12:31.705 --> 07:12:33.730
I felt sick and hardly able to 
hold the rudder, when suddenly I

07:12:33.731 --> 07:12:36.370
saw a line of high land towards 
the south.

07:12:41.676 --> 07:12:43.676
the dreadful suspense I endured 
for 

07:12:46.379 --> 07:12:48.557
several hours, this sudden 
certainty of life rushed like a 

07:12:48.558 --> 07:12:50.589
flood of warm joy to my heart, 
and tears gushed from my eyes.

07:12:56.943 --> 07:12:59.190
strange is that clinging love we
have of life even in the excess 

07:12:59.191 --> 07:13:01.191
of misery!

07:13:04.887 --> 07:13:07.553
of my dress and eagerly steered 
my course towards the land.

07:13:12.450 --> 07:13:14.489
as I approached nearer I easily 
perceived the traces of 

07:13:14.490 --> 07:13:16.490
cultivation.

07:13:22.244 --> 07:13:25.977
myself suddenly transported back
to the neighbourhood of 

07:13:22.244 --> 07:13:24.244
civilised man.

07:13:28.834 --> 07:13:31.483
land and hailed a steeple which 
I at length saw issuing from 

07:13:31.484 --> 07:13:33.484
behind a small promontory.

07:13:38.231 --> 07:13:40.491
debility, I resolved to sail 
directly towards the town, as a 

07:13:40.492 --> 07:13:43.130
place where I could most easily 
procure nourishment.

07:13:51.097 --> 07:13:53.160
a small neat town and a good 
harbour, which I entered, my 

07:13:53.161 --> 07:13:55.823
heart bounding with joy at my 
unexpected escape.

07:14:02.079 --> 07:14:04.139
and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot.

07:14:09.050 --> 07:14:11.084
appearance, but instead of 
offering me any assistance, 

07:14:11.085 --> 07:14:13.969
whispered together with gestures
that at any other time might As 

07:14:13.970 --> 07:14:14.380
it was, I merely remarked that 
they spoke English, and I 

07:14:14.381 --> 07:14:15.797
therefore addressed them in that
language.so kind as to tell me 

07:14:15.798 --> 07:14:17.798
the name of this town and inform
me where I am?

07:14:19.474 --> 07:14:21.590
“You will know that soon 
enough,” replied a man with a 

07:14:21.591 --> 07:14:23.591
hoarse voice.

07:14:27.489 --> 07:14:29.533
will not prove much to your 
taste, but you will not be 

07:14:29.534 --> 07:14:31.977
consulted as to your quarters, I
promise you.

07:14:35.498 --> 07:14:37.529
I was exceedingly surprised on 
receiving so rude an answer from

07:14:37.530 --> 07:14:39.530
a stranger, and I 

07:14:41.824 --> 07:14:43.824
was also disconcerted on 
perceiving the 

07:14:44.826 --> 07:14:46.826
frowning and angry countenances 
of his companions.

07:14:53.850 --> 07:14:55.850
Englishmen to receive strangers 
so inhospitably.

07:14:57.092 --> 07:14:59.726
“I do not know,” said the man, 
“what the custom of the English 

07:14:59.727 --> 07:15:01.759
may be, but it is the custom of 
the Irish to hate villains.

07:15:05.645 --> 07:15:07.645
While this strange dialogue 
continued, I 

07:15:08.868 --> 07:15:10.868
perceived the crowd rapidly 
increase.

07:15:13.973 --> 07:15:15.612
curiosity and anger, which 
annoyed and in some degree 

07:15:15.613 --> 07:15:17.613
alarmed me.

07:15:24.600 --> 07:15:26.600
sound arose from the crowd as 
they 

07:15:27.863 --> 07:15:29.905
followed and surrounded me, when
an ill-looking man approaching 

07:15:29.906 --> 07:15:34.409
tapped me on the shoulder and 
said, “Come, sir, you must 

07:15:34.410 --> 07:15:36.420
follow me to Mr.? Kirwin's to 
give an account of yourself.

07:15:46.858 --> 07:15:48.858
“Ay, sir, free enough for honest
folks.

07:15:49.922 --> 07:15:52.373
Kirwin is a magistrate, and you 
are to give an account of the 

07:15:52.374 --> 07:15:55.008
death of a gentleman who was 
found murdered here last night.

07:15:59.608 --> 07:16:01.608
This answer startled me, but I 
presently recovered myself.

07:16:05.311 --> 07:16:07.964
proved; accordingly I followed 
my conductor in silence and was 

07:16:07.965 --> 07:16:10.212
led to one of the best houses in
the town.

07:16:16.741 --> 07:16:19.185
hunger, but being surrounded by 
a crowd, I thought it politic to

07:16:19.186 --> 07:16:21.256
rouse all my strength, that no 
physical debility 

07:16:26.094 --> 07:16:28.094
might be construed into 
apprehension or conscious guilt.

07:16:30.812 --> 07:16:32.812
that was in a few moments to 
overwhelm 

07:16:36.395 --> 07:16:40.661
me and extinguish in horror and 
despair all fear of ignominy or 

07:16:36.395 --> 07:16:38.395
death.

07:16:39.963 --> 07:16:41.403
my fortitude to recall the 
memory of the frightful events 

07:16:41.404 --> 07:16:42.817
which I am about to relate, in 
proper detail, to my 

07:16:42.818 --> 07:16:44.818
recollection.

07:16:52.421 --> 07:16:54.464
of the magistrate, an old 
benevolent man with calm and 

07:16:54.465 --> 07:16:56.465
mild manners.

07:16:59.744 --> 07:17:01.744
degree of severity, and then, 
turning 

07:17:03.613 --> 07:17:06.265
towards my conductors, he asked 
who appeared as witnesses on 

07:17:06.266 --> 07:17:08.266
this occasion.

07:17:10.879 --> 07:17:13.155
and, one being selected by the 
magistrate, he deposed that he 

07:17:13.156 --> 07:17:15.606
had been out fishing the night 
before with his 

07:17:20.529 --> 07:17:22.549
son and brother-in-law, Daniel 
Nugent, when, about ten o'clock,

07:17:22.550 --> 07:17:24.550
they observed a 

07:17:26.212 --> 07:17:30.412
strong northerly blast rising, 
and they accordingly put in for 

07:17:26.212 --> 07:17:28.212
port.

07:17:32.557 --> 07:17:35.407
had not yet risen; they did not 
land at the harbour, but, as 

07:17:35.408 --> 07:17:37.430
they had been accustomed, at a 
creek about two miles below.

07:17:44.196 --> 07:17:46.856
the fishing tackle, and his 
companions followed him at some 

07:17:46.857 --> 07:17:48.857
distance.

07:17:52.591 --> 07:17:54.228
he struck his foot against 
something and fell at his length

07:17:54.229 --> 07:17:56.229
on the ground.

07:18:01.179 --> 07:18:03.258
and by the light of their 
lantern they found that he had 

07:18:03.259 --> 07:18:05.903
fallen on the body of a man, who
was to all appearance dead.

07:18:12.258 --> 07:18:14.503
the corpse of some person who 
had been drowned and was thrown 

07:18:14.504 --> 07:18:16.504
on shore by the 

07:18:19.229 --> 07:18:21.885
waves, but on examination they 
found that the clothes were not 

07:18:21.886 --> 07:18:23.941
wet and even that the body was 
not then cold.

07:18:29.248 --> 07:18:31.272
cottage of an old woman near the
spot and endeavoured, but in 

07:18:31.273 --> 07:18:33.273
vain, to restore it to life.

07:18:37.214 --> 07:18:39.214
about five and twenty years of 
age.

07:18:41.899 --> 07:18:44.557
there was no sign of any 
violence except the black mark 

07:18:44.558 --> 07:18:46.558
of fingers on his neck.

07:18:50.281 --> 07:18:52.281
not in the least interest me, 
but when 

07:18:55.170 --> 07:18:57.012
the mark of the fingers was 
mentioned I remembered the 

07:18:57.013 --> 07:18:58.847
murder of my brother and felt 
myself extremely agitated; my 

07:18:58.848 --> 07:19:00.848
limbs 

07:19:03.142 --> 07:19:05.170
trembled, and a mist came over 
my eyes, which obliged me to 

07:19:05.171 --> 07:19:07.171
lean on a chair for support.

07:19:11.454 --> 07:19:13.713
eye and of course drew an 
unfavourable augury from my 

07:19:13.714 --> 07:19:15.714
manner.

07:19:18.993 --> 07:19:21.081
but when Daniel Nugent was 
called he swore positively that 

07:19:21.082 --> 07:19:23.764
just before the fall of his 
companion, he saw a boat, 

07:19:27.844 --> 07:19:29.844
with a single man in it, at a 
short 

07:19:30.889 --> 07:19:32.925
distance from the shore; and as 
far as he could judge by the 

07:19:32.926 --> 07:19:36.947
light of a few stars, it was the
same boat in which I had just 

07:19:36.948 --> 07:19:38.948
landed.

07:19:42.274 --> 07:19:44.294
beach and was standing at the 
door of her cottage, waiting for

07:19:44.295 --> 07:19:46.295
the return of 

07:19:49.202 --> 07:19:51.255
the fishermen, about an hour 
before she heard of the 

07:19:51.256 --> 07:19:53.916
discovery of the body, when she 
saw a boat with only one man in 

07:19:53.917 --> 07:19:55.917
it 

07:19:58.013 --> 07:20:00.402
push off from that part of the 
shore where the corpse was 

07:20:00.403 --> 07:20:02.403
afterwards found.

07:20:05.513 --> 07:20:07.551
the fishermen having brought the
body into her house; it was not 

07:20:07.552 --> 07:20:09.552
cold.

07:20:12.879 --> 07:20:15.533
and Daniel went to the town for 
an apothecary, but life was 

07:20:15.534 --> 07:20:17.534
quite gone.

07:20:21.439 --> 07:20:23.473
concerning my landing, and they 
agreed that, with the strong 

07:20:23.474 --> 07:20:25.474
north wind that had arisen 
during the night, it was very 

07:20:28.881 --> 07:20:29.862
probable that I had beaten about
for many hours and had been 

07:20:29.863 --> 07:20:33.796
obliged to return nearly to the 
same spot from which I had 

07:20:29.863 --> 07:20:31.863
departed.

07:20:35.276 --> 07:20:37.916
that I had brought the body from
another place, and it was likely

07:20:37.917 --> 07:20:39.917
that as I did 

07:20:41.580 --> 07:20:44.283
not appear to know the shore, I 
might have put into the harbour 

07:20:44.284 --> 07:20:48.975
ignorant of the distance of the 
town of —— from the place where 

07:20:48.976 --> 07:20:50.976
I had deposited the corpse.

07:20:52.631 --> 07:20:54.872
Kirwin, on hearing this 
evidence, desired that I should 

07:20:54.873 --> 07:20:57.528
be taken into the room where the
body lay for interment, 

07:21:02.211 --> 07:21:04.289
that it might be observed what 
effect the sight of it would 

07:21:04.290 --> 07:21:06.290
produce upon me.

07:21:09.591 --> 07:21:12.238
extreme agitation I had 
exhibited when the mode of the 

07:21:12.239 --> 07:21:14.239
murder had been described.

07:21:19.162 --> 07:21:21.162
magistrate and several other 
persons, to the inn.

07:21:24.912 --> 07:21:27.156
strange coincidences that had 
taken place during this eventful

07:21:27.157 --> 07:21:29.157
night; but, 

07:21:31.231 --> 07:21:33.888
knowing that I had been 
conversing with several persons 

07:21:33.889 --> 07:21:38.280
in the island I had inhabited 
about the time that the body had

07:21:38.281 --> 07:21:40.310
been found, I was perfectly 
tranquil as to the consequences 

07:21:40.311 --> 07:21:42.311
of the affair.

07:21:46.643 --> 07:21:48.643
and was led up to the coffin.

07:21:54.479 --> 07:21:56.716
I reflect on that terrible 
moment without shuddering and 

07:21:56.717 --> 07:21:58.717
agony.

07:22:03.041 --> 07:22:05.858
magistrate and witnesses, passed
like a dream from my memory when

07:22:05.859 --> 07:22:09.315
I saw the lifeless form of Henry
Clerval stretched before me.

07:22:14.032 --> 07:22:16.668
myself on the body, I exclaimed,
“Have my murderous machinations 

07:22:16.669 --> 07:22:19.527
deprived you also, my dearest 
Henry, of life?

07:22:25.222 --> 07:22:27.222
victims await their destiny; but
you, 

07:22:29.382 --> 07:22:31.614
Clerval, my friend, my 
benefactor—” The human frame 

07:22:31.615 --> 07:22:34.388
could no longer support the 
agonies that I endured, and I 

07:22:34.389 --> 07:22:36.389
was 

07:22:37.438 --> 07:22:39.438
carried out of the room in 
strong convulsions.

07:22:44.154 --> 07:22:45.794
death; my ravings, as I 
afterwards heard, were 

07:22:45.795 --> 07:22:47.795
frightful; I called myself 

07:22:50.695 --> 07:22:52.695
the murderer of William, of 
Justine, and of Clerval.

07:22:55.997 --> 07:22:58.361
assist me in the destruction of 
the fiend by whom I was 

07:22:58.362 --> 07:23:00.606
tormented; and at others I felt 
the fingers of the monster 

07:23:05.483 --> 07:23:08.131
already grasping my neck, and 
screamed aloud with agony and 

07:23:08.132 --> 07:23:10.132
terror.

07:23:13.870 --> 07:23:16.514
Kirwin alone understood me; but 
my gestures and bitter cries 

07:23:16.515 --> 07:23:18.538
were sufficient to affright the 
other witnesses.

07:23:25.524 --> 07:23:27.524
before, why did I not sink into 
forgetfulness and rest?

07:23:30.810 --> 07:23:32.810
children, the only hopes of 
their doting 

07:23:35.089 --> 07:23:37.732
parents; how many brides and 
youthful lovers have been one 

07:23:37.733 --> 07:23:39.770
day in the bloom of health and 
hope, and the next a prey for 

07:23:42.415 --> 07:23:44.415
worms and the decay of the tomb!

07:23:48.170 --> 07:23:50.619
could thus resist so many 
shocks, which, like the turning 

07:23:50.620 --> 07:23:52.620
of the wheel, continually 
renewed the torture?

07:24:06.298 --> 07:24:08.748
two months found myself as 
awaking from a dream, in a 

07:24:08.749 --> 07:24:10.749
prison, stretched on a 

07:24:13.160 --> 07:24:14.781
wretched bed, surrounded by 
gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and 

07:24:14.782 --> 07:24:16.797
all the miserable apparatus of a
dungeon.

07:24:22.565 --> 07:24:24.839
awoke to understanding; I had 
forgotten the particulars of 

07:24:24.840 --> 07:24:27.479
what had happened and only felt 
as if some great misfortune 

07:24:32.291 --> 07:24:34.327
had suddenly overwhelmed me; but
when I looked around and saw the

07:24:34.328 --> 07:24:36.328
barred windows 

07:24:38.601 --> 07:24:40.022
and the squalidness of the room 
in which I was, all flashed 

07:24:40.023 --> 07:24:42.023
across my memory and I groaned 
bitterly.

07:24:46.998 --> 07:24:48.998
was sleeping in a chair beside 
me.

07:24:52.691 --> 07:24:55.535
of the turnkeys, and her 
countenance expressed all those 

07:24:55.536 --> 07:24:57.536
bad qualities which often 
characterise that class.

07:25:03.923 --> 07:25:05.923
rude, like that of persons 
accustomed to 

07:25:08.016 --> 07:25:10.016
see without sympathising in 
sights of misery.

07:25:13.322 --> 07:25:16.172
indifference; she addressed me 
in English, and the voice struck

07:25:16.173 --> 07:25:18.173
me as one that I had heard 
during my sufferings.

07:25:21.791 --> 07:25:23.791
” said she.

07:25:27.100 --> 07:25:29.742
feeble voice, “I believe I am; 
but if it be all true, if indeed

07:25:29.743 --> 07:25:31.743
I did not dream, 

07:25:36.858 --> 07:25:38.858
I am sorry that I am still alive
to feel this misery and horror.

07:25:39.094 --> 07:25:40.859
“For that matter,” replied the 
old woman, “if you mean about 

07:25:40.860 --> 07:25:43.703
the gentleman you murdered, I 
believe that it were 

07:25:47.771 --> 07:25:52.037
better for you if you were dead,
for I fancy it will go hard with

07:25:47.771 --> 07:25:49.771
you!

07:25:55.140 --> 07:25:57.371
am sent to nurse you and get you
well; I do my duty with a safe 

07:25:57.372 --> 07:26:00.035
conscience; it were well if 
everybody did the same.

07:26:04.720 --> 07:26:06.767
I turned with loathing from the 
woman who could utter so 

07:26:06.768 --> 07:26:09.412
unfeeling a speech to a person 
just saved, on the very edge of 

07:26:14.336 --> 07:26:16.990
death; but I felt languid and 
unable to reflect on all that 

07:26:16.991 --> 07:26:18.991
had passed.

07:26:21.094 --> 07:26:23.094
me as a dream; I sometimes 
doubted if 

07:26:25.795 --> 07:26:28.043
indeed it were all true, for it 
never presented itself to my 

07:26:28.044 --> 07:26:30.044
mind with the force of reality.

07:26:34.389 --> 07:26:36.389
became more distinct, I grew 
feverish; a 

07:26:38.653 --> 07:26:41.285
darkness pressed around me; no 
one was near me who soothed me 

07:26:41.286 --> 07:26:44.095
with the gentle voice of love; 
no dear hand supported me.

07:26:49.876 --> 07:26:51.876
medicines, and the old woman 
prepared 

07:26:53.359 --> 07:26:56.014
them for me; but utter 
carelessness was visible in the 

07:26:56.015 --> 07:26:58.247
first, and the expression of 
brutality was strongly marked in

07:26:58.248 --> 07:27:01.134
the visage of the second.

07:27:05.625 --> 07:27:07.625
a murderer but the hangman who 
would gain his fee?

07:27:14.539 --> 07:27:16.539
Kirwin had shown me extreme 
kindness.

07:27:19.867 --> 07:27:21.867
prison to be prepared for me ; 
and it 

07:27:22.876 --> 07:27:24.876
was he who had provided a 
physician and a nurse.

07:27:29.467 --> 07:27:31.467
for although he ardently desired
to 

07:27:33.141 --> 07:27:35.184
relieve the sufferings of every 
human creature, he did not wish 

07:27:35.185 --> 07:27:37.289
to be present at the agonies and
miserable ravings of a murderer.

07:27:44.702 --> 07:27:47.353
that I was not neglected, but 
his visits were short and with 

07:27:47.354 --> 07:27:49.354
long intervals.

07:27:53.674 --> 07:27:56.335
recovering, I was seated in a 
chair, my eyes half open and my 

07:27:56.336 --> 07:27:58.583
cheeks livid like those in 
death.

07:28:03.276 --> 07:28:05.276
often reflected I had better 
seek death 

07:28:06.393 --> 07:28:08.924
than desire to remain in a world
which to me was replete with 

07:28:08.925 --> 07:28:10.925
wretchedness.

07:28:40.793 --> 07:28:41.617
At one time I considered whether
I should not declare myself 

07:28:41.618 --> 07:28:42.355
guilty and suffer the penalty of
the law, less innocent than poor

07:28:42.356 --> 07:28:44.974
Justine had been.my apartment 
was opened and Mr. Kirwin 

07:28:44.975 --> 07:28:46.975
entered.

07:28:48.251 --> 07:28:48.667
compassion; he drew a chair 
close to mine and addressed me 

07:28:48.668 --> 07:28:50.668
in French, “I fear that this 
place is very shocking to you; 

07:28:51.939 --> 07:28:53.939
can I do anything to make you 
more comfortable?

07:28:54.951 --> 07:28:59.931
”is nothing to me; on the whole 
earth there is no comfort which 

07:28:59.932 --> 07:29:01.932
I am capable 

07:29:02.932 --> 07:29:04.932
of receiving.

07:29:07.650 --> 07:29:09.650
”

07:29:12.394 --> 07:29:14.394
can be but of little 

07:29:16.137 --> 07:29:18.137
relief to one borne down as you 
are by so strange a misfortune.

07:29:21.041 --> 07:29:21.444
melancholy abode, for doubtless 
evidence can easily be brought 

07:29:21.445 --> 07:29:23.445
to free you from the criminal 
charge.

07:29:27.374 --> 07:29:30.017
“That is my least concern; I am,
by a course of strange events, 

07:29:30.018 --> 07:29:32.018
become the most miserable of 
mortals.

07:29:37.403 --> 07:29:39.403
have been, can death be any evil
to me?

07:29:40.671 --> 07:29:43.306
“Nothing indeed could be more 
unfortunate and agonising than 

07:29:43.307 --> 07:29:45.765
the strange chances that have 
lately occurred.

07:29:50.658 --> 07:29:52.658
accident, on this shore, 
renowned for 

07:29:54.736 --> 07:29:58.336
its hospitality, seized 
immediately, and charged with 

07:29:54.736 --> 07:29:56.736
murder.

07:30:01.664 --> 07:30:04.353
your eyes was the body of your 
friend, murdered in so 

07:30:04.354 --> 07:30:06.354
unaccountable a manner 

07:30:08.638 --> 07:30:10.638
and placed, as it were, by some 
fiend across your path.

07:30:12.326 --> 07:30:14.972
Kirwin said this, 
notwithstanding the agitation I 

07:30:14.973 --> 07:30:17.968
endured on this retrospect of my

07:30:32.496 --> 07:30:32.900
sufferings, I also felt 
considerable surprise at the 

07:30:32.901 --> 07:30:35.550
knowledge he seemed to possess 
concerning me.exhibited in my 

07:30:35.551 --> 07:30:36.594
countenance, for Mr. Kirwin 
hastened to say, “Immediately 

07:30:36.595 --> 07:30:38.214
upon your being taken ill, all 
the papers that were on your 

07:30:38.215 --> 07:30:40.215
person were 

07:30:41.365 --> 07:30:42.381
brought me, and I examined them 
that I might discover some trace

07:30:42.382 --> 07:30:43.606
by which I could send to your 
relations an account of your 

07:30:43.607 --> 07:30:45.607
misfortune and illness.

07:30:56.273 --> 07:30:57.870
among others, one which I 
discovered from its commencement

07:30:57.871 --> 07:30:59.871
to be from your father.

07:31:10.957 --> 07:31:12.182
nearly two months have elapsed 
since the departure of my 

07:31:12.183 --> 07:31:14.183
letter.

07:31:20.581 --> 07:31:22.581
you are unfit for agitation of 
any kind.

07:31:23.589 --> 07:31:25.589
”

07:31:32.390 --> 07:31:32.807
times worse than the most 
horrible event; tell me what new

07:31:32.808 --> 07:31:34.833
scene of death has been acted, 
and whose murder I am now to 

07:31:34.834 --> 07:31:36.456
lament?“Your family is perfectly
well,” said Mr. Kirwin with 

07:31:36.457 --> 07:31:37.901
gentleness; “and someone, a 
friend, is come to visit you.I 

07:31:37.902 --> 07:31:39.902
know not by what chain of 
thought the 

07:31:40.911 --> 07:31:42.911
idea presented 

07:31:44.404 --> 07:31:47.053
itself, but it instantly darted 
into my mind that the murderer 

07:31:47.054 --> 07:31:49.724
had come to mock at my misery 
and taunt me with the death 

07:31:54.433 --> 07:31:57.083
of Clerval, as a new incitement 
for me to comply with his 

07:31:57.084 --> 07:31:59.084
hellish desires.

07:32:09.163 --> 07:32:11.163
Kirwin regarded me with a 
troubled countenance.

07:32:15.456 --> 07:32:17.456
exclamation as a presumption of 
my guilt 

07:32:19.366 --> 07:32:21.418
and said in rather a severe 
tone, “I should have thought, 

07:32:21.419 --> 07:32:24.078
young man, that the presence of 
your father would have been 

07:32:28.336 --> 07:32:30.336
welcome instead of inspiring 
such violent repugnance.

07:32:32.006 --> 07:32:34.006
” cried I, while every feature 
and every 

07:32:36.143 --> 07:32:38.143
muscle was relaxed from anguish 
to pleasure.

07:32:46.172 --> 07:32:48.404
My change of manner surprised 
and pleased the magistrate; 

07:32:48.405 --> 07:32:50.460
perhaps he thought that my 
former exclamation was a 

07:32:54.989 --> 07:32:56.816
momentary return of delirium, 
and now he instantly resumed his

07:32:56.817 --> 07:32:58.817
former benevolence.

07:33:02.548 --> 07:33:04.548
nurse, and in a moment my father
entered it.

07:33:09.066 --> 07:33:11.066
given me greater pleasure than 
the arrival of my father.

07:33:15.935 --> 07:33:17.935
cried, “Are you then safe—and 
Elizabeth—and Ernest?

07:33:19.635 --> 07:33:21.691
My father calmed me with 
assurances of their welfare and 

07:33:21.692 --> 07:33:25.861
endeavoured, by dwelling on 
these subjects so interesting to

07:33:25.862 --> 07:33:28.536
my heart, to raise my desponding
spirits; but he soon felt 

07:33:33.424 --> 07:33:35.424
that a prison cannot be the 
abode of cheerfulness.

07:33:38.526 --> 07:33:40.526
” said he, looking mournfully at
the 

07:33:41.550 --> 07:33:43.550
barred windows and wretched 
appearance of the room.

07:33:48.172 --> 07:33:50.172
fatality seems to pursue you.

07:33:53.496 --> 07:33:55.496
unfortunate and murdered friend 
was an 

07:33:58.220 --> 07:34:02.086
agitation too great to be 
endured in my weak state; I shed

07:33:58.220 --> 07:34:00.220
tears.

07:34:04.526 --> 07:34:06.578
destiny of the most horrible 
kind hangs over me, and I must 

07:34:06.579 --> 07:34:08.579
live to fulfil it, 

07:34:11.470 --> 07:34:13.470
or surely I should have died on 
the coffin of Henry.

07:34:14.540 --> 07:34:16.585
We were not allowed to converse 
for any length of time, for the 

07:34:16.586 --> 07:34:18.586
precarious state 

07:34:21.528 --> 07:34:23.528
of my health rendered every 
precaution 

07:34:26.793 --> 07:34:28.824
Kirwin came in and insisted that
my strength should not be 

07:34:28.825 --> 07:34:30.825
exhausted by too much exertion.

07:34:46.792 --> 07:34:48.370
was to me like that of my good 
angel, and I gradually recovered

07:34:48.371 --> 07:34:50.371
my health.

07:34:59.345 --> 07:35:01.345
absorbed by a gloomy and black 

07:35:02.601 --> 07:35:04.601
melancholy that nothing could 

07:35:06.949 --> 07:35:08.949
dissipate.

07:35:20.062 --> 07:35:22.062
ever before me, ghastly and 
murdered.

07:35:26.315 --> 07:35:28.315
these reflections 

07:35:29.577 --> 07:35:31.577
threw me made my friends dread a

07:35:32.905 --> 07:35:34.905
destiny, which is now drawing to
a close.

07:35:44.921 --> 07:35:46.921
extinguish these throbbings and 

07:35:48.229 --> 07:35:50.922
relieve me from the mighty 
weight of anguish that bears me 

07:35:50.923 --> 07:35:52.957
to the dust; and, in executing 
the award of justice, I shall 

07:35:52.958 --> 07:35:54.958
also sink to rest.

07:36:00.859 --> 07:36:02.859
distant, although the wish was 
ever 

07:36:03.875 --> 07:36:05.875
present to my thoughts; and

07:36:07.134 --> 07:36:09.134
I often sat for hours motionless

07:36:11.894 --> 07:36:13.894
and speechless, wishing for some

07:36:16.311 --> 07:36:16.712
mighty revolution that might 
bury me and my destroyer in its 

07:36:16.713 --> 07:36:18.713
ruins.

07:36:28.890 --> 07:36:29.933
prison, and although I was still
weak and in continual danger of 

07:36:29.934 --> 07:36:31.934
a relapse, I 

07:36:32.942 --> 07:36:35.894
was obliged to travel nearly a 
hundred miles to the country 

07:36:35.895 --> 07:36:36.945
town where the court was held. 
Kirwin charged himself with 

07:36:36.946 --> 07:36:37.963
every care of collecting 
witnesses and arranging my 

07:36:37.964 --> 07:36:39.964
defence.

07:36:44.320 --> 07:36:46.320
publicly as a criminal, as the 
case was 

07:36:48.026 --> 07:36:50.026
not brought before the court 
that decides on life and death.

07:36:53.672 --> 07:36:55.672
its being proved that I was on 
the Orkney Islands at the hour 

07:36:58.158 --> 07:36:59.589
the body of my friend was found;
and a fortnight after my removal

07:36:59.590 --> 07:37:01.590
I was 

07:37:02.595 --> 07:37:04.595
liberated from prison.

07:37:11.014 --> 07:37:16.573
freed from the vexations of a 
criminal charge, that I was 

07:37:16.574 --> 07:37:16.980
again allowed to breathe the 
fresh atmosphere and permitted 

07:37:16.981 --> 07:37:18.981
to return to my native country.

07:37:22.887 --> 07:37:24.503
feelings, for to me the walls of
a dungeon or a palace were alike

07:37:24.504 --> 07:37:26.504
hateful.

07:37:33.930 --> 07:37:36.573
and although the sun shone upon 
me, as upon the happy and gay of

07:37:36.574 --> 07:37:38.574
heart, I saw 

07:37:41.482 --> 07:37:44.129
around me nothing but a dense 
and frightful darkness, 

07:37:44.130 --> 07:37:46.773
penetrated by no light but the 
glimmer of two eyes that glared 

07:37:46.774 --> 07:37:48.774
upon me.

07:37:53.157 --> 07:37:55.157
of Henry, languishing in death, 
the dark 

07:37:58.448 --> 07:38:00.878
orbs nearly covered by the lids 
and the long black lashes that 

07:38:00.879 --> 07:38:05.769
fringed them; sometimes it was 
the watery, clouded eyes of the 

07:38:05.770 --> 07:38:08.414
monster, as I first saw them in 
my chamber at Ingolstadt.

07:38:20.107 --> 07:38:22.758
soon visit, of Elizabeth and 
Ernest; but these words only 

07:38:22.759 --> 07:38:24.759
drew deep groans from me.

07:38:30.090 --> 07:38:32.789
happiness and thought with 
melancholy delight of my beloved

07:38:32.790 --> 07:38:34.790
cousin or longed, 

07:38:37.473 --> 07:38:39.508
with a devouringmaladie du pays,
to see once more the blue lake 

07:38:39.509 --> 07:38:42.155
and rapid Rhone, that had been 
so dear to me in early 

07:38:44.817 --> 07:38:46.817
childhood; but my general state 
of 

07:38:49.726 --> 07:38:52.166
feeling was a torpor in which a 
prison was as welcome a 

07:38:52.167 --> 07:38:57.046
residence as the divinest scene 
in nature; and these fits were 

07:38:57.047 --> 07:38:59.904
seldom interrupted but by 
paroxysms of anguish and 

07:38:59.905 --> 07:39:01.905
despair.

07:39:06.011 --> 07:39:08.011
put an end to the existence I 
loathed, 

07:39:10.752 --> 07:39:13.012
and it required unceasing 
attendance and vigilance to 

07:39:13.013 --> 07:39:15.469
restrain me from committing some
dreadful act of violence.

07:39:22.002 --> 07:39:24.061
recollection of which finally 
triumphed over my selfish 

07:39:24.062 --> 07:39:26.062
despair.

07:39:29.837 --> 07:39:31.891
without delay to Geneva, there 
to watch over the lives of those

07:39:31.892 --> 07:39:37.167
I so fondly loved and to lie in 
wait for the murderer, that if 

07:39:37.168 --> 07:39:39.168
any chance led me to 

07:39:41.513 --> 07:39:41.912
the place of his concealment, or
if he dared again to blast me by

07:39:41.913 --> 07:39:42.944
his presence, I might, with 
unfailing aim, put an end to the

07:39:42.945 --> 07:39:43.140
existence of the monstrous image
which I had endued with the 

07:39:43.141 --> 07:39:44.369
mockery of a soul still more 
monstrous.departure, fearful 

07:39:44.370 --> 07:39:45.792
that I could not sustain the 
fatigues of a journey, for I was

07:39:45.793 --> 07:39:47.793
a shattered wreck—the shadow of 
a human being.

07:39:49.319 --> 07:39:51.319
and day preyed upon my wasted 
frame.

07:39:54.831 --> 07:39:57.277
with such inquietude and 
impatience, my father thought it

07:39:57.278 --> 07:39:59.278
best to yield.

07:40:15.641 --> 07:40:16.273
bound for Havre-de-Grace and 
sailed with a fair wind from the

07:40:16.274 --> 07:40:18.274
Irish shores.

07:40:27.325 --> 07:40:29.325
and listening to the dashing of 
the waves.

07:40:36.497 --> 07:40:37.335
from my sight, and my pulse beat
with a feverish joy when I 

07:40:37.336 --> 07:40:39.336
reflected that I should soon see
Geneva.

07:40:46.961 --> 07:40:47.779
light of a frightful dream; yet 
the vessel in which I was, the 

07:40:47.780 --> 07:40:51.843
wind that blew me from the 
detested shore of Ireland, and 

07:40:51.844 --> 07:40:54.735
the sea which surrounded me, 
told me too forcibly that I was 

07:40:55.959 --> 07:40:58.217
deceived by no vision and that 
Clerval, my friend and dearest 

07:40:58.218 --> 07:41:01.092
companion, had fallen a victim 
to me and the monster of my 

07:41:01.093 --> 07:41:03.093
creation.

07:41:12.290 --> 07:41:14.290
life; my quiet happiness while 
residing 

07:41:15.302 --> 07:41:18.071
with my family in Geneva, the 
death of my mother, and my 

07:41:18.072 --> 07:41:20.072
departure for Ingolstadt.

07:41:26.030 --> 07:41:28.689
enthusiasm that hurried me on to
the creation of my hideous 

07:41:28.690 --> 07:41:31.795
enemy, and I called to mind the 
night in which he first lived.

07:41:39.754 --> 07:41:41.786
thought; a thousand feelings 
pressed upon me, and I wept 

07:41:41.787 --> 07:41:43.787
bitterly.

07:41:48.054 --> 07:41:50.873
I had been in the custom of 
taking every night a small 

07:41:50.874 --> 07:41:56.172
quantity of laudanum, for it was
by means of this drug only that 

07:41:56.173 --> 07:41:58.173
I was enabled to gain the 

07:42:01.608 --> 07:42:03.608
rest necessary for the 
preservation of life.

07:42:07.863 --> 07:42:09.863
various misfortunes, I now 
swallowed 

07:42:11.916 --> 07:42:13.916
double my usual quantity and 
soon slept profoundly.

07:42:17.193 --> 07:42:20.186
from thought and misery; my 
dreams presented a thousand 

07:42:20.483 --> 07:42:22.483
objects that scared me.

07:42:27.651 --> 07:42:29.914
kind of nightmare; I felt the 
fiend's grasp in my neck and 

07:42:29.915 --> 07:42:35.234
could not free myself from it; 
groans and cries rang in my 

07:42:35.235 --> 07:42:37.235
ears.

07:42:41.153 --> 07:42:43.798
perceiving my restlessness, 
awoke me; the dashing waves were

07:42:43.799 --> 07:42:49.116
around, the cloudy sky above, 
the fiend was not here:  A sense

07:42:49.117 --> 07:42:51.117
of security, a feeling 

07:42:52.130 --> 07:42:53.250
that a truce was established 
between the present hour and the

07:42:53.251 --> 07:42:55.285
irresistible, disastrous future 
imparted to me a kind of calm 

07:42:55.286 --> 07:42:55.890
forgetfulness, of which the 
human mind is by its structure 

07:42:55.891 --> 07:42:57.891
peculiarly susceptible.

07:43:02.240 --> 07:43:02.845
strength and that I must repose 
before I could continue my 

07:43:02.846 --> 07:43:05.406
journey.indefatigable, but he 
did not know the origin of my 

07:43:05.407 --> 07:43:07.407
sufferings and sought 

07:43:08.420 --> 07:43:10.758
erroneous methods to remedy the 
incurable ill.

07:43:19.802 --> 07:43:20.209
beings, and I felt attracted 
even to the most repulsive among

07:43:20.210 --> 07:43:21.219
them, as to creatures of an 
angelic nature and celestial 

07:43:21.220 --> 07:43:24.487
mechanism.whose joy it was to 
shed their blood and to revel in

07:43:24.488 --> 07:43:27.988
their groans.and hunt me from 
the world, did they know my 

07:43:27.989 --> 07:43:29.989
unhallowed acts and the crimes 
which had their source in me!

07:43:32.506 --> 07:43:33.937
my desire to avoid society and 
strove by various arguments to 

07:43:33.938 --> 07:43:35.938
banish my despair.

07:43:39.263 --> 07:43:41.263
the degradation of being obliged
to 

07:43:42.274 --> 07:43:44.274
answer a charge of 

07:43:54.639 --> 07:43:55.245
murder, and he endeavoured to 
prove to me the futility of 

07:43:55.246 --> 07:43:57.246
pride.

07:44:03.684 --> 07:44:05.734
passions, would indeed be 
degraded if such a wretch as I 

07:44:05.735 --> 07:44:07.735
felt pride.

07:44:10.024 --> 07:44:11.035
innocent as I, and she suffered 
the same charge; she died for 

07:44:11.036 --> 07:44:13.036
it; and I am the cause of this—I
murdered her.

07:44:17.364 --> 07:44:18.987
My father had often, during my 
imprisonment, heard me make the 

07:44:18.988 --> 07:44:21.019
same assertion; when I thus 
accused myself, he sometimes 

07:44:21.020 --> 07:44:23.020
seemed to desire an explanation,
and at others he appeared 

07:44:24.890 --> 07:44:27.538
to consider it as the offspring 
of delirium, and that, during my

07:44:27.539 --> 07:44:28.541
illness, some idea of this kind 
had presented itself to my 

07:44:28.542 --> 07:44:29.590
imagination, the remembrance of 
which I preserved in my 

07:44:29.591 --> 07:44:31.591
convalescence.

07:44:34.901 --> 07:44:36.901
continual silence concerning the
wretch I had created.

07:44:40.604 --> 07:44:42.221
supposed mad, and this in itself
would for ever have chained my 

07:44:42.222 --> 07:44:44.222
tongue.

07:44:48.573 --> 07:44:50.238
to disclose a secret which would
fill my hearer with 

07:44:50.239 --> 07:44:52.271
consternation and make fear and 
unnatural horror the inmates of 

07:44:52.272 --> 07:44:54.272
his breast.

07:45:01.902 --> 07:45:02.342
thirst for sympathy and was 
silent when I would have given 

07:45:02.343 --> 07:45:05.622
the world to have confided the 
fatal secret.I could offer no 

07:45:05.623 --> 07:45:06.640
explanation of them, but their 
truth in part relieved the 

07:45:06.641 --> 07:45:08.268
burden of my mysterious woe.an 
expression of unbounded wonder, 

07:45:08.269 --> 07:45:10.900
“My dearest Victor, what 
infatuation is this?make such an

07:45:10.901 --> 07:45:12.901
assertion again.

07:45:13.961 --> 07:45:15.961
“I am not mad,” I cried

07:45:16.961 --> 07:45:20.292
“the sun and the heavens, who 
have viewed my operations, can 

07:45:20.293 --> 07:45:22.293
bear witness of my truth.

not, my father,

The conclusion of this speech 
convinced my father that my 

07:45:48.459 --> 07:45:49.879
ideas were deranged, and he 
instantly changed the subject of

07:45:49.880 --> 07:45:50.485
our conversation and endeavoured
to alter the course of my

thoughts.obliterate the memory 
of the scenes that had taken 

07:45:52.935 --> 07:45:53.151
place in Ireland and never 
alluded to them or suffered me 

07:45:53.152 --> 07:45:55.152
to speak of my misfortunes.

07:46:07.819 --> 07:46:09.512
more calm; misery had her 
dwelling in my heart, but I no 

07:46:09.513 --> 07:46:12.509
longer talked in the same 

07:46:15.771 --> 07:46:17.771
incoherent manner of my own 

07:46:23.207 --> 07:46:26.062

the consciousness of them.the 

07:46:26.063 --> 07:46:29.996
imperious voice of wretchedness,
which sometimes desired to 

07:46:26.063 --> 07:46:26.467
declare itself to the whole 
world, and my manners were 

07:46:26.468 --> 07:46:27.488
calmer and more composed than 
they had ever been since my 

07:46:27.489 --> 07:46:30.736

Switzerland, I received the “My

07:46:36.788 --> 07:46:38.788
may hope to see you in less than

so many misfortunes weigh upon 
you, 

07:47:08.068 --> 07:47:10.359
but a conversation that I had 
with my uncle 

07:47:13.380 --> 07:47:16.233
previous to his departure 
renders some explanation 

07:47:16.234 --> 07:47:18.234
necessary before we meet.

07:47:31.946 --> 07:47:33.946

my doubts satisfied.

yet be pleased with this

explanation; and in a 
probability of this being the 

07:47:41.057 --> 07:47:44.296
case, I dare not any longer 
postpone writing what, during 

07:47:44.297 --> 07:47:44.735
your absence, I have often 
wished to express to you but 

07:47:44.736 --> 07:47:46.736
have never had the courage to 
begin.

your parents ever since our

you not love another?

at Ingolstadt; and I confess to 

07:48:30.729 --> 07:48:32.729
you, my 

07:48:33.741 --> 07:48:36.071
friend, that when I saw you last

solitude from the society of 
every 

07:48:41.163 --> 07:48:43.163
creature, I 

07:48:45.636 --> 07:48:47.728
could not help supposing that 
you might regret our connection 

07:48:47.729 --> 07:48:49.729
and 

07:48:50.743 --> 07:48:52.931
believe yourself bound in honour
to fulfil the wishes of your 

07:48:55.936 --> 07:48:57.936
parents, although they 

07:49:12.891 --> 07:49:15.145
opposed themselves to your 
inclinations.

dreams of futurity you have been

my constant friend and 
companion.

declare to you that our marriage

07:50:04.943 --> 07:50:05.564
would render me eternally 
miserable unless it were the

07:50:17.622 --> 07:50:19.622
request, remain satisfied that 
nothing on earth will have the 

07:50:19.855 --> 07:50:24.255
“Do not let this letter disturb 
you; do not answer tomorrow, or 

07:50:19.855 --> 07:50:21.855
the next day, or even until you 
come, if it will give you pain.

07:50:26.558 --> 07:50:27.181
your health, and if I see but 
one smile on your lips when we 

07:50:27.182 --> 07:50:28.194
meet, occasioned by this or any 
other exertion of mine, I shall 

07:50:28.195 --> 07:50:30.195
need no other happiness.

07:50:31.859 --> 07:50:36.125
revived in my memory what I had 
before forgotten, the threat of 

07:50:31.859 --> 07:50:33.491
the fiend—“I will be with you on
your wedding-night!Such was my 

07:50:33.492 --> 07:50:34.549
sentence, and on that night 
would the daemon employ every 

07:50:34.550 --> 07:50:36.783
art to destroy me and tear me 
from the glimpse of happiness 

07:50:36.784 --> 07:50:38.784
which promised partly to console
my sufferings.

07:50:40.433 --> 07:50:42.433
consummate his crimes by my 
death.

07:50:49.360 --> 07:50:51.360
then assuredly 

07:50:52.526 --> 07:50:54.526
take place, in which if he were 

07:50:56.606 --> 07:50:58.606
victorious I should be at peace 

07:51:01.704 --> 07:51:03.704
and his power over me be at an 
end.

07:51:08.504 --> 07:51:10.546
family have been massacred 
before his eyes, his cottage 

07:51:10.547 --> 07:51:15.879
burnt, his lands laid waste, and
he is turned adrift, homeless, 

07:51:15.880 --> 07:51:17.880
penniless, and alone, but free.

07:51:24.217 --> 07:51:26.217
my Elizabeth I possessed

07:51:27.224 --> 07:51:29.061
a treasure, alas, balanced by 
those horrors of remorse and 

07:51:29.062 --> 07:51:31.150
guilt which would pursue me 
until death.

07:51:40.036 --> 07:51:42.325
softened feelings stole into my 
heart and dared to whisper 

07:51:42.326 --> 07:51:42.730
paradisiacal dreams of love and 
joy; but the apple was already 

07:51:42.731 --> 07:51:48.581
eaten, and the angel's arm bared
to drive me from all hope.

07:51:56.530 --> 07:51:59.192
death was inevitable; yet, 
again, I considered whether my 

07:51:59.193 --> 07:52:01.423
marriage would hasten my fate.

07:52:06.753 --> 07:52:09.423
few months sooner, but if my 
torturer should suspect that I 

07:52:09.424 --> 07:52:11.867
postponed it, influenced by his 
menaces, he would 

07:52:17.184 --> 07:52:19.184
surely find other and perhaps 
more dreadful means of revenge.

07:52:24.734 --> 07:52:27.186
wedding-night, yet he did not 
consider that threat as binding 

07:52:27.187 --> 07:52:30.053
him to peace in the meantime, 
for as if to show me that 

07:52:33.089 --> 07:52:38.314
he was not yet satiated with 
blood, he had murdered Clerval 

07:52:38.315 --> 07:52:40.572
immediately after the 
enunciation of his threats.

07:52:45.857 --> 07:52:51.610
immediate union with my cousin 
would conduce either to hers or 

07:52:51.611 --> 07:52:54.267
my father's happiness, my 
adversary's designs against my 

07:52:54.268 --> 07:52:56.268
life 

07:52:57.362 --> 07:52:59.362
In this state of mind I wrote to
Elizabeth.

07:53:03.622 --> 07:53:06.536
“little happiness remains for us
on earth; yet all that I may one

07:53:09.176 --> 07:53:11.176
day enjoy is centred in you.

07:53:14.454 --> 07:53:16.482
you alone do I consecrate my 
life and my endeavours for 

07:53:16.483 --> 07:53:18.483
contentment.

07:53:22.881 --> 07:53:24.881
dreadful one; when revealed to 
you, it 

07:53:25.889 --> 07:53:28.631
will chill your frame with 
horror, and then, far from being

07:53:31.314 --> 07:53:33.497
surprised at my misery, you will
only wonder that I survive what 

07:53:33.498 --> 07:53:35.498
I have endured.

07:53:40.603 --> 07:53:42.603
terror to you the day

07:53:43.682 --> 07:53:46.381
after our marriage shall take 
place, for, my sweet cousin, 

07:53:46.382 --> 07:53:48.382
there must be perfect confidence
between us.

07:53:57.217 --> 07:53:59.217
and I know you will comply.

07:54:01.565 --> 07:54:04.017
In about a week after the 
arrival of Elizabeth's letter we

07:54:04.018 --> 07:54:06.018
returned to Geneva.

07:54:10.968 --> 07:54:13.823
affection, yet tears were in her
eyes as she beheld my emaciated 

07:54:13.824 --> 07:54:15.824
frame and feverish cheeks.

07:54:23.227 --> 07:54:25.867
that heavenly vivacity that had 
before charmed me; but her 

07:54:25.868 --> 07:54:27.868
gentleness and soft 

07:54:28.878 --> 07:54:34.284
looks of compassion made her a 
more fit companion for one 

07:54:34.285 --> 07:54:36.285
blasted and miserable as I was.

07:54:45.359 --> 07:54:47.391
when I thought of what had 
passed, a real insanity 

07:54:47.392 --> 07:54:49.392
possessed me; sometimes I 

07:54:52.280 --> 07:54:54.280
was furious and burnt with rage,
sometimes low and despondent.

07:54:59.193 --> 07:55:01.193
but sat motionless, bewildered 
by the 

07:55:02.195 --> 07:55:04.195
multitude of miseries that 
overcame me.

07:55:09.578 --> 07:55:11.218
me from these fits; her gentle 
voice would soothe me when 

07:55:11.219 --> 07:55:13.219

07:55:14.220 --> 07:55:16.503

human feelings when sunk in 

07:55:16.504 --> 07:55:18.504
torpor.

remonstrate and endeavour to 
inspire me with resignation.

07:55:32.963 --> 07:55:34.963
resigned, but for the guilty 
there is no peace.

07:55:39.155 --> 07:55:39.352

sometimes found in indulging the

07:55:39.353 --> 07:55:41.995
excess of grief.of my immediate

consecrate myself, in life or 

07:55:44.230 --> 07:55:46.230

cousin.

07:55:49.364 --> 07:55:51.364
“My dear Victor, do not speak 
thus.

07:55:55.515 --> 07:55:57.569
let us only cling closer to what
remains and transfer our love 

07:55:57.570 --> 07:56:00.204
for those whom we have lost to 
those who yet live.

07:56:05.912 --> 07:56:07.912

and mutual misfortune.

whom we have been so cruelly 

07:56:17.763 --> 07:56:19.763
deprived.

07:56:21.852 --> 07:56:23.852
Such were the lessons of my 
father.

07:56:27.178 --> 07:56:29.840
returned; nor can you wonder 
that, omnipotent as the fiend 

07:56:29.841 --> 07:56:31.873
had yet been in his deeds of 
blood, I should almost 

07:56:37.230 --> 07:56:39.857
regard him as invincible, and 
that when he had pronounced the 

07:56:39.858 --> 07:56:41.907
words “I shall be with you on 
your wedding-night,” I 

07:56:45.707 --> 07:56:47.707
should regard the threatened 
fate as unavoidable.

07:56:51.454 --> 07:56:53.454
of Elizabeth were balanced with 
it, and 

07:56:55.726 --> 07:56:57.726
I therefore, with a contented 
and even 

07:56:58.871 --> 07:57:00.524
cheerful countenance, agreed 
with my father that if my cousin

07:57:00.525 --> 07:57:02.525
would consent, 

07:57:05.228 --> 07:57:06.853
the ceremony should take place 
in ten days, and thus put, as I 

07:57:06.854 --> 07:57:08.854
imagined, the seal to my fate.

07:57:16.375 --> 07:57:18.980
might be the hellish intention 
of my fiendish adversary, I 

07:57:18.981 --> 07:57:21.865
would rather have banished 
myself for ever from my native 

07:57:24.321 --> 07:57:26.784
country and wandered a 
friendless outcast over the 

07:57:26.785 --> 07:57:28.785
earth than have consented to 
this miserable marriage.

07:57:35.319 --> 07:57:37.980
the monster had blinded me to 
his real intentions; and when I 

07:57:37.981 --> 07:57:39.981
thought that I 

07:57:42.851 --> 07:57:44.489
had prepared only my own death,

that brought smiles and joy to 
the countenance of my father, 

07:57:47.736 --> 07:57:48.147
but hardly deceived the 
ever-watchful and nicer eye of 

07:57:48.148 --> 07:57:50.148
Elizabeth.

07:57:53.453 --> 07:57:55.453
placid contentment, not 
unmingled with a 

07:57:58.163 --> 07:57:59.783
little fear, which past 
misfortunes had impressed, that 

07:57:59.784 --> 07:58:04.969
what now appeared certain and 
tangible happiness might soon 

07:58:04.970 --> 07:58:06.970
dissipate into an airy dream and

07:58:09.696 --> 07:58:11.696
leave no trace but deep and 
everlasting regret.

07:58:15.028 --> 07:58:17.719
congratulatory visits were 
received, and all wore a smiling

07:58:17.720 --> 07:58:19.720
appearance.

preyed there and entered with 

07:58:26.614 --> 07:58:28.614
seeming earnestness

into the plans of my father, 
although they might only serve 

07:58:32.971 --> 07:58:34.971
as the decorations of my 
tragedy.

07:58:39.512 --> 07:58:41.971
the inheritance of Elizabeth had
been restored to her by the 

07:58:41.972 --> 07:58:43.972
Austrian government.

Villa Lavenza and spend our 

07:58:55.478 --> 07:58:55.682
first days of happiness beside 
the beautiful lake near which it

07:58:55.683 --> 07:58:56.972
stood.to defend my person in 
case the fiend should openly 

07:58:56.973 --> 07:58:58.973
attack me.

07:59:02.916 --> 07:59:04.998
constantly about me and was ever
on the watch to prevent 

07:59:04.999 --> 07:59:06.999
artifice, and by these 

07:59:08.664 --> 07:59:10.664
means gained a greater degree of
tranquillity.

07:59:13.852 --> 07:59:15.852
threat appeared more as a 
delusion, not 

07:59:19.215 --> 07:59:20.842
to be regarded as worthy to 
disturb my peace, while the 

07:59:20.843 --> 07:59:23.505
happiness I hoped for in my 
marriage wore a greater 

07:59:23.506 --> 07:59:25.506
appearance 

07:59:27.788 --> 07:59:27.983
of certainty as the day fixed 
for its solemnisation drew 

07:59:27.984 --> 07:59:28.414
nearer and I heard it 
continually spoken of as an 

07:59:28.415 --> 07:59:30.415
occurrence which no accident 
could possibly prevent.

07:59:36.202 --> 07:59:38.202
demeanour contributed greatly to
calm her mind.

07:59:43.119 --> 07:59:44.267
wishes and my destiny, she was 
melancholy, and a presentiment 

07:59:44.268 --> 07:59:46.268
of evil 

07:59:48.383 --> 07:59:50.892
pervaded her; and perhaps also 
she thought of the dreadful 

07:59:50.893 --> 07:59:53.383
secret which I had promised to 
reveal to her on the following 

07:59:53.384 --> 07:59:55.384
day.

08:00:00.014 --> 08:00:02.512
overjoyed, and, in the bustle of
preparation, only recognised in 

08:00:02.513 --> 08:00:04.750
the melancholy of his niece the 
diffidence of a bride.

08:00:11.114 --> 08:00:13.781
large party assembled at my 
father's, but it was agreed that

08:00:13.782 --> 08:00:15.814
Elizabeth and I should commence 
our journey by water, 

08:00:19.730 --> 08:00:20.570
sleeping that night at Evian and
continuing our voyage on the 

08:00:20.571 --> 08:00:23.193
following day.Those were the 
last moments of my life during 

08:00:23.194 --> 08:00:25.194
which I enjoyed the feeling of 
happiness.

08:00:30.011 --> 08:00:32.282
hot, but we were sheltered from 
its rays by a kind of canopy 

08:00:32.283 --> 08:00:34.283
while we enjoyed the 

08:00:36.542 --> 08:00:38.571
beauty of the scene, sometimes 
on one side of the lake, where 

08:00:38.572 --> 08:00:43.912
we saw Mont Salêve, the pleasant
banks of Montalègre, and at a 

08:00:43.913 --> 08:00:48.525
distance, surmounting all, the 
beautiful Mont Blanc, and the 

08:00:48.526 --> 08:00:50.526
assemblage of snowy 

08:00:53.877 --> 08:00:55.071
mountains that in vain endeavour
to emulate her; sometimes 

08:00:55.072 --> 08:00:59.789
coasting the opposite banks, we 
saw the mighty Jura opposing its

08:00:59.790 --> 08:01:02.429
dark side to the ambition that 
would quit its native country, 

08:01:02.430 --> 08:01:04.430
and 

08:01:07.132 --> 08:01:09.809
an almost insurmountable barrier
to the invader who should wish 

08:01:09.810 --> 08:01:11.810
to enslave it.

08:01:19.548 --> 08:01:21.548
what I may yet endure, you would
endeavour to let me taste the 

08:01:23.575 --> 08:01:25.597
quiet and freedom from despair 
that this one day at least 

08:01:25.598 --> 08:01:27.598
permits me to enjoy.

08:01:29.437 --> 08:01:31.483
“Be happy, my dear Victor,” 
replied Elizabeth; “there is, I 

08:01:31.484 --> 08:01:34.125
hope, nothing to distress you; 
and be assured that if a 

08:01:38.856 --> 08:01:40.856
lively joy is not painted in my 
face, my heart is contented.

08:01:45.231 --> 08:01:47.272
too much on the prospect that is
opened before us, but I will not

08:01:47.273 --> 08:01:50.551
listen to such a sinister voice.
the clouds, which sometimes 

08:01:50.552 --> 08:01:54.209
obscure and sometimes rise above
the dome of Mont Look also at 

08:01:54.210 --> 08:01:54.423
the innumerable fish that are 
swimming in the clear waters, 

08:01:54.424 --> 08:01:56.424
where we can distinguish every 
pebble that lies at the bottom.

08:02:02.599 --> 08:02:04.629
Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to 
divert her thoughts and mine 

08:02:04.630 --> 08:02:06.630
from all reflection upon 
melancholy subjects.

08:02:12.648 --> 08:02:14.684
a few instants shone in her 
eyes, but it continually gave 

08:02:14.685 --> 08:02:16.799
place to distraction and 
reverie.

08:02:21.679 --> 08:02:23.679
passed the river Drance and 
observed its 

08:02:25.749 --> 08:02:27.366
path through the chasms of the 
higher and the glens of the 

08:02:27.367 --> 08:02:29.367
lower hills.

08:02:32.726 --> 08:02:34.798
and we approached the 
amphitheatre of mountains which 

08:02:34.799 --> 08:02:36.799
forms its eastern boundary.

08:02:41.773 --> 08:02:43.195
woods that surrounded it and the
range of mountain above mountain

08:02:43.196 --> 08:02:45.437
by which it was overhung.

08:02:50.132 --> 08:02:52.781
along with amazing rapidity, 
sank at sunset to a light 

08:02:52.782 --> 08:02:54.782
breeze; the soft air 

08:02:57.654 --> 08:02:59.685
just ruffled the water and 
caused a pleasant motion among 

08:02:59.686 --> 08:03:03.948
the trees as we approached the 
shore, from which it wafted the 

08:03:03.949 --> 08:03:05.993
most delightful scent of flowers
and hay.landed, and as I touched

08:03:05.994 --> 08:03:08.660
the shore I felt those cares and
fears revive which soon were to 

08:03:08.661 --> 08:03:10.661
clasp me and cling to me for 
ever.

08:03:19.617 --> 08:03:21.617
landed; we walked for a short 

08:03:24.008 --> 08:03:26.872
time on the shore, enjoying the 
transitory light, and then 

08:03:26.873 --> 08:03:28.874
retired to the inn and 
contemplated the lovely 

08:03:32.879 --> 08:03:35.115
scene of waters, woods, and 
mountains, obscured in darkness,

08:03:35.116 --> 08:03:37.116
yet still displaying their black
outlines.

08:03:42.533 --> 08:03:44.533
south, now rose with great 
violence in the west.

08:03:48.879 --> 08:03:50.932
heavens and was beginning to 
descend; the clouds swept across

08:03:50.933 --> 08:03:52.933
it swifter than 

08:03:55.230 --> 08:03:57.305
the flight of the vulture and 
dimmed her rays, while the lake 

08:03:57.306 --> 08:03:59.943
reflected the scene of the busy 
heavens, rendered still 

08:04:04.651 --> 08:04:06.651
busier by the restless waves 
that were beginning to rise.

08:04:14.245 --> 08:04:16.286
soon as night obscured the 
shapes of objects, a thousand 

08:04:16.287 --> 08:04:18.287
fears arose in my mind.

08:04:23.695 --> 08:04:26.372
right hand grasped a pistol 
which was hidden in my bosom; 

08:04:26.373 --> 08:04:31.119
every sound terrified me, but I 
resolved that I would sell my 

08:04:31.120 --> 08:04:33.120
life dearly and not shrink 

08:04:35.864 --> 08:04:38.498
from the conflict until my own 
life or that of my adversary was

08:04:38.499 --> 08:04:40.499
extinguished.

08:04:44.244 --> 08:04:46.489
some time in timid and fearful 
silence, but there was something

08:04:46.490 --> 08:04:48.490
in my glance 

08:04:51.384 --> 08:04:53.619
which communicated terror to 
her, and trembling, she asked, 

08:04:53.620 --> 08:04:56.060
“What is it that agitates you, 
my dear Victor?

08:05:03.374 --> 08:05:05.620
“this night, and all will be 
safe; but this night is 

08:05:05.621 --> 08:05:07.621
dreadful, very dreadful.

08:05:10.660 --> 08:05:12.660
I passed an hour in this state 

08:05:15.195 --> 08:05:17.275
of mind, when suddenly I 
reflected how fearful the combat

08:05:17.276 --> 08:05:19.276
which I momentarily 

08:05:21.362 --> 08:05:23.599
expected would be to my wife, 
and I earnestly entreated her to

08:05:23.600 --> 08:05:28.278
retire, resolving not to join 
her until I had obtained some 

08:05:28.279 --> 08:05:30.924
knowledge as to the situation of
my enemy.

08:05:35.809 --> 08:05:37.809
walking up and down the passages
of the 

08:05:40.503 --> 08:05:42.571
house and inspecting every 
corner that might afford a 

08:05:42.572 --> 08:05:44.572
retreat to my adversary.

08:05:47.900 --> 08:05:50.539
was beginning to conjecture that
some fortunate chance had 

08:05:50.540 --> 08:05:52.563
intervened to prevent the 
execution of his menaces 

08:05:57.444 --> 08:05:59.444
when suddenly I heard a shrill 
and dreadful scream.

08:06:06.852 --> 08:06:09.106
into my mind, my arms dropped, 
the motion of every muscle and 

08:06:09.107 --> 08:06:13.810
fibre was suspended; I could 
feel the blood trickling in my 

08:06:13.811 --> 08:06:15.811
veins and tingling in 

08:06:16.814 --> 08:06:18.814
the extremities of my limbs.

08:06:22.222 --> 08:06:24.863
the scream was repeated, and I 
rushed into the room.

08:06:32.208 --> 08:06:34.208
of the best hope and the purest 
creature on earth?

08:06:38.159 --> 08:06:40.793
thrown across the bed, her head 
hanging down and her pale and 

08:06:40.794 --> 08:06:43.452
distorted features half covered 
by her hair.

08:06:50.393 --> 08:06:52.428
figure—her bloodless arms and 
relaxed form flung by the 

08:06:52.429 --> 08:06:54.429
murderer on its bridal bier.

08:07:05.691 --> 08:07:07.691
recollection; I fell senseless 
on the ground.

08:07:11.398 --> 08:07:14.360
surrounded by the people of the 
inn; their countenances 

08:07:14.361 --> 08:07:16.409
expressed a breathless terror, 
but the horror of 

08:07:20.859 --> 08:07:22.874
others appeared only as a 
mockery, a shadow of the 

08:07:22.875 --> 08:07:24.875
feelings that oppressed me.

08:07:28.380 --> 08:07:30.454
lay the body of Elizabeth, my 
love, my wife, so lately living,

08:07:30.455 --> 08:07:32.455
so dear, so worthy.

08:07:36.355 --> 08:07:38.355
which I had first beheld her, 
and now, 

08:07:41.030 --> 08:07:43.274
as she lay, her head upon her 
arm and a handkerchief thrown 

08:07:43.275 --> 08:07:45.320
across her face and neck, I 
might have supposed her asleep.

08:07:51.658 --> 08:07:54.357
with ardour, but the deadly 
languor and coldness of the 

08:07:54.358 --> 08:07:56.358
limbs told me that what 

08:07:59.054 --> 08:08:01.710
I now held in my arms had ceased
to be the Elizabeth whom I had 

08:08:01.711 --> 08:08:03.711
loved and cherished.

08:08:07.481 --> 08:08:09.538
was on her neck, and the breath 
had ceased to issue from her 

08:08:09.539 --> 08:08:11.539
lips.

08:08:16.058 --> 08:08:18.058
agony of despair, I happened to 
look up.

08:08:20.776 --> 08:08:23.262
darkened, and I felt a kind of 
panic on seeing the pale yellow 

08:08:23.263 --> 08:08:25.263
light of the moon 

08:08:26.365 --> 08:08:26.774
The shutters had been thrown 
back, and with a sensation of 

08:08:26.775 --> 08:08:27.807
horror not to be described, I 
saw at the open window a figure 

08:08:27.808 --> 08:08:28.826
the most hideous and abhorred.he
seemed to jeer, as with his 

08:08:28.827 --> 08:08:31.884
fiendish finger he pointed 
towards the corpse of my wife.

08:08:35.196 --> 08:08:35.386
drawing a pistol from my bosom, 
fired; but he eluded me, leaped 

08:08:35.387 --> 08:08:36.002
from his station, and running 
with the swiftness of lightning,

08:08:36.003 --> 08:08:37.421
plunged into the lake.
disappeared, and we followed the

08:08:37.422 --> 08:08:40.274
track with boats; nets were 
cast, but in vain.returned 

08:08:40.275 --> 08:08:40.876
hopeless, most of my companions 
believing it to have been a form

08:08:40.877 --> 08:08:42.308
conjured up by my fancy.search 
the country, parties going in 

08:08:42.309 --> 08:08:44.309
different directions among the 
woods and vines.

08:08:48.007 --> 08:08:50.007
proceeded a short distance from 
the 

08:08:51.018 --> 08:08:53.018
house, but my head 

08:09:56.907 --> 08:09:58.907
whirled round, my steps were 

08:10:07.666 --> 08:10:07.854
like those of a drunken man, I 
fell at last in a state of utter

08:10:07.855 --> 08:10:09.516
exhaustion; a film covered my 
eyes, and my skin was parched 

08:10:09.517 --> 08:10:11.517
with the heat of fever.

08:10:13.201 --> 08:10:15.447
placed on a bed, hardly 
conscious of what had happened; 

08:10:15.448 --> 08:10:16.915
my eyes wandered round the room 
as if to seek something that I 

08:10:16.916 --> 08:10:18.916
had lost.

08:10:30.961 --> 08:10:32.341
as if by instinct, crawled into 
the room where the corpse of my 

08:10:32.342 --> 08:10:34.342
beloved lay.

08:10:38.388 --> 08:10:40.388
over it and joined my sad tears 
to theirs; all this time no 

08:10:41.750 --> 08:10:43.750
distinct idea presented itself 
to my 

08:10:44.764 --> 08:10:47.659
mind, but my thoughts rambled to
various subjects, reflecting 

08:10:47.660 --> 08:10:49.660
confusedly on my misfortunes and
their cause.

08:11:05.031 --> 08:11:07.280
Justine, the murder of Clerval, 
and lastly of my wife; even at 

08:11:07.281 --> 08:11:09.281
that moment I 

08:11:11.954 --> 08:11:13.981
knew not that my only remaining 
friends were safe from the 

08:11:13.982 --> 08:11:15.982
malignity of the 

08:11:18.251 --> 08:11:20.251
fiend; my father even now might 
be 

08:11:21.264 --> 08:11:24.168
writhing under his grasp, and 
Ernest might be dead at his 

08:11:24.169 --> 08:11:26.169
feet.

08:11:33.182 --> 08:11:33.588
I started up and resolved to 
return to Geneva with all 

08:11:33.589 --> 08:11:35.636
possible speed.and I must return
by the lake; but the wind was 

08:11:35.637 --> 08:11:37.863
unfavourable, and the rain fell 
in torrents.might reasonably 

08:11:37.864 --> 08:11:39.864
hope to arrive by night.

08:11:41.125 --> 08:11:42.163
myself, for I had always 
experienced relief from mental 

08:11:42.164 --> 08:11:44.164
torment in bodily exercise.

08:11:46.230 --> 08:11:48.230
and the excess of agitation that
I 

08:11:49.524 --> 08:11:51.524
endured rendered me incapable of
any exertion.

08:11:56.437 --> 08:11:58.473
leaning my head upon my hands, 
gave way to every gloomy idea 

08:11:58.474 --> 08:12:00.474
that arose.

08:12:08.421 --> 08:12:10.421
which were familiar to me in my 

08:12:14.389 --> 08:12:17.382
happier time and which I had 
contemplated but the day before 

08:12:19.099 --> 08:12:20.113
in the company of her who was 
now but a shadow and a 

08:12:20.114 --> 08:12:22.114
recollection.

08:12:30.561 --> 08:12:32.561
saw the fish play 

08:12:33.919 --> 08:12:35.919
in the waters as they had done a

08:12:38.153 --> 08:12:40.153
few hours before; they had then 
been observed by Elizabeth.

08:12:41.407 --> 08:12:43.407
as a great and sudden change.

08:12:44.456 --> 08:12:46.738
lower, but nothing could appear 
to me as it had done the day 

08:12:46.739 --> 08:12:48.739
before.

08:12:59.759 --> 08:13:00.849
every hope of future happiness; 
no creature had ever been so 

08:13:00.850 --> 08:13:01.867
miserable as I was; so frightful
an event is single in the 

08:13:01.868 --> 08:13:03.868
history of man.

08:13:08.267 --> 08:13:10.267
incidents that followed this 
last overwhelming event?

08:13:17.204 --> 08:13:18.830
reached theiracme, and what I 
must now relate can but be 

08:13:18.831 --> 08:13:20.831
tedious to you.

08:13:26.839 --> 08:13:28.839
friends were snatched away; I 
was left desolate.

08:13:32.710 --> 08:13:35.368
must tell, in a few words, what 
remains of my hideous narration.

08:13:46.413 --> 08:13:48.413
former sunk under the tidings 
that I bore.

08:14:01.541 --> 08:14:02.349
for they had lost their charm 
and their delight—his Elizabeth,

08:14:02.350 --> 08:14:04.350
his more than 

08:14:05.354 --> 08:14:10.759
daughter, whom he doted on with 
all that affection which a man 

08:14:10.760 --> 08:14:12.760
feels, who in the decline of 
life, 

08:14:14.437 --> 08:14:18.370
having few affections, clings 
more earnestly to those that 

08:14:14.437 --> 08:14:16.437
remain.

08:14:21.807 --> 08:14:24.039
brought misery on his grey hairs
and doomed him to waste in 

08:14:24.040 --> 08:14:26.040
wretchedness!

08:14:29.140 --> 08:14:31.404
that were accumulated around 
him; the springs of existence 

08:14:31.405 --> 08:14:33.405
suddenly gave way; 

08:14:36.748 --> 08:14:38.792
he was unable to rise from his 
bed, and in a few days he died 

08:14:38.793 --> 08:14:40.793
in my arms.

08:14:45.735 --> 08:14:48.179
chains and darkness were the 
only objects that pressed upon 

08:14:48.180 --> 08:14:50.180
me.

08:14:53.665 --> 08:14:55.721
wandered in flowery meadows and 
pleasant vales with the friends 

08:14:55.722 --> 08:14:58.373
of my youth, but I awoke and 
found myself in a dungeon.

08:15:04.699 --> 08:15:06.699
gained a clear conception of my 
miseries 

08:15:09.390 --> 08:15:11.390
and situation and was then 
released from my prison.

08:15:15.871 --> 08:15:17.306
many months, as I understood, a 
solitary cell had been my 

08:15:17.307 --> 08:15:19.307
habitation.

08:15:23.840 --> 08:15:25.876
gift to me, had I not, as I 
awakened to reason, at the same 

08:15:25.877 --> 08:15:27.877
time awakened to revenge.

08:15:32.789 --> 08:15:34.789
pressed upon me, I began to 
reflect on 

08:15:37.880 --> 08:15:38.862
their cause—the monster whom I 
had created, the miserable 

08:15:38.863 --> 08:15:41.109
daemon whom I had sent abroad 
into the world for my 

08:15:41.110 --> 08:15:43.110
destruction.

08:15:48.018 --> 08:15:50.677
when I thought of him, and 
desired and ardently prayed that

08:15:50.678 --> 08:15:54.950
I might have him within my grasp
to wreak a great and signal 

08:15:54.951 --> 08:15:56.951
revenge on his cursed head.

08:16:01.325 --> 08:16:03.325
useless wishes; I began to 
reflect on 

08:16:05.577 --> 08:16:07.881
the best means of securing him; 
and for this purpose, about a 

08:16:07.882 --> 08:16:10.270
month after my release, I 
repaired to a criminal judge 

08:16:13.952 --> 08:16:16.602
in the town and told him that I 
had an accusation to make, that 

08:16:16.603 --> 08:16:21.283
I knew the destroyer of my 
family, and that I required him 

08:16:21.284 --> 08:16:23.523
to exert his whole authority for
the apprehension of the 

08:16:23.524 --> 08:16:25.524
murderer.

08:16:35.114 --> 08:16:37.796
or exertions on my part shall be
spared to discover the villain.

08:16:39.855 --> 08:16:42.101
“I thank you,” replied I; 
“listen, therefore, to the 

08:16:42.102 --> 08:16:44.102
deposition that I have to make.

08:16:49.422 --> 08:16:51.422
should fear you would not credit
it were 

08:16:53.696 --> 08:16:55.723
there not something in truth 
which, however wonderful, forces

08:16:55.724 --> 08:16:57.724
conviction.

08:17:01.037 --> 08:17:03.037
mistaken for a dream, and I have
no motive for falsehood.

08:17:04.050 --> 08:17:06.050
” My 

08:17:48.067 --> 08:17:49.691
manner as I thus addressed him 
was impressive but calm; I had 

08:17:49.692 --> 08:17:51.317
formed in my own heart a 
resolution to pursue my 

08:17:51.318 --> 08:17:51.724
destroyer to death, and this 
purpose quieted my agony and for

08:17:51.725 --> 08:17:53.863
an interval reconciled me to 
life.

08:17:59.360 --> 08:18:01.390
with firmness and precision, 
marking the dates with accuracy 

08:18:01.391 --> 08:18:03.391
and never deviating 

08:18:04.465 --> 08:18:05.270
The magistrate appeared at first
perfectly incredulous, but as I 

08:18:05.271 --> 08:18:05.471
continued he became more 
attentive and interested; I saw 

08:18:05.472 --> 08:18:07.373
him sometimes shudder with 
horror; at others a lively 

08:18:07.374 --> 08:18:09.707
surprise, unmingled with 
disbelief, was When I had 

08:18:09.708 --> 08:18:11.708
concluded my narration, I said, 
“This is the being whom I accuse

08:18:15.094 --> 08:18:18.061
and for whose seizure and 
punishment I call upon you to 

08:18:18.062 --> 08:18:20.062
exert your whole power.

08:18:28.364 --> 08:18:28.770
and I believe and hope that your
feelings as a man will not 

08:18:28.771 --> 08:18:29.790
revolt from the execution of 
those functions on this 

08:18:29.791 --> 08:18:33.054
occasion.This address caused a 
considerable change in the 

08:18:33.055 --> 08:18:35.055
physiognomy of my own auditor.

08:18:38.419 --> 08:18:39.656
kind of belief that is given to 
a tale of spirits and 

08:18:39.657 --> 08:18:41.657
supernatural events; but 

08:18:42.663 --> 08:18:44.663
when he

08:18:45.838 --> 08:18:46.903
was called upon to act 
officially in consequence, the 

08:18:46.904 --> 08:18:48.904
whole tide of his incredulity 
returned.

08:18:56.211 --> 08:18:58.211
willingly afford you every

08:18:59.515 --> 08:19:02.510
aid in your pursuit, but the 
creature of whom you speak 

08:19:04.808 --> 08:19:05.429
appears to have powers which 
would put all my exertions to 

08:19:05.430 --> 08:19:07.430
defiance.

08:19:15.289 --> 08:19:17.289

08:19:25.564 --> 08:19:26.982
inhabit caves and dens where no 
man would venture to intrude?the

08:19:26.983 --> 08:19:28.983
commission of his crimes, and no
one 

08:19:30.240 --> 08:19:32.282
can conjecture to what place he 
has wandered or what region he 

08:19:32.283 --> 08:19:35.281
may now inhabit.”

08:19:40.844 --> 08:19:42.910
spot which I inhabit, and if he 
has indeed taken refuge in the 

08:19:42.911 --> 08:19:44.938
Alps, he may be hunted like the 
chamois and destroyed as a beast

08:19:44.939 --> 08:19:47.172
of prey.not credit my narrative 
and do not intend to pursue my 

08:19:47.173 --> 08:19:49.173
enemy with the punishment which 
is his desert.

08:19:51.190 --> 08:19:53.190
As I spoke, rage sparkled in my 

08:19:56.371 --> 08:19:58.371
eyes; the magistrate was 
intimidated.

08:20:04.012 --> 08:20:06.012
my power to seize the monster, 
be 

08:20:07.725 --> 08:20:11.791
assured that he shall suffer 
punishment proportionate to his 

08:20:07.725 --> 08:20:09.725
crimes.

08:20:19.989 --> 08:20:21.989
yourself described to be his 
properties, 

08:20:23.011 --> 08:20:25.011
that this will prove

08:20:29.254 --> 08:20:29.452
impracticable; and thus, while 
every proper measure is pursued,

08:20:29.453 --> 08:20:31.453
you should make up your mind to 
disappointment.

08:20:33.065 --> 08:20:35.065
”

08:20:41.101 --> 08:20:43.101
can say will be of little avail.

08:20:44.790 --> 08:20:46.790
while I allow it to be a vice, I
confess 

08:20:47.790 --> 08:20:49.790
that it is the

08:20:54.615 --> 08:20:56.615
devouring and only passion of my
soul.

08:21:09.682 --> 08:21:14.984
that the murderer, whom I have 
turned loose upon society, still

08:21:14.985 --> 08:21:16.985
exists.

08:21:29.474 --> 08:21:32.440
have but one resource, and I 
devote myself, either in my life

08:21:32.441 --> 08:21:34.058
or death, to his destruction.I 
trembled with excess of 

08:21:34.059 --> 08:21:35.084
agitation as I said this; there 
was a frenzy in my manner, and 

08:21:35.085 --> 08:21:37.085
something, I doubt not, of that 
haughty fierceness which the 

08:21:37.743 --> 08:21:39.743
martyrs of old are said to have 
possessed.

08:21:43.487 --> 08:21:45.487
was occupied by far other ideas 
than 

08:21:46.553 --> 08:21:48.553
those of devotion and heroism, 
this 

08:21:49.553 --> 08:21:51.553
elevation of mind had much the 
appearance of madness.

does a child and reverted 

08:22:06.163 --> 08:22:08.163
to my tale as the effects of 
delirium.

08:22:10.003 --> 08:22:10.429
I broke from the house angry and
disturbed and retired to 

08:22:10.430 --> 08:22:12.430
meditate on some other mode of 
action.

08:22:17.780 --> 08:22:19.780
all voluntary thought was 
swallowed up and lost.

08:22:24.512 --> 08:22:26.512
alone endowed me with 

08:22:27.761 --> 08:22:29.432
strength and composure; it 
moulded my feelings and allowed 

08:22:29.433 --> 08:22:33.309
me to be calculating and calm at
periods when otherwise delirium 

08:22:33.310 --> 08:22:37.195
or death would have been my 
portion.

08:22:45.699 --> 08:22:47.699
Geneva for ever; my country, 

08:22:51.025 --> 08:22:53.025
which, when I was happy and 

08:22:54.685 --> 08:22:56.685
beloved, was dear to me, now, in

08:22:58.000 --> 08:23:00.000
my adversity, became hateful.

08:23:03.318 --> 08:23:06.014
together with a few jewels which
had belonged to my mother, and 

08:23:06.015 --> 08:23:08.015
departed.

08:23:12.315 --> 08:23:14.315
to cease but with life.

of the earth and have endured 
all the hardships which 

08:23:25.832 --> 08:23:27.466
travellers in deserts and 
barbarous countries are wont to 

08:23:27.467 --> 08:23:29.467
meet.

being.was to gain some clue by 

08:23:33.453 --> 08:23:35.700
which I might trace the steps of
my fiendish enemy.wandered many 

08:23:35.701 --> 08:23:36.111
hours round the confines of the 
town, uncertain what path I 

08:23:36.112 --> 08:23:38.112
should pursue.

08:23:41.470 --> 08:23:42.729
the entrance of the cemetery 
where William, Elizabeth, and my

08:23:42.730 --> 08:23:44.730
father reposed.

08:23:53.694 --> 08:23:55.787
of the trees, which were gently 
agitated by the wind; the night 

08:23:55.788 --> 08:23:57.788
was nearly dark, 

08:24:00.463 --> 08:24:02.386
and the scene would have been 
solemn and affecting even to an 

08:24:02.387 --> 08:24:04.387
uninterested observer.

08:24:06.875 --> 08:24:09.525
flit around and to cast a 
shadow, which was felt but not 

08:24:09.526 --> 08:24:11.603
seen, around the head of the 
mourner.

08:24:16.384 --> 08:24:18.384
first excited quickly gave way 
to rage and despair.

08:24:22.816 --> 08:24:24.801
murderer also lived, and to 
destroy him I must drag out my 

08:24:24.802 --> 08:24:26.802
weary existence.

08:24:30.689 --> 08:24:32.709

exclaimed, “By the sacred earth 

08:24:32.710 --> 08:24:34.710

me, by the deep and eternal 

08:24:39.639 --> 08:24:41.676
grief that I feel, I swear; and 
by thee, O Night, and the 

08:24:43.925 --> 08:24:45.951
spirits that preside over thee, 
to pursue the daemon who caused 

08:24:45.952 --> 08:24:47.952
this 

08:24:50.728 --> 08:24:52.728
misery, until he or I shall 
perish in mortal conflict.

revenge will I again behold the 

08:24:58.669 --> 08:25:02.953
sun and tread the green herbage 
of earth, which otherwise should

08:25:02.954 --> 08:25:04.954
vanish from my eyes for ever.

of vengeance, to aid and conduct

drink deep of agony; let him 
feel the despair that now 

08:25:19.917 --> 08:25:21.917
torments me.

08:25:23.422 --> 08:25:25.040
I had begun my adjuration with 
solemnity and an awe which 

08:25:25.041 --> 08:25:27.041
almost assured me that 

08:25:29.332 --> 08:25:31.560
the shades of my murdered 
friends heard and approved my 

08:25:31.561 --> 08:25:33.591
devotion, but the furies 
possessed me as I concluded, and

08:25:33.592 --> 08:25:36.447
rage choked my utterance.

08:25:40.929 --> 08:25:42.929
night by a loud and fiendish 
laugh.

08:25:45.660 --> 08:25:47.924
the mountains re-echoed it, and 
I felt as if all hell surrounded

08:25:47.925 --> 08:25:50.587
me with mockery and laughter.

have destroyed my miserable 

08:25:57.737 --> 08:25:58.360
existence but that my vow was 
heard and that I was reserved 

08:25:58.361 --> 08:25:59.804
for vengeance.well-known and 
abhorred voice, apparently close

08:25:59.805 --> 08:26:01.805
to my ear, addressed me 

08:26:03.490 --> 08:26:05.490
in an audible whisper, “I am 
satisfied, miserable wretch!

08:26:09.782 --> 08:26:12.461
I darted towards the spot from 
which the sound proceeded, but 

08:26:12.462 --> 08:26:14.462
the devil eluded my grasp.

08:26:18.782 --> 08:26:21.015
arose and shone full upon his 
ghastly and distorted shape as 

08:26:21.016 --> 08:26:23.016
he fled with more 

08:26:24.041 --> 08:26:25.797
than mortalI pursued him, and 
for many months this has been my

08:26:25.798 --> 08:26:27.798
task.

08:26:31.501 --> 08:26:33.501
windings of the Rhone, but 
vainly.

08:26:37.274 --> 08:26:38.891
a strange chance, I saw the 
fiend enter by night and hide 

08:26:38.892 --> 08:26:41.532
himself in a vessel bound for 
the Black Sea.

08:26:47.474 --> 08:26:49.474
he escaped, I know not how.

08:26:52.198 --> 08:26:54.838
although he still evaded me, I 
have ever followed in his track.

08:27:01.735 --> 08:27:03.362
by this horrid apparition, 
informed me of his path; 

08:27:03.363 --> 08:27:05.363
sometimes he himself, who 

08:27:08.028 --> 08:27:10.388
feared that if I lost all trace 
of him I should despair and die,

08:27:10.389 --> 08:27:12.389
left some mark to guide me.

08:27:16.543 --> 08:27:18.543
saw the print of his huge step 
on the white plain.

08:27:22.869 --> 08:27:24.899
care is new and agony unknown, 
how can you understand what I 

08:27:24.900 --> 08:27:26.900
have felt and still feel?

08:27:31.803 --> 08:27:34.040
pains which I was destined to 
endure; I was cursed by some 

08:27:34.041 --> 08:27:36.683
devil and carried about with me 
my eternal hell; yet still 

08:27:40.393 --> 08:27:41.842
a spirit of good followed and 
directed my steps and when I 

08:27:41.843 --> 08:27:43.843
most murmured would 

08:27:45.512 --> 08:27:48.978
suddenly extricate me from 
seemingly insurmountable 

08:27:45.512 --> 08:27:47.512
difficulties.

08:27:51.428 --> 08:27:53.483
hunger, sank under the 
exhaustion, a repast was 

08:27:53.484 --> 08:27:55.720
prepared for me in the desert 
that restored and inspirited me.

08:28:02.083 --> 08:28:04.083
the peasants of the country ate,
but I 

08:28:06.397 --> 08:28:08.831
will not doubt that it was set 
there by the spirits that I had 

08:28:08.832 --> 08:28:10.832
invoked to aid me.

08:28:13.033 --> 08:28:14.666
cloudless, and I was parched by 
thirst, a slight cloud would 

08:28:14.667 --> 08:28:16.667
bedim the sky, shed 

08:28:19.441 --> 08:28:21.441
the few drops that revived me, 
and vanish.

08:28:24.133 --> 08:28:26.133
of the rivers; but the daemon 
generally 

08:28:28.403 --> 08:28:30.639
avoided these, as it was here 
that the population of the 

08:28:30.640 --> 08:28:32.640
country chiefly collected.

08:28:35.332 --> 08:28:37.982
seldom seen, and I generally 
subsisted on the wild animals 

08:28:37.983 --> 08:28:39.983
that crossed my path.

08:28:44.268 --> 08:28:46.327
friendship of the villagers by 
distributing it; or I brought 

08:28:46.328 --> 08:28:50.595
with me some food that I had 
killed, which, after taking a 

08:28:50.596 --> 08:28:52.596
small part, I always 

08:28:54.932 --> 08:28:56.356
presented to those who had 
provided me with fire and 

08:28:56.357 --> 08:28:58.357
utensils for cooking.

08:29:01.662 --> 08:29:03.894
hateful to me, and it was during
sleep alone that I could taste 

08:29:03.895 --> 08:29:05.895
joy.

08:29:09.612 --> 08:29:11.612
repose, and my dreams lulled me 
even to rapture.

08:29:16.397 --> 08:29:18.204
provided these moments, or 
rather hours, of happiness that 

08:29:18.205 --> 08:29:23.177
I might retain strength to 
fulfil my pilgrimage.sunk under 

08:29:23.178 --> 08:29:25.178
my hardships.

08:29:27.854 --> 08:29:30.095
inspirited by the hope of night,
for in sleep I saw my friends, 

08:29:30.096 --> 08:29:32.096
my wife, and my 

08:29:34.192 --> 08:29:35.813
beloved country; again I saw the
benevolent countenance of my 

08:29:35.814 --> 08:29:40.385
father, heard the silver tones 
of my Elizabeth's voice, and 

08:29:40.386 --> 08:29:42.386
beheld Clerval enjoying health 
and youth.

08:29:46.539 --> 08:29:48.568
march, I persuaded myself that I
was dreaming until night should 

08:29:48.569 --> 08:29:49.778
come and that I should then 
enjoy reality in the arms of my 

08:29:49.779 --> 08:29:51.779
dearest friends.

08:29:59.948 --> 08:30:01.380
sometimes they haunted even my 
waking hours, and persuade 

08:30:01.381 --> 08:30:03.613
myself that they still lived!

08:30:08.283 --> 08:30:10.534
within me, died in my heart, and
I pursued my path towards the 

08:30:10.535 --> 08:30:12.535
destruction 

08:30:14.656 --> 08:30:16.889
of the daemon more as a task 
enjoined by heaven, as the 

08:30:16.890 --> 08:30:20.971
mechanical impulse of some power
of which I was unconscious, than

08:30:20.972 --> 08:30:22.972
as the ardent desire of my soul.

08:30:31.142 --> 08:30:32.767
writing on the barks of the 
trees or cut in stone that 

08:30:32.768 --> 08:30:34.814
guided me and instigated my 
fury.

08:30:46.399 --> 08:30:48.640
words were legible in one of 
these inscriptions—“you live, 

08:30:48.641 --> 08:30:50.641
and my power is complete.

08:30:54.369 --> 08:30:56.369
of the north, where you will 
feel the 

08:30:58.515 --> 08:31:00.515
misery of cold and frost, to 
which I am impassive.

08:31:03.826 --> 08:31:05.826
follow not too tardily, a dead 
hare; eat and be refreshed.

08:31:10.760 --> 08:31:12.878
wrestle for our lives, but many 
hard and miserable hours must 

08:31:12.879 --> 08:31:14.944
you endure until that period 
shall arrive.

08:31:21.295 --> 08:31:23.295
devote thee, miserable fiend, to
torture and death.

08:31:27.632 --> 08:31:29.860
or I perish; and then with what 
ecstasy shall I join my 

08:31:29.861 --> 08:31:31.861
Elizabeth and my 

08:31:34.160 --> 08:31:36.637
departed friends, who even now 
prepare for me the reward of my 

08:31:36.638 --> 08:31:38.638
tedious toil and horrible 
pilgrimage!

08:31:42.573 --> 08:31:44.639
northward, the snows thickened 
and the cold increased in a 

08:31:44.640 --> 08:31:47.277
degree almost too severe to 
support.

08:31:51.381 --> 08:31:54.234
hovels, and only a few of the 
most hardy ventured forth to 

08:31:54.235 --> 08:31:56.235
seize the animals whom 

08:31:57.902 --> 08:31:59.902
starvation had forced from their
hiding-places to seek for prey.

08:32:04.241 --> 08:32:06.241
no fish could be procured; and 
thus I 

08:32:08.381 --> 08:32:10.381
was cut off from my chief 
article of maintenance.

08:32:13.659 --> 08:32:15.659
the difficulty of my labours.

08:32:22.625 --> 08:32:24.625
furs and provide food, for we 
shall soon 

08:32:26.921 --> 08:32:29.086
enter upon a journey where your 
sufferings will satisfy my 

08:32:29.087 --> 08:32:31.087
everlasting hatred.

08:32:33.356 --> 08:32:35.400
My courage and perseverance were
invigorated by these scoffing 

08:32:35.401 --> 08:32:38.080
words; I resolved not to fail in
my purpose, and 

08:32:41.757 --> 08:32:44.649
calling on Heaven to support me,
I continued with unabated 

08:32:44.650 --> 08:32:48.719
fervour to traverse immense 
deserts, until the ocean 

08:32:48.720 --> 08:32:51.244
appeared at a distance and 
formed the utmost boundary of 

08:32:51.245 --> 08:32:53.245
the horizon.

08:33:02.265 --> 08:33:04.504
distinguished from land by its 
superior wildness and 

08:33:04.505 --> 08:33:06.505
ruggedness.

08:33:09.202 --> 08:33:11.443
beheld the Mediterranean from 
the hills of Asia, and hailed 

08:33:11.444 --> 08:33:13.903
with rapture the boundary of 
their toils.

08:33:19.753 --> 08:33:22.023
with a full heart thanked my 
guiding spirit for conducting me

08:33:22.024 --> 08:33:24.662
in safety to the place where I 
hoped, notwithstanding 

08:33:28.773 --> 08:33:30.773
my adversary's gibe, to meet and
grapple with him.

08:33:34.675 --> 08:33:36.727
procured a sledge and dogs and 
thus traversed the snows with 

08:33:36.728 --> 08:33:38.728
inconceivable speed.

08:33:43.029 --> 08:33:45.698
the same advantages, but I found
that, as before I had daily lost

08:33:45.699 --> 08:33:47.699
ground in the 

08:33:49.964 --> 08:33:52.608
pursuit, I now gained on him, so
much so that when I first saw 

08:33:52.609 --> 08:33:54.647
the ocean he was but one day's 
journey in advance, and I 

08:33:59.569 --> 08:34:01.569
hoped to intercept him before he
should reach the beach.

08:34:05.321 --> 08:34:07.379
on, and in two days arrived at a
wretched hamlet on the seashore.

08:34:13.690 --> 08:34:15.690
concerning the fiend and gained 
accurate information.

08:34:20.087 --> 08:34:21.707
arrived the night before, armed 
with a gun and many pistols, 

08:34:21.708 --> 08:34:23.708
putting to flight 

08:34:26.424 --> 08:34:28.057
the inhabitants of a solitary 
cottage through fear of his 

08:34:28.058 --> 08:34:30.058
terrific appearance.

08:34:34.364 --> 08:34:37.280
winter food, and placing it in a
sledge, to draw which he had 

08:34:37.281 --> 08:34:39.281
seized on a 

08:34:41.390 --> 08:34:43.413
numerous drove of trained dogs, 
he had harnessed them, and the 

08:34:43.414 --> 08:34:45.464
same night, to the joy of the 
horror-struck villagers, 

08:34:49.729 --> 08:34:52.378
had pursued his journey across 
the sea in a direction that led 

08:34:52.379 --> 08:34:54.428
to no land; and they conjectured
that he must speedily 

08:34:59.376 --> 08:35:00.794
be destroyed by the breaking of 
the ice or frozen by the eternal

08:35:00.795 --> 08:35:02.795
frosts.

08:35:06.689 --> 08:35:08.689
a temporary access of despair.

08:35:11.574 --> 08:35:13.574
a destructive and almost endless
journey 

08:35:15.695 --> 08:35:18.335
across the mountainous ices of 
the ocean, amidst cold that few 

08:35:18.336 --> 08:35:22.640
of the inhabitants could long 
endure and which I, the native 

08:35:22.641 --> 08:35:25.293
of a genial and sunny climate, 
could not hope to survive.

08:35:32.119 --> 08:35:34.144
live and be triumphant, my rage 
and vengeance returned, and like

08:35:34.145 --> 08:35:36.406
a mighty tide, overwhelmed every
other feeling.

08:35:44.110 --> 08:35:46.518
spirits of the dead hovered 
round and instigated me to toil 

08:35:48.544 --> 08:35:50.544
and revenge, I prepared for my 
journey.

08:35:53.869 --> 08:35:55.869
fashioned for the inequalities 
of the 

08:35:57.543 --> 08:36:00.204
Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a 
plentiful stock of provisions, I

08:36:00.205 --> 08:36:02.205
departed from land.

08:36:04.890 --> 08:36:05.494
passed since then, but I have 
endured misery which nothing but

08:36:05.495 --> 08:36:06.095
the eternal sentiment of a just 
retribution burning within my 

08:36:06.096 --> 08:36:08.096
heart could have enabled me to 
support.

08:36:10.376 --> 08:36:10.993
often barred up my passage, and 
I often heard the thunder of the

08:36:10.994 --> 08:36:12.994
ground sea, which threatened my 
destruction.

08:36:16.701 --> 08:36:18.701
paths of the sea secure.

08:36:21.198 --> 08:36:23.849
had consumed, I should guess 
that I had passed three weeks in

08:36:23.850 --> 08:36:25.850
this journey; and 

08:36:28.519 --> 08:36:31.180
the continual protraction of 
hope, returning back upon the 

08:36:31.181 --> 08:36:35.497
heart, often wrung bitter drops 
of despondency and grief from my

08:36:35.498 --> 08:36:37.498
eyes.

08:36:40.179 --> 08:36:42.217
prey, and I should soon have 
sunk beneath this misery.

08:36:46.510 --> 08:36:48.510
conveyed me had with incredible 
toil 

08:36:50.185 --> 08:36:52.830
gained the summit of a sloping 
ice mountain, and one, sinking 

08:36:52.831 --> 08:36:57.565
under his fatigue, died, I 
viewed the expanse before me 

08:36:57.566 --> 08:37:00.222
with anguish, when suddenly my 
eye caught a dark speck upon the

08:37:00.223 --> 08:37:02.223
dusky plain.

08:37:07.691 --> 08:37:09.740
could be and uttered a wild cry 
of ecstasy when I distinguished 

08:37:09.741 --> 08:37:11.741
a sledge 

08:37:13.937 --> 08:37:15.937
and the distorted proportions of
a well-known form within.

08:37:24.134 --> 08:37:26.796
hastily wiped away, that they 
might not intercept the view I 

08:37:26.797 --> 08:37:29.458
had of the daemon; but still my 
sight was dimmed by the 

08:37:34.210 --> 08:37:36.848
burning drops, until, giving way
to the emotions that oppressed 

08:37:36.849 --> 08:37:38.849
me, I wept aloud.

08:37:42.146 --> 08:37:44.811
disencumbered the dogs of their 
dead companion, gave them a 

08:37:44.812 --> 08:37:46.812
plentiful portion 

08:37:48.911 --> 08:37:51.527
of food, and after an hour's 
rest, which was absolutely 

08:37:51.528 --> 08:37:53.178
necessary, and yet which was 
bitterly irksome to me, I 

08:37:53.179 --> 08:37:55.852
continued my route.

08:38:01.135 --> 08:38:03.780
again lose sight of it except at
the moments when for a short 

08:38:03.781 --> 08:38:05.781
time some 

08:38:07.056 --> 08:38:09.056
ice-rock concealed it with its 
intervening crags.

08:38:13.195 --> 08:38:16.007
when, after nearly two days' 
journey, I beheld my enemy at no

08:38:16.008 --> 08:38:18.035
more than a mile distant, my 
heart bounded within me.

08:38:24.959 --> 08:38:27.604
grasp of my foe, my hopes were 
suddenly extinguished, and I 

08:38:27.605 --> 08:38:29.605
lost all trace of 

08:38:31.263 --> 08:38:33.263
him more utterly than I had ever
done before.

08:38:36.605 --> 08:38:38.605
its progress, as the waters 
rolled and 

08:38:40.730 --> 08:38:44.463
swelled beneath me, became every
moment more ominous and 

08:38:40.730 --> 08:38:42.730
terrific.

08:38:49.834 --> 08:38:51.388
with the mighty shock of an 
earthquake, it split and cracked

08:38:51.389 --> 08:38:53.389
with a tremendous 

08:38:54.393 --> 08:38:56.393
and overwhelming sound.

08:38:59.873 --> 08:39:02.514
minutes a tumultuous sea rolled 
between me and my enemy, and I 

08:39:02.515 --> 08:39:04.515
was left drifting 

08:39:06.787 --> 08:39:09.447
on a scattered piece of ice that
was continually lessening and 

08:39:09.448 --> 08:39:11.448
thus preparing for me a hideous 
death.

08:39:16.796 --> 08:39:18.862
passed; several of my dogs died,
and I myself was about to sink 

08:39:18.863 --> 08:39:21.526
under the accumulation of 
distress when I saw your 

08:39:25.796 --> 08:39:28.442
vessel riding at anchor and 
holding forth to me hopes of 

08:39:28.443 --> 08:39:30.443
succour and life.

08:39:33.749 --> 08:39:35.749
came so far north and was 
astounded at the sight.

08:39:40.139 --> 08:39:42.590
to construct oars, and by these 
means was enabled, with infinite

08:39:42.591 --> 08:39:47.362
fatigue, to move my ice raft in 
the direction of your ship.

08:39:52.705 --> 08:39:55.388
southwards, still to trust 
myself to the mercy of the seas 

08:39:55.389 --> 08:39:57.389
rather than abandon my purpose.

08:40:02.326 --> 08:40:04.326
boat with which I could pursue 
my enemy.

08:40:08.651 --> 08:40:10.651
exhausted, and I should soon 
have sunk 

08:40:13.371 --> 08:40:15.449
under my multiplied hardships 
into a death which I still 

08:40:15.450 --> 08:40:17.450
dread, for my task is 
unfulfilled.

08:40:21.780 --> 08:40:24.016
conducting me to the daemon, 
allow me the rest I so much 

08:40:24.017 --> 08:40:26.055
desire; or must I die, and he 
yet live?

08:40:32.194 --> 08:40:34.054
shall not escape, that you will 
seek him and satisfy my 

08:40:34.055 --> 08:40:36.055
vengeance in his death.

08:40:39.744 --> 08:40:42.417
undertake my pilgrimage, to 
endure the hardships that I have

08:40:42.418 --> 08:40:44.418
undergone?

08:40:49.362 --> 08:40:52.005
appear, if the ministers of 
vengeance should conduct him to 

08:40:52.006 --> 08:40:54.006
you, swear that he 

08:40:56.325 --> 08:40:58.562
shall not live—swear that he 
shall not triumph over my 

08:40:58.563 --> 08:40:59.370
accumulated woes and He is 
eloquent and persuasive, and 

08:40:59.371 --> 08:41:02.456
once his words had even power 
over my heart; but trust him 

08:41:02.457 --> 08:41:04.457
not.

08:41:07.153 --> 08:41:09.153
full of treachery and fiend-like
malice.

08:41:13.581 --> 08:41:15.581
William, Justine, Clerval, 
Elizabeth, my 

08:41:16.582 --> 08:41:18.370
father, and of the wretched 
Victor, and thrust your sword 

08:41:18.371 --> 08:41:20.371
into his heart.

08:41:31.082 --> 08:41:33.082
story, Margaret; and do you not 
feel 

08:41:34.087 --> 08:41:36.087
your blood congeal 

08:41:51.108 --> 08:41:53.133
with horror, like that which 
even now curdles mine?could not 

08:41:53.134 --> 08:41:53.753
continue his tale; at others, 
his voice broken, yet piercing, 

08:41:53.754 --> 08:41:55.754
uttered with difficulty the 
words so replete with anguish.

08:41:56.806 --> 08:41:57.423
lighted up with indignation, now
subdued to downcast sorrow and 

08:41:57.424 --> 08:41:59.424
quenched in infinite 
wretchedness.

08:42:06.394 --> 08:42:09.068
and tones and related the most 
horrible incidents with a 

08:42:09.069 --> 08:42:13.306
tranquil voice, suppressing 
every mark of agitation; then, 

08:42:13.307 --> 08:42:15.974
like a volcano bursting forth, 
his face would suddenly change 

08:42:15.975 --> 08:42:17.975
to an 

08:42:20.247 --> 08:42:22.721
expression of the wildest rage 
as he shrieked out imprecations 

08:42:22.722 --> 08:42:24.722
on his persecutor.

08:42:27.642 --> 08:42:30.170
appearance of the simplest 
truth, yet I own to you that the

08:42:30.171 --> 08:42:32.171
letters of Felix and 

08:42:34.893 --> 08:42:37.570
Safie, which he showed me, and 
the apparition of the monster 

08:42:37.571 --> 08:42:39.634
seen from our ship, brought to 
me a greater conviction 

08:42:44.936 --> 08:42:47.187
of the truth of his narrative 
than his asseverations, however 

08:42:47.188 --> 08:42:49.188
earnest and connected.

08:42:59.838 --> 08:43:01.892
Frankenstein the particulars of 
his creature's formation, but on

08:43:01.893 --> 08:43:03.893
this point he was impenetrable.

08:43:05.147 --> 08:43:07.378
Would you also create for 
yourself and the world a 

08:43:07.379 --> 08:43:09.379
demoniacal enemy?

08:43:15.334 --> 08:43:17.374
Frankenstein discovered that I 
made notes concerning his 

08:43:17.375 --> 08:43:20.016
history; he asked to see them 
and then himself corrected 

08:43:24.721 --> 08:43:27.402
and augmented them in many 
places, but principally in 

08:43:27.403 --> 08:43:29.403
giving the life and spirit to 
the conversations he held with 

08:43:31.050 --> 08:43:33.050
his enemy.

08:43:35.967 --> 08:43:38.427
narration,” said he, “I would 
not that a mutilated one should 

08:43:38.428 --> 08:43:40.428
go down to posterity.

08:43:41.611 --> 08:43:43.895
Thus has a week passed away, 
while I have listened to the 

08:43:43.896 --> 08:43:45.954
strangest tale that ever 
imagination formed.

08:43:52.326 --> 08:43:54.500
soul have been drunk up by the 
interest for my guest which this

08:43:54.501 --> 08:43:56.970
tale and his own elevated and 
gentle manners have created.

08:44:03.889 --> 08:44:06.591
one so infinitely miserable, so 
destitute of every hope of 

08:44:06.592 --> 08:44:08.592
consolation, to live?

08:44:13.536 --> 08:44:15.583
be when he composes his 
shattered spirit to peace and 

08:44:15.584 --> 08:44:17.584
death.

08:44:20.927 --> 08:44:22.952
offspring of solitude and 
delirium; he believes that when 

08:44:22.953 --> 08:44:25.642
in dreams he holds converse with
his friends and derives 

08:44:29.750 --> 08:44:32.395
from that communion consolation 
for his miseries or excitements 

08:44:32.396 --> 08:44:37.126
to his vengeance, that they are 
not the creations of his fancy, 

08:44:37.127 --> 08:44:42.048
but the beings themselves who 
visit him from the regions of a 

08:44:42.049 --> 08:44:44.049
remote world.

08:44:47.766 --> 08:44:49.402
reveries that render them to me 
almost as imposing and 

08:44:49.403 --> 08:44:51.403
interesting as truth.

08:44:55.718 --> 08:44:57.718
confined to his own history and 
misfortunes.

08:45:01.623 --> 08:45:03.078
displays unbounded knowledge and
a quick and piercing 

08:45:03.079 --> 08:45:05.079
apprehension.

08:45:09.521 --> 08:45:11.566
touching; nor can I hear him, 
when he relates a pathetic 

08:45:11.567 --> 08:45:16.460
incident or endeavours to move 
the passions of pity or love, 

08:45:16.461 --> 08:45:18.461
without tears.

08:45:22.417 --> 08:45:23.862
been in the days of his 
prosperity, when he is thus 

08:45:23.863 --> 08:45:25.863
noble and godlike in ruin!

08:45:34.369 --> 08:45:36.369
myself destined for some great 
enterprise.

08:45:41.334 --> 08:45:43.885
possessed a coolness of judgment
that fitted me for illustrious 

08:45:43.886 --> 08:45:45.886
achievements.

08:45:48.613 --> 08:45:50.613
nature supported me when others 
would 

08:45:52.331 --> 08:45:54.572
have been oppressed, for I 
deemed it criminal to throw away

08:45:54.573 --> 08:45:56.852
in useless grief those talents 
that might be useful to my 

08:45:58.683 --> 08:46:00.683
fellow creatures.

08:46:03.583 --> 08:46:06.039
completed, no less a one than 
the creation of a sensitive and 

08:46:06.040 --> 08:46:10.309
rational animal, I could not 
rank myself with the herd of 

08:46:10.310 --> 08:46:12.310
common projectors.

08:46:16.421 --> 08:46:18.897
the commencement of my career, 
now serves only to plunge me 

08:46:18.898 --> 08:46:20.898
lower in the dust.

08:46:24.205 --> 08:46:24.395
nothing, and like the archangel 
who aspired to omnipotence, I am

08:46:24.396 --> 08:46:25.822
chained in an eternal hell.of 
analysis and application were 

08:46:25.823 --> 08:46:27.272
intense; by the union of these 
qualities I conceived the idea 

08:46:27.273 --> 08:46:29.273
and executed the creation of a 
man.

08:46:32.605 --> 08:46:34.605
passion my reveries while the 
work was incomplete.

08:46:39.946 --> 08:46:42.601
exulting in my powers, now 
burning with the idea of their 

08:46:42.602 --> 08:46:44.602
effects.

08:46:46.908 --> 08:46:48.908
hopes and a lofty ambition; but 
how am I sunk!

08:46:53.654 --> 08:46:56.316
once was, you would not 
recognise me in this state of 

08:46:56.317 --> 08:46:58.317
degradation.

08:47:02.279 --> 08:47:04.537
high destiny seemed to bear me 
on, until I fell, never, never 

08:47:04.538 --> 08:47:06.538
again to rise.

08:47:08.638 --> 08:47:10.638
Must I then lose this admirable 
being?

08:47:13.372 --> 08:47:15.372
sought one who would sympathise 
with and love me.

08:47:19.717 --> 08:47:22.361
found such a one, but I fear I 
have gained him only to know his

08:47:22.362 --> 08:47:24.362
value and lose him.

08:47:32.926 --> 08:47:35.576
your kind intentions towards so 
miserable a wretch; but when you

08:47:35.577 --> 08:47:37.617
speak of new ties and fresh 
affections, think 

08:47:42.951 --> 08:47:44.951
you that any can replace those 
who are gone?

08:47:47.626 --> 08:47:49.626
any woman another Elizabeth?

08:47:52.527 --> 08:47:54.560
strongly moved by any superior 
excellence, the companions of 

08:47:54.561 --> 08:47:56.584
our childhood always possess a 
certain power 

08:48:01.473 --> 08:48:03.473
over our minds which hardly any 
later friend can obtain.

08:48:07.179 --> 08:48:09.837
which, however they may be 
afterwards modified, are never 

08:48:09.838 --> 08:48:11.838
eradicated; and they 

08:48:14.575 --> 08:48:16.805
can judge of our actions with 
more certain conclusions as to 

08:48:16.806 --> 08:48:18.806
the integrity of our motives.

08:48:23.558 --> 08:48:26.205
indeed such symptoms have been 
shown early, suspect the other 

08:48:26.206 --> 08:48:28.885
of fraud or false dealing, when 
another friend, 

08:48:32.552 --> 08:48:34.831
however strongly he may be 
attached, may, in spite of 

08:48:34.832 --> 08:48:36.832
himself, be contemplated with 
suspicion.

08:48:40.537 --> 08:48:43.187
through habit and association, 
but from their own merits; and 

08:48:43.188 --> 08:48:45.188
wherever I am, the 

08:48:48.084 --> 08:48:50.121
soothing voice of my Elizabeth 
and the conversation of Clerval 

08:48:50.122 --> 08:48:52.155
will be ever whispered in my 
ear.

08:48:57.043 --> 08:48:59.043
such a solitude can persuade me 
to preserve my life.

08:49:04.391 --> 08:49:06.693
undertaking or design, fraught 
with extensive utility to my 

08:49:06.694 --> 08:49:08.694
fellow creatures, then could I 
live to fulfil it.

08:49:14.491 --> 08:49:17.183
pursue and destroy the being to 
whom I gave existence; then my 

08:49:17.184 --> 08:49:19.219
lot on earth will be fulfilled 
and I may die.

08:49:22.298 --> 08:49:24.298
My beloved Sister, September 2d.

08:49:28.442 --> 08:49:30.916
and ignorant whether I am ever 
doomed to see again dear England

08:49:30.917 --> 08:49:33.782
and the dearer friends that 
inhabit it.

08:49:39.279 --> 08:49:41.320
which admit of no escape and 
threaten every moment to crush 

08:49:41.321 --> 08:49:43.321
my vessel.

08:49:47.189 --> 08:49:49.446
to be my companions look towards
me for aid, but I have none to 

08:49:49.447 --> 08:49:51.447
bestow.

08:49:55.166 --> 08:49:57.196
in our situation, yet my courage
and hopes do not desert me.

08:50:02.510 --> 08:50:04.510
lives of all these men are 
endangered through me.

08:50:11.700 --> 08:50:13.157
and you will anxiously await my 
return.visitings of despair and 

08:50:13.158 --> 08:50:15.158
yet be tortured by hope.

08:50:16.224 --> 08:50:18.289
My beloved sister, the sickening
failing of your heart-felt 

08:50:18.290 --> 08:50:23.195
expectations is, in prospect, 
more terrible to me than my own 

08:50:23.196 --> 08:50:25.196
death.

08:50:27.271 --> 08:50:29.271
children; you may be happy.

08:50:40.596 --> 08:50:42.596
talks as if life were a 
possession which he valued.

08:50:47.348 --> 08:50:49.998
accidents have happened to other
navigators who have attempted 

08:50:49.999 --> 08:50:51.999
this sea, and in spite of 
myself, he fills me with 

08:50:53.701 --> 08:50:55.701
cheerful auguries.

08:50:59.620 --> 08:51:02.270
eloquence; when he speaks, they 
no longer despair; he rouses 

08:51:02.271 --> 08:51:04.765
their energies, and while they 
hear his voice 

08:51:09.723 --> 08:51:11.750
they believe these vast 
mountains of ice are mole-hills 

08:51:11.751 --> 08:51:14.405
which will vanish before the 
resolutions of man.

08:51:19.718 --> 08:51:21.801
of expectation delayed fills 
them with fear, and I almost 

08:51:21.802 --> 08:51:23.838
dread a mutiny caused by this 
despair.

08:51:30.811 --> 08:51:33.415
uncommon interest that, although
it is highly probable that these

08:51:33.416 --> 08:51:36.070
papers may never reach you, yet 
I cannot forbear recording it.

08:51:42.389 --> 08:51:44.630
ice, still in imminent danger of
being crushed in their conflict.

08:51:51.005 --> 08:51:53.061
unfortunate comrades have 
already found a grave amidst 

08:51:53.062 --> 08:51:55.062
this scene of desolation.

08:51:59.990 --> 08:52:00.403
health; a feverish fire still 
glimmers in his eyes, but he is 

08:52:00.404 --> 08:52:01.412
exhausted, and when suddenly 
roused to any exertion, he 

08:52:01.413 --> 08:52:03.721
speedily sinks again into 
apparent lifelessness.I 

08:52:03.722 --> 08:52:05.722
entertained of a mutiny.

08:52:07.435 --> 08:52:07.836
the wan countenance of my 
friend—his eyes half closed and 

08:52:07.837 --> 08:52:12.966
his limbs hanging listlessly—I 
Fe Fe Fe Fe Fe Fe was roused by 

08:52:12.967 --> 08:52:13.979
half a dozen of the sailors, He 
told me that he and his 

08:52:13.980 --> 08:52:17.242
companions had been chosen by 
the other sailors to come in 

08:52:17.243 --> 08:52:17.638
deputation to me to make me a 
requisition which, in justice, I

08:52:17.639 --> 08:52:19.504
could not refuse.probably never 
escape, but they feared that if,

08:52:19.505 --> 08:52:22.169
as was possible, the ice should 
dissipate and a free passage be 

08:52:22.170 --> 08:52:26.841
Fe opened, I should be rash 
enough to continue my voyage and

08:52:26.842 --> 08:52:31.111
lead them into fresh dangers, 
after they might happily have 

08:52:31.112 --> 08:52:33.112
surmounted this.

08:52:35.849 --> 08:52:37.849
engage with a solemn promise 
that if the 

08:52:39.339 --> 08:52:40.749
vessel should be freed I would 
instantly direct my course 

08:52:40.750 --> 08:52:42.750
southwards.

08:52:46.924 --> 08:52:48.924
conceived the idea of returning 
if set free.

08:52:52.240 --> 08:52:54.240
possibility, refuse this demand?

08:52:57.129 --> 08:52:59.167
Frankenstein, who had at first 
been silent, and indeed appeared

08:52:59.168 --> 08:53:01.168
hardly to 

08:53:02.834 --> 08:53:05.057
have force enough to attend, now
roused himself; his eyes 

08:53:05.058 --> 08:53:07.058
sparkled, and his cheeks flushed
with momentary vigour.

08:53:25.377 --> 08:53:27.375
placid as a southern sea, but 
because it was full of dangers 

08:53:27.376 --> 08:53:29.376
and terror, because 

08:53:30.449 --> 08:53:33.109
at every new incident your 
fortitude was to be called forth

08:53:33.110 --> 08:53:35.110
and your courage 

08:53:36.216 --> 08:53:37.828
exhibited, because danger and 
death surrounded it, and these 

08:53:37.829 --> 08:53:39.829
you were to brave and overcome.

08:53:43.548 --> 08:53:46.205
was it an honourable 
undertaking.benefactors of your 

08:53:46.206 --> 08:53:47.006
species, your names adored as 
belonging to brave men who 

08:53:47.007 --> 08:53:48.437
encountered death for honour and
the benefit of mankind.

08:53:48.438 --> 08:53:49.277
imagination of danger, or, if 
you will, the first mighty and 

08:53:49.278 --> 08:53:51.524
terrific trial of your courage, 
you shrink away and are 

08:53:55.848 --> 08:53:58.490
content to be handed down as men
who had not strength enough to 

08:53:58.491 --> 08:54:02.571
endure cold and peril; and so, 
poor souls, they were chilly and

08:54:02.572 --> 08:54:04.572
returned to their warm 
firesides.

08:54:07.523 --> 08:54:10.376
preparation; ye need not have 
come thus far and dragged your 

08:54:10.377 --> 08:54:13.263
captain to the shame of a defeat
merely to prove yourselves 

08:54:13.264 --> 08:54:15.264
cowards.

08:54:22.796 --> 08:54:25.491
your hearts may be; it is 
mutable and cannot withstand you

08:54:25.492 --> 08:54:27.492
if you say that it 

08:54:29.381 --> 08:54:30.616
Do not return to your families 
with the stigma of disgrace 

08:54:30.617 --> 08:54:32.617
marked on your brows.

08:54:36.532 --> 08:54:38.577
conquered and who know not what 
it is to turn their backs on the

08:54:38.578 --> 08:54:43.325
foe.He spoke this with a voice 
so modulated to the different 

08:54:43.326 --> 08:54:45.326
feelings expressed in 

08:54:47.223 --> 08:54:49.295
his speech, with an eye so full 
of lofty design and heroism, 

08:54:49.296 --> 08:54:51.334
that can you wonder that these 
men were moved?

08:54:59.769 --> 08:55:02.014
consider of what had been said, 
that I would not lead them 

08:55:02.015 --> 08:55:04.466
farther north if they 
strenuously desired the 

08:55:04.467 --> 08:55:07.354
contrary, but that I hoped that,
with reflection, their courage 

08:55:07.355 --> 08:55:11.315
would return.How all this will 
terminate, I know not, but I had

08:55:11.316 --> 08:55:13.350
rather die than return 
shamefully, my purpose 

08:55:13.351 --> 08:55:15.351
unfulfilled.

08:55:18.732 --> 08:55:20.202
men, unsupported by ideas of 
glory and honour, can never 

08:55:20.203 --> 08:55:22.430
willingly continue to endure 
their present hardships.

08:55:28.754 --> 08:55:30.754
return if we are not destroyed.

08:55:33.388 --> 08:55:35.388
and indecision; I come back 
ignorant and disappointed.

08:55:39.778 --> 08:55:41.778
possess to bear this injustice 
with patience.

08:55:48.350 --> 08:55:50.350
glory; I have lost my friend.

08:55:53.066 --> 08:55:55.112
bitter circumstances to you, my 
dear sister; and while I am 

08:55:55.113 --> 08:55:57.349
wafted towards England and 
towards you, I will not despond.

08:56:03.718 --> 08:56:05.787
and roarings like thunder were 
heard at a distance as the 

08:56:05.788 --> 08:56:07.788
islands split and cracked in 
every direction.

08:56:12.147 --> 08:56:14.147
as we could only remain passive,
my 

08:56:15.713 --> 08:56:15.910
chief attention was occupied by 
my unfortunate guest whose 

08:56:15.911 --> 08:56:18.581
illness increased in such a 
degree that he was entirely 

08:56:18.582 --> 08:56:20.582
confined to his bed.

08:56:23.118 --> 08:56:25.160
driven with force towards the 
north; a breeze sprang from the 

08:56:25.161 --> 08:56:29.468
west, and on the 11th the 
passage towards the south became

08:56:29.469 --> 08:56:31.469
perfectly free.

08:56:34.332 --> 08:56:36.395
their return to their native 
country was apparently assured, 

08:56:36.396 --> 08:56:38.439
a shout of tumultuous joy broke 
from them, loud and 

08:56:40.667 --> 08:56:42.667
long-continued.

08:56:45.990 --> 08:56:47.990
asked the cause of the tumult.

08:56:50.102 --> 08:56:52.102
will soon return to England.

08:57:01.517 --> 08:57:02.144
“Do so, if you will; but I will 
not.is assigned to me by Heaven,

08:57:02.145 --> 08:57:04.178
and I dare not.assist my 
vengeance will endow me with 

08:57:04.586 --> 08:57:05.592
sufficient strength.” Saying 
this, he endeavoured to spring 

08:57:05.593 --> 08:57:05.793
from the bed, but the exertion 
was too great for him; he fell 

08:57:05.794 --> 08:57:07.794
back and fainted.

08:57:10.130 --> 08:57:12.130
I often thought that life was 
entirely extinct.

08:57:17.085 --> 08:57:19.085
breathed with difficulty and was
unable to speak.

08:57:22.421 --> 08:57:24.421
draught and ordered us to leave 
him undisturbed.

08:57:27.083 --> 08:57:29.083
friend had certainly not many 
hours to live.

08:57:31.816 --> 08:57:33.816
could only grieve and be 
patient.

08:57:36.112 --> 08:57:38.544
eyes were closed, and I thought 
he slept; but presently he 

08:57:38.545 --> 08:57:42.422
called to me in a feeble voice, 
and bidding me come near, said, 

08:57:42.423 --> 08:57:44.423
“Alas!

08:57:47.775 --> 08:57:49.775
feel that I shall soon die, and 
he, my 

08:57:52.094 --> 08:57:54.094
enemy and persecutor, may still 
be in being.

08:58:02.116 --> 08:58:03.558
moments of my existence I feel 
that burning hatred and ardent 

08:58:03.559 --> 08:58:06.246
desire of revenge I once 
expressed; but I feel 

08:58:11.155 --> 08:58:13.155
myself justified in desiring the
death of my adversary.

08:58:16.863 --> 08:58:19.544
occupied in examining my past 
conduct; nor do I find it 

08:58:19.545 --> 08:58:21.545
blamable.

08:58:25.283 --> 08:58:27.526
created a rational creature and 
was bound towards him to assure,

08:58:27.527 --> 08:58:29.527
as far as 

08:58:31.585 --> 08:58:33.585
was in my power, his happiness 
and well-being.

08:58:42.224 --> 08:58:44.224
another still paramount to that.

08:58:49.192 --> 08:58:51.853
species had greater claims to my
attention because they included 

08:58:51.854 --> 08:58:53.854
a 

08:58:56.139 --> 08:58:58.139
greater proportion of happiness 
or misery.

08:59:01.903 --> 08:59:03.940
did right in refusing, to create
a companion for the first 

08:59:03.941 --> 08:59:05.941
creature.

08:59:09.267 --> 08:59:11.940
selfishness in evil; he 
destroyed my friends; he devoted

08:59:11.941 --> 08:59:16.616
to destruction beings who 
possessed exquisite sensations, 

08:59:16.617 --> 08:59:18.617
happiness, and wisdom; nor 

08:59:20.945 --> 08:59:22.945
do I know where this thirst for 
vengeance may end.

08:59:27.312 --> 08:59:29.312
other wretched, he ought to die.

08:59:37.356 --> 08:59:39.991
motives, I asked you to 
undertake my unfinished work, 

08:59:39.992 --> 08:59:45.288
and I renew this request now, 
when I am only induced by reason

08:59:45.289 --> 08:59:47.289
and virtue.

08:59:49.381 --> 08:59:51.381
country and friends to fulfil 
this task; 

08:59:54.804 --> 08:59:57.431
and now that you are returning 
to England, you will have little

08:59:57.432 --> 08:59:59.432
chance of meeting with him.

09:00:04.788 --> 09:00:06.788
and the well balancing of what 
you may 

09:00:09.389 --> 09:00:11.647
esteem your duties, I leave to 
you; my judgment and ideas are 

09:00:11.648 --> 09:00:14.359
already disturbed by the near 
approach of death.

09:00:20.131 --> 09:00:22.131
think right, for I may still be 
misled by passion.

09:00:26.489 --> 09:00:28.535
instrument of mischief disturbs 
me; in other respects, this 

09:00:28.536 --> 09:00:31.197
hour, when I momentarily expect 
my release, is the 

09:00:35.915 --> 09:00:37.915
only happy one which I have 
enjoyed for several years.

09:00:42.275 --> 09:00:44.275
before me, and I hasten to their
arms.

09:00:49.610 --> 09:00:51.610
avoid ambition, even if it 

09:00:58.119 --> 09:01:00.810
be only the apparently innocent 
one of distinguishing yourself 

09:01:00.811 --> 09:01:02.811
in science and discoveries.

09:01:09.435 --> 09:01:11.435
these hopes, yet another may 
succeed.

09:01:12.585 --> 09:01:15.231
His voice became fainter as he 
spoke, and at length, exhausted 

09:01:15.232 --> 09:01:17.296
by his effort, he sank into 
silence.

09:01:23.355 --> 09:01:25.118
attempted again to speak but was
unable; he pressed my hand 

09:01:25.119 --> 09:01:30.010
feebly, and his eyes closed for 
ever, while the irradiation of a

09:01:30.011 --> 09:01:32.694
gentle smile passed away from 
his lips.

09:01:37.998 --> 09:01:39.998
the untimely extinction of this 
glorious spirit?

09:01:45.385 --> 09:01:47.385
understand the depth of my 
sorrow?

09:01:48.858 --> 09:01:50.858
be inadequate and feeble.

09:01:54.833 --> 09:01:56.833
by a cloud of disappointment.

09:02:00.209 --> 09:02:02.209
may there find consolation.

09:02:09.619 --> 09:02:11.619
fairly, and the watch on deck 
scarcely stir.

09:02:14.961 --> 09:02:17.640
voice, but hoarser; it comes 
from the cabin where the remains

09:02:17.641 --> 09:02:20.094
of Frankenstein still lie.

09:02:36.019 --> 09:02:38.701
power to detail it; yet the tale
which I have recorded would be 

09:02:38.702 --> 09:02:41.330
incomplete without this final 
and wonderful catastrophe.

09:02:49.292 --> 09:02:51.292
remains of my ill-fated and 
admirable friend.

09:02:54.039 --> 09:02:56.711
find words to describe—gigantic 
in stature, yet uncouth and 

09:02:56.712 --> 09:02:59.391
distorted in its proportions.

09:03:05.698 --> 09:03:07.770
was concealed by long locks of 
ragged hair; but one vast hand 

09:03:07.771 --> 09:03:12.657
was extended, in colour and 
apparent texture like that of a 

09:03:12.658 --> 09:03:14.658
mummy.

09:03:17.812 --> 09:03:19.812
he ceased to utter exclamations 
of grief 

09:03:20.828 --> 09:03:22.828
and horror and sprung towards 
the window.

09:03:28.529 --> 09:03:30.557
as his face, of such loathsome 
yet appalling hideousness.

09:03:36.857 --> 09:03:38.857
endeavoured to recollect what 
were my 

09:03:39.864 --> 09:03:41.864
duties with regard to this 
destroyer.

09:03:47.555 --> 09:03:50.195
and again turning towards the 
lifeless form of his creator, he

09:03:50.196 --> 09:03:52.196
seemed to forget 

09:03:54.918 --> 09:03:57.566
my presence, and every feature 
and gesture seemed instigated by

09:03:57.567 --> 09:03:59.567
the wildest rage of some 
uncontrollable passion.

09:04:02.863 --> 09:04:04.863
” he exclaimed.

09:04:07.565 --> 09:04:10.222
consummated; the miserable 
series of my being is wound to 

09:04:10.223 --> 09:04:12.223
its close!

09:04:23.790 --> 09:04:25.790
destroying all thou lovedst.

09:04:29.802 --> 09:04:31.430
His voice seemed suffocated, and
my first impulses, which had 

09:04:31.431 --> 09:04:33.470
suggested to me the duty of 
obeying the dying request 

09:04:38.869 --> 09:04:41.328
of my friend in destroying his 
enemy, were now suspended by a 

09:04:41.329 --> 09:04:43.329
mixture of curiosity and 
compassion.

09:05:23.810 --> 09:05:25.384
dared not again raise my eyes to
his face, there was something so

09:05:25.385 --> 09:05:27.385
scaring and 

09:05:29.041 --> 09:05:31.041
unearthly in his ugliness.

09:05:33.174 --> 09:05:35.839
address him in a pause of the 
tempest of his passion.If you 

09:05:35.840 --> 09:05:39.906
had listened to the voice of 
conscience and heeded the stings

09:05:35.840 --> 09:05:37.840
of remorse before you had urged 
your 

09:05:40.494 --> 09:05:42.247
diabolical vengeance to this 
extremity, Frankenstein would 

09:05:42.248 --> 09:05:44.248
yet have lived.

09:05:46.521 --> 09:05:48.521
” said the daemon.

09:05:58.234 --> 09:06:00.234
corpse, “he suffered not in the 
consummation of the deed.

09:06:03.947 --> 09:06:05.584
anguish that was mine during the
lingering detail of its 

09:06:05.585 --> 09:06:07.585
execution.

09:06:11.933 --> 09:06:13.933
while my heart was poisoned with
remorse.

09:06:22.517 --> 09:06:25.026
susceptible of love and 
sympathy, and when wrenched by 

09:06:25.027 --> 09:06:27.730
misery to vice and hatred, it 
did not endure the violence 

09:06:33.088 --> 09:06:35.088
of the change without torture 
such as you cannot even imagine.

09:06:39.851 --> 09:06:41.851
to Switzerland, heart-broken and
overcome.

09:06:46.857 --> 09:06:48.857
to horror; I abhorred myself.

09:06:52.214 --> 09:06:54.682
author at once of my existence 
and of its unspeakable torments,

09:06:54.683 --> 09:06:56.683
dared to hope 

09:06:59.004 --> 09:07:01.493
for happiness, that while he 
accumulated wretchedness and 

09:07:01.494 --> 09:07:03.727
despair upon me he sought his 
own enjoyment in feelings and 

09:07:09.259 --> 09:07:11.131
passions from the indulgence of 
which I was for ever barred, 

09:07:11.132 --> 09:07:13.809
then impotent envy and bitter 
indignation filled me with an 

09:07:16.503 --> 09:07:18.503
insatiable thirst for vengeance.

09:07:23.221 --> 09:07:25.221
that it should be accomplished.

09:07:29.183 --> 09:07:31.706
a deadly torture, but I was the 
slave, not the master, of an 

09:07:31.707 --> 09:07:34.394
impulse which I detested yet 
could not disobey.

09:07:45.324 --> 09:07:47.324
anguish, to riot in the excess 
of my despair.

09:07:54.478 --> 09:07:57.122
adapt my nature to an element 
which I had willingly chosen.

09:08:02.452 --> 09:08:04.452
became an insatiable passion.

09:08:09.410 --> 09:08:12.099
I was at first touched by the 
expressions of his misery; yet, 

09:08:12.100 --> 09:08:14.100
when I called to mind what 
Frankenstein had 

09:08:17.812 --> 09:08:19.873
said of his powers of eloquence 
and persuasion, and when I again

09:08:19.874 --> 09:08:24.595
cast my eyes on the lifeless 
form of my friend, indignation 

09:08:24.596 --> 09:08:26.596
was rekindled within me.

09:08:32.626 --> 09:08:34.626
over the desolation that you 
have made.

09:08:39.031 --> 09:08:41.090
buildings, and when they are 
consumed, you sit among the 

09:08:41.091 --> 09:08:43.091
ruins and lament the fall.

09:08:49.085 --> 09:08:51.085
would he be the object, again 
would he 

09:08:53.823 --> 09:08:55.823
become the prey, of your 
accursed vengeance.

09:08:59.138 --> 09:09:00.565
lament only because the victim 
of your malignity is withdrawn 

09:09:00.566 --> 09:09:02.566
from your power.

09:09:05.484 --> 09:09:07.484
“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” 
interrupted the being.

09:09:12.323 --> 09:09:14.323
conveyed to you by what appears 
to be the purport of my actions.

09:09:15.170 --> 09:09:15.584
of virtue, the feelings of 
happiness and affection with 

09:09:15.585 --> 09:09:16.210
which my whole being overflowed,
that I wished to be 

09:09:16.211 --> 09:09:19.478
participated.shadow, and that 
happiness and affection are 

09:09:19.479 --> 09:09:22.328
turned into bitter and loathing 
despair, in what should I seek 

09:09:22.329 --> 09:09:24.329
for sympathy?

09:09:27.696 --> 09:09:29.696
sufferings shall endure; when I 
die, I 

09:09:32.992 --> 09:09:35.211
am well satisfied that 
abhorrence and opprobrium should

09:09:35.212 --> 09:09:37.212
load my memory.

09:09:40.752 --> 09:09:42.752
of virtue, of fame, and of 
enjoyment.

09:09:47.417 --> 09:09:49.280
beings who, pardoning my outward
form, would love me for the 

09:09:49.281 --> 09:09:51.335
excellent qualities which I was 
capable of unfolding.

09:10:07.350 --> 09:10:08.577
misery, can be found comparable 
to mine.of my sins, I cannot 

09:10:08.578 --> 09:10:09.878
believe that I am the same 
creature whose thoughts were 

09:10:09.879 --> 09:10:13.679
once filled with sublime and 
transcendent visions of the 

09:10:09.879 --> 09:10:11.879
beauty and the majesty of 
goodness.

09:10:21.194 --> 09:10:23.194
friends and associates in his 
desolation; I am alone.

09:10:28.983 --> 09:10:30.605
friend, seem to have a knowledge
of my crimes and his 

09:10:30.606 --> 09:10:32.606
misfortunes.

09:10:37.007 --> 09:10:39.672
them he could not sum up the 
hours and months of misery which

09:10:39.673 --> 09:10:41.707
I endured wasting in impotent 
passions.

09:10:47.619 --> 09:10:49.619
not satisfy my own desires.

09:10:53.361 --> 09:10:56.019
craving; still I desired love 
and fellowship, and I was still 

09:10:56.020 --> 09:10:58.020
spurned.

09:11:03.396 --> 09:11:05.396
when all humankind sinned 
against me?

09:11:10.327 --> 09:11:12.327
his friend from his door with 
contumely?

09:11:16.230 --> 09:11:18.230
sought to destroy the saviour of
his child?

09:11:21.323 --> 09:11:23.323
an abortion, to be spurned at, 
and kicked, and trampled on.

09:11:33.017 --> 09:11:35.479
helpless; I have strangled the 
innocent as they slept and 

09:11:35.480 --> 09:11:38.144
grasped to death his throat who 
never injured me or any other 

09:11:40.808 --> 09:11:42.808
living thing.

09:11:47.146 --> 09:11:49.788
specimen of all that is worthy 
of love and admiration among 

09:11:49.789 --> 09:11:51.789
men, to misery; I 

09:11:54.117 --> 09:11:56.117
have pursued him even to that 
irremediable ruin.

09:11:58.411 --> 09:12:00.411
equal that with which I regard 
myself.

09:12:05.194 --> 09:12:07.194
deed; I think on the heart in 
which the 

09:12:08.362 --> 09:12:10.030
imagination of it was conceived 
and long for the moment when 

09:12:10.031 --> 09:12:15.324
these hands will meet my eyes, 
when that imagination will haunt

09:12:15.325 --> 09:12:17.325
my thoughts no more.

09:12:28.523 --> 09:12:30.523
needed to consummate the series 
of my 

09:12:33.297 --> 09:12:37.563
being and accomplish that which 
must be done, but it requires my

09:12:33.297 --> 09:12:35.297
own.

09:12:44.838 --> 09:12:47.503
raft which brought me thither 
and shall seek the most northern

09:12:47.504 --> 09:12:49.129
extremity of the globe; I shall 
collect my funeral pile and 

09:12:49.130 --> 09:12:49.329
consume to ashes this miserable 
frame, that its remains may 

09:12:49.330 --> 09:12:50.151
afford no light to any curious 
and unhallowed wretch who would 

09:12:50.152 --> 09:12:52.152
create such another as I have 
been.

09:12:55.297 --> 09:12:57.556
which now consume me or be the 
prey of feelings unsatisfied, 

09:12:57.557 --> 09:12:59.557
yet unquenched.

09:13:04.320 --> 09:13:06.960
and when I shall be no more, the
very remembrance of us both will

09:13:06.961 --> 09:13:08.961
speedily vanish.

09:13:13.923 --> 09:13:15.923
or feel the winds play on my 
cheeks.

09:13:19.067 --> 09:13:21.067
away; and in this condition must
I find my happiness.

09:13:26.654 --> 09:13:28.698
this world affords first opened 
upon me, when I felt the 

09:13:28.699 --> 09:13:31.367
cheering warmth of summer and 
heard the rustling of the 

09:13:36.098 --> 09:13:38.139
leaves and the warbling of the 
birds, and these were all to me,

09:13:38.140 --> 09:13:40.773
I should have wept to die; now 
it is my only consolation.

09:13:47.130 --> 09:13:49.130
bitterest remorse, where can I 
find rest but in death?

09:13:54.131 --> 09:13:56.131
humankind whom these eyes will 
ever behold.

09:14:01.889 --> 09:14:04.142
cherished a desire of revenge 
against me, it would be better 

09:14:04.143 --> 09:14:06.831
satiated in my life than in my 
destruction.

09:14:12.604 --> 09:14:14.604
extinction, that I might not 
cause 

09:14:15.609 --> 09:14:16.911
greater wretchedness; and if 
yet, in some mode unknown to me,

09:14:16.912 --> 09:14:17.727
thou hadst not ceased to think 
and feel, thou wouldst not 

09:14:17.728 --> 09:14:19.728
desire against me a 

09:14:20.730 --> 09:14:22.730
vengeance greater than that 
which I feel.

09:14:25.115 --> 09:14:25.516
still superior to thine, for the
bitter sting of remorse will not

09:14:25.517 --> 09:14:27.561
cease to rankle in my wounds 
until death shall close them for

09:14:27.562 --> 09:14:29.562
ever.

09:14:38.294 --> 09:14:39.113
solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die,
and what I now feel be no longer

09:14:39.114 --> 09:14:41.114
felt.

09:14:48.279 --> 09:14:50.279
triumphantly and exult in the 
agony of the torturing flames.

09:14:54.628 --> 09:14:55.845
My spirit will sleep in peace, 
or if it thinks, it will not 

09:14:55.846 --> 09:14:57.846
surely think thus.

09:15:00.069 --> 09:15:02.069
”

09:15:04.418 --> 09:15:06.418
said this, upon the ice raft 
which lay close to the vessel.

09:15:10.155 --> 09:15:12.155
lost in darkness and distance.

09:15:23.237 --> 09:15:25.104
&gt;&gt; On behalf of the library of 
congress, I would like to thank 

09:15:25.105 --> 09:15:31.068
all of our wonderful readers 
today. You did a fantastic job. 

09:15:31.069 --> 09:15:32.504
Thank you to the Franken reads 
organization for bringing the 

09:15:32.505 --> 09:15:37.999
project to us. Thank you to the 
national endowment for the 

09:15:38.000 --> 09:15:40.365
humanities, and thank you to 
everyone around the world who 

09:15:40.366 --> 09:15:42.366
viewed us today. Good night.

09:15:52.059 --> 09:15:54.059
&gt;&gt; I would like to thank Neil, 

09:15:55.777 --> 09:15:59.654
president of the Keith Shelley 
association of America. Thank 

09:15:59.655 --> 09:16:01.655
you so much for your help. 
Appreciate it.
