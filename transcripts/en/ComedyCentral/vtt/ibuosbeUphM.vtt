&gt;&gt; LET'S ASSUME FOR A MOMENT
THAT YOU ARE A SOLDIER
IN BATTLE.

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:08.274 align:start size:97% position:3%
YOU'RE IN A DEFENSIVE POSITION
ENEMY FIGHTERS ALL AROUND.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.710
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY BAD.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start size:94% position:6%
IN YOUR FOXHOLE, YOU'VE GOT
TWO PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU
OUT:

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.449
THE RELIGIOUS GUY
AND THE ATHEIST.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:19.886 align:start position:0%
WHICH ONE ARE YOU GONNA COUNT ON
TO GET YOU OUT OF DANGER?

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.157 align:start size:91% position:9%
THE ATHEIST, WHO REALIZES
THERE'S NOBODY TO RELY ON
BUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR TEAM

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.994 align:start size:97% position:3%
OR THE CHURCH BOY WHO'S GONNA
PRAY TO HIS INVISIBLE FRIEND
TO GET YOU OUT OF DANGER

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.429
USING MAGIC?

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.498 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION
"GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP
THEMSELVES"?

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.169
IF YOU'RE HELPING YOURSELF
WHAT DO YOU NEED GOD FOR?

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.336
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S...

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.704
NOT EVEN THERE.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.239
GEE.

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:42.308
&gt;&gt; LET'S PRAY FOR HER.

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.111 align:start size:91% position:9%
I CAN SEE WHY SHE WOULD BE
MAD AT GOD.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.780
AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
PRO-CHRISTIAN COMEDY SHOWS ON
TV, I THINK IT'S

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:52.819
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
GOD CREATED ATHEISTS, WHICH
MEANS THEY DESERVE RESPECT.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:57.323 align:start size:91% position:9%
EVEN IF THEY DON'T REALIZE
FOXHOLES ARE ASSIGNED BY
COMPANY RANK AND DUTY

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.126
NOT BY A WISH LIST.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.664
THAT GIRL WHO LIVES IN OUTER
SPACE IS KATE, AND ARMED WITH
ONLY A BRITNEY SPEARS MIC

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:08.267
SHE'S WAGING AN UNHOLY WAR
AGAINST FAITH ON YOUTUBE.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.306
NO ONE IS MORE PROUD OF WHAT
THEY BELIEVE IN THAN PEOPLE
WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.707
I CAN SEE THE APPEAL.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.511 align:start position:0%
WHO WOULDN'T WANT THEIR SUNDAYS
TOTALLY FREE FOR
FOOTBALL AND MIMOSAS?

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:22.248 align:start size:97% position:3%
BUT IF GOD ISN'T REAL, HOW DO
ELEVATORS AND WI-FI WORK?

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.617 align:start position:0%
IT'S STRAIGHT UP MIRACLES AND WE
BOTH KNOW IT.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920 align:start size:97% position:3%
BEING AN ATHEIST IS JUST DIET
SATANISM.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:32.592 align:start size:88% position:13%
I CAN'T EXPLAIN SUDOKUS
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THERE IS NO MATH.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:37.130
IF THERE'S NO GOD THEN WHO
DECIDES WHO GETS CANCER?

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:40.066 align:start size:97% position:3%
I BELIEVE IN THE MAN UPSTAIRS
THE SAME WAY I BELIEVE
THE HEAT COULD WIN A

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.968
CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.769
WHAT DOES IT HURT TO PRETEND?

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:48.007 align:start position:0%
THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU BELIEVE AS LONG AS
I NEVER HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.209 align:start size:88% position:13%
OR GET MY HEAD SAWED OFF
BECAUSE OF IT.

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.911
THE LORD STILL LOVES KATE.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.380
HECK, HE MAY LOVE HER MORE
BECAUSE THAT LITTLE [BLEEP]TEASE
IS PLAYING HARD

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:55.815
TO GET.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.216
DRIVES HIM CRAZY.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.152
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT HER TO
HOLLYWOOD, WHERE EVERYONE IS

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:07.493
DAMNED TO HELL, FOR THIS WEEK'S
CEWEBRITY PROFILE.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:08.528
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MATTHEW, HUH?

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.596
NOT SO DEPRESSING NOW, IS IT?

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.064
GOT SOME SUCCULENTS.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.699
PEOPLE OVERWATER SUCCULENTS.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.434
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.869
YOU'RE SO QUIET.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.704
DO YOU WANT A HEATER?

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.907
HERE YOU GO, MATT.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.242
GET YOU A NICE SMOKE.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:26.145 align:start size:91% position:9%
CAREFUL, THOSE THINGS WILL
KILL YOU.

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.247
AH, THE BABADOOK IS BACK!

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.415 align:start size:78% position:22%
CURSE YOU, MATTHEW
FOR READING THAT BOOK.

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:30.616
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.851
I'M NOT THE BABADOOK.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:32.785
I'M AN ATHEIST.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.687 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND EVERY FOXHOLE COULD USE
AN ATHEIST.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.621
WHO'S THE DEAD GUY?

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:36.622
&gt;&gt; SHH.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.257
THAT'S MATTHEW.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.563 align:start position:0%
HE'S A GOOD GAY CHRISTIAN FELLOW
LIKE MYSELF, AND I'M NOT READY
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:48.601
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE MEET BACK UP
IN THE AFTERLIFE, HE HAS A
SHINY NEW BUTTHOLE, BECAUSE
THERE'S

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.836
NOT A LOT OF TREAD LEFT ON HIS
EARTHLY ONE.

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.171
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.673
&gt;&gt; I REALLY DON'T.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.607
UNLESS YOU MEAN GEORGE LUCAS.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.509
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT MEAN GEORGE LUCAS.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:03:00.379
IF GOD DIDN'T WRITE THE BIBLE
THEN WHO DID, J.K. ROWLING?

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:03.950
&gt;&gt; LOTS OF PEOPLE WROTE IT
OVER MANY HUNDREDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:07.386 align:start size:97% position:3%
I MEAN, IF YOU NOTICE, IT HAD
LOTS AND LOTS OF AUTHORS
MANY OF WHOM CONTRADICT

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.654
EACH OTHER.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:11.724
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOT ONE
CONTRADICTION IN THE 
ENTIRE BIBLE.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:15.027 align:start size:91% position:9%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S WHOLE WEBSITES
DESCRIBING THE CONTRADICTIONS
IN THE BIBLE.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.662 align:start size:84% position:16%
&gt;&gt; THOSE WEBSITES ARE
CONTRADICTIONS.

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:21.500
IF THERE'S NO GOD THEN HOW DID
NOAH KNOW TO BUILD AN ARK?

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.503 align:start size:97% position:3%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ASSUMING, OF COURSE
THAT NOAH'S NOT JUST A FAIRY
TALE.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:25.538
OH.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.373 align:start size:97% position:3%
GOSH, I THOUGHT I TURNED THAT
OFF.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:30.209
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WEIRD THAT GOD JUST
INTERJECTED RIGHT AT THE 
PERFECT TIME.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:31.844
THANKS, BIG GUY.

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:32.945
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO CHURCH?

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.346
&gt;&gt; I HAVE.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.384
THERE WAS A UNITARIAN CHURCH
THAT I TRIED FOR, LIKE, 
ONCE OR TWICE.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.119 align:start size:97% position:3%
&gt;&gt; YOU WEREN'T FORCED TO GO TO
CHURCH AS A CHILD?

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.454
&gt;&gt; OH, GOODNESS, NO.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.322 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF PARENTS DID YOU
HAVE?

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:44.557
&gt;&gt; OH, I WAS RAISED BY HIPPIES.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.125
&gt;&gt; HIPPIES DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD?

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:48.461
&gt;&gt; OH, I DIDN'T SAY THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IN GOD; THEY JUST NEVER
MADE ME GO TO

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.528
CHURCH.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:51.864 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; SING ME A FEW OF THE GOOD
ATHEIST HYMNS.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:56.002
&gt;&gt; I'M SURE THEY EXIST
BUT I DON'T KNOW THEM.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD
CHRISTIAN HYMNS?

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.674 align:start size:63% position:38%
&gt;&gt; UH--
&gt;&gt; ♪ I'VE GOT THE J♪
♪ JOY, JOY DOWN IN ♪

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.110 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SEE, THAT REMINDS--
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU SAY "WHERE."

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.611
YOU HAVE TO SAY "WHERE."

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:09.315 align:start size:91% position:9%
♪ I'VE GOT THE JOY, JOY ♪

HOW YOU HOLDING UP BACK THERE
MATT?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.529 align:start size:97% position:3%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE LOOKS A LITTLE
WORSE FOR WEAR.

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:24.297
&gt;&gt; HE'S FINE.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.798
&gt;&gt; WHO'S THAT IN THE PHOTO?

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:31.604 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT IS MY SAINT OF A MOTHER
WHO HAPPENS TO BE COVERING UP
MY GLORY HOLE.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.906 align:start size:91% position:9%
WOULD IT CHANGE YOUR MIND
IF GOD WERE A LADY?

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.574
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY, NO.

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.576 align:start size:91% position:9%
WHAT WOULD CHANGE MY MIND
IS IF GOD SHOWED UP.

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.011
PUT IN A PERSONAL APPEARANCE.

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.414
&gt;&gt; BY THAT POINT IT'LL BE TOO
LATE, MISSY.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.049
&gt;&gt; TOO LATE FOR WHAT?

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.750
&gt;&gt; TO JUMP ABOARD THE GOD TRAIN.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:46.452
&gt;&gt; THAT'S FINE.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:49.989 align:start position:0%
IF GOD WAS REAL, I'D BE LOOKING
FOR SOME MAGIC RING OR FLAMING
SWORD SO I COULD KILL HIM.

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:52.291
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:56.595 align:start position:0%
IF YOU WERE GONNA GO CHRISTIANS
JEWS, MUSLIM--
WHICH ONE ANNOYS YOU THE MOST?

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:59.532
&gt;&gt; IT'S KIND OF A TIE BETWEEN
THE CHRISTIANS AND THE MUSLIMS.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.702 align:start position:0%
THE JEWS TEND TO MIND THEIR OWN
BUSINESS, AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
IN A RELIGION.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:08.341 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DO APPRECIATE THE
JEWS MINDING THEIR OWN G-D
BUSINESS.

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.842
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BILL MAHER?

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.377
&gt;&gt; I DO FIND HIM AMUSING.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.014 align:start size:91% position:9%
SOMETIMES HE GOES TOO FAR
ON SOME SUBJECTS
BUT FOR THE MOST PART

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:15.948
I THINK I RESPECT HIM.

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.783
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT RICKY GERVAIS?

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:18.217
&gt;&gt; OH, HE'S AWESOME.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.485
&gt;&gt; YOU LIKE HIM?

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.755
&gt;&gt; LET'S FACE IT; THERE'S VERY
FEW UNFUNNY BRITISH COMEDIANS.

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:24.924
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.059 align:start size:88% position:13%
HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH
"BIONICDANCE"?

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:30.763
&gt;&gt;WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY A
REFERENCE TO A CARTOON SHOW
THAT I LOVED WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:31.864 align:start size:91% position:9%
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE
CARTOON SHOW?

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.399
&gt;&gt; BIONIC SIX, IT'S CALLED.

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:34.633
&gt;&gt; BIONIC SIX.

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:37.103
I DON'T KNOW IF I REMEMBER THAT.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.504 align:start size:94% position:6%
DO YOU GET INTO THAT WEIRD--
&gt;&gt; ANIME.

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.439 align:start size:91% position:9%
&gt;&gt; ANIME--DO YOU ENJOY THE
ANIME?

00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:44.510
&gt;&gt; I ENJOYED IT A LOT MORE
MANY YEARS AGO BUT IT'S NOT AS
MUCH OF A THING

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.445
FOR ME AS IT USED TO BE.

00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:47.747 align:start size:97% position:3%
&gt;&gt; WAS IT, LIKE, EVER A SEXUAL
THING WITH YOU?

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.048
&gt;&gt; OH, GOODNESS, NO.

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.550 align:start size:97% position:3%
&gt;&gt; IS IT ILLEGAL TO MASTURBATE
TO CARTOONS?

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:55.254
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS IT ILLEGAL TO
MASTURBATE, AT LEAST IN THE
UNITED STATES, AT ALL?

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:56.856 align:start size:91% position:9%
&gt;&gt; SO, IN PRIVATE, YOU CAN
MASTURBATE TO CHILDREN?

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.624
&gt;&gt; IT'S PROBABLY FROWNED UPON.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:00.726
&gt;&gt; IT'S DEFINITELY FROWNED UPON.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.830
&gt;&gt;I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT IF
THE KIDS ARE NAKED OR DOING
ANYTHING SEXUAL, IT'S ILLEGAL...

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:08.801
&gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT'S GOING LIKE THIS?

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:10.770 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SOME KID'S
STUDENT PHOTO, I DON'T KNOW
I MEAN, THAT'S WEIRD.

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:13.105
&gt;&gt; IT'S TOTALLY WEIRD BUT IF YOU
JUST HAVE A PHOTO OF A KID, YOU
CAN MASTURBATE TO

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:14.106
IT, I THINK.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.808
IN THIS COUNTR-- THAT'S WHAT I'M
FIGHTING FOR.

00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:17.643
I GOT THESE.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:18.277
TWO TABLETS.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.311
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.314
&gt;&gt; AND I CREATED THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS FOR ATHEISTS.

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:22.948
&gt;&gt; OH, DEAR.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:24.349
&gt;&gt; ONLY CAME UP WITH NINE.

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:26.852 align:start size:97% position:3%
I FELT THE ATHEIST DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THE SAME AS THE
CHRISTIANS.

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.789 align:start size:97% position:3%
&gt;&gt; "THOU SHALT NOT BE SO SMUG
ALL THE TIME."

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.424 align:start position:0%
YOU WANT TO TAKE THE FUN OUT OF
EVERYTHING.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOPE, THAT'S COMMANDMENT ONE
FOR ATHEISTS.

'BLESS YOU' AFTER A SNEEZE

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.766 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE I COULD FIND
A WAY TO SAY THAT
THAT'S NOT RELIGIOUS.

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:42.835
&gt;&gt; JUST SAY "BLESS YOU"!

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:57.950
&gt;&gt; RIGHT?

00:06:57.983 --> 00:06:58.751

DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT
THE ATHEIST, THE CHRISTIAN

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.933
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:15.734

I THINK WE'RE SPERM INSIDE A
