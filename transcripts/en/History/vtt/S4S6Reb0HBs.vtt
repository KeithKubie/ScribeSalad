00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.253
- Oh, dude, that's an

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:04.754
We're stopping here, bro.
- All right.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.925
Look at that body style.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.928
Really guessing it's a 69.
Hello?

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:12.721
Yes?

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.763
How are you, sir?

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.014
- I'm good.
- Good, good.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.391
My name is Danny.
- Ronald.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.642
It is a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.352
- OK, same here.
- You have great taste.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.439
And that Grand Prix over there
got my undivided attention.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.815
All right.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.400
And I was wondering
if I could chat with you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.193
for a moment about that car.
- You sure can.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.153
Is it a '69?

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.028
No, '71.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.071
Darn it, man.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.198
I was-- I was off, man.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.119
Debuting in 1962, the Grand
Prix was Pontiac's luxury

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.371
performance car, and
like many other Pontiacs,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.832
its history lies
mostly in motor sports.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.709
Not only in its
name, the Grand Prix

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.503
was a favorite among
professional NASCAR drivers.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:47.380
But that almost wasn't the case.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.676
After a terrible accident during
a Le Mans race in 1955, General

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.386
Motors-- who owned Pontiac--

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:56.639
agreed to an industry-wide
ban on auto racing.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.184
But knowing that racing
was the key to success,

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.186
Pontiac fought to
keep its presence.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.354
The Grand Prix, along
with other Pontiac cars,

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:08.109
went on to become a leading
player in the racing world.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.694
What's the story on
this car, Ronald?

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.868
Are you the original owner?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:18.495
Oh, that is a rarity.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.172
What's under the hood, sir?

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.173
It's the 400?

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.467
Very nice.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.886
It's bone stock.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:35.887
Ronald, this is a cool ride.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.767
Is this a car that
you would sell?

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.855
It is?

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.817
So Mike and I were on a hunt for
a flip to just kind of butter

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.610
up Kevin a little bit,
in case he freaks out

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.237
over the CHIPS bike for Steve.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.364
So we found this way
cool looking Grand Prix.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.615
I just don't know
if this guy is going

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.158
to want too much money for it.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.159
What would you want for this?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.456
It's all original.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.791
I don't-- I don't even know--

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.834
I don't even know
what this car's worth.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:09.128
You don't see them.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:09.963
What did they offer you?

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:16.553
What'd you tell him?
OK.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.679
And he never showed up.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.726
Yes, sir.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.895
You have loved this
car for a long time,

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.730
and the last thing
you want is somebody

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.399
who's going to treat it wrong.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.025
And that's not us.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.027
A car like this, we would
treat with so much respect.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.196
I won't even let Mike touch it.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.574
Ronald, you are
a gentlemen, sir.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.367
Thank you.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.744
You know, seven grand is
not that bad of a price

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:43.371
for a '71 Grand Prix.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.039
It's not in that
good of a shape,

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.541
and I don't know how
hard the parts are

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.792
going to be to find for this.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.210
So I'm going to do
a little research.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.045
And if it turns out like
it could be a winner,

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.922
I know where it's at.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:56.050
Now, that right there,
my man, that right there?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.260
That might be us.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.136
I think it is, man.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.137
