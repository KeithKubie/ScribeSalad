00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.690
Deirdre is working with a
function that contains the

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.060
following points.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.350
These are the x values,
these are y values.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.460
They ask us, is this function
linear or non-linear?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.379
So linear functions, the way to
tell them is for any given

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.610
change in x, is the change
in y always going

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.760
to be the same value.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.180
For example, for any one-step
change in x, is the change in

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.460
y always going to be 3?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.940
Is it always going to be 5?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.450
If it's always going to be the
same value, you're dealing

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.670
with a linear function.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.570
If for each change in x--so over
here x is always changing

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.380
by 1, so since x is always
changing by 1, the change in

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.800
y's have to always
be the same.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.920
If they're not, then
we're dealing with

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200
a non-linear function.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.280
We can actually show
that plotting out.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150
If the changes in x-- we're
going by different values, if

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.190
this went from 1 to 2 and then
2 to 4-- what you'd want to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.310
do, then, is divide the change
in y by the change in x, and

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.030
that should always
be a constant.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.280
In fact, let me write
that down.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.660
If something is linear, then
the change in y over the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.240
change in x always constant.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.960
Now, in this example,
the change in x's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.480
are always 1, right?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.890
We go from 1 to 2, 2 to
3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.060
So in this example, the change
in x is always going to be 1.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.030
So in order for this function to
be linear, our change in y

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.180
needs to be constant because
we're just going to take that

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.310
and divide it by 1.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.910
So let's see if our change
in y is constant.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.480
When we go from 11 to
14, we go up by 3.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.500
When we go from 14 to 19, we go
up by 5, so I already see

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.980
that it is not constant.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.190
We didn't go up by 3 this
time, we went up by 5.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.100
And here, we go up by 7.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.230
And here, we're going up by 9.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.780
So we're actually going up by
increasing amounts, so we're

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.380
definitely dealing with
a non-linear function.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.780
And we can see that if
we graph it out.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.390
So let me draw-- I'll do
a rough graph here.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.410
So let me make that my vertical
axis, my y-axis.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.510
And we go all the
way up to 35.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.040
So I'll just do 10, 20, 30.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.470
Actually, I can it do a little
bit more granularly than that.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:44.650
I could do 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, and then 35.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.690
And then our values
go 1 through 5.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.970
I'll do it on this
axis right here.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.010
They're not obviously the exact
same scale, so I'll do

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.030
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.610
So let's plot these points.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.800
So the first point is 1, 11,
when x is 1, y is 11.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.760
This is our x-axis.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600
When x is 1, y is 11, that's
right about there.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.160
When x is 2, y is 14, that's
right about there.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.570
When x is 3, y is 19,
right about there.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:32.200
When x is 4, y is 26,
right about there.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.080
And then finally, when x is 5,
y is 35, right up there.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.810
So you can immediately
see that this is not

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.480
tracing out a line.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.110
If this was a linear function,
then all the points would be

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.250
on a line that looks something
like that.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.530
That's why it's called
a linear function.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.150
In this case, it's not,
it's non-linear.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.320
The rate of increase as
x changes is going up.
