00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.200
Is Math Art?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.970
Of course it is!

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.330
Why would you even... that's a dumb question.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.520
Hey guys, Tara Long here for Dnews today - to
talk about one of my favorite subjects, math.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.140
Which as it turns out - is as valid a form
of art, as any other.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.240
who knew?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.449
Now it's difficult to put into words, exactly
what it is that makes numbers and symbols

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.960
so appealing - but according to scientists,
it boils down to simple brain chemistry.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.280
In a recent study at University College in
London, researchers showed a group of mathematicians

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.280
60 different mathematical equations, and asked
them to rate those equations on a scale of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.379
"ugly to "beautiful," while inside an fMRI
scanner.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.239
The results showed that the more "beautiful"
an equation was - according to the test subject

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.100
- the more likely it was to elicit activity
in the A1 field of the medial orbitofrontal

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.109
cortex.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.940
This is the part of your brain that's typically
associated with emotional responses to visual

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.360
and musical beauty.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.370
Meaning people like us respond to numbers
and equations, the same way other people do

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.100
to music or art.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
But even people with no musical talent can
still appreciate good music - so what constitutes

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.150
beauty in math?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.680
And does the appreciation of it require some
understanding of its meaning?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.770
Well, not necessarily.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.920
To test that idea, researchers performed the
same study on a control group - with no special

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.660
appreciation of math.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.210
And while those subjects did show a significantly
lower emotional response to the equations

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.200
- a handful of them were still capable of
finding their beauty - even with no understanding

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.320
of what they actually mean.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.149
So what makes an equation "objectively beautiful"?

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.770
Is it just a formula of curves and shapes,
maybe symmetry that makes it pleasing to the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.770
eye?

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.689
It's difficult to quantify the exact reasons,
but there is one equation consistently rated

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.869
to be the most attractive - and that's Euler's
identity (1+eiπ=0) - perhaps because it contains

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.180
the 3 most fundamental numbers in the mathematical
universe, e, pi, and i.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.640
It's a pretty hot equation, I'm not gonna
lie.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.720
What's the ugliest, you ask?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.060
According to the mathematicians in this study,
it's this - Srinivasa Ramanujan's rapidly

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.810
converging infinite series of π.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.760
But hey - there's a lot about math I don't
know.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.770
I'm not a wizard.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.950
If there's an equation out there you don't
think gets enough recognition - then leave

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.000
it in the comments below.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Or tweet at me.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.250
And I can judge it, based on its looks.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.540
Like a nerdy hot or not.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.410
Or Tinder for geeks.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.610
And hey - if you've got more time to kill,
why not go check out some of the other shows

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.970
I do, like Rev3Games - or Hard Science, the
#1 destination for videos of Anthony Carboni

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.670
injuring himself.
