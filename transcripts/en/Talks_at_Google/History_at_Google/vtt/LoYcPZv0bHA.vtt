[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.070
VANESSA: Welcome
to Google Talks,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.340
and today we have
the great honor

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.080
of having some of the world's
greatest medievalists here

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.950
at Google.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.370
So I'd like to welcome
Simon Keynes, Claire Breay,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.130
and Jo Story who are going to
be talking about the exhibition

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.610
at the British Library that's
still on called Anglo-Saxon

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.120
Kingdoms--

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.373
Art, Word, and War.

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:31.290
And just a show of hands,
how many people have

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.650
been to see the exhibition?

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.150
Good.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.650
OK, well I'll turn
it over to Claire

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.812
from the British Library.

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:41.255
Claire, thanks.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.690
CLAIRE BREAY: Thank
you very much, Vanessa.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, the Anglo-Saxon
Kingdoms Exhibition

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.970
at the British Library
is the largest exhibition

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.580
that there's ever been,
covering the whole period

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.220
of the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms, from the departure

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.200
of the Romans right
up to the Norman

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.320
conquest of 1066 and beyond.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.350
And it looks at the
history and the literature

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.770
and the art of the
Anglo-Saxon kingdoms,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.430
examining the original
evidence that survives

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.930
and bringing together some
of the greatest treasures.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.200
The impetus for the exhibition
was the acquisition in 2012

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.660
of this little manuscript,
the "St. Cuthbert Gospel,"

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.600
in my hand there.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.010
And that little book
weighs only 162 grams,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.110
but it cost us 9 million pounds.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.900
And so we had-- it's the
earliest intact European book.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.750
And before its
acquisition, it was

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.060
the most important
English medieval

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.310
manuscript that was still
in private hands, I think.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.270
And we wanted to sort
of mark that acquisition

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.430
by doing something
really on a large scale

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.020
about the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.370
The exhibition has
180 objects in it.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.530
80 of those come
from the library's

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.000
own outstanding collection
of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.910
You can see one of the most
famous here, the "Lindisfarne

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.150
Gospels," made around 700.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.180
And so 80 of the objects
come from the library's

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.940
own collection.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.240
And 100 are loans.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.690
The exhibition, I think, has
been popular for many reasons.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.120
But I think one of the
sources of its success

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.350
is that it looks at the
beginnings and the foundation

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.370
of so many things.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.135
It includes this manuscript,
which isn't actually

00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:48.260
an Anglo-Saxon manuscript,
dates from the beginning

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.520
of the 12th century.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.460
And it's called the
"Textus Roffensis,"

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.330
"Book of Rochester."

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.100
And it is the
earliest manuscript

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.640
that we have of English law.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.660
So it contains the
laws of King Ethelberht

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.140
of Kent compiled around 600.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.390
But it's also really
important because it's

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.660
the earliest
extended text that we

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.300
have that is written
in the English language

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.235
and the beginnings of
the English language

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:18.110
and English literature,
a theme running right

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.040
through the exhibition.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.500
We also have in the exhibition
the first original charter

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.860
that survives on the
sheet it was written on,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.510
on the left here, the
charter of [INAUDIBLE],, which

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.710
dates from 679, granting
land in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.470
And that is next to here
and in the exhibition

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.130
next to the Letter
of World [? Hera, ?]

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.450
which is the earliest
original letter that survives

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.670
from Anglo-Saxon England.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.030
And this letter is
written in Latin.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.130
So we have earlier
letters, but this one

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.630
survives on the original
piece of parchment

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.240
it was first written on.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.540
And also in the exhibition,
we have this document,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.130
in which the scribe didn't waste
any of the parchment at all.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.470
This is the Fonthill Letter.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.270
And its claim to
fame is that it is

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.150
the earliest letter
that survives written

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.500
in the English language.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.260
It's a letter to Edward
the Elder telling

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.715
a tale of crime and punishment
about a disputed piece of land.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.880
There are many very beautiful
manuscripts in the exhibition.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.070
And this manuscript contains
this very famous image

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.490
of King Athelstan.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.230
And it is the first
portrait that we

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.810
have of an English
king in a manuscript.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.370
There are portraits
of kings on old coins,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.490
but this is the first
one in a manuscript.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.760
And here, King
Athelstan is presenting

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.450
a copy of [? Thebes ?]
lives of Saint Cuthbert,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.270
the famous Northumbrian
Anglo-Saxon saint.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.580
And he's presenting
this manuscript

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.330
to the community
of St. Cuthbert.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.250
So as I said, the
exhibition has at its heart

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.960
80 manuscripts from the
library's own collections.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.740
But we also have
these 100 manuscripts

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.600
and archaeological
objects on loan.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.010
And we borrowed those
from 25 lenders.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.080
And some of those
manuscripts have never

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.700
been seen in Britain before,
including this fantastic gospel

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.670
book, the [INAUDIBLE]
Gospels on loan from Paris

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.335
with this wonderful Lion of St.
Mark leaping across the page.

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.990
This was made around 700.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.710
We have codex [INAUDIBLE],,
it's a giant Bible

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.050
made at the beginning
of the eighth century

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.500
and taken from
Northumbria to Italy.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.540
It is one of the
greatest treasures

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.310
of Anglo-Saxon England.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.370
And it has never
been back to England

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.070
in 1300 years, until the day it
was delivered for installation

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.950
in the exhibition.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.190
We have this manuscript, not
an Anglo-Saxon manuscript.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.180
This is the "Utrecht Psalter,"
"Book of the Psalms,"

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.260
made in the first half of the
9th century on the continent

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.470
and brought to
Canterbury, where it

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.720
was used as a model
for other manuscripts,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.440
and it has these fantastic
cartoon-like strips,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.810
decoration, illustration of
what is going on in the Psalms.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.460
This manuscript was in the
collection of Sir Robert

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.650
Cotton, but he
lent it to a friend

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.880
and it made its way
to the continent.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.950
And it's never been on
exhibition in Britain before,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.550
and neither has this manuscript,
the [? Bocelli ?] book.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.070
This is one of the four
principal manuscripts

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.970
of Old English poetry.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.260
And we are displaying it
open at the poem known

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.580
as the Dream of the Rood.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.160
So it's the dream
of the cross telling

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.180
the story of the crucifixion
from the cross' point of view.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.110
And it's been in Italy for
nearly 1,000 years, at least.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.860
And the loan of
that manuscript has

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.970
enabled us to display together
for the very first time

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.560
the four principal manuscripts
of Old English poetry, which

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.850
together contains 75% of
all the old English poetry

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.215
that survives.

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:25.740
And it's there, second on the
left, next to, on the left,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.600
the unique manuscript
of "Beowulf"

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.978
from our own collections.

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:31.520
And if you've been
to the exhibition,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.790
you will have seen that there
is a replica of the Ruthwell

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.720
Cross in the exhibition in
this language and literature

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.770
section.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.500
And the Ruthwell
Cross, on its sides,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.510
has inscriptions
in runes, which are

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.610
extracts from that poem,
The Dream of the Rood,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.070
so you see it--

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:58.220
you see poetry on the parchment
pages but also on the stone.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.740
And right at the end
of the exhibition,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.760
we have "Domesday "Book,
the most famous book,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.740
I think, in English history.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.080
And of course, this isn't an
Anglo-Saxon manuscript either.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.550
It was written up in 1086,
and it's on loan to us

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.960
from the National Archives.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:24.770
And it's famous as a product of
Norman control and efficiency,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.580
but actually, "Domesday
Book" tells us so much

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.980
that we can't see from any
other source about the landscape

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.870
and the organization and the
wealth of late Anglo-Saxon

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.710
England.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.549
So it's absolutely
fantastic, unique evidence

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.290
for that period.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.790
So I'm going to hand over
now, after that very brief

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.910
introduction, to Jo and Simon,
who are going to take us

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.930
through the centuries.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.540
They're going to alternate,
looking at a manuscript

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.490
and then a charter
in turn to take us

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.360
into more depth about a few
of the highlight exhibits.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.472
Thanks.

00:09:07.472 --> 00:09:08.180
JOANNA STORY: OK.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.990
Thanks, Claire.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.950
Simon, you come here.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.460
Right.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.127
So I'm going to talk
about a manuscript,

00:09:12.127 --> 00:09:13.880
Simon's going to
talk about a charter,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.422
and the idea is that were going
to move through the centuries

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:17.690
seamlessly, all right?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.720
And we've got about 3
and 1/2 minutes per item,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.220
so if you see me
giving him a nudge,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.190
it'll be because he's running
out of time and vise versa.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.690
OK.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.460
For those of you
interested in big data,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.170
"Domesday Book" is big data
for Anglo-Saxon England.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.700
Seriously, it's extraordinary.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.200
OK.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.712
Right.

00:09:37.712 --> 00:09:38.920
It has started with your one.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.420
Right.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.348
You're going to start with--

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:42.890
SIMON KEYNES: It
seems that I'm going

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.230
to start with the Hlothhere
Charter, which you've just

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.950
seen.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.250
This is the earliest
surviving original

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.650
of an Anglo-Saxon charter.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.340
There are about 1,000 of them
that survived from the period

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.340
670 to 1066.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.580
Of that 1,000, about 100
survive in their original form,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.690
and this is the
earliest of them.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.780
And it's dated 679.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.380
It's a Charter of Hlothhere,
who was King of Kent.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.910
It's granting land in Kent
to the Church of Reculver,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.250
and it was--

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.630
it's dated 679.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.330
It's dated by a system
called the indiction,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.600
so it's not actually yet
the AD system of dating,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.620
anno [? Dominicae, ?] which
we're so familiar with.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.780
But we can work out
that this was 679.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.950
We can also see
that it was drawn up

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.480
at the time of a meeting,
and it was produced and used

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.130
at the meeting.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:51.080
And it's got the attestations
of the king here,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.680
the signum manus
of Hlothhere King,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.770
and then the attestations,
the signatures

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:03.100
of all of his leading men, and
they all have their crosses.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.650
And this is the beginning.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.510
You'll see four or five
more of these things,

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.440
but this is where it all starts.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.700
Unsealed script, very
posh kind of script,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.410
like the "Codex Amiatinus,"
so a fine thing.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.410
JOANNA STORY: Oh, right.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.750
We seem to have missed
one of our slides.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.590
Never mind.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.140
OK, right.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.567
Coming on to "Codex
Amiatinus," this

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:24.400
is the book that has
been prefigured in what

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.455
Claire was saying to you.

00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:27.580
This is-- for those who
have been to the exhibition

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.760
will confirm-- this
is a gigantic book.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.870
It's at least this big.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.600
It takes three or four
people to carry it.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.920
It is an extraordinary book
for many reasons, one of which

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.750
is its size.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.660
It contains well over
1,000 pages, 1,030 pages,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:51.940
so it contains the skins
of at least 500 animals,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.070
possibly more than that.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.130
These sorts of books can
tell us an enormous amount

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.980
about the animal
husbandry, the landscape,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.010
the way in which
monasteries worked in order

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.750
to produce the natural
resources that you

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.770
need for production of books
on a grand scale of this sort.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.500
The book is also important
because it's the earliest

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.140
complete Latin Bible.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.050
It contains the translation
done by Saint Jerome

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.460
in the late fourth
century, but it's

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.810
the best translation of this.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.460
So it is the version of the
Bible that, then, provides

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.620
the sort of [? stemmer, ?] if
you like, for understanding

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:35.110
the transmission
of the Latin Bible

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.200
through Europe through
the Middle Ages.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.800
It is important because this
book was made in England,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.260
in Northumbria, at
the monastery where

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.050
the Venerable Bede was based.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.970
It is, if you like, a
pastiche of an Italian book

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.550
of the sixth century,
and what it represents

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.940
is the ability of the
Northumbrian scribes

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.280
in the early eighth
century to produce

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.400
a book that was, to all
intents and purposes,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.620
a perfect Italian book.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.100
And it demonstrated
how well the English

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.760
had absorbed the lessons
of the missionaries who

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.030
had brought Christianity
to Anglo-Saxon England

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.540
from Rome round about 600.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.420
Even more amazing, it was one
of three books of this type that

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.250
was made at Wearmouth-Jarrow.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.660
And one was intended for Jarrow,
one for Wearmouth, and one--

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.700
this one-- to go to the pope.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.930
And we know that it
was sent to the pope.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.030
We've got an account written
at the time of the abbot

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.990
leaving Wearmouth-Jarrow
with this book

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.110
and taking it to Rome.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.360
He didn't make it all the way.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.800
He died in Burgundy
and was buried there.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.410
But his men took--

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.510
the monks of Jarrow took
the book on to Rome,

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.180
where it was received
by Pope Gregory II,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.550
and there it has stayed.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.620
As Claire said, it has not
been back to England since it

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.930
left in 716.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.210
When it came back to
the British Library

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.030
for the start of
this exhibition,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.950
there were more than a
few tears in the room,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.507
because this is a monument of
European, of world culture.

00:14:12.507 --> 00:14:14.590
And to bring it back to
Britain for the first time

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.490
was very important.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.160
What you can probably
see if you look

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.310
at the screen is what you've
got on the left-hand side

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.210
is the dedication page.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.350
Now, we have the dedication
in its original form

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.680
in this account from Northumbria
in the early eighth century,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.440
but you can probably see
how it's been altered.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.510
Can you see it's
written in black ink,

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.910
and then someone's come
in and written in brown?

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.200
That was somebody in Italy
appropriating this book

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.910
for the Italian monastery.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.800
And so all the way
through the Middle Ages,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.110
it was believed that this
was an Italian sixth century

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.260
book until somebody
spotted the correlation

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.160
between the dedication
inscription in the manuscript

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.750
and in this text, whereby it
was sort of re-realized that it

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.410
was, in fact, a book
made in Northumbria

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.490
in the early eighth
century at the monastery

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.047
of Wearmouth-Jarrow when the
Venerable Bede was alive.

00:15:09.047 --> 00:15:09.880
SIMON KEYNES: Right.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.220
Now we go-- we've had
one charter from 679.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.130
This, now, is another
original charter.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.790
We're moving into the period of
the Mercian Supremacy, a period

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.400
in the eighth century when
the Mercian kings in the West

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.620
Midlands were
dominant in England.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:35.410
And in this case,
it's dated 736.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.570
You can see that script are
as [? tight ?] [? cartular. ?]

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:44.342
It's now using a system of
dating with which we are

00:15:44.342 --> 00:15:46.300
familiar, which was
introduced into the country

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.130
by the Venerable Bede himself.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.830
And again, he's called--

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.260
he was king of the
Mercians, but the scribe

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.870
in writing that has
said, I, Aethelbald,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:04.030
by gift of God, King,
not only of the Mercians,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.450
but of all of the kingdoms which
go by the general name South

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.290
English.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.860
So the scribe is conscious that
Aethelbald is more than a king

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.060
of the Mercians.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.840
And in fact, when he gets
down to the witness list,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.120
he's getting so
overexcited by this

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.090
that he actually calls
Aethelbald king of Britain,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.040
which is obviously a
gross exaggeration,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.640
but that's par for the course.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.480
And again, in this case, you
can see that the document

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.120
has been used in ceremony.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.580
Names have been added.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.260
The document was
written in advance,

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.810
and some names have
been inserted there

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.190
and added at the bottom there.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.530
You can tell that from
the different ink.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.240
So again, we see what
charters themselves

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.900
can deliver at all stages
of Anglo-Saxon England

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.600
in substantiating what
we otherwise learn

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.930
from the books in general.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.680
JOANNA STORY: And the
charter of this sort

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.130
is written in a script that
we call uncial, which is also

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.130
the script that's used for
writing the poshest gospel

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.329
books in that sort
of Roman context.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.829
So we can tell
something about who

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.996
the scribes are who are
writing the charters as well

00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:15.020
as the books.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.520
OK.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.950
So sticking with
the eighth century,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.240
and moving on into the
ninth century as well,

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.609
this is one of these very, very
sort of luscious, deluxe gospel

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.890
books that was written,
probably in Kent,

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.140
round about the middle
years of the eighth century,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.298
so around the sort of
750s, that sort of period.

00:17:33.298 --> 00:17:34.840
And this one is here
for two reasons,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.760
partly because it is a
part of what was clearly

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.910
a very, very sumptuous book
written with copious amounts

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.530
of gold and silver.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.550
But also, some of the
other pages in this book

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.440
are dip dyed in purple
with all of the resonance

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.340
of imperial Roman connotations
that go with that.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.570
And it's possible that those
dipped purple pages might also

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.290
have been imported, perhaps
from as far away as Byzantium.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.190
So this type of manuscript--
you can see here

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.100
in sort of epigraphic
capitals the beginning

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.550
of the generation of Christ,
the part of the Bible

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.270
that explains Christ's lineage.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.900
The X at the top is part of
the name of Christ in Greek,

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.320
but you can see it with all of
these curls and swirls, which

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.040
are reminiscent of Celtic
or Irish style of art

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.000
as well being used
in this manuscript.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.180
This manuscript is also here
to take us into the next phase,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.480
if you like, of Anglo-Saxon
history in the ninth century,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.980
because you can
probably see the top

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.900
and bottom of this ornate
page are little lines

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.465
of writing in little letters.

00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:48.340
And this is, in fact,
written in Old English,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.190
so in the vernacular.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.750
And it records an incident
whereby this book was ransomed

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.730
for three bags of gold from
heathen invaders, heathen

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.960
pirates, and we're talking
here about Vikings.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.060
And this man whose
name was Alfred--

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.640
it's not King Alfred,
but the Alderman Alfred--

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.840
ransomed these books
and brought them

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.200
and gave them to the church
at Canterbury in order

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.360
that Canterbury thereafter might
remember himself, and his wife,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.940
and his daughter
in their prayers

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.640
in perpetuity as
a sort of thanks

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.700
for the rescuing of the word
of God in this manuscript.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.630
So we've got here in this book
an extraordinary eighth century

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.720
book that was clearly
snaffled by the Vikings,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.850
not because they
could give a monkey's

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.730
about the content of what
it said, but probably

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.423
because it had an ornate,
jeweled cover on the front.

00:19:46.423 --> 00:19:49.090
They may also have realized that
they could get some gold for it

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.760
if there was someone who
was prepared to buy it back

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.970
from them.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.430
Interestingly also,
you might just

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.270
be able to notice in the
margin the name of Aethelred.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.690
Here is the name of his
wife, and here is the name

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.100
of his daughter along the side.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.590
Aethelred-- sorry--
Alfred's name

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.680
is near the name of Christ.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.040
His wife's name here
comes alongside the word

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.790
"mater," so this is in reference
to Mary, the mother of God.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.950
And the daughter's name is
alongside a section which says,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.400
"in utero [? happens," ?]
holding in her womb.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.250
So the placing of
the names, at least

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.330
of the wife and the daughter,
reflects that generation

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:31.990
of Christ.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.820
It says quite a lot
about Alfred's sense

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.290
of his own importance
that he goes

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.850
alongside the name of Christ.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:42.130
But as they read out
this text, if you like,

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.750
the memory of
these three people,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.300
these benefactors to the
community at Canterbury

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.270
who saved this book
from the Vikings,

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.460
is sort of hoovered
up in the prayers that

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.840
go with the community every
time this book is used and read

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.370
in that sort of
liturgical setting.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.490
SIMON KEYNES: Now we go
again from the sublime

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.330
to the ridiculous.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.050
This is the back of a charter.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.820
It can't get much
worse than that.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.410
What one has to do is
imagine that on the front

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.940
of this charter there is a
very significant text marking

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.550
the agreement of--

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.020
marking the making
of an agreement

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.110
between the Church of
Canterbury and the Kings

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.820
of the West Saxons.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.570
We're in the early part
of the ninth century.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.100
And so on the front
of the charter,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.690
there is the text of this thing.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.990
And then on the top left, that's
the archbishop and the members

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:42.030
of his community sort
of signing the document,

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.860
agreeing to hold to it.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.750
And it's a crucial
turning point.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.470
We are moving away from
the Mercian Supremacy

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.870
to the emergence
of the West Saxons

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.350
and their special relationship
with the Archbishops

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.040
of Canterbury we've
just been hearing about.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.850
The people with the document
took the document, then,

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.870
to Wilton in Wiltshire in the
kingdom of the West Saxons,

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:12.540
and there it was confirmed by
King Ecgberht and his son King

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.190
Aethelwulf.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.760
And it's attested by
Aethelwulf and then the bishops

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.590
of Winchester and
Sherburn and then

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.030
all of the noblemen
of the West Saxons.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.150
So the West Saxons
have endorsed it.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.750
And then it's taken after
that to a church council,

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:37.920
and you can see there that the
bishops of the whole country

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.870
also acknowledge this agreement
between Canterbury and Wessex.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.570
So that's in effect-- it's 838--

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.720
it's symbolic of
this great turn which

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.690
establishes the special
relationship between Canterbury

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:57.210
and Wessex and then leads to
the rise of Wessex in the later

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.960
ninth century and to everything
else that came thereafter,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.442
which we'll see.

00:23:02.442 --> 00:23:03.150
JOANNA STORY: OK.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.380
So we're looking at this
shift in the balance of power

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.660
to the kingdom of Wessex.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.880
And this is where
we first really hear

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.500
of one of the major
achievements, if you like,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.740
of that West Saxon dynasty.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.750
This is a book
associated directly

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.550
with King Alfred himself.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.160
King Alfred, he died in
899, one of those very easy

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.660
dates to remember.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.010
Now, Alfred's dynasty--
we've seen the 838 charter--

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.840
is coming to power against a
backdrop of external pressure,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.723
particularly from Viking
raiders, Scandinavian raiders,

00:23:41.723 --> 00:23:43.890
who start the process with
these sort of hit and run

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.030
raids on the coast.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.473
And then gradually, you get the
build-up of much larger armies

00:23:48.473 --> 00:23:49.890
that are overwintering
and staying

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.230
for several years campaigning.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.810
The West Saxon kingdom
was the last, if you like,

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.110
the last kingdom standing after
the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.010
had been--

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.960
the dynasties had been taken
out by Scandinavian armies.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.500
And Alfred is well
remembered in history

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:13.260
as the West Saxon king who is
really responsible for stopping

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:19.590
that Viking onslaught and
maintaining the power of Wessex

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.122
and starting to rebuild
the power of Wessex.

00:24:22.122 --> 00:24:23.580
Towards the end of
his reign, there

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.080
comes this period of relative
peace and prosperity in Wessex,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.190
and Alfred is able to shift
his attention to something

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.550
that he had always been
interested in, which

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.320
was learning.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.747
And he understood that
the English kingdoms--

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:43.830
he thought that one of the
reasons why the English

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.130
kingdoms had been so badly
damaged and so badly targeted

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.730
by these external raiders
was that they were not

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.760
sufficiently, if you like,
sufficiently good Christians

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.350
in order to be able to--

00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:01.560
God was punishing them
for their lack of faith.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.230
But he also
understood that there

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.590
had been such degradation
over the years of the ability,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:11.003
of the resources in England,
to learn that he said,

00:25:11.003 --> 00:25:12.420
we've got to do
something radical.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.290
What we've got to do is rebuild
the sort of Christianity

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.460
across the kingdom, but there
are not enough people anymore

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.650
who can read and write in Latin.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.520
He said, before everything
was ransacked and burned,

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.165
we had the ability.

00:25:28.165 --> 00:25:30.540
We had people all over the
place who could read and write

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.950
in Latin, and people would come
to England to learn from us.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.040
But now, he says, there
is scarcely anyone south

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.720
of the Humber who is competent.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.580
So he said, we must
do things differently,

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.800
and we must do it in English.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.510
And this is, if you
like, the greatest

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.950
legacy of King Alfred to our
modern day, where he turns

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.070
English from the
vernacular, spoken language

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.640
of the ordinary people
into a literary language,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.240
which is appropriate
for use in the church.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.910
And this manuscript
is where he lays out

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.950
that manifesto, if you
like, of the use of English

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:12.350
alongside Latin as a language
that can be there to reinforce,

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:17.450
to re-establish the
Christian morals and ethos

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.490
of the English people.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.880
And this is where
he lays it out.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.047
And this is a manuscript
that dates almost certainly

00:26:23.047 --> 00:26:25.280
to the last decade of
the ninth century where

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.860
Alfred writes to Bishop
Werferth laying out this agenda.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.250
And what thereafter
follows is a translation

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.540
into English of the
"Pastoral Care," which

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.100
had been composed
by Pope Gregory

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.240
the Great, the pope who had
sent the missionaries to England

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.150
in round about 600.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.400
Whereas Gregory the Great
had seen the "Pastoral Care"

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.370
as a handbook for
bishops, really Alfred

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.490
sees the "Pastoral Care"
translated into English

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.190
as a handbook for kings
about how to operate

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.510
and how to be a good king.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.140
SIMON KEYNES: Well, that's
Alfred the Great at his finest.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.390
He had a son and grandson.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.220
The son was called
Edward the Elder.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.310
The grandson was the
person responsible

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.100
for a magnificent
series of charters

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.390
in the 930s, which represent
the first establishment

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.370
of a kingdom of the English.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.640
We're no longer the
kingdom of the West Saxons.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.680
Things have moved forward
in the early 10th century,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.740
and this is a product
of this new kingdom.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.600
And you can see at a glance
what an extraordinary number

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.790
of people attend these
royal assemblies.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.800
This was issued--
it's dated incredibly

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.240
accurately-- the
12th of November,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.080
931 at Lifton in Devon.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.000
There was this council meeting.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.480
And the document itself
is just a grant of land

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.440
to a miscellaneous person,
but you can see here's

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.390
the King and all of his bishops.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.120
Here are all of the
aldermen, the Dukes,

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.660
the Earls of the kingdom coming
from Wessex, coming from Kent,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.460
coming from northern
England, eastern England.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.380
Some have weird names.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.950
[? Thorfath, ?] [? Hada, ?]
[? Skoler, ?] these are all

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.070
Norse names.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.700
These are representatives
of the Viking invaders.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.580
Then, some abbots,
and then lots and lots

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.660
of thanes of
miscellaneous people.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.600
And this is typical of
diplomas of the 10th century

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.860
granting land to individuals.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.830
And in this particular case,
the will of the beneficiary

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.330
is attached to the
bottom edge, and he

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.140
grants to land to Winchester.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.040
And Claire has very kindly
lent me the charter,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.370
and you can get a sense of
what these documents look

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.340
like in parchment.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.820
You can pass this round, and
I'm very grateful to her.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.920
But it gives you some sense of
if you own that document you

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.910
would own the land.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.220
You could go to court and
just waive the document

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.040
at the people in the
court, and the fact

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.590
that you had the title
deed would be enough.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.007
Anyway, it's a
magnificent document.

00:29:15.007 --> 00:29:16.840
JOANNA STORY: Even
better than the original.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.340
OK.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.720
One of the things I was like
about these witness lists--

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.390
and Simon pointed out this
group of Norse names--

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.510
is you can kind of
imagine that the committee

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.922
room, and the Scandinavians are
sitting in the corner together.

00:29:28.922 --> 00:29:30.880
And as they go around
and mark off who's there,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.755
you've got this little
group of Scandinavians

00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:33.910
sitting in the corner.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:34.910
You know what it's like.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.380
Students, they always
sit in the same place.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.920
I'm sure that's
what was going on.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.670
OK.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.800
Right.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.690
So here we come
to our poster boy

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.400
for the exhibition, King Edgar.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.530
Now, Edgar ruled
from 959 to 975,

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.680
so we're well into the middle
years of the 10th century here.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:30:00.280
And Edgar really picks up
on the legacy of Athelstan,

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.560
who we've just heard about,
who is one of the kings

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.640
to really start to define
a kingdom of the English

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.430
for the first time.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.250
And Edgar takes that forward.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.150
And he does that in a
number of different ways,

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.420
but one of the things
he's most associated with

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.500
is a wholesale
reform of the church,

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.030
because he sees the church--

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.800
just like Alfred had
done before him--

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.850
as an essential sort of
partner in the running

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.760
of a medieval kingdom, in
the running of his kingdom.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.860
And just as he sees the
kingdom as a unified whole,

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.190
so he sees the church as
a unified whole as well.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.310
So he talks about one
church and one kingdom.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.640
But he sees that the
church needs reform,

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.980
and it needs reform
along the lines

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.880
of the rule of Saint
Benedict, the sixth century

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.270
monk from Italy who produced a
rule known as the Benedictine

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.710
rule.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.670
Edgar and his followers
decide that this

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.320
needs to be implemented in
Anglo-Saxon England in a more

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.150
systematic way than
had been done before.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.010
So under Edgar and
his key reformers,

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.720
people like Bishop Aethelwold,
Archbishop Dunstan,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:24.550
and Wulfstan of York as well
are reforming important churches

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.470
through the kingdom,
not all of them,

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.292
but key churches including
the church at Winchester,

00:31:30.292 --> 00:31:32.500
the Old Minster at Winchester,
which is, if you like,

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.480
the West Saxon capital.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.590
And this book is,
in fact, a charter.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:46.450
It's the Great Charter for the
reformed Minster at Winchester,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:50.920
but very unusually in the form
of a book rather than as one

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.615
of these single-sheet charters.

00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:55.240
And that's because
it's so long, and it

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.660
goes on for sort of 60 pages
but all written in gold.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.650
But at the front of it, you
have this portrait of King Edgar

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.700
donating the charter-- you
can see it in his hand there--

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.670
to Christ, who is seen
in the mandala above them

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.450
with Saint Peter and Mary
on either side of him.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.450
Christ shown in that mandala
like that, the intersection

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.840
of two circles, the heavenly
sphere and the earthly sphere,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.400
Christ in majesty in between.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.720
And so just as we had
that image of Athelstan

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.000
that Claire showed us that
the beginning donating

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.240
a copy of the "Life of
Saint Cuthbert" to Saint

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.000
Cuthbert himself, here
you have King Edgar

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.730
presenting the charter
for the new Minster,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.920
the reformed church,
to Christ himself.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.158
And then the text of it follows
in the 60 odd pages thereafter.

00:32:47.567 --> 00:32:48.400
SIMON KEYNES: Right.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.050
Well, I'm afraid it goes
pear shaped after that,

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.440
because the Vikings came
back in even larger numbers

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.750
than they'd been here before
under King Sweyn Forkbeard

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.090
and then Sweyn's son, King Cnut.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.170
And with the English
under the impressive rule

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.560
of King Aethelred the Unready,
you can imagine what happened.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.960
And the Danes conquered
the English in 1016.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:23.010
This is, however, a magnificent
charter of King Cnut,

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:29.280
and it shows how once he
became king, in effect

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.370
he had nothing to bring
himself, and he took over

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.540
all of the English institutions
which had developed.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.340
And Athelstan's charter,
which we looked at,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.830
is in a script known
as square minuscule.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.600
This is in a
beautiful script known

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.460
as Anglo-Caroline
minuscule, which

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.740
is the ancestor of the script
that we all write today.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.510
And it's just a
grant by the king.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:57.090
Most interestingly, it's
also issued at the request

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:01.770
of his wife, Queen Aelfgifu.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.850
And that shows
how significant it

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.030
was to him that he married
the widow of King Aethelred

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.582
the Unready, and in this way,
he was able to ingratiate

00:34:12.582 --> 00:34:14.040
himself-- well, he
thought he might

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.199
be able to ingratiate
himself so much the more

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.780
with the English people.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.489
It's a stunning document.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:23.580
Again, you can analyze
all of the names.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.380
There's Cnut, the
Archbishop of York,

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.760
Wulfstan, Aelfgifu, the queen,
and then several bishops,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.199
several abbots.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:35.710
And then here you have one
of the chief Scandinavians,

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.040
[? Thirkettle, ?]
Thorkell the Tall.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.840
And then here is Godwine.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.770
That's Earl Godwin, the father
of Harold who became king.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.060
This is in 1018, the first
year of Cnut's reign,

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.300
and you can see
already there were

00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:00.360
sort of warnings of what's going
to happen good many years later

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.402
with the Norman conquest.

00:35:01.402 --> 00:35:03.693
JOANNA STORY: I mean, another
interesting thing to just

00:35:03.693 --> 00:35:06.450
pick out here while we've
got this one on the screen is

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.110
that you can probably see
that the script changes

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.520
to a much sort of, if you
like, sort of smaller point

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.560
size and a different font,
to use modern terminology.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.603
This is the parcel of land.

00:35:19.603 --> 00:35:21.270
It's a description
of the parcel of land

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:25.050
that's being donated
in the charter,

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.150
and it's in Old English.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.120
So the main framework of
the charter is in Latin,

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.580
but when it switches
to describing

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.430
the actual bit of the
land that is to be given,

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.980
they revert to the
vernacular so that it's

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.140
absolutely clear to
everybody listening

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.630
precisely where this is.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.950
And these charter bounds
go so far as to say,

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.710
you go up to the holly tree
at the top of the hill,

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.230
and then you come
down the valley

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.490
until you get to the stream
and then along and around.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.160
And you can imagine
this being read aloud

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.000
in the Old English vernacular so
that everybody in the locality

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.660
actually, really understood the
precise boundary of land that

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.022
was being donated.

00:36:05.022 --> 00:36:06.480
And one of the
extraordinary things

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.010
about so many of these
Anglo-Saxon charters

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:16.440
is that we can reconstruct very
often these absolute parcels

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.400
of land that are
available that were being

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.510
given, including some, in fact,
for land parcels in London

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.260
itself.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.040
And you can walk the bounds of
these charters within the city

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.600
today.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.710
Claire, won't you come up.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.070
CLAIRE BREAY: Thank you.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.400
So I showed before an image
of "Domesday Book," which is

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.980
near the end of the exhibition.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.360
And as I said, "Domesday Book"
contains this incredible detail

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.440
covering most of
the country, and it

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.410
reflects the organization
of the country.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.960
And it's organized by
the shires which had

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.470
emerged in the 10th century.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.670
And that organization of
the shires, the counties,

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:10.320
their boundaries lasted until
local government reorganization

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.990
in 1974, so it's a
very long-lived legacy

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:19.440
of the late Anglo-Saxon period.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.390
But "Domesday" also
shows the wealth

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:27.030
that existed in England
in the 11th century,

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.770
and of course, it
was that wealth--

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.720
and the organization
of the country--

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:38.730
that made England so attractive
to Cnut in his conquest of 1016

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:45.750
and to William of Normandy,
more famously, in 1066.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:52.050
So that organization of the
country is a great legacy,

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:58.300
but the other great legacy is
the English language itself.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.770
And as I said at
the beginning, that

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.010
is something that
we've embedded right

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.880
throughout the exhibition.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:13.590
Looking from the earliest uses
of short pieces of English

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:19.260
in runic characters inscribed
on objects and the "Textus

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.180
Roffensis," that
earliest extended

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:28.230
text in the English language,
we look at the use of English

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.830
with Latin as a
literary language.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.960
But right at the end
of the exhibition,

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.700
we have this manuscript,
which shows the continuity

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.120
of the English language.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.880
This manuscript is a
very large, the book

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.630
of the psalms known as the
"Eadwine Psalter" on loan

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:52.140
to us from Trinity
College in Cambridge.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.030
And it is one of three psalters
that are displayed together.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:00.960
And it's displayed with the
"Utrecht Psalter," which I also

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.180
showed earlier, which
has those cartoon

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:08.280
strip-like drawings of
those very lively characters

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.170
from the psalms.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.490
And through the display of
these three manuscripts,

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.840
we're trying to bring out--

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.890
or bring together--
some of the themes that

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.930
run right through the
exhibition, not just

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.330
the continuity of the
English language, which I'll

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:28.020
come onto in a moment, but
the themes of connectedness

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:33.570
and contacts between
the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.230
and their neighbors in Ireland
and continental Europe,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.260
because the "Utrecht
Psalter," as I said,

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.340
was made on the continent
in the 9th century.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.310
And it was a manuscript
that came to Canterbury,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.040
and a copy was made of it.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.230
Now, it was used
as a model there

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.030
at the beginning
of the 11th century

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.010
for a manuscript in
our own collections

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.080
known as the "Harley Psalter."

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.990
And then this manuscript,
the "Eadwine Psalter,"

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:11.580
was produced in the middle
of the 12th century.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.150
It didn't include all
the illustrations,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:20.940
but it does incorporate the
three different versions

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.080
of the psalms in Latin
whereas only one had

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.740
been included before.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.300
And so that's why it's got
these three columns of text.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.500
And very interestingly,
between the lines

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.750
of the Latin in the
right-hand column,

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.280
the psalms have been translated
into Anglo-Norman French,

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:48.990
reflecting the new reality
following the Norman conquest.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:53.100
But between the lines
of the middle column

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.190
of the psalms in
Latin, the Psalms

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.650
are translated into
English, showing

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.490
the continuity of
the English language

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.095
well into the 12th century.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.190
I hope-- well, I've
seen that several of you

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.550
been to the exhibition, and
I hope that many more of you

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:17.880
might have been inspired by
looking at these manuscripts

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.340
and charters today to go.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.690
Very sadly for us, it closes
on the 19th of February.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:28.710
It's extremely busy, so
I do advise you to book

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.380
ahead if you'd like to go.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.080
But it has been an absolutely
incredible experience

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.830
working on the exhibition.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:42.590
We were-- or I was-- indebted
to the advisory group who helped

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.840
to develop the exhibition.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:48.100
And Simon and Jo were absolutely
key members of that group,

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.510
and they both were
very great contributors

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.220
to the catalog as well.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.820
And Jo edited the catalog
with me for her sins.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:04.270
And I think-- yeah, it has
been an incredible project

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.550
to work on, and I don't
think this group of,

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:13.060
well, manuscripts and charters
will be together again

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.850
certainly in our lifetimes.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:16.804
Thank you very much.

00:42:16.804 --> 00:42:20.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:31.860
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.110
We do have time for questions.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.655
Please wait for the microphone.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.210
AUDIENCE: What is the
difference between a charter

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.518
and a manuscript?

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.790
JOANNA STORY: OK.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.270
Manuscript literally
means "written by hand,"

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.730
so charters are
manuscripts, if you like.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.920
But the objects I
was talking about

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.150
were books, a codices, a
codex, whereas a charter--

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.020
the ones that Simon was showing
you-- were on single sheets,

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.545
so single sheets of parchment.

00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:08.170
And when we're talking
about parchment,

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.000
we're talking
about animal skins.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.070
So in Anglo-Saxon England,
it's mostly cattle skin,

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:18.330
but increasingly, also the use
of sheep or goat skin as well.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.948
If you can get the
images back up--

00:43:19.948 --> 00:43:21.240
can you get the images back up?

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.680
We might be to sort of
point to some things.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.950
So one of the interesting
things about those charters

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.700
that we looked at, I
don't know if you saw

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.880
they had sort of lines on them.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.080
Did you see that?

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.420
That's how they were folded
up, so you can reconstruct

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.740
how they were all folded up.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.390
And some of these
original charters--

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:41.700
so these are things that
were written in 838 or 736--

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:45.920
were folded up into
little squares this big

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.087
that somehow have survived.

00:43:48.087 --> 00:43:49.920
And that, I think, is
one of the really sort

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.378
of mind blowing things, that
these little, tiny things that

00:43:52.378 --> 00:43:55.950
have been folded up and
kept over the years,

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.700
very often in the context
of the church that

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.320
was the beneficiary of the
land that was being granted.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.310
So a charter is a legal
document that records

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.760
the grant of land or privilege.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.560
Lots of them survive in copies
in codices, manuscripts,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.320
but some of them-- and
we've got quite a lot--

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.380
survive in those original forms.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.907
So they're original legal
documents from 1,000 years ago.

00:44:27.907 --> 00:44:29.490
CLAIRE BREAY: And
we have quite a lot,

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.680
but a huge amount
has also been lost.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.240
And I think that's one of the
different things about curating

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.550
an exhibition on
this sort of period

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:43.230
compared with something even
later in the Middle Ages, let

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.750
alone a more modern subject.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.967
The evidence is
very fragmentary.

00:44:48.967 --> 00:44:50.550
I worked on the Magna
Carta exhibition

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.380
at the British Library
a few years ago,

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.840
and my research had a
spreadsheet with two

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.870
and a half thousand
possible exhibits on it.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.890
And there just aren't that many
manuscripts surviving at all

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:07.800
from Anglo-Saxon English, so
you're choosing from a smaller

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.420
pool of what survives.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.330
But I think one of the
interesting things that we've

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.790
tried to get people to think
about in the exhibition

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:20.220
is how you use that
fragmentary evidence to tell

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.520
the story of what was
actually happening

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.950
and to get visitors to engage
with the difficulties of having

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:37.710
to try and extrapolate so much,
often from very small pieces

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.010
of evidence that survive.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.520
JOANNA STORY: I mean, there's
an important sort of point

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.760
of principle there, which
is that medievalists

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.900
work from data.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.910
We work from
evidence, but you also

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.730
have to have a really
good imagination

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.950
to make the leap
between the evidence

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.270
and then to back it up.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.950
So we tell good
stories because we've

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.690
got the imagination to do it.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.326
But the evidence, the data
is what underpins it all.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.810
AUDIENCE: Why did so many
people sign the charters?

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.420
Was it to increase the
legitimacy of the document

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.790
or to increase the
prestige of the people--

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.520
meaning I was here when
this charter was made?

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.680
SIMON KEYNES: Well, I
think the essential point

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.850
is that these charters are
products of the royal assembly

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.830
at which they were produced.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.620
And so the witness
list is symbolic

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:31.310
of that fact, the fact that
this is not just the king

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:32.030
making an act.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.970
It's the king in
consultation with,

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:38.840
and with the permission of,
the bishops, and the earls,

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.270
and the men of the land.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.820
So one shouldn't
think that they're

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.950
necessarily all
lining up and sort

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.140
of signing the document itself.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:53.420
It's more of a symbolic
representation of a royal act

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:58.780
proceeding from
a royal assembly,

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.790
and that's very much
a part of the way

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:04.650
that the Anglo-Saxons
saw it themselves.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.900
JOANNA STORY: So you're right.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.072
It is for the--

00:47:07.072 --> 00:47:08.780
it's really both of
those things you say.

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.238
It's for the prestige
of the people

00:47:10.238 --> 00:47:14.870
as well as ensuring
that the record

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:17.660
of that transfer of
land-- because the source

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:23.160
of all wealth is land, was
then, is now, ever shall be.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.240
So the transfer of
land in perpetuity

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.840
into the church is something
that they want to make sure

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.260
is recorded and witnessed by
as many people as possible.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:42.090
So the charter, if you like,
is a record both of the event

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.750
as it occurs-- a bit
like a video record--

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:48.990
but it's also picking up
other people who agree to it

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.800
and agreed that this
transfer has taken place

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.215
in the presence of the king.

00:47:53.215 --> 00:47:55.340
CLAIRE BREAY: And I think
one of the amazing things

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.040
about the documents
in the exhibition

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.280
is that I think they do
sort of transport you back

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:06.210
to that moment in time and
to when a group of people

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:06.710
were there.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:08.660
Or with the wills
there's somebody

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.880
dealing with their
property, and it gives you

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:16.490
a connection with the
individuals and the occasion

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:20.040
when they were created, which
I think is very powerful.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.950
And I think people
visiting the exhibition

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:24.620
have found it very,
very powerful.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.270
Although I think, in
curating an exhibition,

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.890
there is a tension
between what is visually

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:37.640
appealing to visitors and
what is the most historically

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.570
important, Simon.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:39.320
SIMON KEYNES: Yes.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.362
CLAIRE BREAY: So, Simon--

00:48:40.362 --> 00:48:42.620
SIMON KEYNES: Claire.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.900
CLAIRE BREAY: Simon was
very keen, very, very keen

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:49.190
to have some charters in the
exhibition which were extremely

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.570
important, which I deemed
to be undisplayable

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.570
much to his distress.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:54.740
So, yeah--

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.700
JOANNA STORY: I can't
tell you what she really

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.367
said about them.

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:59.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.640
We are not having
that on our wall.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.890
It might be historically
very significant,

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.018
but it cannot be displayed.

00:49:05.018 --> 00:49:05.810
CLAIRE BREAY: Yeah.

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.100
It has to be
something that people

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.390
are going to stop and look at.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:10.210
Yeah.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.960
AUDIENCE: Are you
trying to tell the story

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.510
of the English
language, and was it

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:17.120
possible that the English
language could have died out?

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.330
It was fragile, wasn't
it, when the Normans came?

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:21.680
It could have died out.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.780
We could have been
speaking French.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.700
I mean, are you
telling a history

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.170
of the English language?

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.212
JOANNA STORY: Yes, certainly
it is there as well.

00:49:29.212 --> 00:49:34.940
I mean, as Claire said, there
are fragments of English--

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.620
written English--

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.162
from right at the
beginning of the period.

00:49:40.162 --> 00:49:41.870
So when you first go
into the exhibition,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.560
there are little runic
inscriptions written in English

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.700
that show the earliest
phases of the language.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.310
It is revived under
King Alfred and is

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:55.670
made into a literary
language for the church.

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.980
It clearly existed in
the form of epic poetry

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.470
in a very sort of
sophisticated way before that,

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.340
but it then becomes written down
as a language of composition

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.410
for the church and for
thinking and knowledge

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.720
exchange from
Alfred's time onward,

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.660
so the end of the
11th and 12th century.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.710
When French starts being used
in England after the Norman

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:20.060
conquest, it is a
language of the elite.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.440
So it is a language
of government.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.940
It's a language of the church.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.690
But the vernacular language,
the spoken language,

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:33.920
remains English
to a large degree.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.900
You get loanwords
coming in from French,

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.310
those things like "beef"
comes from [FRENCH]

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.280
and "mutton," [FRENCH].

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.200
Those are the
words of the table,

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.900
but they're not the words
of the spoken people.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.010
"Swine," [GERMAN]
from the Germans.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.960
So you can see the
language borrowing,

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.930
but English remains
through the conquest.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:01.133
So there's a very strong
line of continuity in that

00:51:01.133 --> 00:51:02.300
the other side the conquest.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.170
So I don't think it is quite
as fragile as you might have

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:10.520
thought, but that's partly to
do with the nature of the regime

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.160
change that you see
in the 11th century,

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.670
first under Cnut and then
under William beyond that.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.100
AUDIENCE: How often do new
manuscripts come to light?

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.010
Let's say if you were to
have done this exhibition 10

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:28.670
years ago, would it be
almost exactly the same

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.860
as it is now, or
are there new things

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.263
that have been discovered?

00:51:32.263 --> 00:51:33.680
CLAIRE BREAY: So
one of the most--

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.110
JOANNA STORY: Sorry.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:34.540
Sorry.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.020
I was going to say the
"Anderson Pontifical."

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:36.400
SIMON KEYNES: Yeah.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.108
CLAIRE BREAY: OK.

00:51:37.108 --> 00:51:38.090
Well, you can do that.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:38.980
I'll do this one.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.060
So one of the most
interesting things,

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.900
I think, for me
is the discovery,

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.940
through the
multispectral imaging

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.120
of Christina Duffy, who
is in the audience today,

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.400
of the "Bodmin Gospels."

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.290
So in the "Bodmin
Gospels," which

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:58.280
are a ninth century
Breton gospel

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.490
book which ended up
in Cornwall, there

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.670
is a page which looks
completely blank.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:09.350
But Christina, who
works at the library,

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:12.260
did some multispectral
imaging on this page for us,

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:18.230
and the text of five documents--

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.960
they're manumission documents
recording the freeing

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.570
of slaves in Cornwall.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:27.230
And so this hidden
documentary evidence,

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.480
which had never
been seen before,

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.943
came to light through
the new imaging.

00:52:33.943 --> 00:52:35.360
And this was a
manuscript that had

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.700
been in the national
collection for over 200 years,

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.770
so sometimes there
are new things

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:47.510
to be discovered in manuscripts
that we already know about.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:50.150
And I think these
documents are especially

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:55.570
interesting because they
are the freeing of slaves,

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:58.580
so there is information about
people who aren't recorded

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.480
in any other sources at all.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.790
But yes, there's also the
"Anderson Pontifical," which

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.730
was a spectacular discovery.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:11.050
SIMON KEYNES: Yes, if I can just
add that every now and then,

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:13.900
a new Anglo-Saxon
manuscript might appear.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.165
The best-known and
well-represented

00:53:16.165 --> 00:53:17.540
in the exhibition
is a manuscript

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.550
known as the "Anderson
Pontifical," which

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.160
was discovered in
a Scottish hayloft.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.450
Someone was just sort of going
through their old plowshares

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.950
or whatever, and
suddenly they found

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:30.830
this stunningly
beautiful early 11th

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.410
century Anglo-Saxon
pontifical, which

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.720
is a book containing
all of the services

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.190
that a bishop would use.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.830
And so there's the
coronation order,

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:44.040
which is much like the one
that survives to this day.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:49.700
So that's a complete manuscript.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.125
Charters can also come
to light, not necessarily

00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.750
in their original
form, but in the form

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.970
of early modern
transcripts or whatever.

00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:00.230
But what we really
want is for you

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:03.380
lot to devise some
kind of machine that

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.560
enables us to discover
manuscripts in the same way

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.950
that metal detectorists are
discovering hoards, gold,

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:11.450
silver.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:17.720
We read about it every day
almost in the newspapers.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.150
Metal detectorists
contribute a massive amount,

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.428
and what we want is a
machine which can identify

00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:24.970
Anglo-Saxon--

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.220
JOANNA STORY: A book detector!

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.670
SIMON KEYNES: --books just
underneath the surface.

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:30.560
And then we can dig them up.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.670
So there is a difference--

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:32.900
JOANNA STORY: I mean, one--

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.140
a complete manuscript was
discovered in a bog in Ireland

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.270
a few years ago, the
"Faddan More Psalter,"

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:41.070
which came out that sort
of anaerobic environment

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:44.360
of the bog, which was a very
important new discovery.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.450
CLAIRE BREAY: --2006, yes.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.033
In a bit of a state,
but nevertheless.

00:54:47.033 --> 00:54:49.100
JOANNA STORY: Alphabet
soup it was described as.

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:49.892
CLAIRE BREAY: Yeah.

00:54:49.892 --> 00:54:51.950
I mean, there were
two big exhibitions

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:56.090
on this period at the British
Museum, which Simon actually

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.410
contributed to.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:02.900
In 1991, there was the
Making of England exhibition,

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:07.410
and the subtitle for that was
Art and Culture 600 to 900.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.550
And in 1984, there
was the Golden Age

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:15.360
of Anglo-Saxon Art looking at
the later Anglo-Saxon period.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.380
But I think the focus
of those exhibitions

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.800
was very much more
on art and style,

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.400
whereas the focus
of this exhibition

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.905
is more on the history.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.540
There were a lot of manuscripts
in those other exhibitions

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.830
which are in this exhibition
covering the whole period,

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:40.770
but we've got all
those loans that

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.840
are in Britain for
the first time,

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.500
so they weren't included
in those exhibitions.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:51.440
And we do have a large number
of illuminated manuscripts,

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:57.170
but we are, I think, using them
to tell a historical story.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.760
And the great thing
about manuscripts

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:05.090
is that they have many pages,
so we, in many, many cases,

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:11.120
chose to show a different
opening from the ones that

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.850
were shown in those
exhibitions and are

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:14.975
recorded in those catalogs.

00:56:17.322 --> 00:56:19.780
SPEAKER: I think we could easily
fill another hour of this,

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.430
but we are unfortunately
out of time.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.840
So again, thank you very much.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.840
CLAIRE BREAY: Thank you.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.790
[APPLAUSE]
