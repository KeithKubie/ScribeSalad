00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.710
My solution to most of my problems is to light
them on fire.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.279
Why can’t garbage be one of those problems?

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.309
HI, I’m Julian, this is DNews.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.330
Americans make a lot of trash, according to
the EPA in 2012 the average person made 1,600

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.910
pounds of solid waste that year, about 45%
more than the average european.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.070
About 55% of that goes in a landfill, so to
translate that, if you’re an average american,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.609
you were responsible for burying 880 pounds
of trash in 2012.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.030
Is there something that garbage could be doing
besides just sitting there?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
Sweden thinks so.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.989
Only about 1% of swedish trash ends up in
a landfill.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.999
The rest is almost evenly split between being
recycled and burned for energy.

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:50.609
Sweden actually burns so much trash they import
700,000 tons of it from europe in order to

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.940
keep the fires lit, and by using the heat
to create steam and run turbines, they get

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.920
about 8.5% of their electricity needs from
burning waste.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.279
Göran Skoglund, a representative of one of
Sweden’s energy companies, estimates that

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:08.490
burned trash has about a third the energy
pound for pound as burned fossil fuels.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.600
Burning their trash means they save space
in landfills, don’t need to import fossil

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.670
fuels, and as an added bonus, they cut down
on greenhouse gasses.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.640
Alright, stop right there because I know exactly
what you all just yelled at your computer

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.640
screens.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.020
“But Julian, burning anything is going to
create CO2!”

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.909
And yeah, you’re right.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.340
But like a Swedish police drama, it’s all
very nuanced.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.249
On the face of it, burning garbage actually
looks less favorable than coal or natural

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.500
gas, in terms of CO2 production.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.799
According to the EPA flaming trash creates
2,988 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.630
For the same power, coal makes 2,249 pounds
of CO2 and natural gas makes 1,135 pounds.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.189
That doesn’t sound good until you consider
that a lot of the CO2 released by burning

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.210
trash is from stuff that was part of the earth’s
carbon cycle.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.270
It’s carbon that was in the air not too
long ago and would be returning there again,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.509
whereas the carbon released from burning fossil
fuels was out of the carbon cycle for millions

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.189
of years, sequestered away deep underground.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.400
So the EPA considers the CO2 impact of burning
waste to be about a third as bad as it looks.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.850
But energy from garbage unequivocally cuts
down on a much more insidious greenhouse gas:

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.850
methane.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.650
Methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere for
hundreds of years like CO2 can, usually it’s

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.239
out after a dozen.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.720
But this little molecule is so good at trapping
heat, the EPA estimates one CH4 has 25 times

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.819
the impact as one CO2 over the course of a
century.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.000
And do you know what the third biggest source
of man-made methane is in the United States?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Landfills.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.780
Yep, 18% of the methane Americans make happens
when we bury our trash and let microbes go

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.159
to town on it.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.739
Methane is a key component of natural gas
so some landfills capture it and sell it to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.739
power companies.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.150
You’d think the tradeoff would be reduced
methane for increased CO2, but the number

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.349
one source of methane emissions is natural
gas and petroleum systems.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.860
You don’t get that methane when you burn
junk, and as a bonus, you don’t have to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.870
burn as much natural gas or coal.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.900
Double win.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.980
Flaming heaps of trash isn’t as totally
glamorous as I’m making it sound though.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.879
Like anything, it has it’s own foibles.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.960
It cuts down on greenhouse gasses but the
tradeoff is it puts other pollutants into

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960
the air.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.510
Sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, is
released, along with trace amounts of mercury

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.850
compounds and dioxins which are highly toxic
and build up in fatty tissue.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.500
Concerns over these chemicals are the main
hindrance to adoption in the US, along with

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.579
nobody wanting a trash burning facility in
their backyard when there’s lots of cheap

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.579
land.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.930
Sweden strictly regulates all these toxic
byproducts, and even so plant representatives

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.900
say their scrubbers reduce toxic chemical
levels to half the legal limits.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.140
Some of these byproducts would still be present
in landfills too, only then they’d have

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.909
the potential to seep into groundwater if
the landfills aren’t equipped with a protective

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:49.909
lining.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.140
Environmentalists who oppose burning trash
argue that the goal should be to reduce how

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.510
much waste we make in the first place and
recycle more, and they’re absolutely right.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.040
But there’s no evidence that burning waste
will hurt recycling efforts.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.459
Sweden is expecting to step up recycling to
from 50 to 60% in the coming years, and they’re

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.180
only burning what they can’t use.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.359
Even though the US buries most of our trash,
we only recycle 34% of it.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.019
So even though it’s not glamorous and not
the cure-all for our refuse and energy woes,

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.260
it looks like burning trash could actually
be an important stopgap for climate change

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.610
if it were more widespread.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.230
Egypt deals with its junk in a rather unusual
and interesting way.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.860
Lisette and the team at our sister channel,
Seeker, cover that right here.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:41.060
Where do you fall on the burning trash issue?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.060
For it?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.060
Hate it?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.730
Have some reservations about it after Toy
Story 3?
