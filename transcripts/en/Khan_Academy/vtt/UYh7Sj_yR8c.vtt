00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.590
- [Voiceover] So we have a
rectangle right over here.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.550
Let's say that we know that its area is

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.220
42x times y to the third.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.190
So that is the area of the rectangle.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.490
And we also know that the
height right over here

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.590
is 14xy and what we
want to do in this video

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.890
is figure out what the
length is going to be.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.610
And as you can imagine, it's going to be

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.990
in algebraic terms.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.950
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.850
and figure out what is
the length going to be

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.520
if this height is 14xy and the area is

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.500
42xy to the third.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.250
Well, how do you figure out area?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.760
You take your length, and
I'll just use L for length.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.390
I'll put L in parentheses.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.920
So you take your length
and you multiply it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.750
times your height.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.890
So let's multiply it times

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.000
14xy

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.320
and that's going to give you your area.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290
So that's going to give us our area

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.080
of 42xy to the third power.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.520
So how do we solve for our length?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.590
Well, we can just divide
both sides by 14xy.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.850
So let's do that.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550
So, let's divide the left-hand side

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.182
and the right-hand side

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:13.120
by 14xy,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.650
14xy.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.720
Now on the left-hand
side, I'm multiplying by

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.220
14xy and dividing by 14xy,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.950
that's the same thing as just
multiplying or dividing by one

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.390
so that cancels out.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.290
So I'm just left with L or our length

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.050
which is the whole point of
dividing both sides by 14xy.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.620
And on the right-hand side, I can look

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.220
at the coefficients first.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.182
I could say 42 divided by 14,

00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:40.270
and that's going to be three.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.650
Three, and then I could say

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.920
well, x divided by x that's
just going to be one,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.470
and then I have y to
the third divided by y.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.150
y to the third divided
by y, that is going to be

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.660
y to the third divided by
y is going to be y-squared.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.550
And then we're done.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.650
Our length is three y-squared.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.590
So our length is equal to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.132
three y-squared.
