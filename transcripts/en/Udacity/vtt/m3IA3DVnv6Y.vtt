Hi.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.580
I'm Pete LePage,
a developer advocate at Google.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.150
&gt;&gt; And I'm Cameron Pittman,
a front end course developer at Udacity.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.770
We're here to help you create
websites that look and

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.110
feel great, no matter the device.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.640
&gt;&gt; In this course, you'll be learning
basic guidelines, that make sites look

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.660
great across the dozens of
different devices in use today.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt; So Pete you're the expert.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.410
What are websites like Google News
doing to look so good on every device?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.680
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.020
Google news uses two
different strategies.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.920
A fully responsive version for
phones and tablet's.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.780
And for desktops it uses a responsive
layout that starts at a minimum size.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.770
That works well for

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.520
them, but adds a layer of complexity and
extra work to keep things up to date.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.300
&gt;&gt; Hm, that's interesting.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.650
Right, I know there are a lot of
different ways to accomplish good,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.120
responsive design.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.220
What about websites like Skinny Ties?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Skinny Ties was fully
responsive across all devices,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.290
laptops and desktops.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.440
This is my preferred
way of building sites,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.400
because it means no matter what
device the user's on now, or

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.600
in the future,
my site's probably going to work well.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.500
&gt;&gt; Nice.
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.270
&gt;&gt; Great, then let's get started.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.770
&gt;&gt; Cool.
