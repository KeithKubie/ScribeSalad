00:00:00.453 --> 00:00:04.910
In the figure above, triangle
ABC is inscribed in the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.919
circle with center O and diameter AC.

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.298
So AC is the diameter right over there.

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:16.298
If AB is equal to AO,
so this is equal to that

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.050
right over there, AO is the radius so AB

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.092
is the same length of
the radius, what is the

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:27.888
degree measure of angle ABO?

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:30.175
So the main realization here is that

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:33.309
this length right over here,
AO, the length of segment AO,

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.095
that's a radius so this is
a radius right over here.

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.790
It goes from the center of the circle

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.387
to the circle itself, to point A.

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:45.926
Well this is also a radius of a circle.

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:48.976
This is going to have the same length.

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:50.973
They already told us that
AB has the same length

00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:55.253
as AO which, because AO
is a radius and OB is also

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:58.816
a radius, it's going to have
the same length as OB or BO.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:00.477
And so then what do we have?

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.369
We have an equilateral triangle.

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.551
What do we know about
an equilateral triangle?

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.570
All of the sides have
the same length, but also

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.593
all of these interior angles are

00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:11.083
going to have the same measures.

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:13.846
So that angle is equal to
that is equal to that angle

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:16.051
and all three of them,
because they have to add up

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.883
to 180 degrees, and you
have three equal angles

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:20.672
adding up to 180 degrees, each of these

00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:25.215
have to be 60 degree angles.

00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:29.875
So angle ABO, which is the
one they're asking about,

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:33.810
is going to be a 60 degree angle.
