00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:08.316
And I'm not going by myself.

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:09.576
I'm about to meet up with a friend

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.988
who is just as passionate and
obsessed with food as I am.

00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:14.288
I'm excited to meet him.

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:15.952
And we're gonna take
you on a Thai food tour

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:19.694
where we're gonna eat all four
of the major Thai cuisines

00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:20.873
in one single day.

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:22.293
We'll be eating Southern Thai food.

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:23.635
We'll be eating Isaan food

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:25.873
from the Northeastern region of Thailand.

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:27.599
We'll be eating Northern Thai food,

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.160
and then finally, we'll be
eating Central Thai food.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.430
So stay tuned for this
ultimate day of Thai food

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.054
that you're not gonna wanna miss.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:38.387
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.324
Hey, hey, hey.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:42.281
- Go for it, man.
- Good morning.

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:43.663
- [Mark] Good morning.

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:44.496
- What's up?

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:45.329
- [Mark] What's up?

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.162
- Good morning, Ting Ting.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:47.023
- Good morning.
Good morning.

00:00:47.023 --> 00:00:47.856
- Good morning.

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:49.141
- [Mark] Guys, this is Trevor
James, the Food Ranger.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.300
- I am so excited to be here right now.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500
I can't believe it (chuckles).

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.288
- And we've got Ting Ting in the back.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.237
- Hello.
- We've got Ying in the back,

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:59.165
and Micah, who is probably
sleeping back there.

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:02.461
You just have one single day in Bangkok.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.007
This is gonna be a Thai food tour

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:05.636
that you're not gonna wanna miss.

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:08.969
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.712
And so if you go to a,

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:18.113
just a random Thai restaurant...

00:01:18.113 --> 00:01:18.946
- Yeah?

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.427
- They may have a mix of different dishes.

00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:23.313
But if you really get into
the regional variations

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:26.651
of Thai cuisine, that's
when you start to get some

00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:30.018
really impressively good taste dishes

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:31.483
and tastes and local flavors.

00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:34.039
- So we're going really
specific to try it all today?

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.872
- [Mark] Yes.

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:35.705
- [Trevor] Awesome.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:37.232
- Micah is just loving this morning walk

00:01:37.232 --> 00:01:38.899
through the market.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:42.396
He's actually woken up for the occasion

00:01:42.396 --> 00:01:45.040
for the first time, and
he is looking around.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.112
We're on our way to the
Southern Thai food restaurant.

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:48.168
That's gonna be our first stop,

00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:50.807
so we're gonna have Southern
Thai food for breakfast.

00:01:50.807 --> 00:01:53.290
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.810
Yeah, fried fish, fish curry,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.731
and as you move down the buffet line

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:00.315
of more and more curries and soups.

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:01.148
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:02.787
- [Mark] So this restaurant
is called Ruam Tai,

00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:04.696
and this is a Southern Thai restaurant

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:06.522
I've been coming to for many years.

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:07.499
I think they ...

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.287
Yeah, this is one of
the best places to come

00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:10.589
if you love Southern Thai food

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.947
and to get an authentic
taste of Southern Thai food.

00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:15.470
I think they make about 50
different dishes every day.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.728
- There is a lot here.

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:18.598
- And they're all prepared
early in the morning.

00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:23.259
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.413
This is gaeng som with
(speaking in foreign language),

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:27.444
which is taro stems.

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:28.277
- [Trevor] Taro stems?

00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:29.110
- [Mark] Taro stems.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.984
(speaking in foreign language),

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.287
another staple Southern Thai dish.

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:34.590
- [Trevor] That has gotta be (mumbles)

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.647
- [Mark] The hardest thing about eating

00:02:35.647 --> 00:02:38.202
at a restaurant like this
is holding yourself back.

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.035
(Trevor laughs)

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:39.868
for ordering everything.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.844
- [Trevor] Yeah you want
it all, right? (chuckles)

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:43.955
- So I ordered up a full spectrum

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.201
of very, very typical Thai dishes.

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:47.748
- Okay.

00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:49.415
- We've got some gaeng tai pla here,

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:52.582
which is fish entrails,
fermented curry with-

00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:53.598
- Entrails?

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:55.509
- Yeah, it's got the viscera,

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.686
the inside of the fish.

00:02:56.686 --> 00:02:57.983
- Okay.

00:02:57.983 --> 00:02:58.929
- Kind of the fish guts.

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.040
And then the other really
key Southern Thai dish

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.225
is called gaeng som,
which is a sour curry.

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.462
And then yeah, you could
just point and choose

00:03:07.462 --> 00:03:08.560
to whatever you like.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.021
And then a big fish.

00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:10.854
- [Trevor] Yup.

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:11.730
- [Mark] This is a salted fish,

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.840
which has then been deep fried.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.064
- [Trevor] Amazing.

00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:16.242
- Chilies and shallots.

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:17.097
- Shall we dig in?

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:17.930
- Yes, man.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.763
- [Trevor] Okay.

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:19.816
- [Mark] What do you
wanna start with first?

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:21.321
- [Trevor] I really wanna
try the fish entrails here.

00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:22.159
- [Mark] All right, let's go, yeah.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.380
- [Trevor] What else is in here?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.491
- [Mark] Those are chunks of bamboo shoot,

00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:27.075
and then there is long beets in there.

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:27.930
- [Trevor] Oh.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.111
Let's cheers then.

00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.444
- All right (chuckles).

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:35.397
- Mmm.

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:36.277
Good.
(Mark chuckles)

00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:37.110
Good.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.301
Oh.

00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:41.000
- That flavor, man.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.917
- That is an explosion.

00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:47.049
- [Mark] It's so pungent but like yeah,

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.001
so like wonderful...

00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:50.588
There is such a wonderful powerful flavor.

00:03:50.588 --> 00:03:52.585
- [Trevor] That fermented fish flavor

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.553
is so strong and powerful.

00:03:54.553 --> 00:03:56.405
- [Mark] Oh you can see
just like oils and juices

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:57.604
squeezing out.
- Oh.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:58.548
- [Trevor] Yeah (chuckles).

00:03:58.548 --> 00:03:59.548
Oh you can.

00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:01.556
- [Mark] So we should
just taste a little piece

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:03.186
with some chilies and
some shallots all in one.

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:05.436
- [Trevor] Yeah, good idea.

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.354
Mm.

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:08.187
- Oh yeah.

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:09.433
- Oh.

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:10.266
- Mm.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:11.099
(Trevor chuckles)

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.932
- Oh, that's amazing.

00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:15.073
I was expecting it to be more salty,

00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:16.293
but it's not too salty.

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:17.126
It's perfect.

00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:20.318
- That citrus flavor really
mixes well with the chilies.

00:04:20.318 --> 00:04:22.433
- [Mark] This dish is called kua kling,

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.673
which is the dry curry.

00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:25.696
- [Trevor] Mm.

00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:29.790
- [Mark] This on top here are
shredded kaffir lime leaves.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.623
- Oh yeah.

00:04:30.623 --> 00:04:32.177
- That chili and that curry paste

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:34.416
then with that fresh lime zesty flavor.

00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:35.650
Oh Micah.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.359
Micah is looking up at
us eating (chuckles).

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:38.867
- Hi, Micah.

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:39.700
Is he hungry?

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.654
- He is smiling at Trevor.

00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:44.591
Uncle Trevor and Dad are eating
some awesome food, Micah.

00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:46.585
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:49.023
One day, he will feast.

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:49.856
- [Mark] I think he can smell

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:54.023
that fermented fish curry
right there (chuckles).

00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:56.419
- Oh!

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.104
Oh! (chuckles)

00:04:59.104 --> 00:05:00.862
- Yeah, dude.

00:05:00.862 --> 00:05:01.914
- Oh, it's pasty.

00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:02.972
- The chalkiness.

00:05:02.972 --> 00:05:05.333
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:06.166
- [Ying] Yup.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:08.544
- These are cashew nut leaves.

00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:09.377
- Oh wow.

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:11.384
- Cashew fruit leaves.

00:05:11.384 --> 00:05:12.928
- [Trevor] Never tasted
anything like that.

00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:14.576
- [Mark] These are taro stems.

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:17.207
- [Trevor] Taro stems.

00:05:17.207 --> 00:05:18.873
Oh.

00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:19.706
(chuckles)

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:20.539
- Oh.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:21.372
- The taro...

00:05:21.372 --> 00:05:22.205
- They're like...

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:23.038
- There's that...

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:25.308
- Sponges, they're like sponges but crisp.

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:29.351
And another dish that we
absolutely have to try is this,

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.191
in Thai, it's called gaeng kee lek.

00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:33.710
I believe they're cassia leaves.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.543
Mmm.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.580
- Now that is creamy.

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:40.895
The leaves have a bitter taste though

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:42.872
but in a really good way.

00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:45.028
- And then just wrapped
up in that coconut milk.

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:46.694
- [Trevor] So spicy, everything is just,

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:48.200
your mouth feels alive.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.192
- I don't think you can get any better

00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:51.494
than Southern Thai food for breakfast.

00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:52.549
- Oh.

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:53.765
No (chuckles).

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:54.738
What flavor.

00:05:54.738 --> 00:05:55.571
- [Mark] What a way to start the day, man.

00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:56.738
- [Trevor] Mm.

00:05:57.597 --> 00:06:00.116
- Micah just had a huge meal,

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:02.680
and Trevor and I are
still eating this meal.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.513
- Yeah (chuckles).

00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:04.599
- [Mark] Food is absolutely amazing.

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:05.455
- [Trevor] Incredible.

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:07.324
- So if you're looking for
authentic Southern Thai food

00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:08.911
when you come to Bangkok,

00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:10.213
this is a great restaurant to come to.

00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:14.130
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:18.271
- That was so amazing, that flavor.

00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:19.853
- Oh man, I'm feeling fantastic.

00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:20.832
- Yeah.

00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:23.351
- We're walking back
through Wang Lang Market,

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:25.830
and there's just an oversupply

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.275
- Wow.
of every kind of Thai snack

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:28.597
that you would wanna eat in this market.

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:30.669
- So many things to try.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:31.968
- I'm loving hanging out with Trevor.

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:33.798
Trevor is enthusiastic about food.

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:35.048
He loves to eat

00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:38.886
and it's so much fun to eat with him.

00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:41.219
There is a dessert up ahead,

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:43.519
which is called khanom tungtaek,

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.405
which is very famous
popular at Wang Lang Market.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:49.252
So I'm gonna go stop there and buy some,

00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:51.571
and then Trevor and I
will taste that next.

00:06:51.571 --> 00:06:55.488
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:04.814
- [Trevor] What do we have here?

00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:07.247
- [Mark] That is called khanom tungtaek,

00:07:07.247 --> 00:07:09.358
and Ying already bought us some.

00:07:09.358 --> 00:07:10.191
- [Trevor] Oh.

00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.024
- [Mark] So she bought us some.

00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:11.961
They're kind of like waffles.

00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:13.016
- [Trevor] Oh, okay.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.906
- [Mark] They put the batter
into these little molds.

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:16.739
- [Trevor] Yup.

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:17.572
- [Mark] And then they fill them

00:07:17.572 --> 00:07:19.525
with a variety of different fillings.

00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:20.987
One of them is coconut.

00:07:20.987 --> 00:07:22.696
One of them is called foi thong,

00:07:22.696 --> 00:07:23.955
which is the,

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:25.542
it's an egg yolk candy which she is

00:07:25.542 --> 00:07:26.592
- [Trevor] Oh nice.
fishing out over there.

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:27.609
- [Mark] You love egg yolk candy?

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:28.442
- [Trevor] Yup.

00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:30.791
- [Mark] And then there's
cream in there, there's sugar.

00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:31.925
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:33.105
(all laugh)

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:34.373
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:35.226
(Trevor laughs)

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:38.115
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:38.948
- Mm.

00:07:38.948 --> 00:07:39.781
- Yeah.

00:07:40.673 --> 00:07:43.717
- [Trevor] I could really eat some sweet.

00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:45.383
- [Mark] It's all just sweet.

00:07:45.383 --> 00:07:48.309
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:49.857
You could just spend a day
in here just eating, dude.

00:07:49.857 --> 00:07:51.076
There is so much.

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:52.455
But we gotta move on.

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:53.877
That was a lot of fun anyways,

00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:56.077
eating that khanom tungtaek, right?

00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:58.273
- [Trevor] That was so sweet.

00:07:58.273 --> 00:07:59.106
- [Mark] Did you like that?

00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:00.916
- [Trevor] And fluffy,
oh yeah, it was great.

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:04.249
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:08:07.616 --> 00:08:09.297
- We're now in an area called Sathorn,

00:08:09.297 --> 00:08:13.031
which is the central
business district of Bangkok,

00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:15.835
and we're gonna eat at what is

00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:18.604
I think one of the best
Isaan restaurants in Bangkok.

00:08:18.604 --> 00:08:20.677
We made it to Silom,

00:08:20.677 --> 00:08:23.359
right at the peak of lunch rush,

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:24.632
so it's busy, man.
- Busy.

00:08:24.632 --> 00:08:25.465
- A lot of people.

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:26.298
- Yes.

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.815
(upbeat music)

00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:29.749
It's a famous new building.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:30.644
- [Trevor] Oh wow.

00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:33.085
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:34.221
- [Mark] Oh wow,

00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:36.254
they had redone their dining room

00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.366
since I was here last time.

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:42.283
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:46.225
I think that's our catfish
we're ordering there.

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:49.951
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:54.602
- [Mark] Okay, it's laab
made with minced catfish.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.350
And then you wanna watch her
as she mixes up the salad.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.183
- [Trevor] Yeah.

00:08:57.183 --> 00:08:58.626
- [Mark] Then she adds in...

00:08:58.626 --> 00:08:59.965
- [Trevor] Oh yeah.

00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:00.798
- [Mark] Juices.

00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:01.631
That is khao khua,

00:09:01.631 --> 00:09:05.631
which is the roasted
toasted sticky rice powder,

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:07.853
- Nice.
fish sauce,

00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:08.991
lime juice.

00:09:08.991 --> 00:09:10.413
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:11.835
(Mark chuckles)

00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:12.729
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:15.087
Oh, that's where it gets all the flavor.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.163
- [Mark] That's all the dressing mix.

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:17.496
- [Trevor] Yeah.

00:09:18.438 --> 00:09:19.271
Mmm.

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:23.000
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.258
- [Mark] All right.

00:09:24.258 --> 00:09:25.091
- [Trevor] Mmm.

00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:29.008
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:33.331
- This restaurant is
called Som Tam Jay So,

00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.850
Som Tam, and it's right in Silom,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.882
and what I love about
this restaurant is that

00:09:38.882 --> 00:09:40.467
the taste of the papaya salads,

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:43.837
they taste exactly like you
would get them in Isaan.

00:09:43.837 --> 00:09:44.670
- Really?

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.316
- [Mark] So that it's the authentic taste.

00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:47.939
You can get it right here in Bangkok.

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:48.772
- [Trevor] Cheers.

00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:49.670
- Cheers seems like the right thing to do

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.893
with this overflowing sticky rice.

00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:52.395
- Yeah, look at that.

00:09:52.395 --> 00:09:53.249
- [Mark] But the common thing to do

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:54.508
is grab a ball of sticky rice

00:09:54.508 --> 00:09:55.932
and you can kind of ball
it up with your fingers.

00:09:55.932 --> 00:09:56.765
- Okay.

00:09:56.765 --> 00:09:58.126
- And then you can dip it into the,

00:09:58.126 --> 00:09:59.265
especially the dressings.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.098
- Okay.

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:01.500
- So if we start with this salad,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.558
this one is tam boo ba la,

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:05.725
which is the fermented fish with crab.

00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:08.173
- Mmm.

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:10.122
Oh (chuckles).

00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:10.955
- Yeah.

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:11.994
- Oh.

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:13.640
- Oh, that is fermented.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.021
- Fermented.

00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:15.997
It's got a kick to it.

00:10:15.997 --> 00:10:17.177
- [Mark] And there's a
fermented crab in here.

00:10:17.177 --> 00:10:18.314
There's the fermented fish sauce.

00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:19.701
There's dried chilies in here,

00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:21.529
all of the green papaya.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:22.446
These are,

00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:25.594
in Thai, they are called
(speaking in foreign language).

00:10:25.594 --> 00:10:27.266
They're kind of like mini stink beans.

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:29.253
(both laugh)

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:30.086
Okay.

00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:30.919
- Okay.

00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:35.751
- Mmm.

00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:37.256
- Totally.

00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:38.089
(Trevor chuckles)

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:39.081
- Dude.

00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:40.788
(Trevor chuckles)

00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:42.481
That amount of flavor, man.

00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:43.314
- Oh.

00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:47.111
There is some definite odor

00:10:47.111 --> 00:10:48.313
to those seeds in there.
- Oh yeah.

00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:49.979
What I love about it is
it is such a strong flavor

00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:51.198
but at the same time, it's so balanced.

00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:52.031
- Ooh!

00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:53.040
- It's sour-
- And it burns.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.545
- It's spicy.

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:55.462
It's fishy.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:57.841
Something I was gonna tell you

00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:59.765
that is pretty cool about this restaurant,

00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:02.042
especially the auntie making som tam,

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:02.875
the auntie pounding.

00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:03.708
- [Trevor] Yup.

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:04.541
- [Mark] You could actually see

00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:05.582
that she's wearing safety goggles.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.559
- [Trevor] Really? (chuckles)

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:09.805
- [Mark] Because she pounds
with that mortar so hard

00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:11.350
that chili seeds can come flying up.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.183
- [Trevor] Mmm.

00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:13.016
- And I believe that's why she's wearing

00:11:13.016 --> 00:11:14.521
the safety goggles,

00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:15.843
which I think is just cool.

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:18.202
So you gotta wear safety
goggles for doing construction

00:11:18.202 --> 00:11:20.890
and for, like, welding and things

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.367
and also when you're making some serious,

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:25.443
some seriously spicy som tam.

00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:26.276
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:27.802
It's like a wave.

00:11:27.802 --> 00:11:30.162
It starts off slow and then you got this

00:11:30.162 --> 00:11:32.514
incredibly spicy peak
- It builds.

00:11:32.514 --> 00:11:33.347
and then slowly...
- It builds a little bit

00:11:33.347 --> 00:11:34.180
right?

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.013
- [Trevor] Cool down.

00:11:35.013 --> 00:11:35.846
- [Mark] Yeah, man.

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:38.098
This one is a laab made with catfish.

00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:38.931
Ooh!

00:11:41.427 --> 00:11:43.130
Well, this is one of the
best versions of laab.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.551
- [Trevor] Man, I'm burning.

00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:45.384
- Mm-hmm.

00:11:45.384 --> 00:11:46.634
- That is, wow!

00:11:47.719 --> 00:11:49.322
That is real flavor here
(Mark laughs)

00:11:49.322 --> 00:11:50.380
(Trevor chuckles)

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.213
- [Mark] Yup.

00:11:51.213 --> 00:11:52.171
- [Trevor] My eyes are watering.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.148
- Teardrop coming down.

00:11:53.148 --> 00:11:55.059
- I'm crying, it's so good.

00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:56.280
- Yup, tears of joy.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.032
Another type of green
papaya salad that we got

00:11:58.032 --> 00:11:59.583
is called tam pa,

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:03.037
and in Thai, it directly
translates to jungle salad.

00:12:03.037 --> 00:12:03.870
- [Trevor] Jungle.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.285
- Jungle-pounded salad.

00:12:06.285 --> 00:12:08.153
So this includes fermented fish sauce.

00:12:08.153 --> 00:12:10.272
It includes crab.

00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:13.036
There are some kind of like
cherry snails in there.

00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:13.869
- [Trevor] Mmm.

00:12:13.869 --> 00:12:14.702
- [Mark] There are tomatoes in there,

00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:17.109
lots of dried chilies and limes

00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:19.066
and then the white popinac seeds.

00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:19.959
There is also the khanom jeen,

00:12:19.959 --> 00:12:21.624
the white rice noodles in here as well.

00:12:21.624 --> 00:12:23.047
- Oh great.

00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:25.612
You can see this little piece right here.

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:26.445
- Yeah.

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.584
- That's one of the snail type of things.

00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:29.417
- Oh nice.

00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:32.021
- Yeah.
- Oh there, I got one.

00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:32.875
- Oh yeah.

00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:34.417
- Oh yeah.

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:35.634
- Oh, a hanging noodle.

00:12:35.634 --> 00:12:38.467
(Trevor chuckles)

00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:40.971
- Mmm.

00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:43.609
- Mmm.

00:12:45.053 --> 00:12:47.412
Just flavor overload.

00:12:47.412 --> 00:12:48.266
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:49.524
- [Mark] One of the most powerful salads

00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:50.707
you could possibly eat.

00:12:50.707 --> 00:12:51.540
Man, it's good.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.373
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:55.222
I have never tasted
anything like that before.

00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:57.131
I think I had a few
tears coming out there.

00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:58.192
- [Mark] Yes, man.

00:12:58.192 --> 00:12:59.025
Yup, all right,

00:12:59.025 --> 00:12:59.858
cheers, man.
- Cool down with some chicken.

00:12:59.858 --> 00:13:00.691
- Chicken wing time.

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:01.524
- Yeah.

00:13:02.721 --> 00:13:03.554
Mmm.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:05.867
Mmm.

00:13:05.867 --> 00:13:06.700
- I got a bone with that.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.897
- Me too (chuckles).

00:13:07.897 --> 00:13:08.730
- It's so soft.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.563
- Yeah.

00:13:09.563 --> 00:13:10.541
- [Mark] This is the
chicken dipping sauce here.

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:11.679
It might be a little bit sweet,

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:14.606
and it might be like tamarind that...

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:15.543
So this is like a tamarind-

00:13:15.543 --> 00:13:17.130
- [Trevor] Sweet tamarind sauce?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:17.963
- [Mark] I think so.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:18.959
- [Trevor] Okay, let's try it.

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:22.739
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:23.572
- [Trevor] Mmm.

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:24.405
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:25.238
- [Trevor] Oh.

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:26.071
- [Mark] Yeah, they're really good.

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:27.141
- [Trevor] Oh yeah, a little sour,

00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:28.321
almost kind of fruity too.

00:13:28.321 --> 00:13:29.154
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:30.720
Auntie has invited us to sit down with her

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.749
for a little bit and...

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:32.582
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:32.582 --> 00:13:33.415
We have a (speaking in foreign language)

00:13:33.415 --> 00:13:34.478
which is roasted fish.

00:13:34.478 --> 00:13:38.395
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:42.016
- Yup.

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:44.045
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:45.264
Mmm.

00:13:45.264 --> 00:13:46.097
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:46.930
Oh.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.763
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:47.763 --> 00:13:48.596
Wow!

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:50.995
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:52.075
All right.

00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:52.908
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:52.908 --> 00:13:53.741
All right.

00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:55.255
- [Mark] You take some cabbage

00:13:55.255 --> 00:13:57.820
and then you can dip it into the

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.024
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:01.857
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:14:01.857 --> 00:14:03.294
- This is a catfish dip.

00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:04.877
- Catfish dip?
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:06.582
(Auntie chuckles)

00:14:06.582 --> 00:14:10.499
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:14.643
I could really taste galangal in there.

00:14:14.643 --> 00:14:15.476
- Yeah.

00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:17.885
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:18.739
All right.

00:14:18.739 --> 00:14:22.572
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:26.739
- [Mark] She says to add
a lot of the chili sauce.

00:14:27.806 --> 00:14:28.639
Mmm.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.555
- That good?

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:33.722
(Mark speaking in foreign language)

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:35.992
- [Mark] Trevor, what did
you think of that food, man?

00:14:35.992 --> 00:14:39.775
- Wow, what an intense
array of flavors and colors,

00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:40.710
totally blew me away,

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.104
and then a nice surprise treat at the end.

00:14:43.104 --> 00:14:43.937
- Oh yeah.

00:14:43.937 --> 00:14:44.770
- Oh yeah.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.603
- They are so nice.

00:14:45.603 --> 00:14:46.436
- Yeah (chuckles).

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:50.083
- I always leave that restaurant
so happy and so satisfied.

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:52.563
Next, we are going to
eat Northern Thai food.

00:14:52.563 --> 00:14:53.396
- Northern.

00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:56.915
- Lanna food from the
Northern region of Thailand.

00:14:56.915 --> 00:14:59.677
Northern Thai food is the hardest type

00:14:59.677 --> 00:15:02.763
of regional food to find in Bangkok.

00:15:02.763 --> 00:15:04.832
It's very underrepresented.

00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:07.238
So there are some good
restaurants, but we wanted more

00:15:07.238 --> 00:15:09.271
of a, like a street food scene,

00:15:09.271 --> 00:15:11.179
so we decided we're
heading over to a market

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:13.531
called Or Tor Kor Market,
and we'll find a stall

00:15:13.531 --> 00:15:16.902
that has all sorts of
authentic Northern Thai dishes.

00:15:16.902 --> 00:15:17.878
- [Trevor] What a great day.

00:15:17.878 --> 00:15:20.481
- Ying, should we buy Micah
some of those baby wipes?

00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:23.448
Maybe he'll grow a beard
like that (chuckles).

00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:26.537
Micah, we just arrived at the market.

00:15:26.537 --> 00:15:28.077
We just made it to the market.

00:15:28.077 --> 00:15:30.965
Oh, you're sleeping so peacefully now.

00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:34.986
This is one of Bangkok's
ultimate foodie paradises.

00:15:34.986 --> 00:15:36.105
There is so much food here.
- Wow,

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:37.976
there's a lot here.

00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:38.809
So much.

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:40.556
- [Mark] This is
considered one of Bangkok's

00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:41.776
gourmet food markets.

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:42.609
- [Trevor] Really?

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.626
- So it's a lot of good quality food,

00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:47.677
but also, you'll find all
sorts of regional Thai food

00:15:47.677 --> 00:15:50.112
as well as Thai ingredients.

00:15:50.112 --> 00:15:51.453
- [Trevor] What are we trying here?

00:15:51.453 --> 00:15:54.377
- [Mark] So she just told
me this is a nam prik,

00:15:54.377 --> 00:15:57.336
which is a chili dip made with crab eggs.

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:58.517
So I think it's the crab roe.

00:15:58.517 --> 00:15:59.350
- [Trevor] -Okay.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.468
- And normally, you just take
any kind of raw vegetables,

00:16:00.468 --> 00:16:02.703
dip it in, and eat it.

00:16:02.703 --> 00:16:03.883
- [Trevor] All into this.

00:16:03.883 --> 00:16:05.026
- [Mark] See the yellowness from that?

00:16:05.026 --> 00:16:05.859
- [Trevor] Oh yeah, look.

00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.692
Oh, it's like a spoon.

00:16:10.317 --> 00:16:11.997
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

00:16:11.997 --> 00:16:13.587
Oh!

00:16:13.587 --> 00:16:14.420
Oh yeah.

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:16.739
Wow!

00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:18.258
- She's smiling back there.

00:16:18.258 --> 00:16:21.448
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:22.464
Really, really refreshing.

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:23.297
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:16:23.297 --> 00:16:24.130
- [Mark] Mm-hmm.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.203
- [Trevor] That roe.

00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:26.056
- [Mark] Mm-hmm.

00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:28.784
- Is just actually quite creamy.

00:16:28.784 --> 00:16:29.639
- It's almost like egg yolk.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:30.472
- Yeah.

00:16:30.472 --> 00:16:31.751
- [Mark] Here's a Northern
Thai food stall right here.

00:16:31.751 --> 00:16:33.179
- [Trevor] Awesome, so we found it.

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:36.097
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:36.097 --> 00:16:38.002
- All sorts of different
Northern Thai dishes.

00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:38.835
- Wow.

00:16:38.835 --> 00:16:42.327
- And (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:42.327 --> 00:16:44.649
- [Trevor] Wow, this looks totally unique.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:45.710
Is that pork?

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.208
- [Seller] Pork, yes (speaking
in foreign language).

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.041
- [Mark] Pork belly.

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:50.874
- [Trevor] Are we getting these?

00:16:50.874 --> 00:16:52.305
- [Mark] Yeah, these
are a type of mushroom.

00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:53.402
- [Trevor] Oh nice.

00:16:53.402 --> 00:16:55.677
- [Mark] This stall is
mostly just for takeaway,

00:16:55.677 --> 00:16:58.322
and so she has plastic...

00:16:58.322 --> 00:17:00.194
She has paper bowls but no spoons,

00:17:00.194 --> 00:17:01.415
so I'm gonna go to the food court area

00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:02.594
to try to get some spoons,

00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:04.545
and then Trevor and I
are gonna eat right here.

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:05.482
Hold on, man.

00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:08.571
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:10.888
- All right, there we go.

00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:12.314
We got two different dishes.

00:17:12.314 --> 00:17:14.225
One of them is gaeng hang lay.

00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:15.657
Since the spoons are in this curry,

00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:16.914
we may as well start with it.

00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:18.214
Oh, look at that, oh, let me help you.

00:17:18.214 --> 00:17:19.068
- Oh, look at that (chuckles).

00:17:19.068 --> 00:17:20.464
- Oh that-
- It's just gonna fall.

00:17:20.464 --> 00:17:21.297
- It's just oozing.

00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:22.376
- [Trevor] Oh.

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:23.514
Oh, there it is.

00:17:23.514 --> 00:17:24.347
- Mm.

00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:26.255
- Oh yeah.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.066
- Oh that's really good.

00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:29.526
- Oh.

00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:30.359
- Mm.

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:32.815
- Oh, it tastes like
sweet caramelized onions.

00:17:32.815 --> 00:17:33.791
- And the ginger there.

00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:34.646
- Oh yeah.

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:35.479
- Mm.

00:17:35.479 --> 00:17:37.903
The other one we got is a dish
called gaeng kua hed fang.

00:17:37.903 --> 00:17:38.736
- [Trevor] Okay.

00:17:38.736 --> 00:17:40.663
- [Mark] And it's a mushroom curry.

00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:41.496
- [Trevor] Mushroom?

00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:42.329
- Yeah.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:44.121
They look kinda like river rocks.

00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:46.069
- [Trevor] Yeah, they look
like little blueberries.

00:17:46.069 --> 00:17:48.548
- [Mark] Yeah, like
odd-shaped blueberries.

00:17:48.548 --> 00:17:49.767
- [Trevor] Yeah (chuckles).

00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:50.947
- Mm.

00:17:50.947 --> 00:17:51.780
- Oh.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.102
- Oh, they pop.

00:17:53.102 --> 00:17:55.136
- Oh, they're really, really crisp.

00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:58.228
- Yeah, and they just pop,
like a cherry tomato almost.

00:17:58.228 --> 00:17:59.061
- [Mark] Mmm.

00:17:59.061 --> 00:17:59.894
- [Trevor] That's so nice.

00:17:59.894 --> 00:18:00.727
- [Mark] Mm-hmm.

00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:01.610
- [Trevor] I gotta say this is just...

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.443
- [Mark] Deliciousness.

00:18:02.443 --> 00:18:03.766
- [Trevor] Deliciousness.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:04.619
This is where...

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:05.836
- [Mark] Whole flavor.

00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:09.109
- [Trevor] This is where
dreams are made of.

00:18:09.109 --> 00:18:12.031
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:14.143
- That was really good,
especially that gaeng hang lay.

00:18:14.143 --> 00:18:18.060
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.752
We had the gaeng hang lay,
but I really wanted...

00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:28.337
Well, Trevor and I needed to try

00:18:28.337 --> 00:18:30.732
some Northern Thai sausage,
which is called sai ua la,

00:18:30.732 --> 00:18:33.092
which is another absolute

00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:35.328
must-eat Northern Thai dish.

00:18:35.328 --> 00:18:37.140
There's lemongrass in here.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.407
There's galangal and garlic.

00:18:38.407 --> 00:18:39.240
- [Trevor] Oh!

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.073
- [Mark] Yeah, and chilies.

00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:42.772
And it's a-
- That sounds fun.

00:18:42.772 --> 00:18:44.077
- [Mark] It's a heavy herb sausage.

00:18:44.077 --> 00:18:45.864
(rhythmic music)

00:18:45.864 --> 00:18:47.202
- Mmm.

00:18:47.202 --> 00:18:48.035
- Oh yeah.

00:18:49.318 --> 00:18:50.680
Mmm.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.778
- You can really taste the lemongrass.

00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:52.930
Now we're gonna try the nam prik noom,

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.718
which is the green chili dip.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:55.939
Fried pork skin,

00:18:55.939 --> 00:18:57.687
scoop it up.

00:18:57.687 --> 00:18:58.520
Oh.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.353
- Ooh.

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.185
Mm.
- Oh yeah.

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.018
Oh that's...

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:06.313
- Oh, it's very thick.

00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:07.497
- Oh, it's a mouthful though.

00:19:07.497 --> 00:19:08.349
- Mm-hmm.

00:19:08.349 --> 00:19:10.053
- It's a mouthful of flavor.

00:19:10.053 --> 00:19:10.886
- Mmm.

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:13.875
- So to complete this
ultimate Thai food day,

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:16.154
we still need to eat Central Thai food.

00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:17.494
And so the situation right now,

00:19:17.494 --> 00:19:20.604
it's exactly 5:40 p.m.
- Yup.

00:19:20.604 --> 00:19:21.943
We've been eating all day long.

00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:23.773
- We've been out since 7 a.m.

00:19:23.773 --> 00:19:24.606
- Since 7 a.m.

00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:25.439
- Yeah (chuckles).

00:19:25.439 --> 00:19:26.272
- Eating.

00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:27.105
- Eating.

00:19:27.105 --> 00:19:28.438
- And then driving places.

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:31.690
There is one of the absolute best places

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.765
in Bangkok to eat tom yum goong.

00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:34.598
- [Trevor] Ooh.

00:19:34.598 --> 00:19:36.470
- [Mark] Which is a Central Thai soup

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.420
and one of the most famous Thai dishes.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.227
And yeah, this one of
the absolute best places.

00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:44.560
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.755
That drive took a good hour,

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:55.705
but we made it successfully.

00:19:55.705 --> 00:19:58.187
This restaurant is called
Tom Yum Goong Banglamphu.

00:19:58.187 --> 00:19:59.976
- [Trevor] Really, Tom Yum Goong?

00:19:59.976 --> 00:20:01.152
- [Mark] And they
specialize in tom yum goong.

00:20:01.152 --> 00:20:05.069
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:06.527 --> 00:20:08.599
This means if it's not
spicy, I'm not eating.

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:09.780
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.697
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:23.825
Here's a mass of tom yun stock right here.

00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:24.787
- [Trevor] This is the stock right here.

00:20:24.787 --> 00:20:28.704
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.916
This is the tomalley from the shrimp.

00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:45.665
- [Trevor] Oh!

00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:46.562
- [Mark] The head oil.

00:20:46.562 --> 00:20:47.753
- [Trevor] The head oil.

00:20:47.753 --> 00:20:48.808
- [Mark] Oh, that aroma.

00:20:48.808 --> 00:20:51.689
- [Trevor] That is aromatic.

00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:52.907
This looks like it's got

00:20:52.907 --> 00:20:55.059
the true flavor of the street.

00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:56.690
- [Mark] Dude, this is real tom yum, man.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.708
- [Trevor] Wow.

00:20:57.708 --> 00:20:59.944
- [Mark] There's Trevor
going in for the closeup.

00:20:59.944 --> 00:21:00.856
- [Trevor] Yeah (chuckles).

00:21:00.856 --> 00:21:02.481
Gotta get those closeups.

00:21:02.481 --> 00:21:04.675
- [Mark] Those bubbles,
gotta get those bubbles.

00:21:04.675 --> 00:21:08.008
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.750
- [Trevor] Oh, that's great.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.917
- [Mark] (chuckles) Oh
that's beautiful, yeah.

00:21:17.432 --> 00:21:19.097
Oh, this is our omelet going in.

00:21:19.097 --> 00:21:20.358
Look at the way that's puffing up.

00:21:20.358 --> 00:21:22.311
- [Trevor] Look at that,
it's full of bubbles.

00:21:22.311 --> 00:21:23.570
- [Mark] I think it's
only three eggs, man.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.130
It's just so fluffy because
he deep fried it, you know.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:26.963
- [Trevor] Oh.

00:21:26.963 --> 00:21:28.491
- [Mark] He just fluffed it so.

00:21:28.491 --> 00:21:29.914
That is a work of art.

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.254
- [Trevor] Yeah.

00:21:31.254 --> 00:21:32.437
That is huge! (chuckles)

00:21:32.437 --> 00:21:33.270
(Mark chuckles)

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.869
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:34.869 --> 00:21:38.443
- [Mark] The name of this
restaurant includes Tom Yum Goon,

00:21:38.443 --> 00:21:40.678
so this is a dish you
absolutely have to order

00:21:40.678 --> 00:21:42.525
when you come here.
- So this is the specialty.

00:21:42.525 --> 00:21:44.680
- But you should also order
everything else because...

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.930
- [Trevor] Wow, like these monster,

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.672
these juicy shrimp look so (chuckles)...

00:21:49.672 --> 00:21:50.573
and the smell
- Look at how oily

00:21:50.573 --> 00:21:51.467
and delicate they are.

00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:52.413
- The smell, the smell as they just...

00:21:52.413 --> 00:21:53.246
(Mark chuckles)

00:21:53.246 --> 00:21:54.377
We gotta go in for that tom yum.

00:21:54.377 --> 00:21:55.723
- [Mark] Yeah, we gotta try
the tom yum first, yeah.

00:21:55.723 --> 00:21:56.556
- [Trevor] Oh, this is-

00:21:56.556 --> 00:21:57.821
- And actually, he made it expertly.

00:21:57.821 --> 00:21:58.803
He added the broth.

00:21:58.803 --> 00:22:00.350
He added chilies, all the seasoning.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.097
He added the shrimp, and then he added in

00:22:02.097 --> 00:22:03.074
all of this orange stuff,

00:22:03.074 --> 00:22:06.323
which is the head shrimp butter.

00:22:06.323 --> 00:22:09.164
And actually, I just recently
learned the name for it,

00:22:09.164 --> 00:22:10.267
which is called tomalley.

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:11.934
- [Trevor] Tomalley?

00:22:13.067 --> 00:22:14.536
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

00:22:14.536 --> 00:22:16.164
(Trevor chuckles)

00:22:16.164 --> 00:22:17.789
- [Trevor] Oh man!

00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:18.622
- [Mark] Dude.

00:22:18.622 --> 00:22:20.391
- [Trevor] Oh.

00:22:20.391 --> 00:22:21.690
That shrimp head butter.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.523
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:22:22.523 --> 00:22:23.965
- [Trevor] That is what it's about.

00:22:23.965 --> 00:22:25.950
- [Mark] But you can taste how it's sour.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.047
- [Trevor] It's sour and citrusy.

00:22:27.047 --> 00:22:28.673
It's pure shrimp.

00:22:28.673 --> 00:22:31.034
Oh look at the cream.

00:22:31.034 --> 00:22:32.255
- [Mark] Oh yeah they just ooze.

00:22:32.255 --> 00:22:33.207
- They're just oozing.
- They're just oozing,

00:22:33.207 --> 00:22:34.040
look at that (chuckles).

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.125
- It's oozing the cream (chuckles).

00:22:35.125 --> 00:22:37.158
- Okay, I'm just gonna bite that body.

00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:37.991
(laughs)

00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:38.824
(Trevor laughs)

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:39.697
Did you see that?

00:22:39.697 --> 00:22:41.857
Dude, I ripped off the head and it, like,

00:22:41.857 --> 00:22:42.690
it, like, shot.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.646
- [Trevor] It slingshotted.

00:22:43.646 --> 00:22:44.970
- [Mark] Really, it slingshotted some-

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.916
- [Trevor] It's oozing with cream.

00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:47.930
(Mark laughs)

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:48.763
(Trevor chuckles)

00:22:48.763 --> 00:22:49.596
- Okay.

00:22:49.596 --> 00:22:51.109
Ying, can you see that,
that just creaminess?

00:22:51.109 --> 00:22:51.942
Cheers, man.

00:22:51.942 --> 00:22:52.775
- Cheers.

00:22:55.672 --> 00:22:56.726
- Mmm.

00:22:56.726 --> 00:22:58.634
Oh I think I got some shrimp
juices rolling down my chin.

00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:01.498
(Trevor chuckles)

00:23:01.498 --> 00:23:03.178
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:23:03.178 --> 00:23:07.122
That creaminess of the shrimp
is, dude, unbelievable.

00:23:07.122 --> 00:23:08.343
- They're so silky.

00:23:08.343 --> 00:23:09.563
- [Trevor] Yeah.

00:23:09.563 --> 00:23:10.578
- And that texture is unreal.

00:23:10.578 --> 00:23:12.530
- And then with that tom
yum flavor over top...

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.030
- Oh, dude.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.654
Yeah, it actually tastes like,

00:23:15.654 --> 00:23:16.748
it's like whipped cream.

00:23:16.748 --> 00:23:18.062
This one is goong tod kratiem,

00:23:18.062 --> 00:23:20.788
which is fried shrimp with garlic.

00:23:20.788 --> 00:23:21.621
- Mmm.

00:23:21.621 --> 00:23:23.592
And it looks like it's
crispy on the outside.

00:23:23.592 --> 00:23:26.236
- [Mark] Man, he had that
oil like just perfectly.

00:23:26.236 --> 00:23:29.932
I think that's actually
caramelized oyster sauce.

00:23:29.932 --> 00:23:30.765
- [Trevor] Really?

00:23:30.765 --> 00:23:32.249
- [Mark] Because what
he did was he fried them

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:34.326
in a bunch of oil, and
then he drained the oil

00:23:34.326 --> 00:23:35.217
but kept frying them.

00:23:35.217 --> 00:23:36.050
- [Trevor] Mm.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.007
- [Mark] And then he
added some oyster sauce,

00:23:37.007 --> 00:23:38.577
and I think that slightly caramelized.

00:23:38.577 --> 00:23:39.607
- Caramelized.
on top.

00:23:39.607 --> 00:23:40.646
- Let's do it.
- Do we have one?

00:23:40.646 --> 00:23:41.622
Yeah.

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:42.800
- (chuckles) Oh, it just pops out.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.814
(Trevor chuckles)

00:23:43.814 --> 00:23:46.498
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:23:46.498 --> 00:23:47.517
- Mmm.

00:23:47.517 --> 00:23:49.350
- (chuckles) Oh.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.240
That's as good as he made it
look when he was cooking it.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.844
- Yeah.

00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:55.921
It's just one after the
next of deliciousness.

00:23:55.921 --> 00:23:57.264
- [Mark] Also one of the
great things about here

00:23:57.264 --> 00:23:58.097
is the garlic.

00:23:58.097 --> 00:23:58.930
- [Trevor] Mm.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.395
- [Mark] And dude, they
just toss in the cloves

00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:02.269
with the skin and all.

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:03.102
- [Trevor] Mm.

00:24:03.102 --> 00:24:05.274
- [Mark] And look at that oily goozy...

00:24:05.274 --> 00:24:06.107
Goozy.

00:24:06.107 --> 00:24:06.940
(Trevor chuckles)

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.242
Is it oozy or goozy?

00:24:08.242 --> 00:24:11.597
Oh just look at that.
- Mm.

00:24:11.597 --> 00:24:12.430
- Mmm.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.263
(Mark chuckles)

00:24:13.263 --> 00:24:14.096
- [Trevor] Mmm.

00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:15.148
- Wow.

00:24:15.148 --> 00:24:16.003
- Oh that is...

00:24:16.003 --> 00:24:17.182
- Yeah.

00:24:17.182 --> 00:24:18.400
That is ridiculous.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.459
- It almost tastes like honey.

00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:21.088
- The omelet was one of
the most impressive dishes

00:24:21.088 --> 00:24:22.224
that they make here.

00:24:22.224 --> 00:24:24.623
The amount of oil he used, actually,

00:24:24.623 --> 00:24:26.902
you do not wanna know the
amount of oil he used.

00:24:26.902 --> 00:24:27.735
(Trevor chuckles)

00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:29.826
It was a significant amount.

00:24:29.826 --> 00:24:31.452
- [Trevor] It looked
like the wok was full.

00:24:31.452 --> 00:24:32.469
- [Mark] Yeah, pretty much.

00:24:32.469 --> 00:24:33.407
And then when he took it out,

00:24:33.407 --> 00:24:34.464
the wok was only half full.

00:24:34.464 --> 00:24:35.439
- [Trevor] Yeah (chuckles).

00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:38.286
- But anyway, he threw the egg in,

00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:39.829
and there's also shrimp in this omelet,

00:24:39.829 --> 00:24:43.412
and then it just puffed up like a balloon.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.438
Mm.

00:24:46.438 --> 00:24:47.287
Yeah.

00:24:47.287 --> 00:24:48.342
- Oh.

00:24:48.342 --> 00:24:50.580
So many ingredients and so many flavors.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.413
- [Mark] Mm-hmm.

00:24:51.413 --> 00:24:53.307
- That are kind of alien

00:24:53.307 --> 00:24:55.017
to people that don't live here.

00:24:55.017 --> 00:24:56.926
And to taste it and to experience it

00:24:56.926 --> 00:25:00.550
in a true and authentic way is truly

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.846
something that you really have
to do in your life because

00:25:03.846 --> 00:25:06.773
it's not just food, it's an experience.

00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:08.644
- [Mark] Well said.

00:25:08.644 --> 00:25:10.189
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:11.516
- Mm.
- Mm.

00:25:11.516 --> 00:25:13.873
- [Mark] Good stir-fried
vegetables, garlicky.

00:25:13.873 --> 00:25:16.148
- [Trevor] Nice crispy pork belly.

00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:17.976
- The uncle who makes the tom yum goong?

00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:18.809
- Yeah?

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:21.150
- He's truly a legend.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.085
He knows exactly...

00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:23.995
I bet he could make that tom
yum goong with his eyes closed.

00:25:23.995 --> 00:25:24.828
- [Trevor] Really?

00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:26.186
- [Mark] As you saw, he just
puts in the ingredients.

00:25:26.186 --> 00:25:28.436
He throws them in, he boils it.

00:25:28.436 --> 00:25:31.304
He knows exactly how
long he could boil it.

00:25:31.304 --> 00:25:33.949
It turns out perfect every single time.

00:25:33.949 --> 00:25:35.086
- [Trevor] I'm blown away.

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:36.447
- He's truly a legend,

00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:37.941
- Legendary.
tom yum goong.

00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:40.097
And on that, I will take another
bite of this tom yum goong.

00:25:40.097 --> 00:25:41.275
- [Trevor] Yeah.

00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:44.363
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:25:44.363 --> 00:25:45.196
- Dude, that's good (chuckles).

00:25:45.196 --> 00:25:46.696
- The flavor, man.

00:25:48.277 --> 00:25:49.278
The tomalley.

00:25:49.278 --> 00:25:50.141
- The tomalley.

00:25:50.141 --> 00:25:50.974
(Mark chuckles)

00:25:50.974 --> 00:25:52.237
- [Mark] Trevor and I made
it to the end of the day.

00:25:52.237 --> 00:25:53.133
- What an amazing day.

00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:54.921
- That was a challenge.

00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:55.776
- Yeah.

00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.626
- And an absolute joyful eating day.

00:25:58.626 --> 00:25:59.682
- [Trevor] It was.

00:25:59.682 --> 00:26:03.419
- We managed to get all
four major Thai cuisines,

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:05.491
regional cuisines in a single day.

00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:06.324
- [Trevor] Yup.

00:26:06.324 --> 00:26:07.770
- [Mark] From Southern
Thai food to Isaan food

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.707
to Northern Thai food

00:26:08.707 --> 00:26:11.144
and now finishing off with
this Central Thai meal.

00:26:11.144 --> 00:26:12.730
- What an amazing experience.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.825
- Dude, it was absolutely awesome.

00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:15.086
- Yeah, thank you so much.

00:26:15.086 --> 00:26:16.105
- To eat all the food with you.

00:26:16.105 --> 00:26:18.054
- Thank you so much for this experience.

00:26:18.054 --> 00:26:20.858
It was such a great time to
hang out and eat with you.

00:26:20.858 --> 00:26:21.995
- You as well, man.

00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:23.825
I think, like, we were,

00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:24.884
we were made to eat together.

00:26:24.884 --> 00:26:26.187
- Yes, yes, we were.

00:26:26.187 --> 00:26:27.729
- And so finally, to complete this video,

00:26:27.729 --> 00:26:29.640
I have two quick things for you.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.807

it all in a blog post.
