00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.320
 almost six months ago we were 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:11.049
 in equal we went in an activity and then 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.570
 that activity brought with it all 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.949
 this mobilization because we were attacked 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:21.070
 by forces of order there in Mexico 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.050
 policemen by federals by military in 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.380
 they were all attacking us that 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.380
 night 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.490
 today I am here 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.870
 for 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.900
 invite the people of the USA where we 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.750
 continue to support and that mainly that 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.330
 help us press the government of 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.990
 this country that in turn this 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.430
 press Mexico so it does not close the 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.430
 case then of the 43 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.100
 I had to sing 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 wake up from your quiet sweet sleep 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.890
 the rose color wake up because to your 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.810
 around maybe they do not see it here 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.520
 in this country or probably if 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 simply that blind eyes are made
