FEMALE SPEAKER: Authors at
Google New York is pleased to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.200
have Professor Ying Zhu come
and speak to us today.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.005
Please welcome Professor Zhu.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.430
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.020
I think I will start by
actually, instead of talking

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.640
about China Central Television,
I wanted to show

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.650
you something else, which
I think you're

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.880
familiar with, actually.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.650
So this is an interesting
video clip of Korean pop

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.470
singer, Psy, doing his
"Gangnam Style"

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.210
song and dance sequence.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.673
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:38.220
[MUSIC - PSY, "GANGNAM STYLE"]

00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:04.104
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:07.065
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Now,
according to Wikipedia, as of

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:12.200
January 1 of this year, this
music video has been viewed

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.610
over 1.1 billion times.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.530
I just clicked a couple
more times into it

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.880
on YouTube, of course.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.460
And this is the site's
most watched video.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.420
Now, the question is, what does
this slice of K-pop have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.940
anything to do with Chinese
media or China Central

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.190
Television?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.750
Well, nothing much.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.480
And this missing link is
precisely what I wanted to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.960
call your attention to today.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.390
What the South Koreans have
accomplished via this funky

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.310
music video is what the Chinese
state media have been

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.900
craving for to promote name
recognition and make people

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.850
desire what you desire--

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.910
in other words, that is to
project China's soft power.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.970
But Chinese media have yet to
come up with such a pop hit to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.380
boost its soft power.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.640
Now, the lack of recognition
or desirability of Chinese

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.520
soft power is not due to lack
of trying, as billions have

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.750
been spent in promoting China's
soft power globally.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.850
And the Chinese government
invested $7.8 billion alone in

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.580
2009 to facilitate
Chinese media's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.410
global soft power campaign.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.510
And all the money has gone to
major state-run media firms,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.440
including China Central
Television.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.920
Now, the global image campaign
was launched by the Chinese

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.690
state over a decade
ago, back in 2001.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.890
The goal was to change China's
international image which was,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.060
for the most part, negative.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.450
The Chinese Communist Party
warned Chinese media

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.300
practitioners that it would be
unrealistic to expect the West

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.455
to promote China's cause
and perspective.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.420
But a decade later and many
billions after, the overall

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.890
international image of China
continues to be, to put it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.300
mildly, uncool.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.740
Even the Chinese president, Hu
Jintao, acknowledged a year

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.510
ago the dismal record of Chinese
soft power, telling

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.580
the Party that, quote, "The
overall strength of Chinese

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.010
culture and its international
influence is not commensurate

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.010
with China's international
status," end quote.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.390
So what was his solution?

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.410
Well, not Psy's "Gangnam Style"
K-pop, that's for sure.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.380
The popular and the grassroots
have no place in

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.080
China's image campaign.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.430
In fact, the satirical and
rebellious "Gangnam Style"

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.050
might even be considered
unseemly to China's censors

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.090
and cultural guardians.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.880
Instead, Hu Jintao encouraged
the development of Chinese

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.530
national culture rooted in
Confucian tradition capable of

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.630
countering Western cultural
influence.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.890
So a state-manufactured and
managed Chinese national

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.380
culture is the prescription the
Party has in mind for the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.900
people and for the rest
of the world.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.170
Never mind that the world
might not be all that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.990
interested in what the
CCP has to preach.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.780
But this sort of heavy-handed
approach is nothing new.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.860
Now, in China, culture is to

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.780
enlighten rather than entertain.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.960
And then the media is to guard
the purity and quality of

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.880
Chinese culture.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.390
And the media, of course, must
also serve the Party.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.130
Now, to be fair to the Chinese
Communist Party, the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.620
subservience of culture
to politics is

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.670
not the party's invention.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.460
It is rooted in a much longer
tradition of Chinese

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.320
aesthetics that defines art and
culture as the good and

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.600
the beautiful.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.320
The Chinese cultural tradition
puts a greater emphasis on the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.940
responsibility of art in the
normalization of society, as

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.510
opposed to a Western tradition
of art as a critical vanguard

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.820
or individual expression.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.800
Now, to this end, Western
culture is often perceived as

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.360
a source of decadence and evil
for polluting the purity of

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.550
Chinese culture.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.340
And thus, China has time and
again waged wars against the

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.020
cultural vulgarity and
degradation seen, again, as a

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.650
result of Western cultural
pollution or erosion.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.150
The K-pop video can easily be
condemned as vulgar, a cheap

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.970
knockoff of Western-style
pop music.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.070
Now, in January of last year,
the Chinese president, Hu

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.930
Jintao, urged Chinese cultural
policymakers to, quote,

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.000
"clearly see that international
hostile forces

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.770
are intensifying the strategic
plot of westernizing and

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.130
dividing China, and ideological
and cultural

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.890
fields are the focal areas
of their long-term

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.390
infiltration," end quote.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.280
And he said further that,
quote, "We should deeply

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.410
understand the seriousness and
complexity of the ideological

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.070
struggle, always sound the
alarm, and remain vigilant,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.650
and take forceful measures
to be on guard

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.660
and respond," unquote.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.530
Now, though reminiscent of Cold
War rhetoric, this sort

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.600
of militant talk is nothing
new in China.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.880
And to be fair, the West has,
over the years, harbored

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.490
similar apprehension and
distrust towards China,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.580
particularly China's rise
in the past decade.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.900
So the feeling is
somewhat mutual.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.170
Let's just put it that way.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.740
Except that in China, the
state can quickly enact

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.650
policies that aim to deter
Western cultural pollution.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:09.040
And in October 2011, China
banned scores of racy and

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.670
overtly materialistic
entertainment shows on

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.260
prime-time television in an
effort to curb excessive

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.720
entertainment, exemplified by a
Chinese dating show on local

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.320
satellite television, "If You
Are The One," in which a

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:31.830
provocatively dressed young
woman are paraded on stage,

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.700
blatantly embracing
materialism.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.870
I think I have that
queued up here.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.810

can look at our society.

00:07:55.586 --> 00:07:58.990
-Reality TV shows like "If You
Are The One" have become

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.110
common on Chinese television.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.894

attracted fans and ad revenue.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.710
-I think the conversations
between the male and female

contestants reflect the
attitudes and concerns of

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.320
people in their 20s,
30s, and 40s.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.750
I think they authentically
represent the current state of

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.000
things in China.

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:25.250
-But the sometimes racy and
materialistic content has also

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.720
attracted the attention
of China's censors.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.680
This type of content is
relatively new for China.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.460
In the past, television's main
purpose was to spread

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.452
propaganda.

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:34.904
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:37.480
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: We don't
need more propaganda here.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.450
Now, these material girls and
boys from other reality

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.900
programs have seriously offended
Party comrades and

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.180
conservative cultural

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.730
commentators and viewers alike.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.350
And new rules were promptly
issued, forcing all satellite

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.620
TV stations across China to
cut vulgar entertainment

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.000
programs, essentially reducing
weekly entertainment programs

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.580
to two during prime time.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.980
Furthermore, and as a
counterprogramming strategy,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.010
at least one show during prime
time must be about promoting,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.490
quote, "traditional Chinese
virtues, core socialist

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.040
values, and advanced
cultures," unquote.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.675
Now, the battle against Western
popular culture is

00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:29.020
equated with ensuring China's
cultural security.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.170
So it's a serious matter.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.280
The Chinese state's cultural
anxiety was keenly felt in

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.390
2011, a year when "Avatar"
pretty much dominated the

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.520
Chinese box office and Lady
Gaga was a household name,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.725
popular among the Chinese
young and old.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.660
Now, actually, to demonstrate
Lady Gaga's popularity in

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.810
China, I wanted to take the
liberty here to play a clip

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.340
from Hunan Satellite TV's
rendition of Lady Gaga's 2009

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.350
hit, "Bad Romance." Only that
the song is now sung in

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.500
Hunan's Changsha dialect and
no less by a senior choir.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.360
And bear in mind that in this
region of China, the word,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.540
gaga, means grandmother.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.080
I'm not sure if the Lady would
be pleased with this kind of

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.960
connection, the connotation,
the image of

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.530
grandmother and Lady Gaga.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.930
The second is part of Hunan
Satellite Television's

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.690
Mid-Autumn Festival Gala.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.960
Mid-Autumn Festival, some of you
might know, is an occasion

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.240
for family gathering and
reunion in China.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.610
And the choir changed Gaga's
lyrics to be about the elderly

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.100
empty-nesters' yearning for
the grown-up children and

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.495
grandchildren to come
home and visit.

00:10:48.495 --> 00:10:50.670
Let's have a sample of this.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.140
This is going to be
very interesting.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.008
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: So
you get a taste.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.760
So, is this Western culture
pollution or Eastern cultural

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.420
appropriation or subversion?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.680
And to use Lady Gaga to preach
for Confucian family values

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.130
seems to me pretty cool,
especially coming from a group

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.610
of very euphoric senior
citizens.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.770
Regardless, the Chinese
authority was not amused by

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.160
the flood of Western-infused
Chinese programs produced

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.340
mostly by China's provincial
TV stations,

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.470
therefore the crackdown.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.600
But the crackdowns
do hurt Chinese

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.890
television, bottom line.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.340
Now, state-owned and controlled
Chinese television

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.930
is by now financially
self-reliant and operationally

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.790
autonomous.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.140
So when it comes to chasing
ratings, it functions just the

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.860
same as the US commercial
networks.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.350
You have Three Blind Mice, I was
told, since a decade ago

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.620
with networks competing
for ratings.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.660
Now, what is different is that
in China, one network is

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.350
granted greater leverage
in market share.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.850
And that network is, of
course, China Central

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:41.600
Television, the only national
TV network in China.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.900
To understand how China Central
Television obtains its

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.330
leverage, one must understand
China's overall TV structure.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.270
Now, China has the so-called
four-tier television

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.390
structure, where television
stations are set up at the

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.480
national, provincial, county,
and city levels.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.830
And both national and local
regulators operate their own

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.360
TV stations and serve audiences
within their own

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.270
administrative boundaries.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.540
Now, as a result, television
stations, broadcasting

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.840
bureaus, and governments at the
same administrative levels

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.940
are closely linked in economic
and political exchange.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.300
And CCTV is the only broadcaster
that is allowed a

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.830
nationwide coverage, although
the arrival of cable and

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.490
satellite television would
challenge the neat structure.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.430
So how does satellite television
work in China?

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.990
Well, in China, each provincial
TV station is

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.590
allowed to operate one satellite
TV channel with

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.420
signal coverage capable, or
theoretically capable, of

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.610
reaching the entire nation.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.610
But because of the
administrative boundaries and

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.510
local protectionism, provincial
satellite TV

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:59.230
stations must negotiate with
each other to expand their

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.860
satellite channels.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.470
And local broadcasters have
managed over the years to

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.600
extend their regional reach,
their independent satellite

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.190
and cable distribution deals
with other provincial

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.480
broadcasters.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.480
It's a bread and butter issue.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.410
Now, the essential regulator
that oversees China Central

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.860
Television is the State
Administration of Radio, Film,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.030
and Television, or
SARFT in short.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.990
Now, SARFT is motivated both
politically and economically,

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.650
understandably, to boost
CCTV's market share.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.890
And how does it do it?

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:37.960
Well, there is the must-carry
policy that guarantees

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.950
CCTV-1's national coverage.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.190
CCTV has altogether 24 channels
under the big

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.740
umbrella of CCTV China
Central Television.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.620
And CCTV-1 is by far the most
significant channel that

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.210
carries network news and other

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.120
culturally significant programs.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.520
Now, carrying CCTV-1 is

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.105
considered a political mission--

00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:03.430
an undeniable obligation and
responsibility of local

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.420
broadcasters.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.440
Then there is the exclusive
information available to only

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.990
CCTV-1, and then the crackdown
on programs utilizing local

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.498
dialects that appeals
to local audiences.

00:16:17.498 --> 00:16:21.310
As the financial stakes grew
higher, local stations

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.360
rebelled, challenging CCTV's
market dominance by producing

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.060
entertainment programs that
would attract audiences

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.920
nationwide.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.540
And they used
entertainment-oriented Hunan

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.500
Satellite TV for what has
emerged as CCTV's formidable

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.250
challenger.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.150
If you recall, Hunan TV is the
one who made all these video

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:46.190
clips of grandmother and parents
act up just to make

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.360
sure you go home and visit your
parents, so that they

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.890
don't act up.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:56.280
So in 2004, Hunan Satellite TV
debuted a singing competition

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.690
show with mobile phone voting,
modeled on "American Idol."

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.810
And the show "Super Girls"
became an overnight rating

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:09.950
sensation, promoting CCTV to
launch a campaign attacking

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.520
Hunan Satellite Television,
calling it a rogue broadcaster

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.296
with culturally vulgar
programs.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:22.930
And a top official from SARFT
echoed CCTV, complaining about

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.329
what he saw as an excessive
amount of low-quality and

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.180
lowbrow reality shows on
Chinese television.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.610
And he wanted to strengthen
the Party's supervision of

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.860
entertainment programs and to
restrict the number of reality

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.180
shows allowed on TV.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.820
And SARFT eventually announced
a ban on airing talent shows

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.260
during prime time, which is
somewhere between 7:30 to

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.820
10:30 in China.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.110
The ban started in 2007.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.890
And under the new rules, the
programs must be no longer

00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:01.080
than 90 minutes and offer no
prizes to attract contestants.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.070
And "Super Girls" was suspended
in 2008 when the

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.890
Beijing Olympics pretty much
preempted everything.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.390
And then in 2009, Hunan
Television made an attempt to

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.430
relaunch "Super Girls," only in
the different name "Happy

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.480
Girls." This time it's
called "Happy Girls."

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.000
OK, so let's see if "Happy
Girls" can fail better here.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.250
Take a look at these
restrictions.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.615
So SARFT promptly handed down
strict conditions for Hunan TV

00:18:30.615 --> 00:18:35.050
to run "Happy Girls." The
draconian directives made even

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.860
my then-preteen daughters wince,
who complained quite

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.240
wisely, I should say, that,
quote, "This is ridiculous.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.720
Reality TV is all about
expression, not the

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.100
suppression of raw emotions,"
end quote.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.160
Now, here is a segment from the
now much-subdued "Happy

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.260
Girls," which is actually the
opening of the championship

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.880
competition in 2011.

PROFESSOR YING ZHU: So how
is this for C-pop?

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.970
Pretty cool?

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.200
Well, the Chinese cultural
guardians would have none of

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.450
that either.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.680
Now, let's march on.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.230
Now, as CCTV is busy bothering
local stations, it is

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.620
confronted with yet another
formidable challenger.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.980
And this time, it's something
called the internet.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.300
Though television remains the
Party's most manageable

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.280
vehicle for cultural
engineering, even the Chinese

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.150
state can't control
consumer behavior.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.130
CCTV has largely become
irrelevant to the young and

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.780
educated population who has
pretty much opted for the more

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.750
open cyberspace.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.970
At the end of last year
projected that the number of

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.320
Chinese watching entertainment
programs online would surpass

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.090
445 million.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.340
CCTV has tried to woo audiences
back by importing

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.910
popular movies and TV dramas
from the UK and the US.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.940
And the most recent lineup
includes, surprisingly, "V For

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.780
Vendetta," featuring
an anti-hero with

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.230
anti-authoritarian and
totalitartian powers, and yes,

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.150
"Downton Abbey."

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.680
Now, let's dwell on the
internet a bit.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.210
The internet has been a very
positive force in compelling

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.710
Chinese state and the
media to open up.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.930
The internet has made it that
much harder for Chinese

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.810
authorities to shut out
undesirable news or keep it

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.960
out of the traditional
media in China.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.110
And in keeping the news of,
let's say, collapsing schools

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.320
in Sichuan or collapsing
governments in the Middle East

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.730
out of the state media when
millions of people can access

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.070
them online would further drive
people away from the

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.230
traditional media.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.400
So the Chinese state gets it.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.030
But the compulsive censorship
regime will

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.725
not give it a rest.

00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:45.610
The internet and the social
media are subject to very

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.705
sophisticated monitoring
and filtering.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.090
Now, official campaigns were
launched in China a decade ago

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.410
to effectively push for internet
self-censorship,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.730
equating diligent
self-censorship with upholding

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.470
corporate social responsibility,
proper

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.970
professional codes of conduct,
and also individual

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.820
self-discipline.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.640
You have to be self-disciplined
to censor

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.170
yourself, in other words.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.720
And these days, sensitive terms
are routinely blocked.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.820
A search in Chinese about a
recent protest in Guangzhou

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.290
against political censorship
yields not much results.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.220
And in December last year, many
of you know probably Sina

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.140
Weibo, the Chinese version of
Twitter, enacted a seven-day

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.030
delay function for
sensitive terms.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.020
Imagine not getting a result
for seven days.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.220
Gosh, Google would
go bankrupt.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.340
And I suppose it's
the modern day

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.730
version of the Pony Express.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.585
And to think about it, it could
be a useful tool to

00:24:55.585 --> 00:24:58.050
deter my daughter from
getting online.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.360
So Facebook and Twitter
are censored.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.710
So is YouTube, which leads back
to the piece of K-pop we

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.200
sampled at the beginning
of my talk.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.560
The Ministry of Culture in Korea
actually gave an award

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.390
to Google for YouTube's
effectiveness as a platform

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.290
for spreading Korean
popular culture.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:27.370
And Psy's "Gangnam Style" song
exploded in large part because

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.680
his video went viral
on YouTube.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.310
But YouTube is off limits
in China, of course.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.690
Now, despite China's great
firewall, sensitive

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.160
information does manage to
find surreptitious and

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.390
guerrilla style online existence
through various

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.040
transgressive tactics such as
code-breaking, multiple

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.722
blogging, creative use of terms
and phrases, and et

00:25:48.722 --> 00:25:50.410
cetera, et cetera.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.500
And also, censorship has had
little impact on the

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.250
tech-savvy professionals and
rights activists who actively

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.360
seek out and also spread
information by

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.040
circumventing the wall.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.050
Although, recently, China
started to crack down on

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.880
foreign VPNs and other
circumventing technology,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.510
which makes it harder
to climb the wall.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.770
But censorship cannot prevail.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.110
It cannot eliminate dissent.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.310
It would only ferment further
discontent as cohesion would

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.370
eventually lead to rebellion.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.750
Now, by trying hard to fend
off Western media and

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.830
information from coming in,
the Chinese state somehow

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:32.620
imagined that it would
be able to push

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.050
its own media overseas.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:40.610
And in the case of CCTV, it
launched its official English

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.380
channel on September 25, 2000.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.690
CCTV International rapidly
expanded its foreign language

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.620
services in the last few years,
adding Spanish, French,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.260
Russian, Arab, and African
channels to its cocktail of

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.840
foreign language services.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.470
And then came CCTV America.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.810
On February 6 of last year,
before an official visit to

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:09.830
the US of Xi Jinping, China's
incoming president, CCTV

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:14.050
launched its American outpost,
CCTV America.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.340
And on February 11, CCTV
America's panel showed "The

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.145
Heat," which, by the way, is
hosted by Michael Walter, gave

00:27:20.145 --> 00:27:24.960
a preview of Xi Jinping's
upcoming stopover in Iowa, the

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.440
leading soybean producer
in the US and

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.060
big supplier to China.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:29.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.870
-When Chinese Vice President Xi
Jinping's itinerary to the

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.280
United States was announced,
it included stopovers in

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.790
Washington, DC, California,
and also Iowa.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.870
It turns out Vice President
Xi is keen to revive old

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.440
connections and meet with
friends he made when he spent

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.490
some time in Iowa
27 years ago.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.110
He visited the Hawkeye State
as part of an agricultural

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.790
delegation from the
Northeastern

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.290
Hubei province in 1985.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.810
Vice President Xi spent two
nights in the home of an

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.060
American family, toured
farms, and even

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.540
watched a baseball game.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.890
He also met Iowa Governor Terry
Branstad, who says Xi

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.090
Jinping was pleased by the
warmth and friendly reception

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.090
he received back then and feels
a sense of kinship with

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.630
the people of Iowa.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.570
Branstad visited Xi Jinping
during a visit

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.130
to China last September.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.650
He says the Vice President saved
his itinerary from his

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.890
1985 Iowa trip and inquired
about a number

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.370
of people he met.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.800
Iowa is also critical
for another reason.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.510
It's exporting a record amount
of corn, soybeans, and pork to

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.760
meet a massive surge in
demand by China's

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.210
growing middle class.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.180
Look at the exponential
growth in trade

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.580
over a 10-year period.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.940
In 2000, Iowa's exports to China
totaled $45 million.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.920
By 2010, that rose nearly 13
times to $627 million.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.790
What does that do for
the job market?

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.740
Unemployment in Iowa was at
5.6% in December of 2011.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.490
The US national average
at the same time--

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:56.926
8.5%.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:57.362 --> 00:29:01.340
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Now, CCTV
America's vast financial

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.380
resources have brought or bought
veteran news people

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.490
from the US, UK,
and Australia.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.910
But it remains to be seen if
viewers, too, can be bought or

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.150
brought along.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.470
And CCTV America is highly
skewed towards reporting

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.500
economic and financial news.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.370
And when it comes to political
news, it actively engages in

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.430
major events elsewhere
except in China.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.640
When it comes to political
news about China, CCTV's

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.910
America branch is highly
disciplined, sticking to the

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.650
Party's script and reporting
only what is permissible.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.710
It is very much on the
Party's short leash.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.250
So when the journalist strike
against the censorship at

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.890
China's Southern Weekend became
headline news around

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.180
the world, CCTV America
kept silent.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.990
And Al Jazeera, on the other
hand, has created their brand

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.920
name for producing intriguing
news about the Middle East,

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.580
which is actually what CCTV
America aspires to be when it

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.910
comes to news about China.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:07.680
But political editorial makes it
impossible for CCTV America

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.810
to function as a credible and
valuable news about China.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.570
Now, I'm going to wrap
it up a little.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.180
Now, China's top-down,
state-orchestrated soft power

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.890
campaign has so far shown little
impact in altering how

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.210
the world perceives China.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.330
The soft power campaign has
failed to account for the

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.360
power of the grassroots
and the popular.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.530
The paternalistic Chinese state
does not get it that if

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.150
the Chinese back home do not
want to be lectured to, the

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.310
audiences abroad would hardly
want to have the same patience

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.505
or to listen in.

00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:45.510
Now, I'm not suggesting here
that the "Gangnam Style" pop

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.990
is the only way or even a viable
way towards accruing

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.230
soft power.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.160
China can certainly produce its
own brand of soft power,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.793
fusing cultures high and low.

00:30:56.793 --> 00:31:00.400
But whatever it produces, it
must resonate with the

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.100
grassroots and be capable
of unleashing individual

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.010
creativity and aspiration.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:11.960
And when the leaders do lecture,
it wouldn't hurt for

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.880
them to lighten up a little--

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.920
perhaps show some emotions and
be a little more animated.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.140
And I want to show you a clip
here, particularly delivering

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.380
New Year's greetings.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.010

leaders deliver the New Year's

PROFESSOR YING ZHU: I wish
I could continue

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.325
just playing this.

00:33:19.325 --> 00:33:23.000
And the Joe Biden can be very
good soft power, actually, for

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.290
the Chinese state.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.245
Now, let's get serious
here as I wrap up.

00:33:29.245 --> 00:33:31.490
Now, to think of the fundamental
problem is that

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:37.090
the Chinese state has no moral
authority in imparting

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:39.080
cultural values here.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.120
And ultimately, what needs to
be fixed is not just China's

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.020
draconian image alone.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.630
For China's charm offense to
work, it has to shake off its

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.900
repressive and authoritarian
reputation.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.240
And for that to happen, it will
need to lift political

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.260
censorship to allow
for a very vibrant

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.970
civil society to emerge.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.830
It also needs to dismantle the
state monopoly of the media so

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.400
that information channels are
open to dissent, diversity,

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.429
and competition.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.900
After leaving behind the
totalitarian state of Mao's

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.900
era, China glided through a
relatively open phase with

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.150
rapid economic growth and
political exploration only to

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:27.190
arrive today at a toxic cocktail
of authoritarian and

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.090
plutocratic rule where money
and power converge to guard

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.460
interests of a few.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.659
And for China's soft power to
work, China has to first

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:40.050
respect and empower
its own people.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.659
And that's today's talk.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.450

a good ride with me.

AUDIENCE: I was impressed in
your book with the response of

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.500
the senior CCTV individuals,
and how they were trying to

balance commitment with
the different

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.920
venues they had to satisfy.

this whole coming

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.300
out and soft power?

00:35:18.982 --> 00:35:23.050

I think a lot of Chinese

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:24.300
journalists--

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.390
some of them are very
idealistic.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:35.000
And they really do tie their
success and their aspiration

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.840
with the success and aspiration

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.790
of China and globally.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.040
So they somehow do tie their
fate with the fate of China.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.020
So they're also very
patriotic.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.660
And so they do want to see China
prosper and to become a

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.330
respectable global player.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:56.380
But how China is to
reach that step--

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.560
I think that's another issue.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.220
I think they, too, have
their own ideas.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.320
And some of them have to
struggle with very strict

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.060
censorship where
they can't even

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.280
express their ideas freely.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.040
And a lot of them have
to exercise routinely

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.380
self-censorship.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.890
I use self-censorship as just
a descriptive term.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.430
I'm not condemning
self-censorship or being

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.460
judgmental about it,
but that's the

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.310
reality that they face.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:29.080
I think, again, there's a
certain aspiration there, but

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.470
there's a huge gap between
the reality and what

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.110
they aspire to be.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.420
AUDIENCE: I wonder if you know
about the Southern Weekly news

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.080
that just broke today about--

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.820
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Yes.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.130
The New York Times.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:42.610
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.900
The Chinese journalists are all
coming out saying, we're

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.340
speaking for freedom
of speech.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:48.930
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Yes.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.260
This is a very exciting
moment.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.920
This is actually a
watershed moment.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.020
The Chinese government
called these

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.450
demonstrations a mass incident.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.620
In this case, this is the first
incident that people

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.470
actually come out and gather
together to demonstrate

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.570
against the political
censorship.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.240
And this is a very
exciting moment.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.830
And in fact, I was
accepting Boston

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.030
Globe's interview yesterday.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.810
And the question was
posed to me, and I

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.170
expressed my optimism.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.370
I think this is unstoppable.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.920
The world has opened,
and China has opened

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.850
itself to the world.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.020
And China cannot retreat and
go back to a dark age.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.740
I hope that the new leader
will stand back and think

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.520
twice before they crack down
on these demonstrations.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.950
But again, I think it's a great
moment, and I personally

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.866
felt very excited about that.

00:37:39.866 --> 00:37:44.370
AUDIENCE: I think you did
mention Al Jazeera as being

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:49.350
the antithesis, if you
will, of CCTV.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.130
What are the short and
medium-term steps that CCTV

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.850
can become as reputable and as
far-reaching as something as

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.536
Al Jazeera?

00:37:56.536 --> 00:37:59.830
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Well, when
the image of China changes,

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:02.400
that's the only time
you can do that.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:02.990
Two things.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.010
One is the image of
China changes.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.120
And also, China lifts
its censorship.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.920
They're all interrelated.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.034
You cannot do without
the other.

00:38:13.034 --> 00:38:18.550
AUDIENCE: So sort of the forces
that created modern

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:23.970
Western ethos and thinking came
out of a bunch of funny

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.720
cultural events like the English
Civil War and a bunch

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.610
of fairly horrible experiences
that we had in the past.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.030
And those things sort of drive a
lot of things even though we

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.560
are often sort of forgetful
of their background.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.910
What do you think the similar
cultural forces or drivers

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:49.820
within China need to be, or
are, to bring China to the

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.900
place where you and certainly
most of us

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.680
think it ought to go?

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.820
Because it's not the case that
China had something like the

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:03.130
English Civil War to wake it up
to certain things that it

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.380
was doing wrong.

00:39:06.952 --> 00:39:09.740
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Well,
we have different events

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.020
throughout the last century--

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.950
not similar in nature, but
the force for change, the

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.930
modernization force has been
there all along, too.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:33.940
It's not going back to history,
thinking about, at

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.030
this particular moment,
what one might do,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.110
what one might seize.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.000
Clearly, again, going back
to the internet.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.700
The internet has opened the
technological revolution.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.650
Let's put it this way--
technological revolution.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.680
The internet has opened a whole
terrain for competing

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.270
voices to emerge and for
information to go out at a

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.460
very fast rate and to really
make it impossible, really,

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.090
for censorship to control
the information flow.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:06.570
And so that's something that
really helps to facilitate

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.480
this kind of change.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.870
And don't forget that as
recent as back in 1989,

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.580
there's a student movement.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.920
So there is a mass grassroots
demand for change.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.630
And so I'm not sure if I'm
answering your question

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:30.760
succinctly, but I guess I'm not
in a position to really

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.080
prescribe certain solutions.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.940
Just suffice it to say that
there's so many incremental

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.720
changes out there already.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.410
And it seems to me that China is
at a crossroads, and China

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.100
is ready to make that leap.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:52.030
AUDIENCE: In your book, you were
able to interview many

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.960
members of the CCTV family
who responded with

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.500
considerable candor.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:03.330
And I wonder, were they
jeopardizing either their

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:11.130
careers or any personal safety
by being so candid with you?

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.325
And I'm wondering if the book
has been banned in China.

00:41:15.325 --> 00:41:16.900
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: I will be
interested to know whether the

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.640
book is banned in China.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.410
You're right.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.950
A lot of those interviews
were very candid.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:27.560
And first of all, let me say,
I do not consider these

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.770
journalists whom I interviewed
back in

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.670
China my research subjects.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:35.610
They're my fellow journalists.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:43.270
I felt a very keen sense of
camaraderie with these people.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.540
And so these are not
interviews per se.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.250
These are conversations
conducted at various

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.730
occassions over their
own period of time.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.560
I do not just go in there and
put on the video and audio

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.770
tape and say, let's talk.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:59.600
No.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.170
A lot of conversations
conduct over dinner,

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.540
even over hot pot.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:11.700
And so this makes it easier for
people to be less guarded

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.370
and open up.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.920
But there is a very fine line.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.790
And I know and they know
there are certain

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.290
questions I cannot ask.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:24.510
Because it's easy for me to
come back, leave China.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:28.050
But people who are there
have to stay there.

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.300
And they have to live,
to make a living.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.040
So it was a very delicate
balance.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.080
I'm very careful not to ask
certain questions that will be

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.700
too provocative.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:46.290
And then also, a lot of the
high-profile interviewees or

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:53.390
my comrades back there, we grew
up under similar cultural

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.590
conditions around
the same age.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:59.550
And so there is a mutual
understanding there, too.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.560
So there's a trust there,
so that they get

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.800
to open up to me.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.780
And I can tell you that I did
not really put everything in

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.690
that book, because I, too,
have to exercise

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.550
some kind of control.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.350
There's an ethical
consideration.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.130
So yes, it's very candid.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.340
But it also walks a
very fine line.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.300
It works within the boundary.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.550
Let's put it that way.

00:43:24.932 --> 00:43:28.670
AUDIENCE: As CCTV America tries
to project China's soft

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.690
power, what is its metric
for success?

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:34.320
Because even in the US, there's
all these different

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.400
news outlets and organizations
and publications, and there's

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.960
no real consensus on many
important issues.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.320
So how does CCTV see itself
reaching its goal in terms of

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.090
changing America's
image of China?

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.230
PROFESSOR YING ZHU: Well, it'll
be interesting if they

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.010
actually have a goal.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.160
Well, their goal is very clear--
it's to project its

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.270
soft power.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.020
Whether they have a very
coherent strategy, I highly

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.060
doubt there is.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:08.080
And CCTV America and a lot of
CCTV's foreign services really

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.320
are straight-jacketed by
the heavy-handed policy

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.670
interference.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.600
So they're not left alone to
follow their professional

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.590
instinct, to do reporting,
and so on and so forth.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:27.220
So I don't think it is a real
strategy in capital terms or

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.840
in non-capital terms in
a strategy, per se.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.110
There's only goal, only wishful
thinking that if we

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.210
have the financial resources,
we can come over and we can

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.140
set up an outpost there.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:45.050
And we can hire your people
to broadcast for us.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.320
And it might soften up this
kind of propaganda tone a

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.080
little bit.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:54.470
But if you cannot really report
the major news items

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.990
that everybody else is
interested in, then you really

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.530
do not have the credibility.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.790
And if there's a strategy,
I'm not aware of it.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.640
And it's certainly
not succeeding.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.712
[APPLAUSE]
