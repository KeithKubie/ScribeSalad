00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.770
To get notifications about when
a user chooses a menu

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.210
item on one of the timeline
cards you insert for them, or

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.110
if they choose the sharing
contacts that you added for

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.940
them, you need to subscribe
to get all of those

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.260
notifications.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.285
And looks a little
bit like this.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.000
When the user chooses any of
those menu items or the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.910
sharing contact, we're going
to inform you through a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.010
notification, including the
collection that was affected,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.260
the item ID, and a little bit of
other information I'll show

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.650
you in a second.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.890
You can think of the
flow like this.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.440
First, your service subscribes
to notifications from Google.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.220
Now that's going to be a post
request where you insert a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.090
subscription into the
subscription collection.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.640
You're going to provide a little
bit of information like

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.750
what collection you're
subscribing to.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.520
You're going to tell us the user
token, the verify token.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.650
And probably most importantly,
you're going to provide a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.190
callback URL.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.060
And this is where Google
is going to send those

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.519
notifications.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.710
Once the subscription
is in place, this is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.690
what's going to happen.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.400
The user is going to
take some action.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.950
It's going to get transmitted
to Google.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.235
And then Google is going to
send you a notification.

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:20.790
Now in code, it'll look a
little bit like this.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.140
We're going to tell you the
collection that was affected,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.630
the specific item in that
collection that you should be

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.140
looking at, the operation, and
of course, the user token and

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.010
verify token that you
gave us previously.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.870
Now that you have this
notification, you can of

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.370
course, do with it,
as you will.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.280
If this is a menu item, a custom
menu item, you can

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.600
perform that action on
behalf of the user.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.880
If this is a sharing contact,
you can then share that image

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.380
as requested by the user.
