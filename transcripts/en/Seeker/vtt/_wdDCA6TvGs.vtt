00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
We’ve probably all experienced the feeling
of hunger - you feel dizzy, you get stomach

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.240
cramps and you have zero energy.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.510
But these symptoms are fleeting and usually
disappear once we eat our next meal.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:19.730
But what if you had nothing to eat, what happens
to your body when it’s starving?

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.090
Hey there, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.250
Starvation occurs when your body is consuming
fewer calories than those required to sustain

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.250
life.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.939
It is most commonly the result of famine,
extreme dieting, complete fasting for a cause,

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.010
or disease.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.489
Roughly one out of every nine people do not
have enough to eat, but despite this widespread

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.600
problem, starvation is not well understood.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.239
Not because it is not important, obviously,
but because it's difficult to systematically

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.530
study inanition or the impact of starvation
on the body.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.190
The lack of experimental data on the subject
is largely due to the fact that it is unethical

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.399
to conduct a study that requires participants
to go without food.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.610
And that its effects depend on many factors
- such as the weight of the person before

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.680
they began to starve, their genetic makeup,
their health and whether they are drinking

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
water.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.541
But what we do know comes from controversial
studies like Minnesota University’s starvation

00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:12.470
experiment from the 1940s.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.400
During World War II, famine became a pressing
issue for many countries around the world.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.020
At the time, scientists were eager to understand
what happened to the human body in the process

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.040
of starvation - partly because they wanted
to understand how to help patients recover

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040
from it.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.790
It is not as simple as allowing someone to
eat unlimited amounts of food - this can actually

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.330
make recovering patients sick because it’s
difficult for the body’s systems to rapidly

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.270
adjust to eating food again and because hungry
people tend to overeat to the point of vomiting.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.270
Not good.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.960
So the scientists at Minnesota University
recruited volunteers by offering military

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.130
men who had been drafted, the opportunity
to participate in their study in lieu of military

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.130
service.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.390
The 36 men who were finally selected were
all healthy conscientious objectors to the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.390
war.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.700
They were required to walk 35 kilometers a
week (22miles) throughout the entire study.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.390
During the first 12 week control period, the
men’s diets were regulated so that they

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.880
would reach an ideal healthy weight before
the semi-starvation phase - the second period

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880
in the study.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.840
In this semi-starvation period of 24 weeks,
the participants caloric intake was cut in

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.920
about half - from 3,000 to about 1500 calories.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.840
To get them as close to their goal of a 25%
total weight reduction, the researchers adjusted

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.800
the participants food portions.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.500
The researchers found, that in this semi-starvation
phase, participants went through a number

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.710
of changes.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.470
Due to extreme weight loss, the men displayed
physical symptoms like protruding ribs, sullen

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.610
eyes, and gaunt cheeks, as well as swollen
extremities likely from a lack of blood protein

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.610
production.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.660
Physiologically, their metabolic rates decreased
- meaning that their bodies reduced the number

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.180
of calories they expended while resting.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.310
Their heart rates dropped, temperature decreased,
libido declined, and breathing quieted.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.260
It was like their bodies were slowing down
to conserve as much energy as possible.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.960
Psychologically, the men became preoccupied
with food - talking, writing, and even dreaming

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
about it.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.640
They reported depressive symptoms, irritability,
and a lack of interest in everyday activities.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.480
Interestingly, while the men reported cognitive
deficits, the tests the researchers administered

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.790
did not confirm this.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.900
More recent studies on nutrient deficiencies,
however, have found that a lack of adequate

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.440
nutrition can negatively impact cognitive
function.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.040
Although the Minnesota study is over seventy
years old, this research is still the most

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.400
comprehensive look at how the body tries to
cope with starvation.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.190
Given that 795 million people suffer from
undernourishment around the world, it’s

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.740
evident that more research is needed.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.930
But the scientific dilemma is that starving
your research volunteers is highly unethical.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.740
Today, scientists must rely on gathering data
from autopsy and case studies - from sources

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.600
like victims of war who died of starvation.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.480
Through this new data, we have learned that
starvation affects children more intensely.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.570
It can permanently affect development - stunting
their growth and they are also more vulnerable

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.490
to dying - at about 32 days of complete starvation
compared to 70 days for adults.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.320
For children and adults alike, autopsy studies
have shown that when death occurs from starvation,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.240
the body has completely used up its fat reserves
and about 25-50% of other organs and tissues.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.440
This helps explain why the body can suffer
permanent organ damage when undernourished.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.420
But, this isn’t a thing of the past.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.550
In fact North Korea, has recently announced
to its citizens that they should prepare for

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.550
famine.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:46.720
To learn more, check my other episode on whether
North Korea is starving its citizens.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.060
