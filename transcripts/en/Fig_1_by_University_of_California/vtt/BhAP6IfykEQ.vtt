00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:03.489
A major focus of my lab is

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.410
understanding the mechanical properties
of biological materials.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.870
And that ranges from
animal cells to plant cells

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.100
and we're particularly interested in
understanding the cell nucleus

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.490
which is where most of the genomic material,
most of the DNA of the cells is contained

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.029
So there are many cells that appear in this

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.579
way such as cells in our blood, white blood cells.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.060
In some cases, however, the nucleus has a
different shape.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.060
So this is characteristic of some types of
cancer cells

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.260
where this increased volume it occupies inside
of the cell

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.379
is actually used as a marker for diagnosing
and even prognosing cancer --

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.570
some types of breast cancer, for example,
the more severe the shape irregularity, the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.710
worse the prognosis for breast cancer.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.739
This matters for disease -- so cancer cells,
for example, are softer,

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.739
more flexible than benign cells.
And in fact, when treated with different drugs,

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.670
they become stiffer.
So why is that? This is a good question, something

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.810
that we're trying to better understand.
In order to do this, we're building a lot

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.790
of new technologies to be able to probe
the texture or squishiness of individual cells

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.659
and nuclei.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.200
How do we probe the mechanical proprieties
of cells?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.600
These are very small objects: typically 10
microns or 20 microns, maybe more, in diameter.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.600
This requires using very small pieces of equipment.
One of the ways we do that is we build a tortuous

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.079
path,
fabricated into some silicon polymer,

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.189
commonly known as a microfluidic device.
And then we force the cells to squeeze through

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.110
these
narrow constrictions, which gives us some

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.549
indication of the
deformability of the whole cell.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.549
We image the cells and the deformations of
them

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.399
using microscopes and high speed cameras.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.329
So some of these technologies that we're developing
could have

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.259
eventually, a clinical impact.
They could be used by doctors to be able to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.920
diagnose or determine which
drug treatments might be most effective for

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.879
particular patients.
These are of course much longer term potential

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.940
applications,
but it's something that, another dimension

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.400
of our work that we're excited about.
