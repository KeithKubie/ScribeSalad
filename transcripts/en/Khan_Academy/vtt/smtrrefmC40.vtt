00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.860
Triangle ABC is a right
triangle with AC is equal to 7,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.950
BC is equal to 24, and
a right angle at C.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.289
So let's just try to draw that.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.580
And let's draw the right angle.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.288
Maybe we'll have to
use some coordinates.

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:17.170
So let's draw the right
angle at the origin.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.780
So let's say that this
is C right over here.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.260
AC is equal to 7.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.630
So A, we'll put over here.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.760
This distance over
here is going to be 7.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.970
And then we have the
hypotenuse of our triangle.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.840
And then this can be B. And
this distance over here-- they

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.720
tell us that BC is equal to 24.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.640
All right.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.840
Now, point M is
the midpoint of AB.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.260
So point M is right over here.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.930
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.810
Point M is the midpoint of AB.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.130
So this distance is
equal to that distance.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.150
And D is on the same side of
AB as C. So C is on this side,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.300
on I guess you'd call it the
bottom left-hand side of AB,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.810
so that AD is equal
to BD is equal to 15.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.240
So D is going to be
someplace over here.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.680
It's going to be equal
distance between A and B.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.110
Obviously, all of the points
equal distant between A and B

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.080
are going to sit on a line
that looks something like that.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080
This is the midpoint of AB.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.070
So D is going to
sit right over here.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.970
And it's 15 away
from both A and B.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.200
So it would look
something like that.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.620
That distance over there is 15.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.800
And then this distance over
here is also going to be 15.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.320
Given that the area of
triangle CDM-- this is D. So

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.390
CDM is the triangle that
they want to think about.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.790
Given that the area of triangle
CDM may be expressed as m times

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.460
the square root of n over
p, where m, n, and p are

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.722
positive integers and m
and p are relatively prime.

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:06.430
So that just means
you can't simplify it.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.199
And n is not divisible by
the square of any prime.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.840
So you've simplified the
radical as much as possible--

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.780
find m plus n plus p.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.960
So we essentially
need to find the area

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.120
of this green triangle,
of CDM over here.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.285
And so let's see what we
can do to figure it out.

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:27.910
So we could try some
of the coordinates

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.560
for some of these points.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.620
So this point
right over here, A,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.730
is going to be-- its x
value is going to be 7.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.230
I could draw the coordinate,
just so you see what I'm doing.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.190
That could be the x-axis.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.240
And then this side
is on the y-axis.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.040
So the coordinate for
A would be 7 comma 0.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.570
Coordinate for C
would be 0 comma 0.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.575
And the coordinate
for B would be 0, 24.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.906
So the coordinate for M would
just be the average of B and A.

00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:04.460
So the coordinate for M, the
average of 0 and 7 is 7/2.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.640
And the coordinate
for the y-coordinate,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.590
the average of 24 and 0, is 12.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.552
That's fair enough.

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:14.760
Now let's see what we can
figure out about the sides.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.260
So we know this is
a right triangle.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.090
So our gut reaction is always
to use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.990
We know this side and that side.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.680
So if we wanted
to figure out AB,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.880
we could just say
that-- we just know

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:37.060
that 24 squared plus 7 squared
is equal to AB squared.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.330
And 24 squared is 576, plus
49 is equal to AB squared.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.770
And let's see-- 576 plus 49.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.700
If it was plus 50, it would
get us to 626, but it's 1 less

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.200
than that.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.900
So it's 625.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.060
So 625 is equal to AB squared.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.720
So AB is going to equal 25.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.300
So this distance, the distance
of this big hypotenuse here,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.400
is 25.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.810
Or half of the
distance, this is going

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.070
to be 25/2, from B to M. From M
to A is also going to be 25/2.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.530
Now, the other thing we know
is that M right over here,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.710
the triangle CMA is
an isosceles triangle.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.470
How do we know that?

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.480
Well, M, if you look
at its x-coordinate--

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.720
its x-coordinate is directly
in between the x-coordinates

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.650
for C and A. 7/2--
it's the average.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.660
This is 7.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.540
This is 0.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.081
Its M-coordinate is
right over there.

00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.866
It's directly above the
midpoint of this base over here.

00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:52.740
So this is going to be
an isosceles triangle.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.300
It's symmetric.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.680
You could flip
the triangle over.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.750
So this length-- and
this seems useful

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.630
because this is kind of the base
of the triangle we care about.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.400
We could kind of view
this as the base of CDM--

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.210
this is also going to be 25/2.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.460
It's an isosceles triangle.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.543
This is going to be the
same as that because we're

00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:15.539
symmetric around
this right over here.

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.080
So let's see.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.702
We know one side
of this triangle.

00:05:18.702 --> 00:05:20.910
Let's see if we could figure
out this side over here.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.243
It seems pretty straightforward.

00:05:22.243 --> 00:05:25.880
This is going to be a right
triangle right over here,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.810
because this line
from D to M is going

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.770
to be perpendicular to AB.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.650
All of the points that are
equidistant between A and B

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.104
are going to be on a line
that is perpendicular to AB.

00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:41.770
So this is going to
be a right triangle.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.380
So we can figure out DM using
the Pythagorean theorem again.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:06:00.890
We get 25/2 squared
plus DM squared

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.109
is going to be
equal to 15 squared.

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:05.400
It's going to equal to the
hypotenuse of this triangle.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.500
So it's going to equal 225.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.650
And so what do we get?

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:20.779
We get DM squared is
equal to 225 minus 625/4.

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:21.820
So let's put this over 4.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.960
So 225 with 4 as the denominator
is the same thing as 900/4.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.800
And in the last video, I
actually mistakenly said 900/4

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.812
was 125, obviously a
boneheaded mistake.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.270
But the numbers
show up again here.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.050
So 225 is obviously 900/4.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.100
And then we're going to
subtract from that 625/4.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.870
And this is equal
to-- let's see.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.510
In our numerator, we
have 900 minus 625

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.860
would be 300 minus 20.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.870
It's going to be 275/4.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.390
And so DM is going to be equal
to the square root of this.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.660
So it's equal to the
square root of 275/4.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.380
275 is 25 times 11, because
25 times 12 would be 300.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.180
So 25 times 11 over 4.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.240
So this is going to be equal
to 5 square roots of 11 over 2.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.220
So DM is 5 square
roots of 11 over 2.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.560
So what we need to
do here is figure out

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.680
the height of this
triangle right over here.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.552
If we could figure out the
height of that triangle,

00:07:37.552 --> 00:07:38.510
we're pretty much done.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.320
1/2 the base times the height,
but we don't know-- let's see,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.720
we could figure that if we
know the law of cosines.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.095
We could do
something over there.

00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:50.319
If we know the sine of
this angle right over here,

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.860
the sine of that
angle is going to be

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.820
this height over the
side we just figured out.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.390
So if we could figure out
the sine of that angle,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.430
then we'd be done, or we'll
be very close to being done.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.306
But it's not any obvious way.

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:05.430
But one thing we can do,
if you look at this bigger

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.120
triangle over here--
so let me highlight it.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.760
So if you look at triangle BMC.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.990
Let me draw triangle BMC.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.342
Well, I'll just draw it on
this drawing right over here.

00:08:16.342 --> 00:08:17.800
I don't want to
get too overloaded.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.200
But triangle BMC
right over here--

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.830
we know this side is 25/2.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.890
We know this side
over here is 25/2.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.760
We know this side
over here is 24.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.470
And so what we want
to do is figure out

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.440
the sine of this angle right
here, the sine of theta,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.081
of angle CMD.

00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:40.039
Now, that's hard to do.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.850
But what we can
do is use the law

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.630
of cosines of theta plus 90.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.350
So let me redraw our triangle.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.000
So triangle BCM I
could redraw like this.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.450
It's actually an
isosceles triangle.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.535
So we have BCM.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.780
And what is this
angle right over here?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.950
It's going to be our theta that
we care about plus 90 degrees.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.550
So this angle right here
is theta plus 90 degrees.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.190
And this over here is 24.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.630
This is 25/2, and this is 25/2.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.790
And so using this, we could
use the law of cosines

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.480
to figure out what
theta actually is here.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.750
So let's do that.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.875
We're going to use a little
bit of trig identities,

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:27.960
but law of cosines.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.190
So we get the opposite
to the angle squared,

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.660
so we get 24 squared.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:44.080
24 squared is equal to 25/2
squared, plus 25/2 squared,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:54.460
minus 2 times 25/2 times 25/2
times the cosine of this angle,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.840
times-- let me scroll
over-- the cosine

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.676
of theta plus 90 degrees.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:05.300
Now, you're saying,
hey, Sal, you know,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.340
this has it in terms of cosine
of theta plus 90 degrees.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.190
How can we figure out
the sine of theta?

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.720
That's what we
actually care about,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.390
to figure out the
area of this triangle,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.080
or actually to figure out
the height of this triangle.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.520
And to do that, you just
have to make the realization.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.660
We know the trig identity
that the cosine of theta

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.780
is equal-- I won't use
theta because I don't want

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:34.250
to overload theta-- cosine of x
is equal to sine of 90 minus x.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:41.170
So the cosine of
theta plus 90 degrees

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.530
is going to be equal to
the sine of-- let me put it

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.280
in parentheses-- 90
minus whatever is here.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.070
90 minus theta minus 90,
which is equal to-- the 90's

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.844
cancel out-- sine
of negative theta.

00:10:56.844 --> 00:10:58.260
And we know sine
of negative theta

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.010
is equal to the
negative sine of theta.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.400
So this over here
simplifies to-- this

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.692
is the negative sine of theta.

00:11:06.692 --> 00:11:08.150
So we could write
the sine of theta

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.990
here and then put the
negative out here.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.680
And this becomes a positive.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.930
So what does this simplify to?

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.830
We have 24 squared,
which is 576.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.260
576 is equal to-- let's see.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.590
I won't skip any steps here.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.250
So we have 25 squared
plus 25 squared.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:40.620
This is 2 times 25/2
squared plus 2 times--

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:48.250
this is 25/2 squared
again-- times sine of theta.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.020
Now we just have to
solve for sine of theta.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.250
So this is going to
be equal to-- well,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:12:02.210
this is 576 is equal to
2 times 25/2 squared.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.620
I'm just factoring that out.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.760
1 plus sine of theta.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.194
Or we can just divide both sides
of the equation by this here.

00:12:12.194 --> 00:12:13.610
Actually, let me
just simplify it.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.770
This thing over here is
625/4, but then we're

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.150
going to multiply that by 2.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.300
So this thing over
here is 625/2.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.270
So let's divide both
sides of this by 625/2.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:35.660
And we get 576
times 2 over 625--

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.230
just multiplying both sides
by the inverse-- is equal to.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.730
When you multiply both sides
by the inverse [? like this, ?]

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:46.570
it actually cancels out-- is
equal to 1 plus sine of theta.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.880
Or we just subtract
1 from both sides.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.800
We get sine of theta is
equal to 576 times 2.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.460
Let's see, 76 times
2 is 152, plus 1,000.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.780
So it's 1,152/625.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.110
That's that part there, minus 1.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.750
But instead of 1,
let's say 625/625.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.650
So minus 625.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.140
And this is equal to-- I'll
have to do a little math

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:20.550
on the side-- so
1,152 minus 625.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.700
You get a 12 there.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.535
This becomes a 4.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.970
12 minus 5 is 7.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.845
4 minus 2 is 2.

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:27.990
11 minus 6 is 5.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.451
So this is equal to 527/625.

00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.950
Now, you might not realize it,
but we're in the home stretch

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.050
now.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.510
Let me draw this CDM
triangle, the one that

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.100
is really the focus
of the problem.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.440
And let me draw it a
little bit differently.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.050
Let me draw it
slightly differently.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.550
So now we know some very
interesting things about CDM.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.410
So this is C, this
is D, and this

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.020
is M. We know this
side over here.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.675
We figured out it's
5/2 square root of 11.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.860
That's the length of DM.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:10.610
We also know that CM
right over here is 25/2.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:19.470
We also know that sine of
theta here is equal to 527/625.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.130
That's what we just figured out.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.930
And we can use that to figure
out the height of this triangle

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.336
because we know that sine is the
opposite over the hypotenuse,

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.960
if we draw a right
triangle right here.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.560
So sine of theta,
which is 527/625,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.910
is equal to the opposite,
is equal to the height

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.920
of this triangle,
over the hypotenuse,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.950
over 5/2 square roots of 11.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:52.220
So we can multiply both sides
of this by 5/2 square roots 11.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.960
And we get the height
of the triangle

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:05.730
is equal to 527/625 times
5/2 square roots of 11.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:11.150
And let's see, we can divide--
625 divided by 5 is 125.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.060
So you get a 1 here.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.840
And you have a 125 over here.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.370
So this is equal
to 527 square roots

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:28.060
11 over 125 times
2, which is 250.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.070
That's the height.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.160
Now, what's the area
of the triangle?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.320
It's 1/2 base times height.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:42.560
Area is equal to 1/2 base,
which is 25/2, times the height,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:50.330
which we just figured out is
527 square roots of 11 over 250.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.480
Let's see.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.820
Divide the numerator by 25.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.220
Divide the denominator by 25.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.620
You get a 10 there.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:02.430
So this is equal to 527 square
roots of 11 over 2 times

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.150
2 times 10, which is 40.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.090
So that's our area.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.180
And the whole
problem-- they didn't

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.221
want us to find the area.

00:16:08.221 --> 00:16:12.340
They wanted us to find
m plus n plus p, so they

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.183
want us to find essentially
527 plus 11 plus 40.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:29.610
So 527 plus 11 is-- let me
make sure I do this-- 538,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.320
and then plus 40 is 578.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.180
And we're done.
