00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
So, we have another kind of very
interesting piece of the course

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.350
right now.  We're going to continue
to talk about genetics, except now

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.833
we're going to talk about the
genetics of diploid organisms, which

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.716
apart from bacteria, most of the
organisms including us are diploid.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.733
They have more than one copy of each
chromosome, and so we'll go through

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.883
a segment on this, and also talk
about mitosis and meiosis, the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.766
central processes of cell division
and the segregation of genetic

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.983
material that underlie
life as we know it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.533
And then, were going to charge into
a session of recombinant DNA, and

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:47.266
some of these technologies, PCR and
various things that you see in the

00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:51.932
newspapers all the time.  And then,
I'll finish up with the session on

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:56.264
the immune system, which a few of
you thought was surprising that

00:00:56.664 --> 00:01:01.064
bacteria recombine.  I'll tell you
in that system it will feel like

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:05.065
science fiction relative to what
I've told you up to now.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.666
It's an absolutely amazing system.
So, we are going to start today with

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.832
genetics of diploid organisms.  So
I'm going to go back to how this was

00:01:16.332 --> 00:01:20.532
first understood.  And most of you
have probably heard of Gregor

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:26.031
Mendel, who discovered this, and
surely some fraction of you have run

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:30.864
into an exposure to this topic
before.  But in keeping with what

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:36.032
I'm trying to do in this course,
could you guys watch out there?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.049
I think I'm just going to unplug,
yeah, it's OK.  I think I'm just

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:41.464
going to unplug it for just a minute
here.  You've probably heard of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.950
Mendel.  Some of you have seen these
different squares.  You might have

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:49.903
memorized it from a textbook or
something like that.  I'm going to

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:54.189
try and see if we can go through
this material up another level of

00:01:58.428 --> 00:01:58.809
sophistication because, again, and
I'm saying, science didn't just come

00:02:02.713 --> 00:02:06.246
down from on high and end up with
facts in a textbook.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.285
What's in a textbook is somebody's
effort to take a current state of

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:11.199
understanding which is based on
experimentation and come up with

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:15.847
models.  And what you're seeing in
the textbooks are the models such as

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:23.145
they were as of the time the
textbook was submitted for

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:24.145
publication.  Sometimes they change
even before the textbooks get out.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.709
But anyway, it's a process.
Mendel was one of the starting

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:32.591
people who started this process,
really a key figure, and a guy with

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:36.608
an amazing intellect.  But before we
start in, I just want to show you a

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:40.025
couple of pictures because these
kind of knocked me over when I saw

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:43.508
them.  I don't know what kind of
image you have of Mendel.  You

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:47.525
probably know he was a monk, and he
did something with peas, and he

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:51.075
figured out this stuff about
genetics.  And most people probably

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.108
carry around an image probably
somewhat like this sort of

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.858
romanticized drawing.
He was a monk all right, but it was

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:07.476
at an Augustine monastery in Bruno
in Austria that was a very major

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:13.362
intellectual center.  They even
published a scientific journal.

00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:20.116
They sent Mendel off to Vienna to go
to university.  While he was there,

00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:26.270
he studied physics, math, as well as
botany.  So he had, in many ways, a

00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:31.757
background that is very similar to
you guys, very heavy on the

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:37.978
quantitative physical science,
mathematical sort of background.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.400
And then he went on to do some
experiments in biology.  And I think

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.466
you maybe can get a sense of this.
You can see a picture of what Mendel

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.000
actually looked like.  Here's one
picture of him.  But the one that

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.733
really blew me away, I have a
picture of the monks.  Just think of

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.866
what ever image you had of the monks
that Mendel was at.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.591
Well there's a picture of them.  To
me, they look nothing so much like a

00:04:08.142 --> 00:04:08.200
group of university presidents or
something sitting around for a

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:12.475
portrait.  And he traveled very
widely.  Here he was on his way to

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:16.750
London here.  Here is a picture of
him with a group of people on his

00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:21.090
way to, I think he was in Paris on
his way to London.  So this wasn't a

00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:25.101
little isolated monk in a garden who
stumbled across stuff.  He was a

00:04:28.856 --> 00:04:32.989
rather sophisticated guy going after
some interesting problems.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.333
And this was the garden in which he
did his experiments.  Here's a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.600
picture of it.  So this was a
straightforward experimental setup

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.866
for these really amazing things he
did.  So, with that kind of

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.600
background, Mendel was interested in
a problem of inheritance.  And

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.866
people have been aware that traits
were inherited.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.733
That was the whole principle of
domesticating animals and

00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:08.942
domesticating crops, that if you
took parents with certain

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:14.817
characteristics and crossed them
together, the offspring then had the

00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:20.226
traits that were associated with the
parents.  And so people were able to

00:05:20.568 --> 00:05:25.101
get better domesticated animals or
better domesticated crops.  But up

00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:30.245
until then, this mixing was thought
of sort of like blending liquids,

00:05:30.856 --> 00:05:34.856
stir together some green and red,
and a little this and that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.533
And it all stirred together.  And as
you'll see, what one of Mendel's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.600
great insights was, was that it
wasn't like mixing liquids.  And to

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.866
study this problem, then, he picked
a system.  It wasn't that he was

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.266
just fiddling around with peas.  He
was a pretty sophisticated guy, and

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.866
he picked peas as an experimental
organisms for three reasons.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.533
And so, why peas?  Well one, they
were easy to grow, and that's still

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.333
a major consideration of any model
system that you want to use and

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.333
science today.  It's really tricky
to grow, it's very hard to work

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.400
with.  It was easy to pollinate in a
controlled way.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.666
Just the structure of the pea flower
makes it very easy to make sure to

00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:40.379
either put the pollen right on the
pistol of that same flower,  which

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:46.225
is a kind of self fertilization, or
to make sure that the pollen goes

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:52.138
from one flower to another, which is
basically cross-pollination.  And

00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:57.517
the third thing, and this was a
really important thing, was the

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.563
system was worked on before.  And
there were a number of what were

00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:09.142
called pure-breeding lines.
If he had just grabbed peas out of

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:10.948
the wild it would be sort of like me
starting to do genetics by crossing

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:14.250
a couple of you guys.  We'd get
offspring, all right, and we'd cross

00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:17.887
those offspring, we'd keep getting
things, people that look different

00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:21.526
and different, maybe something like
the parents, but what had happened

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.231
with peas is people had taken a pea,
and then they continually inbred it

00:07:27.642 --> 00:07:31.108
until it finally sort of settled
down.  It always had

00:07:31.214 --> 00:07:34.347
white flowers.
It always had wrinkled seeds.  It

00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:35.600
always had whatever the particular
trait was.  And so, I think I showed

00:07:39.198 --> 00:07:39.666
you this slide earlier.  This shows
two things.  You can see there are

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.529
smooth seeds and then wrinkled
seeds.  And it may be a little hard

00:07:47.464 --> 00:07:48.063
to tell in this light, but there is
sort of two colors here.  One's kind

00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:51.797
of greenish and one's sort of
yellowish.  So there, you see two of

00:07:55.732 --> 00:07:56.264
the traits right there.  There were
also flower colors, and height, and

00:07:59.866 --> 00:08:02.532
other things that had the
characteristic.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.666
They were pure breeding.  Every time
you took that line and if you self

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:14.351
crossed it and put out its progeny,
you'd see the same characteristic

00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:20.169
each time.  So, this was the system
that Mendel started to study this

00:08:21.454 --> 00:08:25.987
problem of inheritance.  And how
does blending come together when two

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:32.005
organisms brought pollen?  Or, if it
was other animals like us, it would

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.556
be sperm and egg.
But somehow, you did something that

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.283
ended up giving you an egg that got
fertilized.  And out of that came

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.716
the progeny.  So, what Mendel did,
the term that's used, they say he

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.016
carried out a cross.  This is
genetic-speak here now.  So he took

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.716
pollen from one plant.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.533
And used it to fertilize another
plant, collected the seeds that came

00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:20.865
out of this, and he examined the
progeny.  And I think an interesting

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:26.599
way of thinking about this
is a UROP project.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.466
You'd come into Mendel's lab and
wanted to do a UROP project, it was

00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:40.501
pretty easy.  I could probably show
you all the techniques you needed to

00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:44.802
know, and this is it.  I'd show
how you pollinate, collect seeds,

00:09:45.304 --> 00:09:49.370
and then we'd look at the
characteristics.  So, it's just some

00:09:50.074 --> 00:09:54.540
fairly simple manipulations and some
observational stuff.  So, let's

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:59.510
suppose you're doing Mendel's thing
as a UROP project, and let’s just

00:09:59.614 --> 00:10:03.747
see where that will take us.
So, what Mendel did to begin with,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.700
he took one of these pure breeding
lines that was smooth or I'll

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.033
abbreviated as a capital S.  And he
pollinated it with something that

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.900
was wrinkled.  I'll do that as
little S.  And then he collected the

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.566
seeds from what's known as the first
generation, starting with

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.166
something like this.
And geneticists use the term F1 for

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:45.599
this first generation in a cross
like this, and what he found was

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:54.465
everything, all the seeds, were
smooth.  So, the wrinkled trait had,

00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:00.331
if you will, disappeared.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.133
That's your first UROP experiment.
Time to submit to nature, or

00:11:22.332 --> 00:11:26.865
science, or something, and write a
little paper like Watson and Crick

00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:31.332
that turns the world on its end.
What would you do next?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.333
No gels, no Whitehead Sequencing
Facility.  Anybody got any ideas?

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.850
I've showed you all the techniques
that he knew about.  Pardon?  Cross

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.166
it again?  What's your thinking?  Do
you think the traits disappear, or

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.216
do you think it's hiding?  It might
be hiding, right?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.600
I don't know what he thought, but I
think that's a reasonable to think

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.666
about it is he's probably trying to
figure out, did this wrinkled trait

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.466
just disappear from the face of the
Earth,  or is it hiding in those

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.400
first-generation seeds?  So, let's
put that up here.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.733
So, that's exactly what he did.  So,
he took these seeds, now, that were

00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:41.266
the smooth F1.  These are not the
same smooth as the parental up here.

00:12:43.332 --> 00:12:47.532
Just to make clear, you guys
understand these are pure breeding.

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:54.664
These are the ones that people have
been breeding for a long time, this

00:12:56.665 --> 00:13:00.265
one and this one. In this
case, even though I'm drawing

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.350
it in circles, this is a smooth F1,
smooth F1.  And, this time when he

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.450
did the experiment he looked at the
second generation, or the F2

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.283
generation as a geneticist would
call it.  What he found, he got some

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.716
smooth and he got some wrinkled.
So, the wrinkled trait reemerged in

00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:48.533
the F2.  So it wasn't really gone.
It was hiding.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.333
OK, time to submit to Nature,
Science or Cell.  Got it?  He didn't

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.866
try and publish it at that point.
He did something else.  He had the

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.200
same kind of background you guys
have.  Can you think what he might

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.666
have done?  He could cross again.
There's something else he did with

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.000
this experiment, though.  Well,
you're thinking of new experiments.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.800
He's got a little data processing he
can do here.  What did you say?  I'm

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.600
not able to hear, sorry.
Statistics, OK.  I'll simplify it

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:55.199
even slightly before that.  I've got
some of each.  Count them, right,

00:14:57.399 --> 00:15:01.799
exactly.  So that's what he did, and
I think the numbers were, if I

00:15:04.199 --> 00:15:05.665
remember 5474
and 1850.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.533
So, what should I do now?  Ratio?
Absolutely.  We could count another

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.216
million of them, but that probably
would not be terribly productive.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.100
And what he found out is that when
he did that, he found that he got a

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.516
ratio that was pretty
close to 3:1.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.333
And, so that was sort of what he
found out from this by doing this

00:15:41.332 --> 00:15:45.732
sort of thing over again was a
pattern.  A trait disappeared in the

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:56.866
F1.  The trait reemerged in the F2,
and the two traits had this.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.733
The ratio of the two traits would be
about 3:1.  If you don't think this

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.100
is sort of like a UROP project or
something, that's a page out of some

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.533
of Mendel's actual notes while he
was doing his crosses.  And what he

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.500
did next, then, was to take
some other traits.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.400
Yeah?  Sorry?  Excuse me?  Reemerged
in F2.  So, he took some other

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.830
traits, white and purple flowers,
tall, short, I found that there were

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.660
at least certain other traits.  It
didn't work for everything he

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.156
studied, but some of them he could
see the same pattern.  One of the

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.520
traits disappeared.  It reemerged in
the F2, and when he counted them,

00:16:56.151 --> 00:17:00.417
he'd find that the trait that
reemerged was at one, and the other

00:17:01.383 --> 00:17:05.916
one there were three times as many.
So, he'd seen a pattern.  And all

00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:11.211
he's done at this point is to cross
flowers and count the progeny.  So,

00:17:11.635 --> 00:17:15.768
at that point Mendel tried to
explain his data.  So, he had to,

00:17:16.725 --> 00:17:21.125
now, take the next part of the
scientific process.  And what's kind

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:26.082
of nice about thinking about Mendel,
in this sense, is we are not

00:17:26.908 --> 00:17:29.374
overwhelmed by complicated
techniques.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.944
You can see, I think, the scientific
process.  And it's a very bare bones

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:36.666
thing marching along.  So now he's
got some data.  He's quantitated his

00:17:39.712 --> 00:17:40.456
stuff.  He's found it reproducible.
It's not only for seeds.  It seems

00:17:43.568 --> 00:17:44.376
to be some general feature.  And the
thing about this, I guess, I don't

00:17:47.426 --> 00:17:48.101
know what he thought but it seems to
be likely that he could see that

00:17:51.284 --> 00:17:51.826
this didn't fit very well with the
blending idea.  Like, you'd pour

00:17:55.142 --> 00:17:58.342
together two liquids, and
you'd stir them all up.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Instead, he really made this
monumental leap in thinking that

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:08.024
genetic information must come in
some sort of particular form, come

00:18:08.248 --> 00:18:12.781
in particles, or units, or quanta if
you want to think about if it if

00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:17.405
you're a physicist.  We know those
units as genes right now.  We grow

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:22.096
up with it right now, but to go from
the idea that genetic information

00:18:22.122 --> 00:18:26.388
was kind of like two liquids
blending to the idea it was a little

00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:31.280
particle, so it was just about the
same kind of leap as thinking that

00:18:31.373 --> 00:18:35.573
energy comes in particles instead of
a continuous sort of thing.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.266
So, that was the kind of insight
that Mendel had.  And so genetic

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.133
info comes in particles, units.
I was going to say, we now call

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.756
these genes, and if that was what it
was then he started to think about

00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:14.004
these traits as particles that had a
different character associated with

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:20.253
each of them.  That would mean there
would be one particle that was a big

00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:25.768
S, and that was smooth.  There was
some other particle that was

00:19:27.817 --> 00:19:32.217
specified.  The wrinkled character,
that would be called a small s.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.200
So, what was happening in these
crosses, then, he was now mixing

00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:42.926
particles instead of liquids.
Again, I don't know how he got to,

00:19:43.452 --> 00:19:48.118
how many particles there had to be
of each per organism.  It could have

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.846
been anywhere from two upwards.  He
had to have two in order to explain

00:19:52.908 --> 00:19:57.441
the sort of stuff he was working
with.  There's no reason he couldn't

00:19:57.635 --> 00:20:02.168
have thought of 12 or something.
But I assume you start with the very

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:08.332
simplest thing, number that you can
think of, and see if you can make

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:15.132
this work.  So, what he
hypothesized, then, was that each

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:23.599
organism had two copies of each of
these particles.  So, two copies of

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:30.465
each particle, so this would mean
that there were two types

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:37.199
of particles.
So, there would be the S and the

00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:46.104
smooth.  So, he can get three types
of things.  He could get one that

00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:53.113
was both big S or smooth.  Or you
could have the ones that were the

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:58.789
two little S's.  And these
would be wrinkled.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.800
Or, if you had the other
combination, what he figured out,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.600
what fit with this model is these
would have to be smooth.  That would

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.533
have to mean that one of them is
dominant over the other when you put

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.866
them in combination.  So, in this
thing, the big S would be

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.733
said to be dominant.
And the little s Would be said to be

00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:36.793
recessive.  There's another little
term here that I'm going to

00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:42.847
introduce because it'll help us talk
about this stuff over the next few

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:48.235
days, terms geneticists use all the
time.  Because these both have two

00:21:49.089 --> 00:21:53.422
of the same, they're said to be
homozygous, do the same.  And this

00:21:54.544 --> 00:21:57.810
one, with one of each, is said to be
heterozygous.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.400
OK, so there is, I think, sort of
the setup for Mendel's model.  He

00:22:05.818 --> 00:22:10.151
had to contend with one other issue,
though, and that was if every

00:22:11.636 --> 00:22:15.702
organism has two, and two parents
get together and each donate

00:22:17.454 --> 00:22:22.254
something, unless you did something,
the offspring would have four.  When

00:22:23.272 --> 00:22:27.138
those offspring got together, the
next one would have twice

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.423
as many, and so on.
So, from probably, I don't know

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:38.932
whether it was just from first
principles, but I would imagine he

00:22:39.998 --> 00:22:44.598
figured out that if organisms had
sex with pollen and whatever, or egg

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.930
and sperm, that something had to be
done to get around this problem of

00:22:50.663 --> 00:22:54.796
an ever increasing number of
particles.  So, he envisioned that

00:22:55.997 --> 00:23:00.263
when there were specialized cells
for sex, and that they have the

00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:05.997
number so that the sex cells would
have half the number of particles so

00:23:06.665 --> 00:23:10.531
that when each parent donated one,
you'd be back up to two.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.733
It's pretty simple, straightforward
thinking once you've gotten the idea

00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:23.532
that these things are coming in a
particular form.  So, with this,

00:23:26.399 --> 00:23:30.732
could he now explain his results?
Let's do it over here.  So, what

00:23:34.222 --> 00:23:39.022
happened in the first cross?  He had
a smooth, pure breeding line crossed

00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:47.066
with, so the sex cells from this,
each one would have been a big S,

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.510
and the sex cells from each one of
this would have been a little s.

00:23:59.554 --> 00:24:03.754
And as you recall, what he got was
all smooth, right?  Remember?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.933
So, if we try and figure out what's
happening here, a way of

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.866
representing this would be to think
what happens if all of the

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.133
combinations that you could get, so
if we paired them in all possible

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.000
ways, then every combination would
be identical from that first cross,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.800
one from one parent,
one from the other.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.600
And, if one was dominant over the
other, it's going to look like this.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.776
This is really the word I
introduced you to.  That's the

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.553
genotype.  That's what's going on
down at the genetic level.  What

00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:55.932
you're seeing up here is the
observable characteristics

00:24:57.444 --> 00:25:00.710
of the organism.
That would be the phenotype.  So,

00:25:03.777 --> 00:25:08.243
then what would happen then with
this if he crossed the F1's?  Well,

00:25:11.332 --> 00:25:16.132
as you recall, they were smooth, but
he was now seeing them as being like

00:25:18.887 --> 00:25:23.420
this.  So that means that the sex
cells that are generated from this,

00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:29.776
each one will generate one big S,
and one little s.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.333
And then, if you put them together
to see how this would work out,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.600
well, this one's two big S's.  This
is a big S and a little s, a big S

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.600
and a little s, and two little s's.
So, what he's got over here is SS,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.400
Ss, and ss in a ratio of 1:2:1.
But when you look at the phenotype,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.600
what would we expect?  Well, this
would be smooth, big S and little s.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.333
That's smooth.  Big S, little s,
smooth again, and two little s's,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.266
that's wrinkled.
There's his ratio of 3:1.  Has he

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.700
proved anything?  It works.
Beautiful.  The model must be right?

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.966
What do you think?  Are you ready
to publish?  Why is that?  Why did

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.633
the model work?
Has the model predicted anything

00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:02.271
yet?  No, it works because it
describes the data.  To some extent,

00:27:06.186 --> 00:27:06.528
it's kind of like hitting a curve.
You said it, but you don't really

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.719
know yet.  Of course it's going to
work, because if you got different

00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:14.509
data it would've had a different
model.  So, you're putting your

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:18.767
finger on a really important point,
and that is that you can do an

00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:26.750
experiment.  You can get data.  It
doesn't have to involve DNA

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.610
sequencing or fancy techniques.
You're getting data out of

00:27:30.936 --> 00:27:34.402
a biological system.
You've come up with a hypothesis

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:39.949
that explains it.  But of course
it's going to explain it because you

00:27:40.248 --> 00:27:44.981
wouldn't publish a model that didn't
explain your own data.  But what he

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.280
hasn't done is tested it.  Will his
model predict the outcome of

00:27:49.914 --> 00:27:54.314
something that he hasn't already
done?  So, the suggestion was that

00:27:54.748 --> 00:27:58.481
he should carry out another cross.
And that's what Mendel

00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:02.782
then did again.
This is what he had to work with.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.233
He could cross, and he could count,
and he could do some calculating and

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.166
some thinking.  But, those were the
techniques.  I really like thinking

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.233
about this, because you can sort of
put yourself in his shoes.  So, what

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.900
would you guys like to cross?  We
haven't got much, right?  One, he

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:38.166
did.  One cross he did, the F1 with
the homozygous dominant parent, the

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.100
pure breeding lines.
So, he's got this smooth, that's a

00:28:47.571 --> 00:28:51.904
big S and a little s, and he's
crossing it with something, two big

00:28:54.713 --> 00:28:59.379
S's.  So, the sex cells that you'll
get out of this, so if you set this

00:29:01.855 --> 00:29:04.788
one up and see what happens,
there's the two.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.466
You will get to big S's, big S,
little S, the big S, little S.  This

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.933
is sort of uninformative.  If you
want to look at your notes

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.400
afterwards, and have this be
consistent, let me just

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.533
flip this slightly.
I put the two big S's up here, and

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:37.350
this is our F1 down here.  That way
I'll be following the same pattern

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.450
as I did before.  OK, so there we
are.  In any case, they're all

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:48.150
smooth, but that's not particularly
helpful.  He's seen that result

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.650
before.  It hasn't really proven
out.  Given the sort of unexpected

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.883
result that's predicted by his
model.  But he tried another one

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:04.316
that's very, very similar.
And in this case, he crossed the F1

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.766
with the homozygous recessive
parent.  This is a really important

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.900
process in genetics.
And the reason, because it's so

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.166
important, it's given a special term
that's called a test cross.  Let's

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.966
see what happens with this one,
because this one's more interesting.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.900
So, we take the F1.  So, this is
the F1.  He's now crossing it with

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.966
this homozygous recessive, so a
parent that's got two particles that

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.166
are little s. And so,
will the sex cells look like this:

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.333
a big S little s as before, two
little S's here?  So, if we set up

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.466
this, as we've done, there are the
sex cells from this F1.  Here are

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.666
the sex cells from the homozygous,
recessive parent.  Up here, we get a

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.533
big S and a little s for
each of those.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.466
But here, we get two little s's.
So, if we look at the phenotype, if

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.266
you're out on the field or out in
the garden sitting in the kitchen,

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.200
after you brought your seeds in or
wherever he was working, what would

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.600
you predict you'd see in a cross
like this?  These would be both

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.866
smooth, but these would
both be wrinkled.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.533
So, here at the genotypic level,
we've got a ratio, now, of 1:1.  And

00:32:10.444 --> 00:32:15.044
here as well, there's now a ratio of
1:1.  So, there you have a result

00:32:16.888 --> 00:32:21.421
that you haven't seen before.  And,
if you do that cross and get that

00:32:23.332 --> 00:32:27.332
result, again, it doesn't prove your
model.  Scientific proof

00:32:29.777 --> 00:32:33.110
is never a QED.
Somebody can always come up with an

00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:39.983
experiment tomorrow that disproves
it.  It tends to work more.  You

00:32:40.749 --> 00:32:45.082
just keep shoveling on evidence, and
finally someone says, enough,

00:32:45.915 --> 00:32:50.515
enough, I believe you.  So, this was
at least a test of the model, and

00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:55.814
the model survived this task.  Now,
he did one other experiment.  Of the

00:32:56.248 --> 00:33:00.914
things that we've got on our plate
right now, is there anything else we

00:33:01.416 --> 00:33:05.482
might do you can think of?
He did another cross.  Pardon?  Two

00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:13.433
of the heterogeneous ones? We did
the F1's against each other.  That's

00:33:18.499 --> 00:33:23.099
where we got the 3:1.  We've already
crossed the F1's, but I like your

00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:32.299
idea.  What if we took the F2's?
In this case, it's going to be

00:33:35.454 --> 00:33:39.720
pretty complicated because they've
got this 2:1:1, but one of the

00:33:40.362 --> 00:33:44.895
things you can do with peas is you
can self fertilize them as well as

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:49.603
cross them with their neighbors
because they've got the ability to

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:54.445
make the eggs.  It'll become the
seeds, and they have the pollen,

00:33:55.089 --> 00:33:58.755
which would be equivalent to the
sperm.  So it got both.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.666
So, as long as there's some plants
that you can self fertilize and some

00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:11.255
you can't, one of the really nice
things about peas, they have the

00:34:13.844 --> 00:34:17.977
property that you can self fertilize
them.  So, another kind of

00:34:20.766 --> 00:34:25.232
experiment that Mendel did, then,
was to self fertilize another test

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:32.156
of the model, self fertilize the
F2's.  Well, the model predicts, if

00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:39.280
we look back over there, that what
you'll have there is a mix of things

00:34:41.538 --> 00:34:45.138
in a ratio of 1:2:1.
So, if you were to take seeds from

00:34:47.142 --> 00:34:47.457
that F2, and then cross them with
themselves, you could figure out all

00:34:51.427 --> 00:34:51.741
the different outcomes, and then sum
them up.  You'd have a prediction

00:34:55.713 --> 00:34:57.913
for what this model
would suggest.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.400
All right, so let me just take you
through the pieces.  Let's think

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.266
about a quarter of them, according
to the model, a quarter are that.

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:18.199
So, if we self cross those, what we
should get is all wrinkled because

00:35:20.399 --> 00:35:25.132
the only thing we're dealing with is
the wrinkled trait.  So, that would

00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:31.665
be a quarter of the F2 seeds would
be expected to give that outcome.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.066
So, three quarters of them are
smooth, but it's tricky because

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.266
there's two types of them in there,
right?  So, of these, one third are

00:35:57.199 --> 00:36:01.599
this, and two thirds have that.
So, what would happen if we thought

00:36:06.272 --> 00:36:10.472
about each of those individually,
and thought about the outcome?

00:36:12.816 --> 00:36:17.349
Well, if we take the SS type, and
we've self crossed them, what we're

00:36:19.361 --> 00:36:23.894
going to get is all smooth because
all we've got in the cross are the

00:36:25.907 --> 00:36:29.440
traits for the smooth
characteristic.  And, if we take

00:36:32.453 --> 00:36:36.653
these guys and we've self-crossed
them, we've already done that.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.733
We know what we will get is we will
get smooth to wrinkled in a ratio of

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.900
3:1.  So, again, you could now sit
down with that and figure out in

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.400
total what you would predict in
terms of smooth and wrinkled if you

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.700
self crossed the F2, and if
the model is correct.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.266
So, that was basically your first
UROP project, or the end of the

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:19.532
first term, or the first year, or
something like that.  And he did

00:37:21.399 --> 00:37:25.599
publish those results that were
published in 1866, which was the

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:32.132
same year as those, about the same
time as those results that Pasteur

00:37:33.799 --> 00:37:36.932
was publishing that I told
you about earlier on.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.733
So, it was a very impressive in
retrospect, a truly major

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.636
intellectual leap.  But, it had
almost no impact at all on the

00:37:53.142 --> 00:37:56.875
world.  And there's a theme here
that it sort of tried to

00:37:59.713 --> 00:38:03.446
hit up several times.
And we saw it, to some extent, with

00:38:05.214 --> 00:38:05.386
the early work on DNA, that someone
can get evidence for an idea.  But

00:38:09.642 --> 00:38:09.680
if the scientific community is ready
to accept it, it can take quite

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.470
awhile before that idea becomes
credible even if it's correct.  The

00:38:18.498 --> 00:38:18.536
data was there.  The DNA was genetic
material quite a bit before the

00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:23.030
general scientists thought it was,
and it just seemed like it was too

00:38:27.355 --> 00:38:31.288
simple a molecule, too boring a
molecule to be possibly able

00:38:31.784 --> 00:38:35.384
to encode anything.
And the same sort of thing happened

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.916
here.  It was some geneticists
picked up on this but not

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.883
until about 1900.
