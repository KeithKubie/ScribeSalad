In the quiz before this one, we said that if we wanted to increase each

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.875
potential wiper set price by $4, we should replace c with c plus 4. So that's

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.794
exactly what I've done. In our new equation, everywhere we had the quantity c in

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:18.228
the old equation, we now have a c plus 4. Note that we need to insert c plus 4

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:23.119
with parentheses around it so that whatever operator was applied to c applies to

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.303
both parts of c and of 4. Now, we just need to simplify this expression. After a

00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:36.193
few steps, we finally get to a final equation of p equals negative 200 c squared

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:38.780
plus 18,400 c minus 133,200.
