00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.002
- [Voiceover] All right, Kim.

00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:03.836
So where we left off, Lincoln gets elected

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.287
in November of 1860.

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:08.668
He's not inaugurated
until we get into 1861.

00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:11.201
Shortly after his inauguration,
you have the whole situation

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:14.651
at Fort Sumter, which is really
the start of the Civil War.

00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:16.120
We don't have the first major battle

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.690
until we get to Bull Run.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.130
And the overall theaters of war,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.136
we have this corridor
here in the Northeast

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:24.582
in Virginia and Maryland.

00:00:24.582 --> 00:00:27.802
And you also have it in the
west along the Mississippi.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:29.941
And the North, the strategy is

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.341
well let's use our industrial base.

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.887
Let's use our larger population.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:34.529
Let's use our navy to see

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.147
if we can essentially blockade the South.

00:00:37.147 --> 00:00:38.715
Well the South says, "Hey
we have the home court.

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:39.873
"We have better leadership.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.611
"We just need to outlast the North."

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:44.273
And so what happens as we get started,

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:48.030
we talked about Bull Run
being the first major battle.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.943
Who kind of

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:54.032
comes out better in some
of these first engagements?

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:56.198
- [Voiceover] Well I think
it's a surprise to everyone

00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:00.149
when the South does much
better in the first year

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.581
of the war than the North.

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:06.305
Knowing the major advantages
that the North has

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:10.284
in industrial power, in railroads,

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:13.252
and just in the sheer number of people,

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:18.374
it's very surprising that the leadership

00:01:18.374 --> 00:01:21.493
in the South does such an incredible job

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:24.147
of really blocking the North's advances.

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:27.330
The North is attempting to take Richmond,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.719
and Lee repeatedly keeps

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.887
General McClellan from
getting to Richmond.

00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:36.600
- [Voiceover] Right and
then Lee actually goes

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.732
on the offensive to some degree.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.489
The South essentially wins in Bull Run,

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:41.762
and they have a series of victories

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.923
as you mentioned in year one.

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:48.838
- [Voiceover] Right, so one
problem that the North has

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:52.034
is that Lincoln's generals

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:54.629
are just not nearly as skilled.

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.265
George B. McClellan
that we've talked about,

00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:01.687
his idea of the South's power is perhaps

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.518
considerably greater than
the South's actual power.

00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:08.371
As he is forever telling
Lincoln, "I need more troops.

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:09.882
"I need more supplies.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:12.319
"Send me more things."

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.200
He loves parading his army,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.655
but I think he was actually

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:18.689
a little too close to the troops himself.

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.184
He was really afraid to lose anyone,

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.304
which made him very popular with the army,

00:02:23.304 --> 00:02:27.227
but drove Lincoln crazy
because the North comes out

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:30.189
with this really strong numeric

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.206
and industrial advantage.

00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:36.134
And as McClellan delays,
it gives the South time

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:38.636
to build things up over and over again.

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:41.259
In fact Lincoln, who we
often think of as being sort

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.787
of this great-grandfatherly,
sweet character,

00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:49.637
who has so many words of
wisdom, his letters to McClellan

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:51.434
are downright snarky.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:53.702
He says to McClellan,

00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:55.399
"If you're not using the army,

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.413
"could I borrow it?"
(laughter)

00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:00.421
- [Voiceover] And is that
what historians believe too?

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:03.356
It looks like Lincoln felt
that the reason why year one

00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:04.475
went in favor of the South.

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.903
And what we talked
about in previous years,

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:08.699
everyone thought this was
gonna be a fast engagement.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.482
The North had all of these advantages.

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.293
Lincoln believed that maybe McClellan

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.670
wasn't being aggressive enough.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.250
And do historians
- [Voiceover] Yes absolutely.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.251
- [Voiceover] believe that too?

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.122
- [Voiceover] Yeah, no
I think that's true.

00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:21.009
It's really borne out by the numbers,

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.907
that in many cases where
McClellan thought he was facing

00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:27.713
just thousands of troops,
he was really only facing

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:29.315
a fraction of that.

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:31.521
- [Voiceover] And so that
made him be a little bit more

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:32.518
cautious?
- [Voiceover] He was very

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:33.964
- [Voiceover] cautious.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:35.403
- [Voiceover] At what
point is the turning point,

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.818
at least in these early
stages of the Civil War,

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.363
as we have here in this timeline?

00:03:39.363 --> 00:03:43.858
We go from April 1861
to roughly April 1865.

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:45.238
The first year,

00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:47.676
I can draw that.

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.496
So the first year would be

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:53.125
roughly this.

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.457
We've had several battles after Bull Run,

00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:58.732
but then we get to Antietam.

00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:01.673
- [Voiceover] Right so Lee,
since he's done so well

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:03.630
in Virginia, he decides that he's

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.128
gonna take the army to the North.

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.326
This is the first time that he heads up

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:10.156
into the border state of Maryland,

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:14.563
and he meets at Antietam
Creek with McClellan.

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:16.155
- [Voiceover] And this goes
back to the naming conventions

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.154
between the North and South.

00:04:17.154 --> 00:04:18.902
It's called Antietam,
that's the body of water,

00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:21.048
which the North does.

00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:22.915
This is Antietam right there.

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:24.512
- [Voiceover] Right well
the South refers to it

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:27.367
as the nearby town which
is Sharpsburg, Maryland.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.078
And once again,
- [Voiceover] I see.

00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:30.108
- [Voiceover] this is a big deal.

00:04:30.108 --> 00:04:32.366
This is the South invading the North now,

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:33.569
taking the offensive.

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.897
- [Voiceover] Right and this is

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:39.473
the bloodiest day

00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:41.336
in American history when--

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:42.586
- [Voiceover] Let me make sure

00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:43.756
I digested what you just said.

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:45.496
The bloodiest day?

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.938
I imagine things like
Pearl Harbor and D-Day.

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:53.720
- [Voiceover] Right,
so 4,000 Americans died

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.209
on a single day, September 17th, 1862

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:59.851
when these two armies meet at Antietam.

00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:03.837
And on no other day in American history

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:06.007
have so many Americans died,

00:05:06.007 --> 00:05:08.407
not even on September 11th

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:10.759
did that many Americans die.

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.712
- [Voiceover] And was
this a surprise to folks?

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.466
- [Voiceover] Yeah, well I think

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:20.964
one of the truisms, perhaps
about military strategy

00:05:20.964 --> 00:05:23.604
in general, is that
people are always planning

00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:25.324
for the last war.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.933
They're not planning for the
next war, and so they learn

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:30.759
from their mistakes,
but what they don't know

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.071
how to do always is anticipate

00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:34.960
what's going to be new about this war.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.483
And there were so many new inventions

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:41.198
during this time period that
really made the Civil War

00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:43.419
an incredibly deadly war.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.497
- [Voiceover] Yeah and you can see.

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:45.507
These are pictures.

00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:46.768
These are Antietam right here?

00:05:46.768 --> 00:05:47.744
- [Voiceover] This is Antietam,

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:48.755
yes.
- [Voiceover] And this looks

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:50.143
- [Voiceover] like Lincoln and McClellan.

00:05:50.143 --> 00:05:51.756
- [Voiceover] Right, meeting at Antietam.

00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:52.768
- [Voiceover] Which is incredibly bloody.

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:56.864
And you talk about new
technologies or new weapons,

00:05:56.864 --> 00:05:59.919
this rifle here looks like one of 'em.

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.108
- [Voiceover] (chuckles) Yes.

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:04.192
So this is a war where
there's a transition

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:07.007
from the musket to the rifle,

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:09.490
and what's different about a rifle

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.517
is that inside the barrel of a rifle,

00:06:12.517 --> 00:06:14.762
there is a

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.616
sort of spiral-shaped groove.

00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:20.447
And the spiral-shaped
groove makes the rifle

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:23.323
much more accurate at a
much farther distance.

00:06:23.323 --> 00:06:25.055
It's sort of the difference

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:28.453
between just hurling a
football end over end

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:32.272
and throwing a spiral,
so you can hit a target

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:33.638
at 600 yards,

00:06:33.638 --> 00:06:36.115
which is much greater.
- [Voiceover] Was unheard of

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:38.527
- [Voiceover] for a musket or
hard, very hard with a musket.

00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:40.042
So it gets the bullet spinning,

00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:41.592
which keeps it on its trajectory better.

00:06:41.592 --> 00:06:42.958
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.414
So we have much more accurate technology

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:50.479
and old military strategy.

00:06:50.482 --> 00:06:52.912
If you see paintings of,

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.149
for example the Napoleonic Wars,

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.689
just involved a whole
bunch of soldiers lining up

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:59.914
and going toward each other.

00:06:59.914 --> 00:07:01.621
Well when you've got soldiers in a line

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.902
and very accurate weapons--

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:05.068
- [Voiceover] I never got why that ever

00:07:05.068 --> 00:07:06.397
made sense though.
(Kim laughs)

00:07:06.397 --> 00:07:07.667
- [Voiceover] I'm not sure I do

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:08.850
either to be perfectly
- [Voiceover] Yeah I don't

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.844
- [Voiceover] honest.
- [Voiceover] consider myself

00:07:09.844 --> 00:07:10.969
- [Voiceover] a great military strategist,

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:13.387
but wearing these
(Kim laughs)

00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:16.528
bright uniforms and marching in step

00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:18.021
in these kind of--
- [Voiceover] Yeah it does

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.093
- [Voiceover] seem to make
you a very good target.

00:07:20.093 --> 00:07:23.239
- [Voiceover] Yes, yes, but
anyway, you have the rifle now,

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:24.256
much more

00:07:25.262 --> 00:07:26.983
accurate

00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:29.476
and you end up with scenes like this,

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:31.500
but what was the outcome of Antietam?

00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:36.247
- [Voiceover] There are two
very major outcomes of Antietam,

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.264
I would say.

00:07:37.264 --> 00:07:40.173
One, on the negative side for the North,

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:44.039
is this is a battle that
is widely photographed

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:45.314
as you can see.

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:48.374
Mathew Brady, who was the leading

00:07:48.374 --> 00:07:51.487
photography studio owner of his time,

00:07:51.487 --> 00:07:53.243
and it's one t.

00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:54.275
- [Voiceover] Mathew, okay.

00:07:54.275 --> 00:07:55.744
- [Voiceover] Yeah, very
important, only one t.

00:07:55.744 --> 00:07:56.744
- [Voiceover] Yes, a
(Kim laughs)

00:07:56.744 --> 00:07:59.134
nontraditional spelling of Matthew.

00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:03.076
- [Voiceover] He sends
out his photographer

00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:05.540
that works for him,
named Alexander Gardner,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.526
and they have roving
photographers for the first time.

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:10.084
They have wagons.

00:08:10.084 --> 00:08:11.084
And they take--
- [Voiceover] 'Cause

00:08:11.084 --> 00:08:13.991
- [Voiceover] photography's
just becoming a used technology

00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:16.503
at this time.
- [Voiceover] Right and so

00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:20.092
- [Voiceover] they have
Alexander Gardner photograph

00:08:20.092 --> 00:08:22.797
the battlefields at Antietam.

00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:24.525
And as you can see.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:25.655
- [Voiceover] Like a E-R?

00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:26.663
- [Voiceover] That's right, yes.

00:08:26.663 --> 00:08:28.249
- [Voiceover] Gardner.

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:30.185
- [Voiceover] As you can see,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.344
this is just about as far away

00:08:33.344 --> 00:08:35.979
from the kind of heroic paintings

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.511
of what battles looked like

00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:40.404
that people had been used to
seeing up until this point.

00:08:40.404 --> 00:08:43.809
These don't look like the sort of heroes

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.562
of the Revolutionary War,
like George Washington.

00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:47.655
This is,

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:48.909
this is gruesome.
- [Voiceover] Gruesome.

00:08:48.909 --> 00:08:50.382
- [Voiceover] And this
is really fascinating

00:08:50.382 --> 00:08:52.454
'cause we take it for granted
in today's day and age

00:08:52.454 --> 00:08:56.702
is that the effect of media
on people's perception

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.782
of things like war.

00:08:57.782 --> 00:09:01.642
Before the camera, before photographs,

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:05.396
if I'm a civilian, I just hear
about these great stories,

00:09:05.396 --> 00:09:07.855
and I see these paintings
that look very valiant

00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:09.625
and very heroic.

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:12.412
But now with photographs,
you see the grim reality

00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:14.722
of war, people just shot in their tracks.

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:18.484
And young men just kind of

00:09:18.484 --> 00:09:19.770
just piled up.

00:09:20.741 --> 00:09:22.912
It's just very dark.

00:09:24.282 --> 00:09:27.505
- [Voiceover] Yeah and
it's a real PR problem

00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:29.248
for the North

00:09:29.248 --> 00:09:32.988
because this is before we
can really put photography

00:09:32.988 --> 00:09:34.024
in newspapers.

00:09:34.024 --> 00:09:35.997
They don't have that technology yet,

00:09:35.997 --> 00:09:38.965
but these photographs were put on display

00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:40.488
in Brady's studios.

00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:43.772
He had one in Washington,
D.C. and one in New York City,

00:09:43.772 --> 00:09:46.569
and people would go and
look at these photographs,

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:48.103
and it was very shocking to them.

00:09:48.103 --> 00:09:50.682
It was a level of detail
that they had never seen.

00:09:50.682 --> 00:09:53.536
In some cases, they
could make out the faces

00:09:53.536 --> 00:09:56.195
of the individual men who
were dead on the battlefield.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.921
And that just seemed beyond

00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:01.979
what was imaginable to these people.

00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:05.928
To think of some poor person
going into one of these studios

00:10:05.928 --> 00:10:09.603
and seeing their son dead
there on the battlefield

00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:13.809
made it very difficult for
the North to keep up morale.

00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:15.503
- [Voiceover] Fascinating.
