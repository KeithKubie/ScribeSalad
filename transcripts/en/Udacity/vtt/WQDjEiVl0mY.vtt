00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.920
So one of the problems was that Dev and

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.390
Ops were not talking with each other
early in the development process.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.010
Ending up with incompatible environments
is a pretty bad result from that.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.921
Suppose that Dev knew what Ops knows.

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.164
That the production system has to all
work together as an integrated unit that

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:19.610
can be tested and scaled.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.386
It can't be patched together from pieces
the last minute before launch, and

00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:27.040
suppose that Ops knew what Dev knows.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.970
That the system under development
needs to change rapidly.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.060
The technologies involved just
aren't going to be the same forever.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.020
With that kind of shared knowledge,
Dev and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.590
Ops could work together to come up
with a common deployment environment

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.110
that would work well both in
development and in production.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.320
That would deploy well onto servers at
scale, while also developers make all of

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.090
the changes that they need
to build new features.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.030
This is just one example of how
technical change can be made in

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.580
response to the social and
organizational challenges of DevOps.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.340
There are different ways to implement
this particular change, but

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.850
first, let's take a look at the
situation in which this problem arises.
