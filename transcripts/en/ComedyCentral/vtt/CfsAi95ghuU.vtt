Slap Chef,
what's that?

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.956 align:start size:69% position:31%

program that takes

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.758 align:start size:63% position:38%
decision-making
out of the equation.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.359 align:start position:0%

Go for it.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.752 align:start size:69% position:31%
All of the chefs
are trained in the art

of tai chew moi.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.091 align:start size:81% position:19%
I swear to God if you ever
touch me again I'll--

What about that
mumbo-jumbo I heard about

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:14.007 align:start position:0%
Slap Chef being just abject
violence against women?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start size:34% position:66%
Hmm?
