already and as i said people don't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
already and as i said people don't
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780

really understand that and if they go

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
really understand that and if they go
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.380
really understand that and if they go
down the line and say that chemistry is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
down the line and say that chemistry is
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.039

ways it's almost a sort of language of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
ways it's almost a sort of language of
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.980
ways it's almost a sort of language of
understanding of the world in which we

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
understanding of the world in which we
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530
understanding of the world in which we
live and i don't see how you can do

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
live and i don't see how you can do
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.100
live and i don't see how you can do
really great molecular biology without a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
really great molecular biology without a
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840
really great molecular biology without a
really deep understanding of chemistry

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
really deep understanding of chemistry
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.190
really deep understanding of chemistry
and i think of course i would say that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
and i think of course i would say that
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620
and i think of course i would say that
wouldn't I but I i feel that very

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
wouldn't I but I i feel that very
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.789
wouldn't I but I i feel that very
strongly the change has already occurred
