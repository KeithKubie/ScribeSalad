00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.950
With all the talk of the
deficits that we're entering,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.710
and the stimulus bill, and all
the money that's being spent

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.960
on the bank bailouts, and
potentially the auto bailouts,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.380
the question that everyone's
asking: Is this going to lead

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.540
to inflation?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.880
And that is what I hope to
address in this video.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.310
And I guess a good starting
point is,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.390
well, what is inflation?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.610
It's a general increase in the
prices of goods and services.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.270
So they actually measure it
by-- they take a basket of

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.980
goods and services and they see
how those prices compare

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.910
to a reference year.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.540
And if those prices go up by 3%,
they might use a consumer

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.250
price index.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.290
They'll say inflation
increased by 3%.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.320
So that's what's inflation.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.170
And the opposite of inflation,
if things actually get

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.610
cheaper, is deflation.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.660
If one year 10 megabytes of RAM
costs x dollars, and then

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.910
the next year, it costs a little
bit less, it's actually

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.330
a deflationary process, at
least in that market.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.260
So without the those definitions
out of the way,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650
let's talk a little bit
about what causes it.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.050
A couple of days ago, I made
these videos on cupcake

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.990
economics, where I talked about
what happens when the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.180
cupcake factories have high
utilization or low

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.810
utilization.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.950
What might happen with prices?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.570
And the reason why I did that
is because I really want to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.130
make it very clear that it
really is utilization of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.380
factories or of people
that drive prices.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.720
Let's say this is all the
capacity that I have. When I

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.190
talk about capacity in this
video, I'm speaking in very

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.840
general terms. It's all of the
goods and services that we

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.250
could produce.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090
We could just talk about labor
capacity, and then

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.460
unemployment rate is a measure
of what is essentially not

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.320
being utilized.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.180
But this is just our capacity,
our productive capacity.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.940
And in those cupcake economics
videos, I showed that if the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.260
demand is pushing up against
capacity-- let me do demand in

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.400
a different color.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.110
If demand is really close
to capacity-- and I know

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.090
everything I draw kind of looks
like balance sheets, but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.150
this isn't intended to
be a balance sheet.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.440
This is intended just to show
you that demand is pushing up

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.120
against capacity.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.789
So in this situation, let's
say, this is capacity.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.410
If demand is at 90% of capacity,
then the people with

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340
the capacity might say, gee,
instead of trying to just try

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.360
to sell that extra unit-- this
is demand-- instead of just

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.160
trying to sell that extra unit
and have to worry about all

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.880
the raw materials and have to
work for that extra unit, why

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.670
don't I just raise
prices, right?

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:40.030
So high utilization of capacity,
it leads to prices

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.880
increasing.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.050
And this isn't some kind of
fancy macroeconomic principal;

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.370
it's true if you're running
a lemonade stand.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.410
If all of a sudden, you're
starting to sell 95% of your

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.360
lemonade, you'll probably say,
hey, maybe it's worth it if I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.400
raise the price.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.860
On the other hand, low
utilization-- let me pick

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:08.500
another color --will lead
the prices dropping.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.770
And you go back to your lemonade
stand, and you say,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.990
wow, if I'm only selling 20% of
the lemonade that I make,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.810
maybe my problem is that my
lemonade's too expensive.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.020
And frankly, if there was a
bunch of lemonade stands,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.750
everyone is trying to
sell their capacity.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.180
So just to compete
with each other,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.720
they'll all lower prices.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.480
Actually, I'll throw another
thing in here that's a little

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.670
unrelated to inflation, but high
utilization makes prices

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.060
go up and it also makes
people want to add

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.320
more capacity, right?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.820
So also investment goes up.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.630
Both of those things do add more
capacity, but we won't

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.410
worry about that right now.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.670
So if you accept that-- and
I think it's a reasonable

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.660
argument, because it's really
based on common sense things

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.920
--then I think you'll buy the
argument that, if you have

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.150
very low utilization, it's
difficult to have inflation.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.900
And, likewise, if you have very
high utilization, it's

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.180
hard to avoid inflation.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.420
And to kind of hit the point
home, actually, I took our

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.070
company's Bloomberg terminal
and copied and pasted these

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.010
charts here.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.550
And the orange-- and I know you
can't see it that well on

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.860
YouTube , so I'll try to make
it clear in my drawing, I'll

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.360
do it the same color, --this
orange shows capacity

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.700
utilization, and the starting
date right here, I

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.210
think it was 1967.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.410
This is 1969, actually December
31, 1969, so this is

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.880
1970, beginning of 1970, this
is beginning of 1980,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.690
beginning of 1990,
this is 2000.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.910
This orange line represents
capacity utilization.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.950
So up here this is 90%
utilization and then down here

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.910
this is 70% utilization.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.610
So if we look here, in the late
60's, we have very high

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.610
utilization.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.330
Arguably because of the Vietnam
War, we had factories

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.130
running at capacity to build
bombs and Agent Orange and God

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.530
knows what else.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.220
And then utilization
went down.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.640
We could talk a lot about the
history, but, in general, the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.250
interesting thing-- well,
actually, before I go into

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.520
what happened, let's think about
what this white line is.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.050
So the orange line
is utilization.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.330
Up here we had like
90% utilization.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.130
Very recently, this was like
2007, we had 80%, and very

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.400
recently, utilization has
dropped off, which essentially

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.540
just means we're not running
our factories at full tilt.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.390
This white line is
year-over-year inflation

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.570
growth, and let me
do that in white.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.190
This is year-over-year
inflation growth.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.020
Actually, let me draw a zero
line, so you can separate

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.520
inflation from deflation.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.450
Let me see, zero inflation
is right over here.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.400
That's zero inflation.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.250
And you see, in the time series
that I've done, we've

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.515
never had zero inflation,
although we have had periods

00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.120
of a very high inflation.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.010
But the interesting thing, just
falling into the cupcake

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.350
economics and this whole
notion of capacity

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.200
utilization, is that
inflationary periods are

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.240
always preceded, at least all
the data I have, by increases

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.550
in capacity utilization.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.730
So you could view this as the
beginning of a pretty

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.970
significant uptick
in prices, right?

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.455
And notice, it was preceded
by an uptick in capacity

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.550
utilization.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.930
So, if you saw right here, wow,
capacity utilization is

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.360
starting to go up-- and
actually, another interesting

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.040
thing is to see what threshold
of utilization starts to

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.110
trigger inflation.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.350
So over here, you say, OK, when
inflation really started

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.580
turning around, we were at
a capacity utilization of

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.590
roughly 83%, 84% right there.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.520
And then, if you look at the
next period where inflation

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.800
really started to hit-- you can
either pick that point or

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.360
that point --where was
capacity utilization?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.750
It was around that same level
that was right there.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.850
It was above 80.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.650
This was about 82%.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.990
And we could pick every
period before that.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.270
Well, since then, inflation
really hasn't

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.580
been a major problem.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.710
These are our two major bouts
of inflation, in the early

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.880
70's and in the early 80's,
and those were when we had

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.810
extremely high capacity
utilization.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.990
So the point I want to make here
is capacity utilization

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.700
really is the driver
of inflation.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.260
You actually could find it
the other way around.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.330
So this white line here, you
don't see it because the

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.640
orange line-- actually, I
realize that I'm showing you

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.890
off of the screen.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.420
Let me actually reduce my
window, so I can show you.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.530
So this is more recent, where
we see that capacity

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.880
utilization started
falling off.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.490
I think this is in the
summer of 2007.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.160
And you don't see it there
because it's overwritten, but

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.320
the inflation line has also
dropped considerably.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.570
It comes down to here.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.010
But notice once again, although
here it's pretty

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.980
close, but utilization dropped
off a couple of quarters

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.300
before inflation dropped off.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.770
And that's why I always wonder
why the Federal Reserve Board

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.410
of Governors, they always talk
about different inflation

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.350
indicators and what to do about
interest rates, when you

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.730
do have a pretty good indicator,
and that's capacity

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.170
utilization.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.680
The next question that everyone
has is, OK fine, Sal.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.080
Capacity utilization
drives inflation.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.360
We can all buy that.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.660
But clearly, what's going on
right now is just a wholesale

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.730
printing of money.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.150
And won't the wholesale printing
of money drive demand

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.234
to go up, and then we'll
have very high capacity

00:08:35.234 --> 00:08:38.289
utilization, and then we'll
have inflation or even

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.020
hyper-inflation?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.890
And my argument there is that's
normally the case.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:48.360
Normally, if you increase the
money supply, if the money

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.700
supply goes up, that should
increase demand.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.990
But there's a subtle, and it's
almost a philosophical point,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.750
but it's an important one, to
realize: Money just allows you

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.350
to express demand.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.720
Let's say I really, really want
to buy a Rolls Royce, I

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.870
just don't have the money.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.160
If someone gave me $200,000 into
my pocket, then I could

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.520
express that demand to
buy the Rolls Royce.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.850
On the other hand, let's say,
I have everything I need.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.330
I'm happy with my Honda and my
two-bedroom apartment, and

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.490
someone gave me $200,000.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.050
So they've increased, at
least, my money supply.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.380
Will that increase the demand
for the Rolls Royce?

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.160
No.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.810
I have money to express the
demand, but I won't do it,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.560
because I don't think
it's necessary.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.980
So you can make that same
analogy in the economy as a

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.790
whole, where you can imagine
an island where, let's say,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.210
there's five of us or three of
us, because I don't want to

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.770
draw five people.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.350
And between us, we use seashells
as a currency.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.520
And we're very confident.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.560
And maybe I'm the builder, and
this guy's the fisherman, and

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.100
she's the farmer.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.440
Let's say in one year I use a
seashell to get some fish.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.500
And then he uses that seashell
to buy some crops.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.200
Then she uses that seashell
to buy a house.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.970
And I use that seashell again
to buy more fish.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.130
You can see that one seashell,
even though my money supply on

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.090
that island is one seashell,
it can transact many

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.600
times in that year.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.550
So the velocity in this
example is very high.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.030
So you notice that my expression
of demand happens

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.780
in these actual transactions.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.230
I'll do a classic money
supply equation soon.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.600
But you could imagine another
reality, where, for some

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.190
reason, I stop trusting
this guy.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.290
I've become very cautious, and
I say, well, you know what?

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.910
I don't want to give him my
seashell, because I'm not sure

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.180
if I'm going to get that
seashell back again to do

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.230
something else.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.800
So you can imagine a reality
where the central bank of our

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.560
island, all of a sudden, they
find hundreds of seashells.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.940
And they put seashells in
everyone's pockets so we're

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.480
all full of seashells.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.850
But all of us have lost so
much confidence in the

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.140
economy, or are so unsure over
whether other people are going

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.640
to use my goods and services,
that I don't want to use their

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.720
goods and services.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.130
So we all just start
hoarding seashells.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.710
So this is a situation where
the money supply could

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.510
actually increase pretty
substantially, but since no

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.260
one wants to express it through
demand, it's not going

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.980
to increase utilization.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.870
And so in the situation that
we're in right now, if you're

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.310
wondering about whether you're
going to see inflation or

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.600
deflation, my argument is look
at capacity utilization.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.350
People can point to
the money supply.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.880
This is a classic money
supply equation.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.290
The money supply times the
velocity of money-- that's how

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.260
often the actual dollars switch
hands --is equal to the

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.670
price of the average price of
goods times the total quantity

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.420
of goods and services we have.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.440
So most people say, wow, if the
money supply increases,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.350
then won't prices increase?

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.300
Well, that would be true if you
assume that velocity and

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.890
quantity are constant.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.430
But we're saying that whenever
you have major shocks and

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.290
people lose confidence, this
velocity can slow down

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.260
considerably, especially when
things like financial

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.990
intermediaries start hoarding
money and people start putting

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.110
money into their mattresses.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.720
In fact, oftentimes, people
don't even consider things

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.150
that aren't being transacted
money.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.280
For example, those commemorative
coins that they

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.550
sell on TV.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.710
They're not considered part of
the money supply, because

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.580
people don't use
them as money.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.520
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.380
I'll continue this discussion
in the next video.
