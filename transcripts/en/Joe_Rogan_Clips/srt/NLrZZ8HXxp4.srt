1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,890
That's will happen. The Joe Rogan
experience. Uh, well listen Corey,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,070
you're a bad mother fucker. I appreciate
you coming here. It's just fun.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,280
It's fun talk. Do you want to talk
on more? We did three hours, man,

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,880
but we talk all MMA
to, to me. Let's do it.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,570
Okay.
Let's talk about a,

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,390
but who you told me you're going on your
first elk hunting trip this year. Yep.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,030
Getting out to Montana, Montana. We're
part. Is it around? I can't remember.

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:31,620
So he gave me the code
to put into the DNR site.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,740
Are you using the different set because
you use it a light set up out there for,

10
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,870
but that's for target right here.
I got 60 pounds.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,620
Just like 62 or 63 and how many grains
arrows you a like that's a to 60 yeah,

12
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,600
that's a really lie
there. Oh Man. I'll use,

13
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,290
when I go out there for Elka and I used
it at 300 so I got the grizzly stick

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,610
weighted tips, whatever, 300 grains,
that's it. That's usually what I shoot.

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,380
300 grain.
I shoot five 25 525 grains.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,730
I should pull 84 pounds.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,170
I like a the tip and everything
and I don't know what it is,

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,400
but the answer is 300 wait, I don't
wait. Yeah, with everything. Yeah.

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,070
I've have to get to scale how I make my
own arrows and the basement and all that.

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,560
But I just don't have the scale to
see how much your way at the end.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,340
Are you trying to do that for speed?
Is that why you have the light grains?

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,440
That's just what the guy,
my guy an narrows the hats.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,700
Hats I'm wearing actually in Vegas. I'm
going to connect you to John. Dudley.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,230
I mean I know you've
already talked to him,

25
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,680
but I want to get you guys together next
time you're anywhere near here and he's

26
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,750
in or if you're in
Vegas and he's in Vegas,

27
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,060
I'm going to get you guys together
and have them coach you and help you.

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,210
Cause I already, I already see
that. You, you very accurate.

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,980
You know when we're playing
techno hunt, you're, you know,

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,510
scoring in the vitals every single
time, you know, except for one,

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,010
one little one body, one body shot.
But even that's a dead elk where he,

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,790
where he hit it. But John can
help you tremendously. He, he'll,

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,300
he'll tighten up your shit.
You know, I see his videos,

34
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:58,290
I study that stuff all the
time. But again, he's like
the Mark Henry of archery.

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,610
I see it.
Yeah.

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,940
And hundred yard shot through the
Kettlebell and target that I'll tell her

37
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,361
friends all the time.

38
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:05,520
Like I was most amazing thing I've
ever seen the hold up this big.

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,970
He went through an era only operation.
Yup.

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,970
It's like you don't see people
shooting like cam is good too,

41
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,880
but I'm not saying he couldn't do it,
but I don't camp could do it too.

42
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,200
They have a cam to other post videos
shooting through kettlebells and it's like

43
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,740
some crazy videos too.

44
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:23,520
But I mean it's just that level of
commitment where they're just constantly

45
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:28,050
training, constantly doing. And John
is also just such a fantastic coach.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,620
You know,

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,300
he's so good at the understanding archery
fundamentals and explaining it to you,

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,220
the positioning and it's very much like
martial arts in that we would make a few

49
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:42,750
little changes and it does the world
of difference. I'm willing to learn.

50
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,080
Yeah. Most of the time I'm
learning on the fly, like my dad,

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,200
we learn how to shoot together and I was
like 12 one of his buddies was like, oh,

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,410
ever did archery,
took him to the rain,

53
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,500
she got me a browning and
I was a kid and you know,

54
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,370
I was shooting at it
three shooting with him.

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,980
It's kind of like what I learned was
from what he learned. But if you know my

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,420
dad,
everything other than work,

57
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,510
everything is kind of like ghetto
guys are calling the ghetto Cabo.

58
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,440
We had horses and everything and it was
just like the way you see people do it

59
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,490
on TV when that was not the way my dad
learned how to arrange horses and grab

60
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,200
voices and sell them up and everything
was kind of ghetto ghetto cow boy,

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,170
you know? So now when I go back from
things I learned and I tell him,

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,870
cause like you said, you see my answer
cause I'm all hunting, you know, playing,

63
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,520
fighting. I'm hunting
constantly. He was like,

64
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,370
where'd you learn is it's just watching
videos and I go home with somebody

65
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,520
else's instead of talking
like I talk about what I know.

66
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,830
But most honestly I listened to guys
talk and I ask a question like yeah,

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,070
like I don't know what it is but
I make it seem like I do. But yes.

68
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,010
What are you thinking about that and you
break it down. I had no clue about that.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,990
Learn how to feel dressed. My first deer
in Texas with these guys, hero sports,

70
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,990
a bunch of veterans, we go out, they
asked me and just in case you that's,

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,270
I got closer gates,
you hunting with those guys?

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,810
We've worked with veterans with amputated
legs or mental problems, whatever.

73
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,600
Just listening to a store and we kill
the deer like they'd been hiding they

74
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,000
whole life.
They grew up as key.

75
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:01,530
So field dressing and how to call and
like you shooting the rifle was like,

76
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:05,770
oh you go to just website and
if you got 110 grade a bullet,

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,520
it shows you here at 300 yards.
Aim on this cross here. And like,

78
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,290
and I learned different
stuff from those guys.

79
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,720
Veterans that do this stuff for a living.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,310
They ain't had been in the war and
learn how to shoot a gun then God,

81
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,480
these are like John, Debbie.
I see his videos and his uh,

82
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,960
not in school and Knox and what not
watching, stuff like that. Like you said,

83
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:23,830
you ever had any coaching?

84
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:28,831
Like what I do is just practice over
and over and over and I'm at the range,

85
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,420
the owner, Mike K and m, he'll
come out and be like, oh,

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,270
kind of try to turn your head a little
bit more. I didn't have kisser button.

87
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,000
Put a kisser button though that a forced
you to turn your head and you need to

88
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,720
be strict with the line straight down
and think about pushing his lifeline

89
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,750
through and just stuff like that. And
I just practice, I guess I'm shooting.

90
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,660
I used to shoot at least a
hundred miles a day. Like I said,

91
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,630
I'll pop that truck bit down,
put the radio on your sat there and shoot.

92
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,690
I shot one time so long I couldn't move
my neck back the next morning I fell

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,180
asleep and I woke up.
I could not,

94
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:58,990
I was stuck like I didn't even train
because I was stuck on my head turned like

95
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,380
this cause my neck got tight cause I was
crunched up here and doing this like I

96
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:05,200
wasn't supposed to. But
it all tightened up. Yeah.

97
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,550
And also I'm learning the hard way was
like I went Turkey hunting this year,

98
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,840
this last week. Archery Turkey. Yeah.
Never Been Turkey hunting before.

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,840
I've only seen on youtube or hurt somebody
telling me at the trade show great

100
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,120
American outdoors and it
just sounds so interesting.

101
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,690
And I saw youtube and ordered all the
stuff I need decoys and I was teaching

102
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:25,910
myself watching videos knock the first
day I slate call him boss called.

103
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,620
I don't know. That's not
right now. I came to that,

104
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,020
now I'll put it on the slate and it
sounded like an actual Turkey call.

105
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:36,450
And like I'm good in a week cause
I just steady and try. Right.

106
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,990
So stuff like that. So I just look
forward to fuck with those hex suits.

107
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,890
The who

108
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,750
suit you noted as HTCs. It's
a, especially with birds,

109
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:52,250
birds, you know, birds can navigate
using magnetics. They, they use,

110
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,210
they use like the magnetic
pole to electromagnetic fields.

111
00:05:56,211 --> 00:06:01,211
It's been proven that can register and
they see electric sense electromagnetic

112
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,440
fields. And they think that birds in
particular and, and sea creatures too,

113
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,140
like they use it with a scuba divers and,

114
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,360
and a spear fishermen
and people like that.

115
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,750
There's a suit that blocks
the electromagnetic signal
that your body gives off.

116
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,670
And uh, it's PR supposedly particularly
effective with Turkeys who, you know,

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,880
are very,
uh,

118
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,740
they see very well and they see
things movement and they're very,

119
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,400
very skiddish and they see any weird shit.
They just get the fuck out of there.

120
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,750
But, um, this guy, Mike's linkerd, who's
one of the guys who created the heck suit,

121
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,330
he hunts a turkeys with no blind.

122
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,500
He just sits out in the field with
this heck suit on that blocks the

123
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,300
electromagnet magnetic signal men.

124
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,810
He puts Cammo on over the heck suit and
there's videos of him doing this. Man,

125
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:51,350
it's kind of crazy. You know, this
is a, I gotta check that. Yeah,

126
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,520
this is him sitting there.

127
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,350
So he's sitting with this heck suit on
right in front of these turkeys. Now,

128
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,010
you know,

129
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,000
as well as I know that most of the time
if you are right in front of a Turkey

130
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:06,990
like that, they'll get the fuck out
of Dodge Dakota thing they put over.

131
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,450
But he's not, he doesn't have that. They
don't got the coin is, hey, yeah, I mean,

132
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:15,470
he's babbling behind the giant body
behind him and he's, he's moving.

133
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,450
But the idea is that it can't see the
electromagnetic signal that you're giving

134
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,570
off. There's a lot of videos on
it. It's super controversial,

135
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,620
but a Dudley swears by it.
John Dudley swears by,

136
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:32,240
and a lot of other folks do too. Um,
uh, Shane Dorian. Yeah, I think it does.

137
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:36,320
I think it works for everything. I think
animals can sense something. I mean,

138
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,720
it's not everything, right? I mean,

139
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:42,800
you still can't be downwind or
upwind, you know, if, if you,

140
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,350
if you are wind comes and catches them,

141
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,720
they're gonna smell you and they're
going to get the fuck out of there.

142
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,700
But it's a, and what does that,
another camera, Jesus Christ.

143
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,530
That's a great picture. Like that's
a perfect example of how flow works,

144
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,010
right? That picture is trip, but you gotta
if you try to take that picture of me,

145
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,800
you tried that, you're going to see me.
It's like a perfect, yeah. And of course,

146
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,330
I mean it's the perfect type of leaves,
the perfect angle, the perfect lighting.

147
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,420
You know, it's probably fucked
with a little, but you know, the,

148
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,430
the heck suit is a very
controversial thing,

149
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,980
but people smarter than me say it works.

150
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,560
It really works with sea creatures
for some reason with, um,

151
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,210
things in the water because you know,
animals,

152
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:31,130
they have that a lateral line or fish
rather have that lateral line and they,

153
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,840
they sense electrical signals that are
coming off of a creatures that are in the

154
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:40,220
water. And so scuba divers
swear by this fucking the suit.

155
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,900
It's interesting stuff. Yeah. Hurt
and everything hurt. I'm like, wait,

156
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll get them to send you some.
Yeah, for sure. Well, like I said,

157
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,530
I listened to Dudley when it comes to
every, I'm, you know, I'm like you,

158
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,950
when it comes to martial arts,
if someone's teaching me something,

159
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,870
I just listened. I don't,
I don't second gas.

160
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:02,100
And when a guy is wise's him says
that it works, I'm curious about it.

161
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,770
At least try it before I knock.
You don't work for me. They like,

162
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,060
maybe it's just I'm doing something wrong
and then they come and show me and it

163
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,240
still don't work. It's gonna like I
don't believe it, but if it works,

164
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,450
I'm going to have a particular,
uh, Cammo company right now.

165
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,670
Appreciate thicker CIC is the best. Yeah,
I love it. They'll abandon me. I got,

166
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:20,600
they gave me a little pro deal 50% off
and that's great. So it worked out.

167
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,750
I love it. It's still expensive,
but it's worth it. Yeah.

168
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,900
They just have so much engineering and
their shit. And guys like John Barklow,

169
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,890
the guy was what the designer that does
all the protesting and cold weather,

170
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,880
and you ever see the cold water immersion
test they've done with their shit.

171
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,860
He's got a rewarming drilled that he put
online explaining to people what you do

172
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,770
if you're in cold conditions
and you fall into the water,

173
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,350
like how to read warm yourself.
It's got a whole video where he did it.

174
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,130
They jumped into this icy
river and then yet, nope.

175
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,510
And then clowned out. And you know, the,

176
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:57,630
the suits are designed in a lot of the
clothing is designed to allow you to

177
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:01,200
survive and that sort of a situation. But
you know, you have to know how to do it,

178
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,170
how to go about it. See,
here's, there's John and, uh,

179
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,630
this guy that he's with
and they just dumped it.

180
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,780
There's John on the right and they'd
dump themselves in this freezing fucking

181
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:14,520
water and then get out. And then they
put on sleeping bags and got in the tent.

182
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:15,354
And

183
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,450
let me tell you right now,
that's when the Wpas Geo, ah,

184
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,020
you're not gonna see no black man,
no frozen waters.

185
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,040
You can prove [inaudible] brother and no,

186
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:35,350
I was ready to prove a point. Um,
well he's educating people though.

187
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,650
See when he was in the military,
that's what he did.

188
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:42,030
He taught cold weather survival.
He's, he's so thorough too.

189
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,751
And you know,

190
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:46,980
and he's one of the reasons why sit cause
gear so well engineered and designed

191
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,060
because they've got a guy like him that's
a telling them how to design things.

192
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:55,580
And he's a hunter too. He hunted with me
last year. I hunted elk with him and uh,

193
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,060
in Utah,

194
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,150
I'm actually going to get the test out.
Like my buddy told me before, like,

195
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,810
I promise you thicker, you get that
warm and stuff, no matter how coat,

196
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,700
you're not going to get cold, like the
best shit. So I'm going, uh, Saskatchewan,

197
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,930
Canada for white tail in November.
Yeah, right. They got and he told me,

198
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,940
he say the case, he's like, it's not that
bad. It was kind of cool. It was not bad.

199
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,320
He was like sometimes like negative
two. I'm like, that's fucking back.

200
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,241
Are you calling?
Right.

201
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,550
Well I've got an extra body suit
for you so I'm going to get there.

202
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:23,310
Super warm gear and try it out.
And he said, if it don't worry,

203
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,500
I'll let you use the body suit.
But yeah,

204
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,770
well you might need the body
suit and Saskatchewan is fucking,

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,950
I'm going to test and see if it really
works. I might see you boys video,

206
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,530
check it out.
That candidate colds a different cold,

207
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,100
you know those people are hardy folks
there. You went out there and uh,

208
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,660
June for the bear hand. Actually me and
my dad in the mornings it was cold. Yeah.

209
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,510
And our time day,

210
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,190
the sun come out and then we go to the
top of the mountain to the sea glass and

211
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:51,240
you know, man fast, like instantly
hands froze. I'm in a truck in the heat.

212
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,770
He just out there chilling in his t shirt.
This is how they do this.

213
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,920
Just used to it. Yeah. Now will you,

214
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,980
when you were up there was that
spot and stalk or, yeah. Yeah.

215
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,580
So you catching them when they were coming
out of the dens and eating grass have

216
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:07,820
to go up to the top of the view point.
That's how my mom and we looked at me,

217
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:08,351
him and my dad,

218
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:11,380
he had the spotting scope and we both
from Manaca he said just look for a black

219
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,000
guy.
You see something you're telling me.

220
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:17,770
And I put the spotting scope scope on
it and see ever see a style or a bear we

221
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,920
can get, you don't have something
like office hours cut her cubs.

222
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:21,461
We're not shooting us.

223
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,480
We only want old males and it's crazy
cause it's a 30 minute drive to the top of

224
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,840
the mountain. So after we seal it
might look like it's right there.

225
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,530
It's like like an hour to get down
there and we've got a park and they,

226
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,450
we still got walked 2030 minutes
and hope he's still in that area.

227
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,050
You know what I mean? Like I said, we
came across elk, we came across cougars,

228
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:38,711
all kinds of stuff,

229
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:43,711
but you get an that bear was gone and we
tie back to the truck back to the time

230
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,580
we did it all day to like it got
dark and take us till midnight,

231
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,950
whatever to get home cause it was so
far into the mountains and it was great

232
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,450
like I said, but it walked in and I
had the wrong boots. I like work boots.

233
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,450
My cat stuff was burned
in the first day but,

234
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,020
and I'm with the head guy is I don't
like driving. I was like walking a lot.

235
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,890
So we did a whole lot of walk. He's like,
I figured you'd be in the UFC fighter.

236
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,490
I can test you. I never had a guys
athletic as you that's able to walk.

237
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:12,010
Most people are overweight
or not athletics.

238
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,290
They want to go a little bit and it's
time to go to the trip. Like you,

239
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:19,030
I can test you out a lot of cardio man.
Those were you telling man,

240
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,470
I never been so strong in my life.
That's my mom said like Mr Overtime, 25,

241
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,020
eight like Bruh, you ain't
did it Mama. It's different.

242
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,850
It's different walking up those hills
and those guys that get used to it,

243
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,120
those very specific muscles that you use
when you're constantly hiking up hills

244
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,700
that you said you did a
black per home before.

245
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,860
I did a few in a bow or rifle in um,
uh,

246
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,550
north of Alberta with uh, my friends,
uh, John and Jen, the rivets up there.

247
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,810
They've got a great camp up there.

248
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,910
I just don't have the time to get
away for that many camps, you know?

249
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,270
And I prefer elk hunting a year.

250
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm going to do for this year,
for this year or two elk.

251
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,870
One axis deer and one mule deer.

252
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Now what about Saskatchewan
white till you seen those? Fuck,

253
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,650
what would you what you do it?
Yeah, we'll do it. I'll do it.

254
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,900
He do ever want to see,

255
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,330
I can't cause I do have something
scheduled in November already. Oh,

256
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,130
are you telling me when I can sell more
than 100 a month? I'll get divorced.

257
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,100
My kids will beat me up.
I'm on the verge of that already.

258
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,640
I'm on every morning, I get
up four o'clock she just
put the baby back to sleep.

259
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:27,510
I'm up making noise.

260
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,110
Wish me luck. I'll see you when I get
back. I know they don't like it, man.

261
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,430
It's funny, but I get it. But it's,

262
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,640
it's one of those things that
just takes a lot of time.

263
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:39,070
Like if you're going to go on a
hunting trip, it's seven days away,

264
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,600
you know you have seven days and you're
going to be probably somewhere where

265
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:47,380
there's no cell phone signal. But for
me, man, it's very valuable for my head.

266
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,650
I, I, I've, I recenter
out there. I get it man.

267
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,160
There's fucking animals chasing deer and
did things or trying to survive and it

268
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:59,240
just puts everything in perspective for
me when I'm sneaking up on an elk and

269
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:04,241
I'm on Tiptoe tiptoeing through the grass
and I'm just trying to get inside like

270
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,080
60 70 yards just to get a good shot off
and I'm trying to make sure the wind is

271
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:13,490
ride and I'm not thinking about anything
else, man, nothing. Why draw back?

272
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:16,760
And I sent her my pin and you know on,
I put,

273
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,560
I'm looking through the peep site and
everything's right and the housing's level

274
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,550
and I've got my anchor point and I'm
pulling up my back muscles and I'm just

275
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:29,460
concentrating on that spot.
Aim Small, Ms. Small it all,

276
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,740
the whole world goes away.

277
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,770
The world goes away and when that
Arrow finds that crease and sinks right

278
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:39,710
through the, and you see those
fledglings disappear and you're like, ah,

279
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,590
we fucking did it.

280
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,790
Cause some people will never understand
like why would you be happy you killed

281
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:48,200
an animal because it's so hard to do. It's
not that you're happy, the animals die,

282
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:51,830
you happy you did it. It's a
relief. It's so hard to do.

283
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,110
It's like people don't understand like
to maintain calmness and stillness when

284
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,450
you're drawing on an animal.
It's not like a rifle.

285
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,850
I've shot things with the
rifle and it's not easy.

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,690
It's more hard than people think it is,
but it's way easier than using a bow.

287
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,040
It's not even close.

288
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,320
So you've got to draw back
without being spotted. Yeah.

289
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,600
Then you've got a hold steady. Yup.
The rifle was kind of you guys sticks.

290
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,870
Fantastic. Put your shoulder. Like I said,

291
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,120
it ain't easy but you find a cross
hair at once. You get it settled

292
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,040
on that pool.
I pull it down so they don't see me.

293
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,350
So right now I'm starting to shake.
I've been held like the one,

294
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:28,160
I hit three minutes and 41 seconds.
I had a record and I held his book coming.

295
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,680
He kept stopping like I feel my back so
I had to get up and I'll put it down.

296
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:37,490
I'm like wobbly and I posted a video
after that killed people wonder why I'm so

297
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,940
proud of my kids. Like do you know
what it's like being 235 pounds,

298
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:45,460
six three in a tree, not being
spotted hold or both. You know,

299
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,760
hey you going to control your breathing
and one role moving my head, if I go to,

300
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,500
it's something he see my hat,
mood or silhouette, he's gone.

301
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,320
It's like literally like I post a
video and it looked like a picture,

302
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,410
like just me holding and it looked like
a picture cause I never moved. Like,

303
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:01,940
I don't think anybody understands how
hard it is to be as big as I am all up in

304
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,640
the tree with a climber.
I'm using the cloud so that's hard too.

305
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,600
And Get up and just sit still. The wind
blowing everything. You can't sway.

306
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,780
You sit, everything has to
be right. It's an art to it.

307
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,240
People never know.
They'll never know unless they do it.

308
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,930
It's one of those things and many people
that get mad at people that do it are

309
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,870
meat eaters,
which drives me crazy.

310
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,170
They think there's something wrong
with killing wild animals like that.

311
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,380
That's the best way to do it
because these animals, first of all,

312
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,220
they're going to, you're going
to get organic, real wild
meat. It's better for you.

313
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,040
Second of all,
like these animals lived a real life.

314
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,010
They're not like came in a butcher shop

315
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,720
after I got the band, me and my dad got
and we post a picture and uh, his lady,

316
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,880
she's in the same stuff in the
company and I know she eats meat.

317
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,090
I've seen her at a barbecue, her and
her husband like pound and burgers.

318
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,910
And I posted the picture, shit, I can't
believe you are no longer fall. You.

319
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,380
How could you dare go in a while
and kill a bear to eat it? I said,

320
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,420
don't you eat burgers?
Out of that,

321
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:04,710
you went and got a cattle that somebody
took and chained up and slaughter you

322
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:07,830
rather that than me going out and
getting them the most natural way ever.

323
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,020
Not only that serious.
If you love animals,

324
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,820
you got to kill bears because
they eat everything. They eat.

325
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:18,150
50% of all the deer fawns and El Calves,

326
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,520
they get killed by bears.
50% of them,

327
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,320
like I post a picture of killing a
coyote wants and they're like, oh,

328
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,980
did you get a coyote? Didn't do anything
to you, but the thing they didn't see.

329
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:30,600
I posted a video a week later I killed
the cow as he was chasing down a dope.

330
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,890
He was like trying to get him and I,

331
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,060
I saw and I swung at him right when he
came out. POW flipped him and it was open.

332
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,950
I saved the deer's life. Boy y'all
saw was the picture of the Kylie.

333
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,170
What you can't eat them. Yeah.
But I saved the other wildlife.

334
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,730
They said you'll never
make everybody happy.

335
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,180
You can't make anybody happy that doesn't
understand hunting, that's for sure.

336
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,840
They, they have this perception of it from
movies and from a lot of those redneck

337
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,220
stupid TV shows where,
you know, they just don't,

338
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,680
they don't portray
hunting in a positive way.

339
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,950
And so people get this
negative impression about it.

340
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,290
But I think with more people like you,

341
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,820
elite athletes that are getting into a
Bo Jackson is a big bow hunter. You know,

342
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:11,580
there's a lot of boners now that are,
you know,

343
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:14,400
that we're just athletes
and they realize like, wow,

344
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:18,750
this is thrilling and exciting and
then it's the best meat in the world.

345
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:21,240
So you have so many pros
and it's the most, yeah,

346
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,450
I think it's the most ethical way to eat
meat because you going out and getting

347
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:28,740
it yourself, you're not hiring
some supermarket hit man.
You're doing it yourself.

348
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,020
Right. That's the thing. When
my youtube has the main point,

349
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:33,390
ain't no about hunting.
It's more like one,

350
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,350
a black guy in her community to show her.
It was more than just killing.

351
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:41,820
Like I so far the one and now is a Turkey
this whole week I'm out there but I

352
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:42,421
didn't kill anything.

353
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:45,360
But it's more showing you that it's more
like you see the deer walk up to a few,

354
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,240
the sun coming up, the sand going
down all this and editing it.

355
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,790
I'm doing it all myself now.

356
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,400
Do you think you'll have a career in
that after you get done with [inaudible]?

357
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,180
I don't.

358
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Like I tell when I meet people at the
shows that work willing to work with me

359
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,490
like I don't know. What do you want?
Like I don't want them money or anything.

360
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,970
I just want you to help if you can,

361
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,330
let me use one of your gear on
your thing and I advertise it.

362
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,200
I put you a little link at the beginning.
Tack the Cam, both creative people.

363
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:10,830
I usually just put a thing on there
cause I don't want money but because I'm

364
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:12,930
just a fighter,
I'm not a hunter but I love the sport.

365
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,710
You know I love hunting and you share,
you help advertise whatever.

366
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,580
I'm just wanting to get as well as
well and on the lamb and fighting.

367
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,790
I want the same thing in hunting and with
that dudes I had to bring other people

368
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,640
cause I see like when
I go to the boat shop,

369
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,720
people ask all the time like I'm in today.

370
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,060
I was in the hotel on my button like oh
you got a gig somewhere without a guitar?

371
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:33,100
Like no, it's a bow and arrow. He said
guy say oh and there he look at it. Yeah.

372
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,010
Huh. All that. I love hunting.
Especially when you see me.

373
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:38,870
Like I told my wife I'm going to first
person on Joe Rogan shooting techno thing

374
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,110
with Jordan's a do rag or would a bowl.
It don't work that way

375
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,640
where you're lagging and Jordan, it's
very that guy on the streets with sounds.

376
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,350
But then you see me with a bow or a gun.

377
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,760
I want to be the first guy to ever shoot
techno hot wearing a do rag and a bow.

378
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,690
You mark and Jordan's will direct wavy.
Someone's done that.

379
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,910
Before I went to do rack, you might
get somebody to do rag [inaudible].

380
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,280
Joe Reg Jones by the do rag. It's true.
I got them both. You've got the Combo,

381
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,190
you know what I mean? So that's thing
I want people to see what the show,

382
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,180
not about hunting.

383
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:14,680
Just you don't have to be
the typical what people see.

384
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:17,740
You see country guys,
cowboy has cowboy boots,

385
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,810
kicked shit kickers and they trucks.

386
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,310
I think that's the guy
you expect to be a hunter.

387
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,750
The guy walk around and came up.

388
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,260
I want somebody to see because people find
out how like you, I love it. That's it.

389
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,460
When people see a top level UFC fight or
doing it and they're like, Whoa, really?

390
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,680
Like this is life. Yeah, that's, I
love that. You love it man. It's, it's,

391
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,000
it means a lot to me,
man.

392
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:41,260
I I think that positive role models like
you are what the sport needs to change

393
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,200
people's, but I don't want to say sport
cause I don't think hunting is a sport,

394
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,070
let's call it a disorder. A culture
to change people's perceptions of it.

395
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,300
The positive people like you that are
elite athletes and just for people to get

396
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,220
a chance to see like, hey, this is the,

397
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,290
I mean I'm not encouraging
everyone to do it,

398
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,910
but I think there's a lot of
people that would love that.

399
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:01,390
I've never tried it because they may be
don't have an understanding of what it

400
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:04,540
actually is. So if they see
you, I'll see the videos.

401
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,720
Are you doing like Chad Mendez? We'll
deep. He's deepened, but that's all.

402
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,050
I love it. He loves it.
That's all he wants to do.

403
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,720
I mean he basically is fighting to pay
for his hunting career, you know? Yeah.

404
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,900
Plan. Oh hey found it. I said this
is just scouting and stuff. Yeah,

405
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,600
but right now I got this in Jersey. Yeah.
This is like behind my house I believe.

406
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,360
Yet. Mavens. Huh? It's all
a lot of purchase. I can see
everybody think everything.

407
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:30,100
I post posted stuff.
I got hooked,

408
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:33,610
know a lot of stuff I've got I purchased
because that's what I like to use.

409
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,000
I'll have maybe even hook you up Brandon
Weaver way yet. I actually met him.

410
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,510
I met him at the gray. I do
it. That's my bottom. Me Great.

411
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:42,700
Like I tried to stuff stand like I'm
a purchase this. Oh that's good man.

412
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,200
Good for you. They make
great shit. I mean,

413
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,180
there's a lot of great companies
out there. The Guy Filming,

414
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,540
he was a teammate of mine that hunts, but
when the guy, I talked to frank Yeager,

415
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,260
he said he wanted to do it. Somebody gave
him a bowl. It's like, give me a boat.

416
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:55,350
I set it up. I'll show you how to
get, I got all my guys. Tell them all,

417
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,560
send the link. Um, do you hunter
safety car and I take you out.

418
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,800
I'll film it and I'll show you how to
do it real. Like my buddies in Jersey,

419
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,660
he's a jersey shore Greedo type guy.
But like I said,

420
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:07,510
I taught him how to shoot
at both 15 weeks ago.

421
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,550
Couldn't be kept mixing up the difference
between, uh, is this your shop? Yeah,

422
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,340
this is a little pro shop in
the basement. Oh Wow. Nice.

423
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,480
So you set up your own bows and
everything. You level your third access,

424
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,600
all that stuff. No kidding.
That's great man. I love it.

425
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,020
So thing is just getting people won't
average Joes you get together with Jim

426
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,210
Miller. He's out there too,
right? He's up in a summit.

427
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,700
I haven't hunted with them but
we talk every once in a while.

428
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,800
He's another one full balls deep.

429
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm working with his guys at a and w
labs right now for like attracting or

430
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:39,010
whatnot. Them in bulk.
You get a two I use,

431
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,990
I got a new labs and w last like a track
that got accountants and attract top of

432
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:46,280
the corn or whatever. Yeah,
so like getting him on camera.

433
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,160
So like I use the stuff like
the killer queue. Like I said,

434
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,040
it's not just getting people in
it but like guineas, local shops.

435
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,650
Like you told them like we don't sell
in the store to try and get a few here,

436
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:58,400
a few there. But like we don't have the,
the network to get our name out there.

437
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,280
So there's people like that. Right.
Supporting those. I support me.

438
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,610
You helped me support me
fighting and how post sta? No,

439
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,960
cause I got more followers than you.

440
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:09,530
So maybe somebody will click the link
for short hair now. Give it a try. Yeah,

441
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,970
for sure. That's awesome, man. Do you
have a perfect attitude? I would think,

442
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:15,560
you know, uh, I mean,

443
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:19,070
there's a lot of careers right
now in the hunting world.

444
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:21,920
Like a lot of guys make videos,
they post videos,

445
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:25,970
and they basically make a great
living just making hunting videos.
