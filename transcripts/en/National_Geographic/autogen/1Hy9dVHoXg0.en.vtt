00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.867
The animals who are
filmed for "Hostile Planet"

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:06.133
have to survive in
incredibly tough conditions.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.133
But they're adapted to it.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.200
The crew, on the
other hand, that's

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.500
a whole different ball game.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.266
RENEE GODFREY: Making a
series like "Hostile Planet"

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.834
wasn't simple.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:22.600
We filmed on every continent
on Earth with over 270 people

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.333
on our cruise.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.200
And it took us over
three years to make.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.266
OK, might be worth turning
your cameras on, gentlemen.

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.367
[animals screech]

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:38.867
TOM HUGH-JONES:
Inevitably, if you're

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:40.667
going to follow the animals
that are having to survive

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.233
in the most extreme
corners of the planet,

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.767
you have to go there too.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:46.800
And you get a slight taste
of what their lives are like,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.700
and it's brutal.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.734
MATEO WILLIS: Mountains
are a unique environment.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:54.500
There are other places which
are hotter, like deserts.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.233
And there are places which
are colder, like the Arctic.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.567
Surprisingly, the greatest
challenge in mountains

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:01.633
is gravity.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.000
Because everything is an
effort against gravity.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.633
Everything is trying
to push you down.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.433
All right, let's do this
before any rocks fall.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:20.000
Probably the thing that
shocked and surprised me most

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.200
were these little barnacle
geese chicks in Greenland.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.300
They would walk to
the edge of a cliff,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.500
and then they would
throw themselves

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.233
off, plummeting to the bottom.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:32.767
And then they would
hit the bottom

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.266
and stand up and walk away.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.800
And you just think,
how does life

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.000
survive something so extreme
as falling hundreds of feet?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.967
I would be just
shattered into pieces.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.767
And yet this tiny
little gosling,

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.934
you know, no bigger than a
couple of inches, doesn't.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:46.867
[birds chirping]

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.400
Another day in the office.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.266
MATEO WILLIS: Filming the
barnacle geese on those cliffs

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:55.767
was probably the single
trickiest thing to accomplish.

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:59.100
We needed to get a shot
where I wanted the camera

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.667
over the top of that nest.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.100
We needed to see what
those chicks were seeing.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.000
We needed to know what
it felt to look over

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.166
that edge for the first time.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.633
And the only way to
do that was to get

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.066
an 8 meter crane with
a camera on the end

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.734
swung out over that nest.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.266
But of course, there was
no area to put the crane.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.500
You were on this tiny ledge
that was, say, no bigger

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
than a couple of doormats.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.600
And so you had to balance
the entire crane and all

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.367
the weights on top of
it, so you probably

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:31.066
had 250 pounds of weights
and an $80,000 camera

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.667
on the other end of the crane.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.500
And then you had to somehow
swing it over and get it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.033
out there without
everything giving

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:39.233
way and collapsing around you.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:43.266
More speed and pan to the left.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.800
And that was probably
the only time

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.333
I've ever stopped and
thought, is this really worth

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.133
it for the shot? if
it all goes wrong,

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.533
is it worth it for one shot?

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:53.533
And it was.

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.166
[birds whooping]

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.300
