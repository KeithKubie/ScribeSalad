that's - in my view that gets us to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
that's - in my view that gets us to
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.350
that's - in my view that gets us to
where we want to be yeah and just an

honest assessment of the actual data
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940
honest assessment of the actual data
like what we really know and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

understanding how these scientists come
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689
understanding how these scientists come
to these conclusions but the the problem

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
to these conclusions but the the problem
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490
to these conclusions but the the problem
is these echo chambers where people get

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
is these echo chambers where people get
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.630
is these echo chambers where people get
involved online that magnify all of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
involved online that magnify all of
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.959
involved online that magnify all of
these beliefs and you get radicalized I

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
these beliefs and you get radicalized I
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729
these beliefs and you get radicalized I
mean I've seen true people get involved

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
mean I've seen true people get involved
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.899
mean I've seen true people get involved
in these Facebook groups these

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
in these Facebook groups these
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.810
in these Facebook groups these
anti-vaxxer Facebook groups or you know

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
anti-vaxxer Facebook groups or you know
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730
anti-vaxxer Facebook groups or you know
all sorts of different things I mean

that's how these Flat Earth people get

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
that's how these Flat Earth people get
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.620
that's how these Flat Earth people get
going yes they start listening only to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
going yes they start listening only to
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420
going yes they start listening only to
people that are involved in this circle

people that are involved in this circle
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.800
people that are involved in this circle
they don't have a greater understanding

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
they don't have a greater understanding
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.920
they don't have a greater understanding
of the science involved and you just see

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
of the science involved and you just see
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410
of the science involved and you just see
I just online there's a a cruise to the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
I just online there's a a cruise to the
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600
I just online there's a a cruise to the
flat or cruise for a flat earth right

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
flat or cruise for a flat earth right
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310
flat or cruise for a flat earth right
now if you saw it - the ice wall yeah

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
now if you saw it - the ice wall yeah
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.880
now if you saw it - the ice wall yeah
the ice wall that's a new wrinkle cuz

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
the ice wall that's a new wrinkle cuz
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770
the ice wall that's a new wrinkle cuz
the old flat earthers used to think that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
the old flat earthers used to think that
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.870
the old flat earthers used to think that
the water was shown falling off the disk

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
the water was shown falling off the disk
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399
the water was shown falling off the disk
of the earth you know like the edge of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
of the earth you know like the edge of
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.410
of the earth you know like the edge of
the earth it was just a disk mm-hmm now

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
the earth it was just a disk mm-hmm now
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240
the earth it was just a disk mm-hmm now
the new theory that there's an ice wall

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
the new theory that there's an ice wall
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.670
the new theory that there's an ice wall
actually it is it's kind of not

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
actually it is it's kind of not
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.590
actually it is it's kind of not
falsifiable because to say you you could

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
falsifiable because to say you you could
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389
falsifiable because to say you you could
get on a cruise and sail to the edge of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
get on a cruise and sail to the edge of
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.859
get on a cruise and sail to the edge of
the earth and you would find a wall of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
the earth and you would find a wall of
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.200
the earth and you would find a wall of
ice there so you Antarctica so you think

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
ice there so you Antarctica so you think
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.380
ice there so you Antarctica so you think
ha it's flat in other words they they

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
ha it's flat in other words they they
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.190
ha it's flat in other words they they
have redefined their theory - to make it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
have redefined their theory - to make it
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560

so that you can't disprove it mmm right

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
so that you can't disprove it mmm right
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240
so that you can't disprove it mmm right
you don't get to an edge there's no edge

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
you don't get to an edge there's no edge
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.499
you don't get to an edge there's no edge
there's an ice wall as what they're

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
there's an ice wall as what they're
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.020
there's an ice wall as what they're
saying no and are you aware of hashtag

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030

and if you don't know any better and
that's all you listen to that's where

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
that's all you listen to that's where
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.030
that's all you listen to that's where
your head will go the same with the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040
your head will go the same with the
 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:37.370
your head will go the same with the
anti-vaccination of how it does that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
anti-vaccination of how it does that
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.319
anti-vaccination of how it does that
which is not its uses as you say

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329
which is not its uses as you say
 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.879
which is not its uses as you say
scientific words but it's actually not

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889
scientific words but it's actually not
 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.740
scientific words but it's actually not
scientifically correct right you know it

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750
scientifically correct right you know it
 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.030
scientifically correct right you know it
does this which then does that which

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
does this which then does that which
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.440
does this which then does that which
then does that they lay out a kind of

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
then does that they lay out a kind of
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.720
then does that they lay out a kind of
causal chain you know just false and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730
causal chain you know just false and
 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.280
causal chain you know just false and
then there's a problem of nuance and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
then there's a problem of nuance and
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.110
then there's a problem of nuance and
perspective because there's so many

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120
perspective because there's so many
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.729
perspective because there's so many
people that get vaccinated there's

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
people that get vaccinated there's
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.870
people that get vaccinated there's
hundreds of millions of people in this

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880
hundreds of millions of people in this
 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.210
hundreds of millions of people in this
country billions of people worldwide and

country billions of people worldwide and
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.629
country billions of people worldwide and
then there are instances rare or cases

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639
then there are instances rare or cases
 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.180
then there are instances rare or cases
where people have real issues those

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
where people have real issues those
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.729
where people have real issues those
vaccinations well there are some where

vaccinations well there are some where
 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.259
vaccinations well there are some where
they have real issues so for example

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269
they have real issues so for example
 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.970
they have real issues so for example
there's some vaccines which are known to

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
there's some vaccines which are known to
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.920
there's some vaccines which are known to
cause certain neurological conditions

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930
cause certain neurological conditions
 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.559
