00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.799
No, I...

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.799
I don't change it.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.310
I mean, the difference, you know, if we're
talking about the big 2, Britain and America,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.050
sorry, rest of the world, that's not true.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.050
That was a joke.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.680
But the difference between English or British
humor and American humor, it's usually in

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.570
the production as opposed to the finish core
and how it... how it comes across.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.929
But if there is a difference and...

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:49.870
I suppose I'm not an expert, it's all guess
work but just take the... the sort of I've

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:58.899
been involved with "The Office" transfer,
the remake, the American remake, well, it's

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.649
different.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.069
They're slightly smarter.

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:04.220
They've got better teeth.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.050
They got more ambition.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.190
They're slightly broader.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.460
But the big difference is the Americans are
more optimistic.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.930
And that's due to the fact that Americans
are told, they can become the next president

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.210
of United States.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.500
And they can.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.210
British people are told, it won't happen to
you.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.210
And they carry that.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.020
They carry that with them.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.030
We...

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.390
We champion the underdog.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.280
We champion the underdog to the point where
it's not an underdog anymore and it annoys

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.740
us.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:55.290
I, from somewhere, had this strange, unjustified
belief that it will be all right.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.000
Maybe I was born American, and I always thought
it'll be all right.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.190
I just thought it'll be fine.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.910
I always knew I do what I wanted to do and...
and I was [half].

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.780
So I don't know really.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.719
I'm not saying that I don't have fears and
anxieties and, you know, nervous about things

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.220
but I always know it'll be all right.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.220
I don't know why.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.569
I was brought from fairy tales.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.540
I mean, I suppose, you know, I...

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.569
I do like the underdog.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.129
I do like...

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.540
I do like the story of "Cinderella".

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.180
I do like the story of "A Christmas Carol."

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180
I do...

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.829
I do like the "The Meek will Inherit the Earth,"
you know.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:48.170
Actually, "The Geek will Inherit the Earth."
