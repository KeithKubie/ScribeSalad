point of the short story the film

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620
point of the short story the film

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.810
after that beyond showing this guy
rotting away and this is cool because

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820
rotting away and this is cool because

this is exactly what happened in the
 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.520
this is exactly what happened in the
short story but as a film I think it was

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
short story but as a film I think it was
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.710
short story but as a film I think it was
stretched too long the runtime is about

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
stretched too long the runtime is about
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.230
stretched too long the runtime is about
an hour and 41 minutes and this easily

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240
an hour and 41 minutes and this easily
 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.270
an hour and 41 minutes and this easily
could have been an 80 to 90 minute film

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
could have been an 80 to 90 minute film
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.400
