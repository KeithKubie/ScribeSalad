1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,930
Who knows the heart of the sea,

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,330
who knows its depths.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,540
And as I read that,
I wondered to myself,

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,760
are we just the little fishes

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,380
abandoning ourselves to
the waves to sing and dance

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,953
and play?

7
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,600
Is that what we're doing?

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,670
And I'm not saying don't have fun,

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,970
I'm not saying don't
sing and dance and play.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,310
Enjoy life of course,
and relish the joy of life.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,060
But I think you have to make sure
you don't dance your life away.

12
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,920
Don't be one of the little fishes.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,500
And in Docauto that final writing
of Masashi before he died,

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,140
the last thing he wrote

15
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,610
was never stray from the way.

16
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,410
And I think that that's
what this is about.

17
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,870
All the fun and the singing and the
dancing and whole the play. It's okay,

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,143
it's good.

19
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,320
But all those things,

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,060
yeah,

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,980
can be distractions

22
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,570
because there is a path,
there is a way

23
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,840
and you know what that way is,

24
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,480
you know what you should be doing.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,270
And it's hard to stay on that path
because it is the path of discipline

26
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,260
and discomfort,
but it is the right path.

27
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,150
And did you know that?

28
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,730
And it is that path that will ultimately
lead you to where you really want to be

29
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,750
so that you can live

30
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,550
and you can die

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,640
without regrets.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,070
I think a lot of times

33
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,470
people are trying to find the path,

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,630
then they're looking all around
different places and different people in

35
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:16,040
different influences. But man,
I think so often that path,

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,240
you know what the path is and people
know what they're supposed to be doing,

37
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,720
but they just don't get on
the path and stay on the path.

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah, I agree. Where it's something
they felt when they were eight or 12,

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,650
and they say they travel the world or
travel through life's experiences trying

40
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,140
to find the answer that was in
front of them the entire time.

41
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,970
And so they come back to see what they
knew with different eyes and to recognize

42
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,850
that they knew the path all along,
which is something that,

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,220
uh, I so enjoyed about this
book and the character,

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
both real and certainly presented
by the author of Musashi,

45
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:05,701
who is using his experiences in this
domain of the sword as a means of thematic

46
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,150
interconnectedness. And
so unlike [inaudible], uh,

47
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,730
called Udall at the end,

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,660
he is not just a
technician with the sword,

49
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,980
although he is a brilliant technician.
He's tilling the soil,

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,750
he's constructing buildings,
which later he did quite a lot of,

51
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,261
uh,

52
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:33,820
in terms of architecture and overseeing
the building instead of destruction of

53
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:38,821
things and finding at the highest
levels of performance with the sword in

54
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,380
felling opponents, the, the principles,

55
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,440
the first principles that
he can apply everywhere.

56
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,590
And that's part of what fascinates me so
much about Musashi or anyone who's the

57
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:58,060
best at what they do is that it could
be anything, it could be pottery,

58
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,150
it could be sniping,
it could be calligraphy,

59
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:05,560
but like the best they see the depth,

60
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,260
they see the,

61
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,660
the interwoven web that can expand from
that one fine focus into everything that

62
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,200
they do.

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,200
And I think that for me
at least is the path,

64
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,350
and maybe it's just coming off of a silent
retreat that I want to talk this way,

65
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:30,351
but it doesn't strike me as something
that is cleanly expressed in an Instagram

66
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,780
post or a quote necessarily.

67
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,570
It's more of a feeling like you know,

68
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,140
if you're sober and take a moment to
sit in the stillness in that stillness.

69
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,090
I don't mean sitting on a mountain top.
It could just be

70
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,030
five minutes of silence when you first
get up in the morning and observe your

71
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:57,031
own mind and how you feel like you know
if you're on the path or not or at,

72
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,100
you know when you're not
totally agree, you know,

73
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,240
you know when you're not on it.

74
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,750
And I think that the feeling of
being on it when you're on the path,

75
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,300
it has that beauty of

76
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,690
mindlessness or no mind
is what they would say.

77
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,580
You can say zen, the state of no
mind, and it sounds like unconscious,

78
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,170
but it's different. It's not
unconscious, it's not subconscious.

79
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:30,171
It's something else where you feel that
you are exactly where you should be

80
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,250
doing exactly what you should be
doing and you're not planning,

81
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,530
you're just putting one foot in front of
the other on this path that you didn't

82
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:43,940
have to find because in a way the
path was seeking you the whole time.

83
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,640
And it's just a feeling. It's a
really, it's a feeling I think,

84
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:53,990
that everyone can have,
but they get so caught up,

85
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,820
we all get caught up.
I don't wanna speak for you to find you,

86
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:57,860
and I'll speak for myself.

87
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,880
It's easy to get caught up in
the noise and the shiny objects,

88
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,500
and just like the little fish
you were talking about earlier,

89
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,320
it's like what you see that lure

90
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,660
to recognize it as a lure
is sort of the first step.

91
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,710
And then to realize that when you
look past the lure, all right,

92
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,720
there's a lure 16 inches in front of you,

93
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,500
and then you're in an ocean that
has endless fathoms of depth.

94
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,970
What a journey.
