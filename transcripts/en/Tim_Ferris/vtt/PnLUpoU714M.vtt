1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.790
What skill do I think everyone should master to become more productive?

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
I would say,
I'll cheat here.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.340
I'm going to give two,

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.400
but one is very concrete morning meditation for 10 to 20 minutes.

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.870
You can do this any number of ways.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960
I ended up only adhering to the habit of meditation after quitting many,

7
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:29.730
many times over the years

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.440
following a transcendental meditation course and there are a lot of issues I

9
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.440
have with transcendental meditation,
at least how it's set up,
the costs involved,

10
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.080
it's cheaper than it was then and so on,

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.970
but it is very secular once you get past the first day or so and you have the

12
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:49.710
social pressure or accountability of working with an instructor on a daily basis

13
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:52.980
for four days and so if you're going to meet with them and they want to talk

14
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:55.800
about the two sessions that you did when you weren't together,

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.700
you are going to feel like an ass if you don't have something to report.

16
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.760
And this is a very beneficial type of pressure and that is what got me initially

17
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:11.250
to stick to the daily practice long enough to make it a continual habit.

18
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.020
There are other tools you could use.
For instance,
like the APP headspace,
uh,

19
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.100
which I have used,

20
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:21.360
which many other people have used millions at this point and they have a 10 in

21
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.380
10 I think it is,
which is 10 minutes a day for 10 days.

22
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.000
And you listen to guided meditation,

23
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.170
which quite frankly is easier than going directly to something like TM,

24
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.780
which is mantra based or any type of,

25
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:38.220
I think awareness meditation without the so called does,

26
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.230
let's call it a distraction or tool of a guided voice in recorded audio.

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.420
It's actually a very,

28
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:50.421
very helpful training set of training wheels in the very beginning stages or you

29
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.730
can continue to use it.
I know someone,
for instance,
uh,

30
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.820
and I'm going to butcher her last name because I always do and I'm going to

31
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:01.340
embarrass myself here again.
Maria Popova or Propoga dammit Marie,

32
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:05.550
I'm sorry.
Uh,
it's performance anxiety with your name.
I always do this.

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.190
Who runs brain pickings?

34
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.670
Which started off as an email to I think five of her friends and ended up,

35
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.120
now it has 7 million plus readers per month.
Uh,

36
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.180
she listens to the same guided meditation from Tara Brock every morning and has

37
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:24.410
for years.
I think it's smiling meditation or something along those lines.
Uh,

38
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.380
so it doesn't have to be a just in the beginning thing.
So the meditation,

39
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.600
I think if I look at,
for instance,

40
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.880
all the world class performers that I've interviewed,

41
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.540
80 plus percent have some type of mindfulness or meditative practice,

42
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.920
whether that is sitting down,

43
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.600
palms and lap and meditating or running for 10,

44
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:48.270
20,
30 miles and listening to the same song.

45
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.150
These are all forms of mindfulness training.
And,
uh,

46
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.350
it's a prerequisite foundational skill,

47
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.560
I think for operating at a very,
very high level.

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.490
And there are certainly people who haven't done that deliberately and have

49
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.930
achieved great success.

50
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
But I would encourage everyone who's listening to realize that being successful

51
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.760
objectively compare it to other people and feeling successful are two very

52
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:19.570
different things.

53
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.830
And ideally you want it to have both of those and it's not being egotistical or

54
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.320
egocentric.
I think it's being human.
Um,

55
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.190
this type of mindfulness practice helps with not just the achievement component

56
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.490
but the appreciation component.

57
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:38.491
And I think that you are chasing after a fool's errand if you're just going

58
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.570
after one or the other,
you don't have to.
It can be both end.
Uh,

59
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.840
the second foundational skill,
and I'll try to keep this short,

60
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.090
is getting better at asking questions.

61
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.280
There are piss poor questions.
There are okay questions that are good questions.

62
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.270
And then there are great questions.

63
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.300
And I find that levels of success in almost any industry or area correlate to a

64
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:07.510
person asking great questions.
In some cases they seem absurd.
In fact,

65
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:11.680
the hallmark in way of great questions is that sound completely ridiculous.

66
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.630
So someone might ask like,
Peter Teal,

67
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:18.460
why can't you achieve your 10 year goals in the next six months is a thought

68
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:22.150
exercise.
That's a,
that's,
that's a good question to answer for yourself.
Uh,

69
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.870
and these types of questions come up surprisingly often,
uh,

70
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.600
with,
with very,
very impressive folks,
whether it's in business,
military,

71
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.830
entertainment or otherwise.

72
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.120
And the way you can get better at questions is by studying interviews in part.

73
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.570
So I studied Larry King.
I studied Charlie rose.
I studied Terry Gross.

74
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.240
I studied that,
that that debt did go down the list.

75
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.630
I studied Tony Robbins who does in person one on one interventions at his events

76
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.150
in front of 15,000 people.

77
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.480
And he's just genius with how he uses questions to like pattern interrupt and

78
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:03.520
grab someone's attention and divert them in a more productive,

79
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.280
productive direction.
Now why is that relevant?

80
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:10.840
It's relevant because thinking is the process of asking questions.

81
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.960
You're asking yourself questions and then you're answering them in your own
head.

82
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.630
So if you get better at asking other people questions,

83
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:20.950
you get better at asking yourself questions,
which means you are a,

84
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.690
you're improving your thought,
performance and level of thinking.

85
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.980
So those would be the prerequisite skills.
