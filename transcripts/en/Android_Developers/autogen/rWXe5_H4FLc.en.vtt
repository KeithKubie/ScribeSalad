00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.829
so in our last lesson we were learning

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
so in our last lesson we were learning
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.280
so in our last lesson we were learning
all about rest services and I suppose in

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
all about rest services and I suppose in
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.020
all about rest services and I suppose in
theory now you have enough information

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
theory now you have enough information
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.110
theory now you have enough information
to write your own rest library you could

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
to write your own rest library you could
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.599
to write your own rest library you could
probably figure out in your language how

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
probably figure out in your language how
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.090
probably figure out in your language how
to make a call over HTTP you can

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
to make a call over HTTP you can
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.859
to make a call over HTTP you can
remember to kind of take your access

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
remember to kind of take your access
 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380
remember to kind of take your access
token and append it on to any call that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
token and append it on to any call that
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.720
token and append it on to any call that
you know you can use your JSON parser to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
you know you can use your JSON parser to
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189
you know you can use your JSON parser to
get back that data and do fun things

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
get back that data and do fun things
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.200
get back that data and do fun things
with it but generally speaking you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
with it but generally speaking you
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.269
with it but generally speaking you
shouldn't do that just about every major

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
shouldn't do that just about every major
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.910
shouldn't do that just about every major
language out there has a library to deal

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
language out there has a library to deal
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979
language out there has a library to deal
with interacting with rest services and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
with interacting with rest services and
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.139
with interacting with rest services and
they in general have dealt with all the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
they in general have dealt with all the
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970
they in general have dealt with all the
difficult corner cases that you probably

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
difficult corner cases that you probably
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.040
difficult corner cases that you probably
haven't dealt with yet what happens if

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
haven't dealt with yet what happens if
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.440
haven't dealt with yet what happens if
the network goes down or what happens if

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
the network goes down or what happens if
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.139
the network goes down or what happens if
the token is no longer valid or has

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
the token is no longer valid or has
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060
the token is no longer valid or has
expired how can we make sure we trap

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
expired how can we make sure we trap
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069
expired how can we make sure we trap
that information instead of you know

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
that information instead of you know
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.170
that information instead of you know
crashing so you should definitely use

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
crashing so you should definitely use
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420
crashing so you should definitely use
these libraries and typically they come

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
these libraries and typically they come
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.459
these libraries and typically they come
in three types the first thing the first

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
in three types the first thing the first
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470
in three types the first thing the first
type of library basically abstracts out

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
type of library basically abstracts out
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510
type of library basically abstracts out
all the networking bits you still have

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
all the networking bits you still have
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490
all the networking bits you still have
to have a pretty good understanding of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
to have a pretty good understanding of
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890
to have a pretty good understanding of
the rest calls you're going to make this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
the rest calls you're going to make this
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080
the rest calls you're going to make this
is an example from the PHP client

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
is an example from the PHP client
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.870
is an example from the PHP client
library where we're just using the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
library where we're just using the
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.350
library where we're just using the
Google HTTP request method to take care

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
Google HTTP request method to take care
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060
Google HTTP request method to take care
of some of the networking details but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
of some of the networking details but
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.560
of some of the networking details but
you'll notice I still have to supply the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
you'll notice I still have to supply the
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.050
you'll notice I still have to supply the
full address of the endpoint that we

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
full address of the endpoint that we
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.330
full address of the endpoint that we
want I have to specify that this is a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
want I have to specify that this is a
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070
want I have to specify that this is a
post call and I have to supply the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
post call and I have to supply the
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440
post call and I have to supply the
values to this post call in an array

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
values to this post call in an array
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539
values to this post call in an array
what this library does for me is it

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
what this library does for me is it
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.330
what this library does for me is it
remembers the oauth2 bearer token that I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
remembers the oauth2 bearer token that I
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190
remembers the oauth2 bearer token that I
pass to it in an initialization step

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
pass to it in an initialization step
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289
pass to it in an initialization step
somewhere and then it just kind of deals

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
somewhere and then it just kind of deals
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999
somewhere and then it just kind of deals
with making the call getting the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
with making the call getting the
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580
with making the call getting the
response and returning it back in this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
response and returning it back in this
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039
response and returning it back in this
bottom line here so pretty low level

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
bottom line here so pretty low level
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410
bottom line here so pretty low level
still kind of close to the metal the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
still kind of close to the metal the
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.389
still kind of close to the metal the
second type of library takes advantage

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
second type of library takes advantage
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370
second type of library takes advantage
of something that Google does and maybe

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
of something that Google does and maybe
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200
of something that Google does and maybe
other companies as well which is we

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
other companies as well which is we
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.850
other companies as well which is we
create this thing called a discovery

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
create this thing called a discovery
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249
create this thing called a discovery
document which is a very very detailed

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
document which is a very very detailed
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.469
document which is a very very detailed
description of everything that goes on

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
description of everything that goes on
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.179
description of everything that goes on
in our rest service you know we have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
in our rest service you know we have
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.280
in our rest service you know we have
various tools that analyze our rest

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
various tools that analyze our rest
 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.080
various tools that analyze our rest
service produce these very detailed

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
service produce these very detailed
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.420
service produce these very detailed
discovery documents and then within each

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
discovery documents and then within each
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.180
discovery documents and then within each
of our languages we have corresponding

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
of our languages we have corresponding
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740
of our languages we have corresponding
tools that read in this discovery

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
tools that read in this discovery
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900
tools that read in this discovery
document and essentially convert that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
document and essentially convert that
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190
document and essentially convert that
into kind of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
into kind of
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.710
into kind of
native objects and calls that can be

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
native objects and calls that can be
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600
native objects and calls that can be
made within that language this sounds

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
made within that language this sounds
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.280
made within that language this sounds
kind of confusing and abstract so let's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
kind of confusing and abstract so let's
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080
kind of confusing and abstract so let's
just show you an example this is the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
just show you an example this is the
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970
just show you an example this is the
exact same call that I made on the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
exact same call that I made on the
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.740
exact same call that I made on the
previous slide the big difference is

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
previous slide the big difference is
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.009
previous slide the big difference is
this PHP library has a google game

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019
this PHP library has a google game
 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.770
this PHP library has a google game
service PHP file that is generated by

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
service PHP file that is generated by
 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.350
service PHP file that is generated by
one of these tools it's analyzed our

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
one of these tools it's analyzed our
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.930
one of these tools it's analyzed our
rest service is realized that I have a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
rest service is realized that I have a
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.960
rest service is realized that I have a
score / submit call that is a post that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
score / submit call that is a post that
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150
score / submit call that is a post that
takes two values the leaderboard ID and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
takes two values the leaderboard ID and
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520
takes two values the leaderboard ID and
the score value and basically turns that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
the score value and basically turns that
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.070
the score value and basically turns that
into a method that i can call directly

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
into a method that i can call directly
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.460
into a method that i can call directly
so I'm basically accessing this variable

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
so I'm basically accessing this variable
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.550
so I'm basically accessing this variable
called game service which is a google

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
called game service which is a google
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.280
called game service which is a google
game service object that then allows me

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
game service object that then allows me
 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.140
game service object that then allows me
to submit a score to a leaderboard just

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
to submit a score to a leaderboard just
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.030
to submit a score to a leaderboard just
by calling a couple of public methods on

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
by calling a couple of public methods on
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100
by calling a couple of public methods on
it I don't have to know that this is a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
it I don't have to know that this is a
 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.500
it I don't have to know that this is a
post call although I can probably guess

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
post call although I can probably guess
 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720
post call although I can probably guess
and thanks to the magic of code hinting

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
and thanks to the magic of code hinting
 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.690
and thanks to the magic of code hinting
my ID can probably tell me what values I

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
my ID can probably tell me what values I
 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.610
my ID can probably tell me what values I
should be supplying here I don't need to

should be supplying here I don't need to
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.949
should be supplying here I don't need to
look it up and the rest you know call or

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959
look it up and the rest you know call or
 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.630
look it up and the rest you know call or
the reference documentation and look up

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640
the reference documentation and look up
 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.190
the reference documentation and look up
what the actual key is for each of these

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
what the actual key is for each of these
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.410
what the actual key is for each of these
values or anything like that it's nicely

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
values or anything like that it's nicely
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.530
values or anything like that it's nicely
integrated and then the third type of

abstract this stuff out for you and this
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.949
abstract this stuff out for you and this
is what the play games library for iOS

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
is what the play games library for iOS

does so here I'm creating a score object

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
does so here I'm creating a score object
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.289
does so here I'm creating a score object
by calling the gpg score class method

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299
by calling the gpg score class method
 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.750
by calling the gpg score class method
score with leaderboard ID I'm assigning

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760
score with leaderboard ID I'm assigning
 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.240
score with leaderboard ID I'm assigning
it a value and then I'm sort of telling

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
it a value and then I'm sort of telling
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.160
it a value and then I'm sort of telling
the score value hey go submit yourself

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170
the score value hey go submit yourself
 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.930
the score value hey go submit yourself
and here's a completion handler that you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
and here's a completion handler that you
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640
and here's a completion handler that you
can call when you're all done submitting

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
can call when you're all done submitting
 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.530
can call when you're all done submitting
yourself and in this completion handler

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
yourself and in this completion handler
 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.379
yourself and in this completion handler
I'll have some information about the

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389
I'll have some information about the
 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.599
I'll have some information about the
score i submitted as well as any errors

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609
score i submitted as well as any errors
 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.640
score i submitted as well as any errors
that need to be surfaced and so you'll

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
that need to be surfaced and so you'll
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.800
that need to be surfaced and so you'll
notice here unlike the PHP library I'm

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
notice here unlike the PHP library I'm
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.770
notice here unlike the PHP library I'm
not even kicking off a network call I'm

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780
not even kicking off a network call I'm
 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.809
not even kicking off a network call I'm
sort of passing it on to the library to

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819
sort of passing it on to the library to
 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.699
sort of passing it on to the library to
say hey start this up at an appropriate

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709
say hey start this up at an appropriate
 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.280
say hey start this up at an appropriate
moment and so what the library does is

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
moment and so what the library does is
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.680
moment and so what the library does is
first it takes these tasks they want to

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690
first it takes these tasks they want to
 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.330
first it takes these tasks they want to
perform and converts it into the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
perform and converts it into the
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.879
perform and converts it into the
appropriate rest calls it also deals

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889
appropriate rest calls it also deals
 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.430
appropriate rest calls it also deals
with all the networking auth junk for me

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440
with all the networking auth junk for me
 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.530
with all the networking auth junk for me
at some point I had to initialize this

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
at some point I had to initialize this
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.960
at some point I had to initialize this
with my GPP sign-in object and you'll

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
with my GPP sign-in object and you'll
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.360
with my GPP sign-in object and you'll
see that coming up but then that point

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
see that coming up but then that point
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.589
see that coming up but then that point
the library kind of takes care of

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599
the library kind of takes care of
 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.350
the library kind of takes care of
managing my access token for me I don't

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
managing my access token for me I don't
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.570
managing my access token for me I don't
have to actually know my users access

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580
have to actually know my users access
 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.210
have to actually know my users access
at any point it does some smart things

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220
at any point it does some smart things
 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.969
at any point it does some smart things
like intelligently cache data for me and

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979
like intelligently cache data for me and
 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.670
like intelligently cache data for me and
deal with situations for instance where

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680
deal with situations for instance where
 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.939
deal with situations for instance where
I'm offline in this case actually I can

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949
I'm offline in this case actually I can
 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.070
I'm offline in this case actually I can
still submit a score with completion

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080
still submit a score with completion
 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.800
still submit a score with completion
handler and if the user is offline the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810
handler and if the user is offline the
 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.540
handler and if the user is offline the
library will be smart enough to hold on

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550
library will be smart enough to hold on
 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.879
library will be smart enough to hold on
to that score and wait until I come back

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889
to that score and wait until I come back
 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.980
to that score and wait until I come back
online again and then it will attempt to

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
online again and then it will attempt to
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.209
online again and then it will attempt to
submit the score in the background

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219
submit the score in the background
 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.670
submit the score in the background
what's even better is by the way if I

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680
what's even better is by the way if I
 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.379
what's even better is by the way if I
submit a better score with the same

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389
submit a better score with the same
 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.510
submit a better score with the same
leaderboard ID the library will be smart

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520
leaderboard ID the library will be smart
 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.459
leaderboard ID the library will be smart
enough to disregard this first score and

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469
enough to disregard this first score and
 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.230
enough to disregard this first score and
just use the second one once I come back

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
just use the second one once I come back
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.149
just use the second one once I come back
online so there's a lot of extra logic

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159
online so there's a lot of extra logic
 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.860
online so there's a lot of extra logic
that this library handles behind the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870
that this library handles behind the
 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.439
that this library handles behind the
scenes for me when it takes all this and

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449
scenes for me when it takes all this and
 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.890
scenes for me when it takes all this and
converts it to rest calls which is great

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900
converts it to rest calls which is great
 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.119
converts it to rest calls which is great
except that it doesn't really do that

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129
except that it doesn't really do that
 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.430
except that it doesn't really do that
and I guess this is the big lie I've

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440
and I guess this is the big lie I've
 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.409
and I guess this is the big lie I've
been talking all about rest services it

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419
been talking all about rest services it
 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.180
been talking all about rest services it
turns out that right now the objective-c

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190
turns out that right now the objective-c
 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.920
turns out that right now the objective-c
client library uses a completely

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930
client library uses a completely
 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.080
client library uses a completely
different service called JSON RPC and

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090
different service called JSON RPC and
 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.769
different service called JSON RPC and
JSON RPC is another set of rules that

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779
JSON RPC is another set of rules that
 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.689
JSON RPC is another set of rules that
can be used to talk to back-end services

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699
can be used to talk to back-end services
 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.760
can be used to talk to back-end services
in some ways it's similar to rest in

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770
in some ways it's similar to rest in
 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.980
in some ways it's similar to rest in
some ways it's different I think one of

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990
some ways it's different I think one of
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.230
some ways it's different I think one of
the biggest advantages of JSON RPC is

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240
the biggest advantages of JSON RPC is
 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.930
the biggest advantages of JSON RPC is
that it's a little simpler to make batch

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940
that it's a little simpler to make batch
 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.269
that it's a little simpler to make batch
calls all at once on the other hand I

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279
calls all at once on the other hand I
 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.980
calls all at once on the other hand I
think with rest it's easier to cache

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990
think with rest it's easier to cache
 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.379
think with rest it's easier to cache
data you get back from from a get column

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389
data you get back from from a get column
 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.999
data you get back from from a get column
that sort of thing and if you're

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009
that sort of thing and if you're
 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.559
that sort of thing and if you're
wondering hey wait a minute why did you

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569
wondering hey wait a minute why did you
 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.240
wondering hey wait a minute why did you
just spend the last ten minutes teaching

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
just spend the last ten minutes teaching
 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.010
just spend the last ten minutes teaching
me about rest when the client library

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020
me about rest when the client library
 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.709
me about rest when the client library
does something different the answer is

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719
does something different the answer is
 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.659
does something different the answer is
that I would actually like you to forget

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669
that I would actually like you to forget
 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.059
that I would actually like you to forget
this technicality and pretend that the

rest behind the scenes and there's a
 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.320
rest behind the scenes and there's a
couple reasons for it number one just

the future will actually be changing
things on the back end so that even the

things on the back end so that even the

that the play games library for iOS also
uses rest in the back end and

uses rest in the back end and

it's you know it's like that guy who

it's you know it's like that guy who

shut up they're not nobody cares and the
 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.290
shut up they're not nobody cares and the
objective c library it uses rest as far

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300
objective c library it uses rest as far
 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.510
objective c library it uses rest as far
as I'm concerned so now that we have a

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520
as I'm concerned so now that we have a

what it does underneath the hood let's
actually add it to our project and we're

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480
actually add it to our project and we're
 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.650
actually add it to our project and we're
