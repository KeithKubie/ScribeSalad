that if you had cut it there this would
 

00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:49.370 align:start position:0%
that if you had cut it there this would
have<00:10:48.180><c> been</c><00:10:48.240><c> way</c><00:10:48.420><c> more</c><00:10:48.450><c> interesting</c><00:10:49.170><c> then</c><00:10:49.260><c> you</c>

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
have been way more interesting then you
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.070 align:start position:0%
have been way more interesting then you
open<00:10:49.740><c> up</c><00:10:49.860><c> with</c><00:10:50.100><c> him</c><00:10:50.760><c> getting</c><00:10:51.060><c> the</c><00:10:51.300><c> drill</c><00:10:51.630><c> and</c>

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
open up with him getting the drill and
 

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
open up with him getting the drill and
so<00:10:52.830><c> you</c><00:10:52.890><c> know</c><00:10:53.070><c> they're</c><00:10:53.250><c> not</c><00:10:53.370><c> gonna</c><00:10:53.520><c> die</c><00:10:53.850><c> like</c>

so you know they're not gonna die like
 

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
so you know they're not gonna die like
once<00:10:55.050><c> you</c><00:10:55.200><c> get</c><00:10:55.380><c> them</c><00:10:55.560><c> in</c><00:10:55.740><c> the</c><00:10:55.890><c> drill</c><00:10:56.160><c> but</c><00:10:56.430><c> I</c>

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.490 align:start position:0%
once you get them in the drill but I

once you get them in the drill but I
mean<00:10:56.790><c> it</c><00:10:56.910><c> sets</c><00:10:57.180><c> up</c><00:10:57.330><c> that</c><00:10:57.480><c> this</c><00:10:57.630><c> is</c><00:10:57.690><c> the</c>

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
mean it sets up that this is the
 

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.860 align:start position:0%
mean it sets up that this is the

beginning of a new set I just wanted to
 

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.460 align:start position:0%
beginning of a new set I just wanted to
divide<00:11:01.050><c> it</c><00:11:01.200><c> with</c><00:11:01.230><c> ice</c><00:11:01.589><c> is</c><00:11:02.160><c> how</c><00:11:02.850><c> their</c><00:11:03.089><c> um</c><00:11:03.570><c> the</c>

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:04.470 align:start position:0%
divide it with ice is how their um the
