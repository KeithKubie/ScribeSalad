00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.764
Well, let's see.

00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:06.210
I know the equation is going
to look like y = mx + b.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.240
So I just need to find my m and my b.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.770
Let's get the slope first.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.970
Slope is a rise over run.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.902
Well, this graph is going downward,
so the rise here would be -1, and

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:20.933
the run is 1, 2, 3,
to get to this point, -1 over 3.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.280
Now I have to find my b.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.780
Well, the y value of the y intercept is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and that's positive 5.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.730
So it looks like this is
the correct equation.
