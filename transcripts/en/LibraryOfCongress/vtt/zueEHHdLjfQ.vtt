00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.600
and he has a book out called

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.800
"Das ist unsere Party,"
right, is that right?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.100
Yay [laughter].

[ Applause ]

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.560
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding:
Well, thank you, Nick,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.520
thank you, Library of Congress.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.480
This is a fantastic venue, and
I'm super thrilled to be here

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.390
and share my insights
about hip-hop culture

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.400
in the German Democratic Republic.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.960
Also providing some light
lunchtime entertainment.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.010
So let me take you back on a
trip to 1984, a little bit more

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.110
than 30 years ago, when the movie

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.410
"Beat Street" introduced
hip-hop culture to audiences

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.250
in America and in Europe.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.500
In its first five minutes,
which I'm showing you here,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.270
you will find everything
you need to know in order

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.940 position:56%
to understand this spread of hip-hop

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.700
into the German Democratic
Republic in the mid-'80s.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.770
So here's the movie.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.060
&gt;&gt; "Beat Street, Beat
Street, Beat Street."

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.360
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding: Okay,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.730
so much for the light lunchtime
entertainment [laughter].

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.690
So these first five minutes showed
basically or gives an introduction

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.970
about hip-hop culture and the
elements, as we call them,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.080
that made it over the Iron
Curtain, which is of course DJing,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.390
you see that at the very end at the
party, the rapping, also emceing,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.140
right, the DJ is also the rapper.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.350
And you have B-Boying, the
little brother of Kenny,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.420 position:56%
the double K. DJ is Lee Kirkland,
he's the little B-Boy with his crew,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.940
you can see on the right.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.000
And it's actually B-Boy
crew from New York City,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.810
so it's the New York City Breakers.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.210
And then you have Ramo or Ramon,
their Puerto Rican friend.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.000
He's a graffiti artist, or
a writer, as some call him.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.440
And you had these first
five minutes as a way

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.610
of showing how these four elements
come together and interact.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.920
In my presentation today, I will
analyze the culture transfer

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.040
of hip-hop that Beat
Street triggered

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.230
in the German Democratic Republic.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.770
I will start by focusing on the
feature film "Beat Street" itself.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.900 position:56%
And I'll show how it not only served
as a mentor for hip-hop aficionados

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.100
in the coming, but also why
it was imported, released,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.770
and highly acclaimed in the GDR
by the officials of the Ministry

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.590
of Culture and the media.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.480 position:56%
I will then give a short overview of
authorities and cultural functions.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.030 position:56%
The People's Police and the Ministry
of State Security that is also known

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.230
under the name of Stasi and
how they dealt with hip-hop

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.000
and its teenage petitioners.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.030
In the main part of my talk though,
I will flush out how hip-hop heads

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.200
in the GDR appropriated
hip-hop culture.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.230
How they created hip-hop fashion
and dance, spray-painted graffiti,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.670
and made music with
DJing and rapping.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.020
In my analysis of this
teenage fascination

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.130
with American popular
culture is German socialism.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.080
I argue that many hip-hop
petitioners became black.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.030
I'm here referring to Americanist
and ethnologist Moritz Ege's study,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.890 position:56%
which is becoming black, about
AfroAmericanophilia in West Germany.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.190
And I follow his definition

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.630
of AfroAmericanophilia
as a cultural theme.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.640
That is the appreciative
appropriation and perception

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.750
of cultural forms and
colored as black.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.860
And the analogous relationship

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.750
to black people and/or
their representations.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.870
Becoming black then
means an imaginary

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.580
and symbolic identification
with African-Americans.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.790
Consequently, in my close readings
of youth performing hip-hop

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.880
in the GDR, I will flush
out how they identified

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.790
with African-Americans on an
imaginary and on a symbolic level.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.270
So let's first look at "Beat
Street" as a cultural mobilizer.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.920
Since it was impossible
to directly interact

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.530
with African-American agents
of hip-hop culture like it was

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.470
in West Germany, and then learn
about and get involved in it,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.500
teenagers in East Germany
got in touch

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.390
with it through other channels.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.190
Radio, television,
and most importantly,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.570
the feature film "Beat Street."

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.270
So before "Beat Street" came in
1985, teenagers would be aware

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.800
of hip-hop through Western German
TV programs and radio stations.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.670
And they were streaming, of course,
from Berlin, which was basically

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.860
in the middle of the GDR, and
they could receive these stations

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.160
very well.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.110 position:56%
Or from the radio and TV towers that
were very close to the Iron Curtain,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.550
and you could receive
these programs quite well.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.880
But then came "Beat Street."

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.460
Beat Street boosted the evolution
and spread of hip-hop culture

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.350
in the GDR, not only by amplifying
teenage interest and involvement

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.290
in breakdancing, DJing,
and rapping, and graffiti,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.290
but also by depicting
America in a way

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.250
that the cultural authorities
found acceptable.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.070
In this respect, the film also
served as a point of reference

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.950
for official appropriations
of hip-hop culture.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.060
"Beat Street" made it onto the
GDR screens for two reasons then.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.680
One, it could be categorized
as a so-called problem film.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.110
That is a film criticizing
the United States

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.420
and thus educating its East
German viewers about the dangers

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.420
of American capitalism, racism,
oppression, and exploitation.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.720
And two, at the same time,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.280
it promised to draw an
audience large enough

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.260
to make it a so-called
[foreign language],

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.890
the socialist name
for a blockbuster.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.040
That is a movie with which East
Germany could make enough money

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.970
to then finance its
own cinema industry.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.780
While it is pretty clear that with
3 million tickets sold between 1985

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.310
and 1990, "Beat Street" was indeed
a [inaudible], I highly doubt

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.830
that teenage hip-hop
heads interpreted the film

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.130
as the officials had intended.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.820
So let's first look at the way that
the Ministry of Culture perceived

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.060
and then rated the movie.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.090
The Ministry of Culture's
head office for film approved

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.990
"Beat Street" for public
screening in March 1985.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.610
And it premiered GDR-wide
on June 15, 1985.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.590
So almost exactly 30 years ago.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.650
Not only did the cultural
functionary seize the very first

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.160
opportunity to watch the movie,
with the delegation traveling

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.270
to West Berlin to attend its West
German premiere on July 27, 1984,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.670
but they also processed its
approval in only eight months.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.490
A very short period compared
to the approval process

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.920
for other Hollywood productions,
and even other socialists ones.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.360
It was faster than any
Soviet movie in the 1980s,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.450
so that shows you how
they wanted this movie.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.460
The interpretation of "Beat Street"
explained why this American movie

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.260
should be screened in the GDR.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.230
[inaudible], of the Progress
Film Distribution Company,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:47.180
that handled the approval process,
stressed the aspects of community,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.200
of living in the ghetto,
and the role hip-hop plays

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.610
for the protagonists in coping
with their everyday lives.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.700
This emphasis paved the way
for a very favorable review.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.110
The company recommended the film be
approved for its social criticism,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.140
its staging of music and dance,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.510
and its attractiveness
to a young audience.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:12.110
And I quote, "The film
impressively shows where the roots

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.260
of this new-called wave -- new
wave called hip-hop, of breakdance,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.430
graffiti paintings, and
rap music, are to be found.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.670
The film achieves its
authentic character especially

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.810 position:56%
through its many original locations.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.670
Which put on display the forbidding
and disintegrating street blocks

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.450
where the black populations live,
and by casting the main characters

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.200
with youngsters who live in this
new youth, who really do breakdance

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.790
in the subway, on the
streets, etcetera.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.910
Music and dance connect and
determine the plot of the film,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.720 position:56%
they are not presented as mere show.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.200 position:56%
Because as in the movie, they are in
the center of the youngsters' lives.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.370 position:56%
The boys are usually out of work
after leaving school, so that dance,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.140
music, and painting help
them to pass the time."

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.310
Getz furthermore tied "Beat
Street's" achievements

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.140
to its producer, Harry Belafonte,
who she lauded for his involvement

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.940
in the Peace Movement
and Black Emancipation.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.490 position:56%
She regarded Belafonte as a
warranty that the movie constituted,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.420
"not only an effectively
staged musical,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.950
but also an unmasking narrative
about the life of youngsters

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.050
in the black ghetto of New York."

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.690
And years later, in an interview,
she recounted that, "with its story

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.760
and way of depicting it, "Beat
Street" matched well with the image

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.160
that we wanted to convey
of America."

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.980
The cultural authorities
interpretive goal then the way they

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.820
wanted youth in the GDR to watch

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.040
and understand the film was geared
towards raising consciousness

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.970
for America as a bad place, because
of its capitalist exploitation,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.790
which created ghettos
and discriminated

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.090
against African-Americans.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.480
The goal was in line with the
official interpretation of hip-hop

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.600
as so-called second culture.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.330
And this goes back to
Lenin, the communist leader.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.470
And the term was made popular then

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.090
by the East German Historian
Chazenski [assumed spelling],

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.560
a very central figure in
the Academy of Sciences.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.750
So what he said had great value.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.120 position:56%
And it basically meant international
working-class culture as a struggle

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.570
against [inaudible] and
capitalist oppression.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.950
Accordingly, the ensemble of
breakdance, rap, and DJing,

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.760 position:56%
and graffiti was ignored because
they didn't know what to do with it.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.120
In the Bronx, was regarded
as anti-capitalist protests

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.830
and potential revolt
against corporate America.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.340
And accordingly, cultural
functionaries encouraged its

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.970
practice as display of solidarity

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.420
with the oppressed masses
in the United States.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.990
I should mention that
in this official view,

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.860
there was no acknowledgment
or appreciation of blackness

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.680
or black expressive
cultures, like blues and jazz,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.730
which hip-hop heavily references
in all of its practices.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.980
So it was basically
detached from all of that.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.730
It was made working-class culture,
and you had to show your solidarity

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:15.440 position:56%
with it, so the GDR will be open to
the world and revolution, of course.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.140
Encouraging the practice of
hip-hop on GDR soil meant

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.770 position:56%
that the authorities conceded to the
fact that they could not stop it.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.420
So the hip-hop motto "Can't
stop, won't stop," also works

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.660
in GDR context [laughter].

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.190
What they could not stop, they
had to contain and to control

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.100
in order to make it socialist.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.650
And they resorted to
two major strategies.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.450 position:56%
First, handing out official licenses
which categorized B-Boys, DJs,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.270
and rappers as artists, sometimes
also called entertainment artists,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:50.180
in the category acrobatic
folk dance [laughter],

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.060
or merely voice singing, right.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.270
So the youngsters have
to obtain these licenses

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.470
and official performances
for a committee

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.940
that evaluated their
quality and then handed

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.100
out their ID cards as artists.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.840
While the teenage artists were
allowed to perform for anyone

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.860
who wanted to book them, they
also had to attach themselves

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.960
to a cultural institution
that agreed to sponsor them.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.170
Artistic freedom, of
course, looks different.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.040
But usually the hip-hop heads have
found ways to undermine this kind

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.480
of control, by the way they danced.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.690
I mean, after all, no experts --

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.750
there were no experts in these
assessment committees, right.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.610
Who was an expert on
breakdance in the GDR?

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.970
Like ballet instructors?

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.460
I don't think so [laughter].

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.380
Then also by the way
they clad themselves,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.170
like they made the fashion.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:43.240
They usually wore like self-made
Puma T-shirts or Adidas sweaters.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.000
Or if you noticed in "Beat Street,"

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.900
the whole attire was
sponsored by Puma.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.850
And they actually like
financed the movie.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.360
Product placement at
its finest, right.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.300
And then also by the way they mixed
the music for their performances.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.500
As some of you might or
might not know, in the GDR,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:07.120
you couldn't just play any music
you wanted in public for discos.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.570
At least 60% had to be from
so-called socialist countries,

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:19.260
and 40% could stem from
not socialist countries.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.440
But if you know what mixing is in
DJ culture and hip-hop culture,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.990
you just take snippets, right.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.620
So 60/40 doesn't really work.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.330
So that's how they kind of
evaded the whole being controlled

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.800
by this quota system.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.670
And the second major strategy was
to produce socialist hip-hop music

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.790
that could be used
for parties and bands,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.730
and that would eventually
supplant America rap music, right.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.420 position:56%
So the music that you heard on "Beat
Street" was okay but not really

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.960
because it came from America
still and from record companies.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.840
So one thought, okay, why don't
we produce our own hip-hop music.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.130
And here's an example, an
early example, from 1985,

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.560
and it's Arnold Fritzsch's,
Elektrik Boogie.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.070
So here again, the ghetto
pictures from "Beat Street."

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.190
And this is it's like [inaudible].

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.240
It's four songs.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.840
Du bist so HeiB you're so hot.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.880
Elektrik Boogie is Elektrik Boogie.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.010
Neon Dschungel is Neon Dschungel
and then O-O-O [laughter].

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:33.660
Which also kind of
which sums it up, oh.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.080
[Music] Okay, these are not
real [inaudible] I guess.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.200 position:56%
So I said, this is an early example,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.660
and needless to say there were
not really any late examples,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.850
because they figured
out soon that this kind

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.820
of substituting American
rap music didn't work.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.950
But [inaudible] Fit, the
composer and producer

00:15:53.950 --> 00:16:00.050 position:56%
who did this whole special disco mix
here, he was a well known composer

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.100
and he worked for the
state quite often.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.480
And he also worked
with like B-Boy crews.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.070
And the state usually wanted
to like be modern and wanted

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.730 position:56%
to give its youth what it wanted,
at least, the state wanted to figure

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.130
out how they could do this.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.380
So every two years,
they had a big meeting

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.720
in a town called [inaudible],

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.430
which was about disco
culture and entertainment.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.950
And it was there in 1984 that
they talked about how they could

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:33.020 position:56%
like incorporate like the hip-hop
in their official socialist culture.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.320
Didn't work.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.820
Okay, the whole pop
project proved a failure.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:44.780 position:56%
Later, in 1987 in December, and then
all the way through 1988 and 1989,

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:50.120
the radio station Good
Vibrations, which translated

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.850
from German [foreign
language], right.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:57.230
But the host wanted to call it
Good Vibrations, but wasn't allowed

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.680
to because English wasn't allowed.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.030
But he call it [foreign
language], which is the same.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.040
But he played American
rap music all the time,

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.340
and more and more and more.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.070
Like he started out
with one hour at night,

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.290
and then he got two hours
in the early evening.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.740
And then twice a week
he had a show that ran

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.230 position:56%
for four hours and with black music.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.520
He also played African
music, but mainly hip-hop.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.520
And in his moderations,
in his like spoken word,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.600
he always interpreted songs by
Public Enemy, Run DMC, Kurtis Blow,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.430
and so forth, and talked about
it in the second culture terms.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.520
So it was very smart,
after all, he was some kind

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.750
of an official representating
the socialist culture.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.010
But then he just played
a whole side of record,

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.870
and he knew that the
youngsters would sit in front

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.510 position:56%
of their radio recorders and just
record the whole half of the record.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.040
And he would have, again,
some text and then say,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.340
and now for the second
half, [laughter],

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.880
and played the second half.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.810
He also played like
amateur productions

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.960
that the GDR or youth produced.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.260
But I talk about that
a little later.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.550
So again, these two strategies,
they didn't really work,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.030
but they were measures of control.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.770
And in the official
perception, the first strategy,

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.290
it usually worked,
because on the outside.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.820
Usually these young B-Boy crews,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.720
they got they obtained
their licenses

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.640
and then they were conforming
to the rules, and, you know,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.710
conforming to the regulations,
and it was all good.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.700 position:56%
When it did not, they were punished.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.460
And usually either the
People's Police came,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.600
and if the People's Police turned
out to be not effective enough,

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.420
then the Stasi applied their surge
of monitoring and infiltrating

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.760
and disintegrating
nonconformance to hip-hoppers.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.110
You had the whole gamut of,
you know, violence, of well,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.860
not torture, but infiltrating

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.390
with an official informants
and so on and so forth.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:02.560 position:56%
But I did find some examples of this
rather brutal [inaudible] practice,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.490
but the majority of hip-hop
crews conformed to the rules

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.150
and regulations and
steer clear of trouble.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.820
Which, however, did not mean
that they were conformists

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.200
on the inside, quite
to the contrary.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.610
I argue that because it was
so easy to play by the rules,

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.120
young hip-hoppers also played with
them, and ultimately used them

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.140
to express their grievances
with the GDR and to break

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.640
out of the confines of
the socialist state.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.550
So let's look at how they did this,

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.510
and let's look at "Beat
Street" again.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.470
So at glance, at the way
GDR teenagers appropriated

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.960
"Beat Street" reveals the wide gap

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.270
between the youth cultural
understanding of the film

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.050
and then the official goal.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.240
For them "Beat Street" performed
authentic hip-hop culture.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.120
For one thing, it enabled them
to meet real hip-hop stars,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.110 position:56%
their role models, albeit on
screen, Kool Herc, which you can see

00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:02.260
on the right-hand side, DJ
Jazzy Jeff, Afrika Bambaataa,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.090
you can see on the left-hand side.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.290
And the New York City
Breakers, I already showed,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.450
and then the Rock Steady
Crew, the rival dance crew,

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.390
and then Melle Mel,
of course, here too.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.210
And then there are more stars, Kool
Moe Dee, Doug Fresh, two rappers,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.480
and then Phase 2 is an
early graffiti artist

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.430
that some people might know.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.130
But he doesn't really have a
person role, but only by way

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.340
of his pictures, of
his graffiti murals.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.410
And then for another,
they were able to identify

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.940
with the everyday teenagers
in the movie

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.180
and observe them doing
their thing in hip-hop.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.400
Kenny, the DJ and emcee,
Lee the B-Boy,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.340
and Ramon, the graffiti artist.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.110
And then that's the
slide you already know.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.530
So what GDR youth had previously
pieced together on the basis

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.920
of media snippets from the West,
they could now view live almost,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.880
in color, and basically anytime
they wanted for only 50 pennies.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.580 position:56%
So what they usually did was go to a
matinee, then to an early afternoon,

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.360
and then to a late night screening.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.780
So back to back.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.360
And they paid 50 pennies for each.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.990
And that was pretty good for them.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.530
"Beat Street" appealed to them
because of its style rather

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.080
than any political
message and its story.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.260
Or, as the B-Boys themselves
recalled

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.310
about their viewing experience,
"what these teenagers had

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.810 position:56%
in the Bronx and did with it was a
lot more stylish, was world's cooler

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:34.420
than anything we teenagers
in the GDR had."

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.640
In their self-fashioning,
GDR B-Boys, rappers,

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.440 position:56%
emcees and graffiti artists
emulated "Beat Street" in many ways.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.470
They performed their visions
of New York in their clothing,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.770
in their graffiti, in their
DJ mixes and rap lyrics.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.500
Posing in front of rundown houses
in central Dessau, for instance,

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.920
invoked a whiff of New York.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.790
Meaning, of course, a ghetto
inner-city in the Bronx.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.830 position:56%
Equating the Bronx with inner-cities

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.900
in the GDR though challenged
the sanctioned marketing

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.690 position:56%
of socialist cities, which held them
up as paragons of modern housing

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.690
for everyone, and relied on
spreading immaculate images

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.220
of progressive urban
socialist achievements, right,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.520
these high-rises,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.660
these prefabricated high-rise
buildings in the GDR.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.660
Furthermore, this conjuring
up of black spaces

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.770
on their home turf
represents this symbolic

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.980
and imaginary identification
with African-Americans,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.970
which is characteristic of this
GDR youth African-Americaofelia.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.390
See here how they pose
in these houses,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.450
how they have on the right-hand
upper side the back pieces

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.340
of graffiti, which they produce
on their own, it's all self-made.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.420
They have the boom box as
something to, you know,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.550
invade public space with.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:02.060
And then the lower right-hand
outside picture is a nice kind

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:10.370 position:56%
of way of looking at the sun I guess
[laughter], but just a cool pose.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.190
So similarly, with the
practice of graffiti,

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.440
writers expressed themselves
visually and imagined themselves

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.540
into their visions of America
that enabled them to take part

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.040
in the transatlantic
culture of hip-hop.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.260
They thus committed a
temporary [foreign language],

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.950
the flight from the
Republic of the GDR.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:32.500
A short break from socialism, which
they thought constrained them,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.860
in which constrained
them like the ghetto.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.690
And if they had to live in
a ghetto, one could say,

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.870
they preferred the
Bronx over the GDR.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.150
Although, of course, they did not
know what the Bronx really looked

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.480
like, right.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.510 position:56%
For them, equating the Bronx with
the GDR meant seeing hip-hop culture

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.600
as a way to overcome this
feeling of being ghettoized.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.890
And this is what also they
saw in "Beat Street, right,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.420
overcoming being constrained
to the ghetto.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.320
Take, for example, the
writer Simo from Dresden.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.200
At age 14, he watched "Beat
Street," and after that,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.110
graffiti became his life.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.840
The following graffiti sketch
is taken from his black book,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.950
his sketchbook, of the 1980s,
shows how he's taken cues from

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.670
"Beat Street" and other
hip-hop media of the time.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.080
So I interviewed him, I met him,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.620
and then he gave me his
sketchbook and I photographed it.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.410
See how he makes Simo his writer
name by dropping the final N

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:32.720
of his name, Simon, just like
Ramo, Ramon in "Beat Street."

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.080
Also note how he graphically bowed
to US rappers in New York City

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.700
as the birthplace of hip-hop.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.890
You can see that on the right side.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:47.070
He has all the lists, he
lists all the hip-hop stars.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.830
And then there's the skyline of
New York, then there's the NY

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.930
with the Statue of Liberty, and
then there is the five Burroughs,

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.060
Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan,
Bronx, and Holland.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.240
And of course, he leaves out
Staten Island and inserts Harlem

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.820
and other black space, right.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.650
Whether this is subconsciously
or consciously, I don't know,

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.070
but it speaks volumes about
how much they were focused

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.450
on on these black spaces.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.650
His motives and comments suggest
that he iconically conceived

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.840
of himself as an African-American
writer living in New York.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.840
He is, after all, a subway rider.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.150
You can barely see, it's below
Simo, I am a subway rider,

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.900
you can see in pencil scribbling.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.210
And then writing graffiti
with a personalized spray can,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.960
which you can see on
the left-hand side.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.590
Roaming the boroughs of New
York like his own neighborhoods.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.670
He knows all the names and all
the places, as if he was a member

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:46.340
of the hip-hop scene there
and not in Dresden, right.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.850
And he's in the Bronx.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:56.640 position:56%
Then a picture that can be disputed
quite controversially is if you look

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.750 position:56%
at the Bronx picture, there's a
youngster with black skin obviously,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.350
and then he has a blue shirt,
and then a red kind of tie,

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:13.250
which could be also at least
half officially Free German Youth

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.550
uniform, right.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:19.940
So socialist mass organization
in communist times.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:25.360
But that's just it's an
observation, it could be disputed.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.860
For the members of the
state apparatus attempting

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.470
to control the practice of hip-hop,
these graffiti were difficult

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.930
to interpret, just like
the whole self-fashioning

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.480
of hip-hop heads proved
quasi-indecipherable

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.560
to these older generations.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.680
And then one aspect at
complicating the control

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.260
of the youth culture was blackness.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.710
On the one hand, it's seen in the
official praise for "Beat Street"

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.590
and Harry Belafonte,
African-Americans were perceived

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.550
as members of the international
working class,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.960
and therefore, to be
synthesized with.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.970
And on the other hand, they
were like teenagers in the GDR,

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.990
emulating blacks in the Bronx.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.810 position:56%
Sporting brands like Puma, listening
to American rap music in public,

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.080
and then also spray
painting graffiti,

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.470
and thereby like vandalizing
the property

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.720
of the state and the people.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.320
Which is not okay [laughter].

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.220
But the police could not
always do something against it

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.620
and the Stasi could also not
always do something against it.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.570
So let's look at some
rap culture in the music.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.320 position:56%
And I'm going to talk about a person
called TJ Big Blaster Electric

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.800
Boogie, that was his name.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.510
Big Blaster because of the
ghetto blaster or the boom box,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.920
and Electric Boogie, of
course, for the dancing style.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.410
Electric B, as he also
called himself,

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.360
alluding to his New York idols like
Afrika Bambaataa, emcee Melee Mel,

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.570
or Erik B Roquiem, those he lists
as his most influential idols.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:59.510
He organized a number of parties,
workshops, and contests in the city

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.620
of Dresden, especially
with a rap contest

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.890
and the rap workshop
in 1988 and in 1989.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.210
He intended to bring together
hip-hop artists from all

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.560
over the GDR to form the
so-called universal hip-hop family.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.030
The family, again, a reference to
Bambaataa and his Azula Nation,

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.890
was to organize hip-hop as a
youth culture independently

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:24.260
from the socialist unity party,
the ruling party in the GDR,

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.760
and its mass organizations
like the Free German Youth.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.150
Although the fall of the wars and
its aftermath ended the founding

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.930
of the universal hip-hop family,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:37.530
Electric B's activities show
how he used DJing and rap

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.310
to create an artist persona, which
allowed him to arrange himself

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.950
with socialism and at the same
time speak out against it.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.930
And I would like to
show that a little bit

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.520
in detail in a few seconds.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.920
With the help of a journalist who
supplied him with hip-hop records,

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.050
a youth club director who managed
to undermine the Free German Youth

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.570
and the youth club [foreign
language], which translates

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.330
into barn in American English,
into [foreign language].

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.520
He started performing
as the hip-hop DJ

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.660
and rapper TJ Big Blaster
Electric Boogie.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.520
His hip-hop parties
attracted large crowds.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.970
And while he performed
under an official license,

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.640
which you can see here, this
is what they looked like,

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.650 position:56%
he did not shy away from criticizing
the socialist cultural landscape.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.750
And I will show that in
his lyrics in a second.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:33.500
So his Christian name is Alexander
Morawitz, and he got this license

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.840
for voice singing, not as
a rapper or DJ or whatever.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:45.160
And this is a rather late license
from June 1989, he had one already

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.650
in 1984 and 1985, but he had

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.730
to renew it every year,
so this is a later one.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:56.880
And he could he was -- he had
got a very high rating, A,

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.180
just like American grades.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:04.090
So he got an A. And therefore,
he could receive payments

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.750
from the people who
booked him, between 70

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:10.790
and 130 marks per performance.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.940
And sometimes his performance
would be five minutes,

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.460
sometimes his performance
would be 20 minutes,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.300
sometimes they were even longer.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.380
And he would get money,
and that was true

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.330
for almost every B-Boy crew too.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.370
So they could make money and
then they invested this money

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.680
into the raw material
to make their clothing

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.450
or to buy records and
so on and so forth.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:35.410
So this is Alexander Morawitz, AKA
TJ Big Blaster Electric Boogie.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.040
So let's listen to his rap
Care, which he composed in 1988.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.890
The following is a live recording
from the Palace of the Republic,

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.440
in January 1989, where he performed

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.930
for the youth in the
Palace Festival.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.430
In other words, he could not get
any bigger, because the Palace

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.730
of the Republic was the biggest --

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.530
it was not only the
seat of the government,

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.710
but also it was the biggest
youth club in the GDR.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.200
And it could not get any more
official, because you had

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.470
to be an officially licensed
artist to perform there.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.850
So this is it.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:12.010
And you can try to decipher the
words, or just read with me.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.510
[ Music ]

00:31:14.510 --> 00:32:29.080
[ Silence ]

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.620
Okay, so I wanted to take you
through the lyrics, of course,

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.390
because they are very
hard to understand.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.090
He is obviously not a
native speaker of English,

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.860
and he also didn't have
English at school, right.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.160
He had to take Russian.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.830
And then, if you took English,
the contact hours that you had

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.630
with English were very, very few.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.110
So what he usually did, he learned
English from record sleeves,

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.680
of course, from the covers of
LPs, and then also he had friends

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.340
from the Technical University in
Dresden who were native Britons,

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:05.180
and they were lectures for the
University and taught English.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.980
And he kind of wrote his text
in German and translated them

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.030
into English and then kind of
polished them and gave them

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.840
to his friends and they
said, this is English enough,

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.530
or this is not English
enough [laughter].

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.490
So this is how it happened.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.290
And you can see the
gestures of boasting, right.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:27.230
I'm the best, I'm the greatest.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:33.240
And he's I think music history,
so he doesn't really identify

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.390
with anything of the
German musical tradition.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:40.450
He has his posse, right,
who was running this town,

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.520
not the mayor of Dresden, it
was he and his posse, right.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.900
[laughter] And so [inaudible]
everybody else,

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.760
and especially the
compromised money musician.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.940 position:56%
So compromise is basically or refers
to the compromise that you had

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:02.450 position:56%
to kind of deal with when you wanted
to make music, to perform in front

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.610
of this commission
that would assess you

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.370
and then hand out these licenses.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:14.810 position:56%
And usually, money musicians kind of
self-censored in order to do that.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.700
So they said, okay, we're not going
to speak up against the state,

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.440
we're not going to have too
much guitars, or we're not going

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.350
to have this line in there.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.340
But we're very conformist, and
this gives us a chance at least

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.700
to make music and to perform.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.710
And that's something he criticizes.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.450
Although he has a license too.

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:38.370
But the way he did it was,
since nobody spoke English

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.070
in these assessments commissions.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.810
He handed them the German
translations, and in the space

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.980
between the German and the
English, he could kind of slip

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.500
in conformist German lines and
not conformist English lines.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.470
So that's how he did it.

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:57.630
And that's why he could call
everybody else money musicians,

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.880
because they only did it for the
money, but he did it for a cause.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.710
And the craftsman vision
is how to do it the right,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:12.750
how to play music well, but
it's without a soul for him.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:18.030
So his soul is hurt when he
listens to this kind of stuff.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.020
And he's also dissing
everybody else, right,

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.440
the compromised money
musicians running zigzag,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.120
following the party line.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.550
And then so he doesn't need it.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:33.490
And he also is dissing them by
calling them with weaker melodies,

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.930
and he's, and this
is my favorite line,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:41.060
we're laughing watching the
pointer of our soccer seeker.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:46.090
The German original is or I
translate into better English now,

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:47.960
and please excuse my language.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.030
We're laughing watching the pointer
of our mother fuckers, right.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.380
So I said it before, excuse
my language [laughter].

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:03.660
So [inaudible] result of
this pig meat nation is

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.060
because the GDR was very proud

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.440
that it fed everybody
and it did so with pork.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.100
So this is why he calls
it pig meat nation.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:22.770
And he hates the cultural
functionaries, which he calls --

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.960
well, the people who
were responsible

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.550 position:56%
for the socialist cultural landscape
are always on vacation it seems,

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.870
and that's why nothing
really good can ever happen.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.170
And they're also suckers.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:40.870
And in this void, he appears and
he brings kind of more culture,

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.510
and everybody else
better stay behind him,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.720 position:56%
because he brings more entertainment
and good times and also criticism.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.160
So that's what he does.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.860
I admit that I'm sure
that not everybody

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.840
in his audience always
understood him [laughter],

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.000
at least not in the
Palace of the Republic.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.080
But he had every fortnight he
had big parties in Dresden,

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.960
and he had like an
audience, he had regulars.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.250
And I'm pretty sure that
those people knew what he was

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.550
talking about.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.810
And also he had regular
workshops where he invited people

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.460
to share their lyrics, to
help them with rhyming,

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.150
with the craft making beats,
and so on and so forth.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.790
So I guess that he had he could
reach out to this community

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:32.150
of hip-hoppers, and
excluding the adult world

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.430
who was keen on monitoring him.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.790
All right, to conclude,
from 1983 to 1990,

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.620
hip-hop culture became
very much alive

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.680
in the German Democratic Republic.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.810
A small but highly visible scene
gives the authorities positive

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.830 position:56%
disposition towards African-American
culture as working-class culture,

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.940
and created its own
versions of breakdance,

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.250
graffiti, Djing, and rap.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.790
In this process of
cultural transfer,

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.900
"Beat Street" played
a decisive role.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.350
Originally imported in order to
educate good young socialists

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:07.140
about bad capitalism in America,
it had quite the opposite effect,

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.940
and instilled in many
young viewers the wish

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.400
to become a hip-hopper
in New York City.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.750
At the same time, it served as
a role model for aspiring B-Boys

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.260
and B-Girls, graffiti
writers, and DJs, and rappers,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.310
to emulate what they
saw on the movie screen.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.070
Against their performances,
be it on official stages,

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.370
be it on the streets,

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:32.470
the controlling agency strategies
proved useless in the long run.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.620
The fall of Iron Curtain also meant
a last curtain for hip-hop culture

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.190
in the GDR, at least for a while.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.020
Apart from the new challenges
that came with having to adjust

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.990
to a new political system,
hip-hoppers had to cope

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.000
with the collapse of
socialist landscape

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.550
that had promoted and
fostered hip-hop.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.370
Although it had done so with the
intention to control and steer it

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:56.920
into the right direction,
acrobatic folk dance, right,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.530
many B-Boy crews had profited
from the money, opportunities,

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.400
and perks that this
arrangement had included,

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.030
such as free practice
space, etcetera.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.020
Now that it was gone and other
things were more important,

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.130
many hip-hoppers took
a hiatus from hip-hop.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.790
However, in the early '90s,
they found back together,

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.240
often in concert with
peers from the West.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.100
And in East-Western collaborations,
they founded new crews who danced,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.990
rapped, spray-painted
graffiti, and made music.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.630
Thus, they contributed to the
process of reunifying Germany

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.020
after 1990, but that's
another chapter

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.330
that I haven't researched yet.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.510
So thank you very much
for your attention.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.130
Questions?

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.570
Yes, Robert.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:56.300
There's a mic.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, and
very, very interesting talk.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.650
This might be outside the
scope of your research,

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.720
but do you have any idea how --

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.260
when you see in West Germany that
they are also taking up this sort

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.420
of hip-hop culture, do
you see any transfer?

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.300
Or do you see any different
interpretations

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.710
in West Germany compared to how
the East Germans are taking this

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:23.190
as a means of sort of
rebellion against authority?

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:24.630
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding:
It's a good question.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:29.340
If you look at how hip-hop
got into West Germany,

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.570
was by African-American
GIs and the military bases,

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:37.970
the American military bases play
the most important role in this.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.740
And so young teenagers from West
Germany could actually meet these

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.460
GIs in the clubs, and they
would bring the records,

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.450
they would bring the know-how,
and they knew how to dress well

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.920
as a hip-hopper and
so on and so forth.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:57.110
So you had this is the main
kind of I guess contrast, right,

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.180
main difference between
these two scenes.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:08.220
I think that due to the fact
that hip-hop in the GDR was kind

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.240
of was transported by
already a stereotype, right.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:18.110
Because "Beat Street" was basically
not received very well even in 1984

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.690
in the United States, because
it was already deemed dead.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.190
With the recording industry
and record industry,

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.500
they basically already had
exported hip-hop enough

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.360
and it was drained of its soul.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.990
So everything that could then
be exported was not the real

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.290
thing anymore.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.440
And "Beat Street" conveyed
that in a sense.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:44.500
And it's not taking place in its
original place, it's Queens, right,

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.920
and not the Bronx, where
they shot the movie.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:56.270 position:56%
But the GIs, they were real like
disc jockeys, or they had knowledge,

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.860
and I guess they showed
it and they shared it.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.160
And I guess the way of looking
at African-Americans in East

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.380
and West is different this way.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:14.420
And in terms of rebellion,
I think it's worth noticing

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.830
that in West Germany,

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:24.940
African-American GIs barely had
a public space due to the racism

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.530
within the Armed Forces,
American Armed Forces,

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.790
but also in West Germany society.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.580
And they kind of built a coalition

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.570
with the immigrants
Turks population.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:39.600
So Funkadelic, the first and for
a long time only black music club

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.930
in Frankfurt, in West Germany, very
close to all of the American bases,

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:47.360
of course, was run by a young Turk.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.320
So I guess you had
minority populations

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.520
and they joined forces somehow.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.590
And in East Germany, you
didn't have it that much.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:01.650
I mean, you had African contract
workers from Angola, Mozambique,

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:06.810
and sometimes also Cuba, and
they were very like attractive

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.090
for the young B-Boys because they
would bring some authenticity

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:14.230
to the breakdance crews, which
is highly problematic, of course.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:19.150
But they were ghettoized in
the GDR by the regime already.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.910
They could only live
in certain cities,

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.910
in certain dwellings,
and so on and so forth.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:26.930
But they kind of made it out there
sometimes and then intermingled

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.470
but not in a way that it
happened in West Germany.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.540
And I guess West Germany
was more commercialized

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.030
from the very beginning because
you could just buy Nike and Puma,

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.340
Adidas wear, and you
could buy all the records.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.280
And in the GDR, you had to be
a little bit more inventive

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.970
and you had to improvise more.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.190
So that's the main
differences, and also I think

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.310
that speaks a little bit about
the potential of rebellion.

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.290
Yes, please.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.820
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.420
You mentioned that English
wasn't going to work.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.990
And I wonder whether "Beat Street,"

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:11.690
when it came out, was
dubbed or subtitled?

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.500
And in either case, how faithful
was it to the original script?

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.500
Or were there kind of
strategic changes made?

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.280
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding: So
what I know is that they --

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.590
it was dubbed, there
was no subtitling.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.840
And they bought -- the GDR
bought the West German version.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.210
So it was dubbed by a
company in West Germany.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:38.140
So you can't really speak
of any strategic changes,

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:44.470
that you should speak like in
socialist terms to the audience.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:48.280
The only strategic
changes are in terms

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.500
of cultural legibility I guess.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.060
So I haven't compared the
two scripts, of course,

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.690
but I know that sometimes,

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:02.520
like maybe [inaudible] a female is
translated differently in German,

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:08.520
a different context, but basically
it carries the same message.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.820
Thank you.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.400
Yeah, and then.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:23.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Growing up in the middle
of the United States at this time,

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:29.590
I mean, I was 12 years old when
this came out, it's interesting

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.300
that the assimilation of hip-hop
culture that you're talking

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.350
about in East Germany was
essentially taking place

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.780
simultaneously in the
middle of the country.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:47.000
Because New York might as well
have been East Germany to someone,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.840
you know, from Oklahoma,
like myself, or,

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.660
you know, around in that area.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:55.480
And one thing that I find
interesting about this is that

00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:01.070
"Beat Street" was part of a whole
bunch of films, similar films,

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.830
that came out around the same time.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:10.740
And from the perspective of
my sort of group growing up,

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.580
"Beat Street" had a kind of
sense of authenticity culturally

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.480
that something like breaking,
for instance, did not have,

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.940
was very sort of sanitized, by the
book sort of movie, that, you know,

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.030
they taught the white
girl how to breakdance

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.330
and all this sort of thing.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.110
And it was that very much
a Hollywoody sort of thing.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:37.580
And I'm wondering if those
other movies made any sort

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.300
of showing in East Germany?

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.200
Because it sounds like it
was a little more thoughtful,

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.090
the way that the film was
introduced, "Beat Street" that is.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.070
And these others would've
not been of much interest.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:54.920
But in the United States, it
at the time seemed to be that

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.550
"Beat Street" had a kind
of authenticity to it,

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.010
but Hollywood needed to sanitize
all of that even further and put

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.120
out things like breaking for people

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.880
who weren't comfortable
with what was going on.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.180
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding:
Yeah, good question.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.360
So "Beat Street" I should mention
is also a Hollywood production,

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.260
but it was produced by an
African-American and also directed

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.700
by an African-American, Stan
Lathan was the director.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:28.240 position:56%
And also, when I looked in the
archives, in East Germany's Ministry

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.920
of Culture, the division of
film, I mean, they had to rate

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.790
and then approve everything,
right, in communist times.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.710
They looked at things
like "Breakin'"

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.250 position:56%
and "Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo."

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:49.050 position:56%
They did not look at "Star Wars" and
they did not look at "Wild Style."

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:54.810
But since they did not decide
to approve and to import it,

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:58.260
there's no further mentioning
of the movies, and I don't know

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.570
like how they liked it or
how they didn't like it.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:05.710
But I think the fact that
Harry Belafonte is the producer

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:12.060
and he was almost communist
enough for the regime to --

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:17.940
for their cause, they decided
to go with "Beat Street."

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:24.300
And for the youngsters,
it was authentic enough.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.530
And for the officials,
it was super authentic.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:32.250
So I mean, there's a whole
authenticity debate, right.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:38.600
But this portrayal was
for them the real thing.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.900
&gt;&gt; Wonderful presentation.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.630
I was just wondering how
East German hip-hop compared

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.250
to other communist
countries or contrasted

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.570
with other communist
countries at the time?

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:49.870
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding:
In terms of hip-hop?

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:52.470
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding: Yeah.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:53.770
It's also a very good question.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.430
So you know that in Hungary and
the Czech Republic and in Poland,

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:00.090
they had some hip-hop culture.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.300
I don't know anything
about the Soviet Union.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:07.280
The Soviet Union did not have any
hip-hop movies, that's for sure,

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.400
because they would
have imported those.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.700
That's my guess.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.820
Starting in 1987, they had
international hip-hop, breaking,

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.420
breakdance competitions
in Szolnok and Hungary.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:27.030
And people from France, from
Switzerland, from Austria,

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.830
countries that had some
kind of communist tradition,

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.680
not from West Germany,
and then from Hungary,

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.560
they met there and they competed.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:41.550
And some B-Boy crews from
East Germany went there,

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.650
also some soloists,
dancers went there.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.920
And I have some video
material, which is super funny,

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:53.250
but I don't have any
written sources on that.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:57.030
The only thing that -- and I'm
still waiting for some answer

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:01.830
from the Stasi archive because
one drew decided to defect,

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:07.690
so they made it out of the GDR by
way of Szolnok, in Hungary in 1987.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.470
And that was a big
scandal and a big --

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:18.660
it was just horrible for the adult
like parents who went with them,

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.560
right, because they had kind
of vouched for this youth

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.160
that everything would be okay.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.670
Hungary and Czechoslovakia were in
high demand because you could buy

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:34.030
or get spray cans there and
other like Western goods

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.880
that were needed for hip-hop.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:44.000
So I have a whole like scrapbook
from Dresden, which is that big,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.320
and it's a mixture between a
diary and newspaper clippings

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.800
but also some sketches
and photographs.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.070
And it shows them in
like total B-Boy wear,

00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:01.160
but also with a bare
upper body in Budapest.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.180
And this is where they could buy
Cocoa-Cola and Marlboro cigarettes,

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:10.340
they could be a little bit more,
you know, free or capitalist.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:17.250 position:56%
So that was in high demand for them.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.800
That was basically
it, not many meetings.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.590
Nowadays it's a little bit
different because there are ties

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.570
between the different
cities at least.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.530
Thank you.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:32.540
Yes, please.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.780
&gt;&gt; This may be a little bit
outside of the parameter

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.800 position:56%
of the research you presented today,
but have you done any research

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.060
into the influence that some German
artists have had on early hip-hop,

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.430
like George Jones or craft work?

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.330
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding: Only a
little bit about [inaudible],

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:51.980
but not in depth research.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.030
I just know that it's kind of
like Afrika Bambaataa is --

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:03.160
or hip-hop in Germany as a
whole is kind of full circle

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.470
or [inaudible] coming full
circle, because [inaudible]

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:09.330
as a German band basically
pioneered electronic music,

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:12.300
that Afrika Bambaataa then
picked up and made hip-hop with.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.400
And then Afrika Bambaataa was the
person that was in high demand

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.880
for East German hip-hoppers.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.560
And so that kind of music
tradition is like going

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.860
across Atlantic at this time.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:33.310
Not that much -- I haven't done
that much research about it.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:38.310
It's also very hard since the Iron
Curtain was actually quite a good

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.460
kind of border for material goods.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:44.590
So you couldn't buy any vinyl
records in East Germany.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:47.460
And I should mention
that in West Germany,

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.320
they just didn't know
what records to buy,

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.120
so they were not there
either, right.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:57.600
So the GIs had to kind of bring
them to the PFs on the base

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.180
and then they would be available.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.450
So it was very slow.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:05.670
And then some music
journalists from East Germany,

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:09.790
they would get the records
without having to ask for them.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.380 position:56%
So they would be [foreign language],
that's what the German term is.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.400
They would just get them
because for their review.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.530
But they gave them away sometimes.

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:24.090
So if there's still one journalist
who has this record collection,

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:28.200
and could tell me which records he
had and which records he gave away,

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.580
then I could tell you more
about how it was used.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.690
But it's gone, I'm sorry to say.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:37.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:39.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.310 position:56%
I was really fascinated by this
idea of second culture that was used

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:45.260
as a kind of wider theoretical
framework by the government

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.840
to understand world
culture, it sounds like.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.090
And I'm curious if you
could speak more broadly,

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.420
if you know it was used
elsewhere in the socialist bloc?

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.490
And what other cultural phenomena
were considered to be sort

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:58.810
of second culture worth importing?

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.110
&gt;&gt; Leonard Schmieding: Thank you.

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:05.370
I've only found it like in GDR
publications, I've only found it

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:11.740
in terms of hip-hop, when they
talk about hip-hop in the 1980s.

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:16.420
I would have to go back to these
magazines and public discourse

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:22.470
to look whether it was also
used with blues or jazz.

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.450 position:56%
But I'm not really -- I'm uncertain.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.740
I'm guessing probably
not, because it was more

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.410
like a folk culture,
blues and jazz were.

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:38.920
And then Chazenski, the
historian, he used it in his

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.540
like multi-volume work
on the history

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.190
of the everyday of
the German people.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.230
And there's a long
chapter using this term.

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:54.140
And it's a hard read, because it's
not only this communist lingo,

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.960
it's also like citation
after citation by people

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.590
like not only Linen or Marks
but like [foreign language],

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:04.290
you name all these
communist socialist big names.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.870
Great thinkers and great citations,

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:10.340
but it's not very concise
[laughter].

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.690
So I haven't found it
with anything else.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:18.810
But maybe a good place to
start would be the preparations

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:23.050
for the World Youth Festival in
Berlin, in 1973, because that's

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:26.330
when Berlin kind of first
under Hannukah opened --

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:30.420
the GDR wanted to be a little
bit more open to the world

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.430
and show how modern
socialism could be.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:37.530
I mean, behind the scenes, they
were very like rigid with the Stasi

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.770
and everything, and they
cleansed the city of it,

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:43.020
like every element
that they didn't want.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.530
But the solidarity with the
oppressed was a big topic there.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.060
So you might f ind stuff there.
