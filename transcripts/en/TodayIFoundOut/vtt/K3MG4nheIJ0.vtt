00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.500
Perhaps no image is more synonymous with the
act of wine making than that of a person smushing

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.440
grapes with their bare feet to extract the
precious juices contained therein (in the

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.539
grapes, not the inevitably sweaty feet).

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.869
But did winemakers ever commonly do this?

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.970
The answer to this question largely depends
on who you ask.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.900
Today, certain winemakers, usually ones that
have some sort of a financial interest in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.790
it, (at least publicly) maintain that grape
stomping was an integral part of winemaking

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.790
history.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.530
However, historians tend to think it was a
relatively rare practise.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.960
To be clear, nobody is saying that ancient
people didn’t crush grapes with their feet

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.000
to extract the juices; rather, it is known
that man has had a much more efficient alternative

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.790
to this method for at least 6000 years.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.559
We know this because in early 2011 archaeologists
uncovered the remnants of an archaic winery,

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.120
complete with a wine press dating back to
4000 BC in Armenia.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.960
Wine itself can be traced back to at least
5400 BC, which would suggest that early man

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.380
must have had a more rudimentary method of
crushing grapes before someone invented a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.750
wine press; and, indeed, probably involved
the use of feet.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.140
This is supported by the existence of numerous
pieces of artwork and other references from

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.859
history illustrating people curb stomping
piles of grapes while they stood in giant

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:30.859
vats.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.220
Perhaps the most prominent pieces come from
ancient Egypt where it’s largely believed

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.319
that stomping grapes was a common part of
winemaking, as evidenced by numerous pieces

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.990
of artwork depicting exactly that.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.689
However it’s important to note that this
was by no means the only step in the juice

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.770
extraction process.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.420
You see, treading grapes is a remarkably inefficient
method of extracting juice from them, and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.180
up until very recently in history, humans
were all about not wasting anything food related

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.180
(See: A Brief History of French Toast).

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.640
After stomping grapes, the ancient Egyptians
would then put the leftovers into a large

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.119
sack, at which point: “Poles were tied to
the sack’s four corners and by turning them

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.369
the rest of the grape juice was squeezed out.”

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.830
A thing to keep in mind is that pressing grapes
is a deceptively difficult task and the amount

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.900
of pressure you use to squeeze grapes must
be closely monitored to avoid accidentally

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.819
releasing bitter tannins from the seeds, which
can, obviously, negatively affect the taste

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.300
of the final product.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.680
With this in mind, pressing grapes by using
simple bodyweight seems like a good way to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.680
avoid applying too much pressure.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.700
However, it’s just too inefficient to be
used on a mass scale unless you were earning

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.910
Egyptian Pharaoh levels of money and had a
fleet of slaves or workers to do it for you.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.959
Not surprisingly, in almost every civilisation
in which wine presses were used, there appears

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.239
to be little evidence that they also stomped
wine; they simply didn’t need to and had

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.129
a much more efficient process in the wine
presses.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.610
An exception to this can be found in Ancient
Rome where grape stomping was common to extract

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.220
the initial juices from grapes, which they
believed to have special properties the rest

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.780
of the juices did not.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.099
Even in this case, the Romans are still noted
to have used presses to extract the bulk of

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.000
the juices after this stomping took place.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.140
As for why treading grapes seems to be so
synonymous with winemaking in general, despite

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.659
being inefficient, unsanitary, rarely used
in history, and time-consuming, that may have

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.920
a lot to do with the winemaking industry itself
playing up to the allure of romanticised old

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.920
timey imagery.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.189
If there’s one thing the wine industry is
great at, it’s making wine seem grandiose,

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.160
when, in the end, it’s just fermented fruit
juice.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.700
Beyond the mystique, there’s an entire industry
based around selling people vacations during

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.950
which they will stomp grapes to make wine
“the traditional way”, even though it’s

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.319
currently illegal in America to sell any wine
made in this way for hygiene reasons and it

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.379
has been for over a century.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.939
It’s just good marketing for the people
advertising these events to play up to the

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.170
fact that grape treading is a supposedly common
ancient way of making wine, even though we’ve

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.090
been pressing grapes in a vastly more efficient
way for many millennia; and with extremely

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.569
rare exceptions, these better methods were
always how wine was made.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.200
Another factor that has played into the popularity
of wine treading is the now iconic 1956 episode

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.530
of I Love Lucy, Lucy’s Italian Adventure,
which features the titular character stomping

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.190
grapes in an Italian winery.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.609
The episode led to a surge in interest in
the practise, despite the fact that the Californian

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.320
grape farmers who supplied the grapes for
the episode did so under the condition that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.210
a character would explicitly mentioned that
grapes aren’t really pressed by foot by

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.210
wine makers.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.639
It should also be noted that, as alluded to,
in rural Europe where most of the imagery

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.900
surrounding this practise is sourced from,
the use of feet has been wholly absent from

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.740
the professional wine making process since
the Middle Ages.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.500
During Prohibition, Grape growers of the day
began selling “bricks of wine”, which

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.930
were primarily blocks of “Rhine Wine”.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.500
These often included the following instructions:
“After dissolving the brick in a gallon

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.080
of water, do not place the liquid in a jug
away in the cupboard for twenty days, because

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:13.199
then it would turn into

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:13.430
wine.”
