It's cool that we learned how to use the console to manipulate other web pages,

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.630
but, of course, we need to start making our own.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.920
&gt;&gt; It's easy to open up the page.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm going to get rid of this Hello World here.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.590
And all you have to do is open index.html in the browser of your choice,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.420
like we have here.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.280
And refresh the page.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.420
And you'll see a very exciting blank page.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.690
Let's talk about how we're going to write something here on this page.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.100
&gt;&gt; It's not too hard.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.790
We can use jQuery's .append function to add HTML to an element on the page.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.460
&gt;&gt; And if the element already has some HTML content,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.550
a pen will add the new HTML to the end of the old content.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.980
I have got ResumeBuilder.js open here.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.940
For our website, we wanted to append HTML to the page's Header.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.000
We will start with this jQuery selector for Header.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.200
The pound sign tells us that we're looking for an element with the id of header.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.240
So in our HTML, we see this div with id equals header.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.180
This selector grabs this tag.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.070
Let's give our students a chance to try it out.
