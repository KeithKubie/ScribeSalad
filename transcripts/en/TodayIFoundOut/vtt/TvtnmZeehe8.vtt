00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.200
This misconception stems primarily from the
fact that, originally, aerosol cans used chlorofluorocarbons

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.450
as a propellant.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.000
Chlorofluorocarbons were also used commonly
in refrigerators, air conditioners, and for

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500
many industrial applications.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.790
Chlorofluorocarbons were particularly popular
because they are non-flammable, non-toxic,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.070
and non-reactive to most compounds.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.520
However, after scientists began to observe
that the Earth’s ozone layer was thinning

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.020
beyond normal seasonal variations, in 1974,
Nobel Prize winner Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.920
and Dr. Mario Molina discovered that these
chlorofluorocarbons were the likely cause

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.550
of the damage to the ozone layer, though this
wasn’t conclusively proven until 1984.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.000
Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, in
the mid-1970s most manufacturers voluntarily

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.740
stopped using chlorofluorocarbons.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.710
Further, in 1978, chlorofluorocarbons were
officially banned in the United States, with

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.210
a few exceptions.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.420
These exceptions were primarily concerning
certain medical applications, such as with

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.700
asthma inhalers (though use in inhalers and
other medicinal applications were officially

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.460
banned in 2008).

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.560
Other countries quickly followed the U.S.
in banning the use of chlorofluorocarbons,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.880
including Canada, Mexico, Australian, and
many European nations.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.499
Thanks to the Montreal Protocol agreement,
ratified by 70 countries initially and 196

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:40.420
countries to date, production of chlorofluorocarbons,
along with other ozone damaging substances,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.850
began to be phased out altogether starting
in 1996, the completion of which, even in

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.999
many developing countries, took place in 2010.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.159
So the bottom line is that for the last three
decades or so in the U.S., followed by many

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.039
other developed countries shortly thereafter,
aerosol sprays haven’t contained any known

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:12.370
ozone depleting substances.
