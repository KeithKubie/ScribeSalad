00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.770
-(cheering, applause)
-Welcome back.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.038
Now, tonight we have to talk

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.240
about the latest
police shooting video

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.108
that's making national news.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.643 line:0%
<i> Police in Louisiana
 this morning</i>

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:13.780 line:0%
are investigating the deadly
police shooting of a black man.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.282
NEWSWOMAN:<i> The video apparently
 shows police confronting</i>

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:19.185
<i> 37-year-old Alton Sterling
 Tuesday morning.</i>

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.254
<i> He's tackled
 by one of the officers.</i>

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.157
<i> Seconds later, an officer
 appears to scream out,</i>

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.259
<i>"Sterling is holding a weapon."</i>

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.428
<i> Sterling was pronounced dead
 at the scene.</i>

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.396
He was pronounced dead
at the scene

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.031
because he was shot by the cops

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.866
while he was pinned
to the ground.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.836
I mean, when I saw this video,
like many of us in this office,

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.237
I mean, we were all
just speechless.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.839
I mean,
is this the type of thing

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.507
we should really have
on a comedy show?

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.543
Now, we've covered
this type of thing in the past,

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.811
and to be frank with you,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.879
we're just tired
of this (bleep) happening,

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:50.083
and feel like we have
to address it in some way.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:54.353
And let me just say, thank God
for (bleep) cell phones.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.855
(applause, whooping)

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:59.092
Really. Because...

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.129
we would never even hear about
incidents like this otherwise.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.698
In fact, part of what makes
people in the black community

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.601
so enraged about this is,
for years we never had evidence

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.036
for these things.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.805
But, you know, in Baton Rouge,
the cops have body cameras.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.074
Okay. So let's see
what that shows. Roll it.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:16.609 line:0%
NEWSMAN: 
<i> The officers in question</i>

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.112 line:0%
<i> were wearing body cameras,
 but they apparently fell off</i>

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.447 line:0%
<i> at the altercation.</i>

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.683
-Fell off?
-MAN: Fell off.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.718
Things don't just<i> fall off.</i>

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.720
Unless you're talking
about Sisqó

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.356
and face of the (bleep) earth.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:34.627
All right? I mean, seriously,
Sisqó, where's "Thong Song 2"?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.529
(laughter, groans)

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.531
I don't know,
this looks bad, Louisiana.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.366
And they know it looks bad, too.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.869
They even brought out
the governor to talk about it.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.204 line:0%
The video is disturbing,
to say the least.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.240 line:0%
In Louisiana,
we're known for our ability

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.442 line:0%
to come together
in difficult circumstances.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.044 line:0%
We will certainly get through,
uh, this tragedy.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.046
Okay, seems like
they're taking it seriously.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.048
I mean, he's got
more middle-aged black women

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.651
on that stage than
a community theater production

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:00.520
of<i> The Color Purple,</i> so...

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.955
-(laughter)
-Right? Right?

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:05.224
Kudos, kudos, kudos to you.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:06.792
Right.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.127
But, uh...

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.363
but what does the, uh,
Louisiana governor

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.232
specifically have to say
about the investigation?

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.701 line:0%
There should be no, uh...

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.838 line:0%
doubt in anybody's mind
but this incident

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.440 line:0%
is gonna be investigated
impartially,

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:23.176 line:0%
professionally and thoroughly,

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.378 line:0%
uh, by the United States
Department of Justice

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.946 line:0%
Civil Rights Division.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.681
Wait, hold on a second.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.550
The Department of Justice?

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.118
The same Department of Justice

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.387
that just handled
Hillary's e-mails?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.056
I don't think black people
are waiting for these cops

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.159
to be excused because the FBI
says they were just "careless."

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.728
And what gets me about this,
what really gets me,

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.330
is that whenever this happens,

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:46.132
there's always
an immediate takedown

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.667
of the dead man's character.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.802 line:0%
We do understand he did in fact
have a criminal record.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.338 line:0%
According to his family and some
of the records that we dug up,

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.041 line:0%
yes, he did have at least...
at least one prior conviction.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.609 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN: 
<i>Sterling has an arrest history,</i>

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.678 line:0%
<i> ranging from battery
 to drug possession.</i>

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.013
So he had a criminal record.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:04.016
Martha Stewart has
a criminal record.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.019
-(laughter, applause, whooping)
-I don't...

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:09.355
I don't remember her
being executed

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:11.457
in a convenience store
parking lot.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.492
Maybe I missed it,
but it feels like

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:16.562
that would have made
<i> Huffington Post</i> at least.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.798
No matter what his crimes were,

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:21.834
Alton Sterling did not deserve
to be executed for them.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.437
Look, guys, the punishment
for resisting arrest

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.972
shouldn't be death.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.007
The punishment
for selling bootleg CD's

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.308
shouldn't be death.

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.178
The punishment for having a gun
in an open-carry state

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.379
shouldn't be death.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.948
The punishment
for being a black man

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.850
shouldn't be death.

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.819
(applause, whooping)

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.391
Now...

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:47.994 line:0%
Black Lives Matter protests
have already sprung up

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.962 line:0%
across Louisiana
in the past 24 hours,

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.898 line:0%
and, you know, let me just say
a quick word about this

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.567 line:0%
just for a second.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.571
It's not that black lives are
more important than white lives,

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.106
or Asian lives,

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.808
but all people don't have the
same uniquely fraught history

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.944
with law enforcement
that black people do.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.014
This is why as infuria...
infuriating as it was,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:10.616
that black people cheered for
the O.J. Simpson verdict, okay?

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.685
Long before white people
could give an Emmy

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:14.553
to Sarah Paulson's hair.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.122
(laughter)

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.557
So when Black Lives Matter
is protesting,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.427
can we just not hear this
right now?

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.462 line:0%
This theme
of Black Lives Matter--

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.531 line:0%
you know what also matters?
Blue lives matter.

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:26.799 line:0%
<i> And all lives matter.</i>

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:28.501 line:0%
Absolutely, all lives matter.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.470 line:0%
-Black lives matter because
<i> all</i> lives matter. -Mm-hmm.

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:33.506 line:0%
-All lives matter.
-All lives matter.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.508
Black lives matter or all lives?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.176
Well, they say
black lives matter.

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.879
I and you and Donald Trump say
all lives matter.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.213
Okay.

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:44.350
If you really believe in
"all lives matter"-- it's fine--

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:46.786
then you should be out there
protesting, right?

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.723
-I mean, Alton Sterling...
-(applause, cheering)

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:53.793
If you break it down.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.961
Alton Sterling was a life,

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.830
the loss of which
should upset you.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:59.432
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.068
In the spirit of inclusuvity...
inclusivity,

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.236
let's check in
with an All Lives Matter,

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:06.138
uh, rally here in New York.

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:08.274
(cricket chirping)

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.411
I'm sorry, that's our bad.
Um, that's right,

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:15.248
uh, maybe All Lives Matter is
protesting in Chicago. Our bad.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.652
(birds chirping)

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:20.986
That was my bad again.

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:23.422
Uh, All Lives Matter must be
protesting in Louisiana.

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:25.691
I mean, that's where the murder
happened. If you could just...

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:27.660
(cricket chirping)

00:05:29.294 --> 00:05:30.629
Where's the outrage, guys?

00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.498
I thought
all lives mattered to you.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.167
Doesn't Alton Sterling's
life matter?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.533
We'll be right back.
