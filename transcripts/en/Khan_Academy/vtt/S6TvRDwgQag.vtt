00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.770
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.280
analyze why it makes sense
for two companies that

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.050
make up a duopoly to coordinate.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.870
To get into an agreement,
which may or may not be legal--

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.170
probably would be illegal--
and restrict quantity.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.010
But also think about why
there's a strong incentive

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.010
for either or both
of the parties

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.170
to cheat their agreement
and produce more quantity

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.010
than they agreed to produce.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.870
So let's say that both of
our players in our duopoly--

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.204
and this would actually apply
to an oligopoly generally,

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.661
but the analysis would be a
little bit more difficult if we

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.640
had more than two
players-- but let's say

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.060
each player has an identical--
they're identical companies.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.340
And they both have a
marginal cost curve

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.350
that looks something like that.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.100
So they both have an
individual marginal cost

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.430
curve that looks like that.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.520
And they both have an
average total cost curve

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.765
that looks something like this.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.327
And they are identical.

00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:03.410
So I'll just draw it once.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.519
This is the marginal
cost and average total

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.040
cost for both firms.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.410
Now let's think about what it
would look like for the market.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.220
Well, one way to
think about it--

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.190
pick an arbitrary marginal cost.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.700
So for one firm, what
can they produce,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.176
or what quantity will they
be at that marginal cost?

00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:23.550
Well, they'll be
at this quantity

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.740
for that marginal cost.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.110
But if you have two firms
that are just like that,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.670
they could have twice
as much quantity

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.200
to be at that point
in marginal cost.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.210
So two firms will be over there.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.790
And if you picked
this marginal cost,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.850
one firm would
produce that quantity

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.470
to be right at
that marginal cost,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.210
for that next incremental good.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.670
But two firms could
produce two, especially

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.037
if they have the exact
same cost structure.

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:48.620
So what you're going
to have is you're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.300
essentially adding
this curve to itself

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.330
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.974
So if you look at the marginal
cost curve for both firms

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:57.390
together, you're
essentially going

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.800
to get a curve that is twice
is fat as the marginal cost

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.680
curve for one firm.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.290
So it will look
something like this.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.400
And I'll do it in yellow.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.270
So it will look
something like that.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.570
So that is the marginal
cost for the market, where

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.310
the market in this example
is both of these firms.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.070
And that will also be true
for the average total cost.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.740
If at this price--
or actually, I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.190
should say, if the average
total cost is up here

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.400
for one firm-- that
means that they

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.160
are producing this quantity.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.380
But two firms together could
produce twice the quantity

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.070
of that average total cost.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.915
So two firms would
produce twice.

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:41.540
And so what you're going to have
is an average total cost curve

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.160
that is twice as fat as
the average total cost

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640
curve for one firm, if
you talk about the market.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.310
So the market's average
total cost curve

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.980
is going to look
something like this.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.340
It's going to be twice as fat.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.390
It's the exact same logic.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.970
It's going to look
something like that.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.005
So that is the average total
cost curve for the market.

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.570
So, so far, the convention
that I've ended up using

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.020
is orange for an
individual firm,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.050
and then this dotted yellow
line for the market as a whole.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.580
Now let's think about
what a good equilibrium--

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.490
or what the right
price should be

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.854
if they were able to
coordinate together.

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:27.270
If they were to essentially
combine their firms and almost

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.701
behave like a monopoly.

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:30.200
And to think about
that, we're going

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.050
to have to draw a demand curve.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.500
So let me draw the
market demand curve.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.200
Let's say the
market demand curve

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.909
looks something like that.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.450
It's really big, so
it's hard for me.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.410
And we'll assume
that this is a line.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.600
So it's not-- well,
that's pretty good.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.350
So this is the
market demand curve.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.640
So if both of these firms
operated together, if they--

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.440
I drew the market demand curve.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.770
I also want to draw the
market marginal revenue curve.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.270
Now remember, we're going to
assume that both of these firms

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.760
are acting together.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.590
If they perfectly coordinate,
they can join their capacities

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.220
and act essentially
like a monopoly.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.660
So if they did act
like a monopoly,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.800
their marginal
revenue curve would

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.880
be twice the slope of
this market demand curve.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.660
So it would hit the horizontal
axis right over there.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.400
And so it would look
something like this.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:38.430
So this right over here is the
market marginal revenue curve.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.280
So if they were to
behave like a monopoly,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.810
you could view this dotted line
as their marginal cost curve.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.490
This would be their
average total cost.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.530
And now this is their
marginal revenue.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.090
If they were to
behave as a monopoly,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.548
what would be the
optimal quantity?

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:53.380
Well, it would be right there,
right where marginal revenue is

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.000
equal to marginal cost.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.500
Before that, they
would keep wanting

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.070
to produce because
marginal revenue is

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.261
higher than marginal cost.

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.260
And then after that, they
don't want to produce,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.922
because marginal cost is
higher than marginal revenue,

00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:08.630
and they're going to
take economic losses

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.350
on each of those
incremental units.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.760
And so this is the quantity
that they would produce.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.870
And the price they would
get for that-- they just

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.790
have to go to the
market demand curve--

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.200
they would get this
price right over here.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.150
Let's say they would get
that price right over there.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.200
And the actual-- their average
total cost per unit-- once

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.380
again, we have to go
to the market here.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.230
It's this dotted
line right over here.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.820
That is their average
total cost per unit.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.570
So their average
economic profit per unit

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.520
is going to be their
revenue per unit,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.190
minus their average
total cost per unit.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.930
So this height is their
economic profit per unit.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.660
And if we multiply that times
the total number of units,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.310
you would get their
total economic profit

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.960
if they coordinate perfectly,
essentially behaving

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.110
like a monopoly.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.490
And let's just say for
argument that this height

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.170
right over here-- let's
say that that is 10.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.660
And let's say that
this quantity that they

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.430
would want to produce
as a monopolist is 50.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.120
So what is the total
economic profit here?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.300
Well, their total
economic profit is 500.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:32.160
Total economic profit if
they coordinate is 500.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.270
And so they see this, and
they say, look, why don't we

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.860
agree to each produce
exactly half of this,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.420
and we would split
the economic profit.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.340
And to see that, let's
just say one firm says, OK.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.180
They both decide that
they're going to produce 25.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.810
They're going to get
this price for it

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.720
up here, which was
the market price.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.090
They're going to get
that price for it,

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.520
and their costs are right here.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.530
Now we're going on
each individual firm.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.130
And that makes sense,
because this cost is just

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.860
twice as far away as this cost.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.850
And the dotted line
yellow average total cost

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.600
for the market is just a
fatter version, twice as fat

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.310
as the orange line.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.210
And so each firm will make
this much economic profit

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.090
per unit, times 25 units.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.850
And so each firm would
make this orange area

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.080
in terms of economic profit,
or half of the entire 500,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.950
or 250 per firm.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.640
Now let's think about why
there is an incentive for one

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.020
or both of the firms to cheat.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.560
Let's say one firm
in particular--

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.920
so the other firm
holds at 25 units.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.130
But the other firm says,
hey, I like this price.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.970
I'm already making
economic profit.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.704
Let me produce 10 more units.

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.870
So the other firm says, I'm
not going to produce 25.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:57.010
I'm going to produce 35 units.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.310
And if that guy
produces 35 units,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.910
and the other firm in the
market-- the other duopolist,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.260
I guess we could say it--
continues to produce at 25,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.325
then the total market production
is now going to be 60.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.910
Now what is the total
economic profit?

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.870
So we can go up the demand
curve right over there.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.530
That's the new price.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.340
That right over there
is the new price.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.060
The cost per unit is
this right over here,

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.030
and then the number of units
that they're producing is 60.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.330
So the new economic
profit is this area,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.850
in this bluish purplish
color that I just drew.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.029
And even visually this is true--
looks like the demand curve

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:49.570
and the average total cost curve
have gotten closer together.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.306
So let's say that this
height right over here is 8.

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:58.850
And it's going to be $8 of
economic profit per unit,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.512
times 60 units.

00:09:00.512 --> 00:09:01.970
So if they cheat--
let's talk about

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.140
the cheating circumstance.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.100
This was coordinate, now let's
think about if they cheat.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.190
Now we have 60 units
for the whole market

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.430
times $8 of economic
profit per unit.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:23.310
You're going to have total
economic profit of 480.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.550
Your total economic
profit went down.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.990
And that makes sense,
because now as a market,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.770
you're producing
beyond the point

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.410
where marginal revenue is
equal to marginal cost.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.800
Now marginal cost as a market
is higher than marginal revenue.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.950
And so all of this
is essentially,

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.080
you're creating economic
loss because each

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.110
of these incremental
units as a market--

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.560
The cost is higher
than the revenue,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.620
and you have an economic loss.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.160
And so that's why your total
economic profit as a market

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.260
went down from 500 to 480.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.570
But how much is this
character going to be making?

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.710
The one that decided to cheat?

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.990
Well, he now has 35 units.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.780
He's producing 35
units, and he's

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.430
getting an economic
profit of $8 per unit.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.000
So he gets this entire
area right over here.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.896
So let's multiply 35 times 8.

00:10:16.896 --> 00:10:18.020
I'll do it right over here.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.720
35 times 8.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.260
5 times 8 is 40, 3 times
8 is 24, plus 4 is 280.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.110
So now the cheating
firm, Cheat, has

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.100
$280 of economic
profit in this period.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.970
And then the honest firm, or the
fair firm-- what they're both

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.750
doing might be illegal by even
attempting to coordinate--

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.490
the non-cheater, I guess
I could call them--

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.155
the non-cheater
will have the rest.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.710
The non-cheater is going
to have the balance

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.280
of the economic profit.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.410
And the total economic
profit was 480.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.690
The cheater's getting 280.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.060
The non-cheater is
only going to get 200.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.260
So the cheater
definitely benefited

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.850
by increasing quantity
past that optimal one.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.090
He went from 250 to 280.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.720
So it made sense for him.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.930
It reduced the total
economic profit,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:18.120
and it really hurt the
non-cheat right over there.
