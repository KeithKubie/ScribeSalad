BILL LUAN: My name
is Bill Luan.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.320
I'm working for Developer
Relations of Google.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.890
I'm the country lead for China
and the Great China region.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.660
I'm very glad that you can
join us for this very

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.480
interesting program, the
featured GDGs along with

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.760
Google I/O.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.620
And along with me is
Sting Chen, the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.370
co-manager of GDG Shanghai.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.940
And today, we will share with
you the experience that he is

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.420
having by managing GDG Shanghai
with many interesting

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.330
programs and so on.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.170
So again, I'm very glad that you
can join us, and welcome.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.780
And so, hello, Sting, and I'm
very glad that you can come to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.810
Google to join us.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.592
What brought you here?

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:49.490
STING CHEN: Thank you.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.580
I'm very glad that you come
here and represent GDG

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.320
Shanghai to Google headquarters
and share some

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.145
experience.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:00:59.930
BILL LUAN: OK.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.810
We are very glad you are here.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.430
So, we will share with our
audience today the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.350
experience you have.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.090
Shanghai GDG is a very

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.490
interesting developer community.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.970
They have written many programs,
especially in the

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.290
past year, that Sting
has involved in

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.320
organizing many programs.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.750
And let's look at the slides.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.580
Here's a quick introduction
of GDG Shanghai.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.210
And so, Sting, could you explain
to our audience a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.720
little bit of history
of GDG Shanghai?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.450
STING CHEN: GDG Shanghai is
created four years before, and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
GDG Shanghai is one of the
largest GDGs in China.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.330
It has a lot of programs.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.500
We try to share knowledge and
connect the people, and also

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.880
cooperate with other GDGs, such
as Hangzhou and Beijing.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.530
And we hold more events,
some of [?  ?]

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.690
Series event, and have
a great brand.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.110
We're also connected to other
communities, such as TopGeek,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.465
PMCamp, OpenERP, and more
than 10 communities.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:17.420
BILL LUAN: OK, great, yeah.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.170
And thank you for a
lot of hard work.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.700
I know organizing events is not
easy, and especially, a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.870
lot of times you depend on
volunteers and have to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.210
overcome a lot of
difficulties--

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.670
logistic, planning, and so on.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.510
Like, myself, with organizing a
lot of events for Google, I

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.660
know it's a lot of hard work.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.330
So thank you for all the efforts
making the developer

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.080
community very robust
in Shanghai.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.510
In terms of events, let's look
at the events you have run.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.910
You have many, many events, as
we can see on the slides, and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.680
maybe you can tell us a little
bit about all the recent

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.712
events, especially showing
on the slides.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:02:59.410
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.730
We try to understand our
audience, what knowledge they

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.960
should know, they
want to know.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.090
So we have a lot of
programs for them.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.540
One of these is Software
Engineering Salon.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.320
Every software engineer has a
lot of work to do, but if the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.970
management is not so good,
the project will delay.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.760
So how to solve this kind of
problem is a common problem.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.170
Even you use Python, Java, or
other program languages, they

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.370
also needed to learn more
Google experiences.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.540
So we invited some people from
the greater company.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.470
They share some very good
teamwork, team building, and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.296
problem solving experience.

00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:58.880
BILL LUAN: OK, sounds great.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.650
And the event just happened
this past quarter, right?

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.130
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.000
BILL LUAN: And was this program
run by Shanghai GDG

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.420
along with other local
communities?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.730
STING CHEN: Yes, right.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.120
BILL LUAN: OK.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.480
And so, that's the first one.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.250
What about the Data Analysis
Conference?

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.800
STING CHEN: We found out there
are a lot of Google Analytics

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.880
users, but a lot of people
confused, though, with the new

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.810
Google Analytics version,
because it is more complicated

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.990
than before.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.630
I used the Google Analytics
about seven years.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.790
I also think the new version
is complicated, and I spent

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.890
some time to know it.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.370
BILL LUAN: That's awful.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.880
We should do a better job in
terms of doing better training

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.850
for the users.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.700
I understand this conference is
first time you guys cover

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.450
about Google Analytics
in China?

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.870
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.850
BILL LUAN: And among all the
GDGs that I have been working

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.770
with, we have never done topics
on Analytics, so I'm

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.870
very glad, actually, that you
organized the event and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.700
covered that topic.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.710
How was the users' reaction?

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.960
Do they like the content?

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.610
STING CHEN: The interesting
thing is there are more kind

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.700
of audience--

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.930
product managers,
some operation

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.720
managers, and some engineers.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.190
They also like this kind of
topic, because they can learn

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.460
how to use the new version
Google Analytics, and they

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.860
also found that there are more
programs in their older

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.800
version or new version
Google Analytics.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.540
They learn more tips.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.420
Very good.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.740
BILL LUAN: OK, yeah.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.450
So, I hope that we can do
similar future trainings on

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.750
Google Analytics, do more
of that in the future.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.010
So again, thank you for
organizing that.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.560
And then, as the slides show,
everybody can see that they

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.610
have a Python conference that
Sting have involved organizing

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.080
along with the GDG community.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.050
And I thought that was a very
interesting one, too.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.560
And you, I understand, are the
organizer for the first ever

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.040
nationwide Python conference
in China, right?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.700
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.055
BILL LUAN: Tell us more
about that experience.

00:06:26.055 --> 00:06:31.160
STING CHEN: I'm a Python
programmer from seven years

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.960
before, but we also have a very
small community, and we

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.735
share knowledge, and we talk
about some technologies.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.050
We wish we had a national Python
community conference,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.255
but we cannot find
some support.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:01.720
Fortunately, we found Bill
Luan tell Guido our

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.400
[? expectation ?].

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.930
BILL LUAN: Yeah.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.990
I actually knew that being the
Python inventor, Guido Rossum

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.970
is also a Googler today, and
of course, he was very glad

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.250
when I asked him to provide
support to your conference.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.230
And I understood he taped a
greeting video for you, right?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.040
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.945
Guido.

00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:24.520
BILL LUAN: You played
his video at

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.240
the conference, right?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.030
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.486
BILL LUAN: Was the audience
surprised?

00:07:28.486 --> 00:07:31.800
STING CHEN: Everybody was so
excited to view Guido.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.970
BILL LUAN: As the inventor,
father of Python, as a

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.760
representative Google, give
you a talk, right?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.930
STING CHEN: Mm hm.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.420
BILL LUAN: And that Python, I
understand that was a long

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.690
event, a whole day
long, right?

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.680
Or multiple days?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.080
One day or two days event?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.810
STING CHEN: Two days event.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.970
BILL LUAN: Yeah, it's
multiple days.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.830
Two days event, right?

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.700
STING CHEN: More than 700 people
come to the conference,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.520
and more than 400 people
view online.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.750
BILL LUAN: I see.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.540
Wow.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:58.900
OK.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.470
So hopefully, you will
do that again.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.425
I'm sure I will get more
support from Guido.

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:06.050
STING CHEN: Oh, we will
hold this this year.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.350
BILL LUAN: OK, terrific.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.750
Yeah.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.620
And you also done HTML5 CodeJam,
the other programs

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.000
that you involved.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.320
Could you maybe a little
bit introducing of

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.630
these to our audience?

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:27.060
STING CHEN: This is 36 hours
event, where there are more

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.330
than 10 teams come
to one place and

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.159
programming by HTML5.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:40.610
So they submit their product
finally, and we'll have some

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.450
people to evaluate
the products and

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.660
give some bonus prize.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.270
Very good.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.910
BILL LUAN: Interesting.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.250
And how about the community
managers training?

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.690
What's that?

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:01.210
STING CHEN: We found that we
don't have very stable

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.860
volunteers come to these
communities.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.240
Some people want to join the
organizers, but they don't

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.800
know how to do this.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.780
So we try to tell people, if you
want to join the community

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.050
organizers, you can learn
something from

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.280
the successful people.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:31.980
So, we invite more than 20
community people to share

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.810
their experience.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.610
BILL LUAN: I see.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.860
This is a very good, yeah.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.270
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.280
BILL LUAN: Because even I know
that working with GDGs across

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.510
China, and along with our
program managing team, working

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.260
with global GDG communities, I
know this also always has been

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.190
a big challenge in terms of have
volunteers continuously

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.790
working with the community and
organizing enough events.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.180
So, yeah, I'm glad that you
organized a training for that.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.420
Very good.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.480
So thank you, again, for
a lot of these efforts.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.410
And also, I know you have a lot
of things in store for the

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.210
second half of this
year, right?

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.400
And would you please share with
our audience some of your

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400
thinking, ideas?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.840
So let's look at slides.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.280
The plan that Sting had with
GDG Shanghai, what are you

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.190
going to do in the
second half?

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.060
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.600
We have a very interesting event
is about learn seven new

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.140
languages in seven weeks, such
as Go, Dart, Python, Ruby,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.990
NodeJs, and other languages.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.830
BILL LUAN: Oh, nice.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.163
I even noticed you have
Dart on there.

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:44.300
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.790
BILL LUAN: We just launched our
new developers.google.com,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.570
our new dev site, this past week
or two, right before I/O.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.720
And I know that Dart content
and Dart training is one of

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.420
the highest viewed material,
and lots of interest in the

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.400
industry to learning these new
languages from Google.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.730
And I'm very glad that you
actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.040
have Dart training on it.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.160
That's nice.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.820
STING CHEN: I think
every [? team ?]

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.370
should learn more
new languages.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.830
BILL LUAN: Yeah, very nice.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.070
But what about college tour?

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.322
STING CHEN: College tour is
a very interesting tour.

00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:27.310
We tried to share the knowledge
in colleges, so we

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.120
pick Android technologies.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.490
In Shanghai, there are more
greater universities, and we

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:39.510
pick five, one-by-one, to
hold the college tour.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.930
In another three months or so,
we hold three college events

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.365
in three very great
universities.

00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:49.200
BILL LUAN: OK.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.620
How did you find the connections
in those

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.210
universities?

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.950
Did you work with the students
who are interested in Google

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.400
technologies, or do you work
with the professors there?

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.320
STING CHEN: We try to connect
to professors.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.090
But we found students is
better, so we connected

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.520
directly to students.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.520
There are some clubs
in colleges.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.010
BILL LUAN: Oh, yeah, OK.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.990
Clubs interested in these
technologies, Google

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.220
technologies, open
web technologies.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.080
STING CHEN: Yeah, and the
students are very

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.760
[? excited. ?]

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.280
We can help them to create
a very great event.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.140
So they do everything, such as
the poster, the logo design,

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.940
and to find a place.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.500
BILL LUAN: Nice.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.950
STING CHEN: Yeah, very good.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.800
BILL LUAN: Now you got a lot
of volunteers, right?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.640
Work with you.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.430
Terrific.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.650
And so, I see on your slides,
you have a PyCon again

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.290
planned, right?

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:43.850
STING CHEN: Yes.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.130
BILL LUAN: And this year, you're
going to do more than

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.010
in one city?

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.570
You're going to have
two cities now.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:48.930
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:57.110
Well, we think one plan is
have this in two cities,

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:02.970
because this has been
a two days weekend.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:08.040
If people work five days and
come to conference two days,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.500
then [? working ?]

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.110
five days they were
very tired.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:17.320
So we try to use one day in one
city, but continually to

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:24.030
view the conference online and
expand this event to Beijing.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.620
Beijing has a lot of
Python programmers.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.660
BILL LUAN: And they couldn't go
to Shanghai last year, so

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.250
by doing this this year,
hopefully you will reach out

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.475
to more people, more
developers.

00:13:34.475 --> 00:13:35.920
Very nice.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.140
And of course, then, DevFestX.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.930
Globally, Developer Relations
work with a lot of developer

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:43.820
communities.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.100
We are organizing events,
anything that is more than

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.530
half a day long, have at lease
three topics, we're branding

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.970
them as DevFestX.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.455
And so, hopefully you will
organize one for Shanghai GDG.

00:13:57.455 --> 00:13:58.640
STING CHEN: OK, no problem.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.940
BILL LUAN: And we will support
you as much as we can, and

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.100
hopefully it will
be successful.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.390
So great, yeah.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.760
One thing I would like to ask
you about the events you run,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.320
in terms of you using events,
you share the knowledge with

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.090
developers.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.010
Maybe you can tell us one or
two stories about in these

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.200
past events, what really
worked well in

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.340
terms of shared knowledge.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.810
And maybe you can give us
a couple of examples?

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.840
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.130
We try to think of what
knowledge people need.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.850
So, we use [? knowledge ?]

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.840
to attract the people come to
a conference or events, such

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.320
as we think that they are a lot
of people converting from

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:50.120
engineers to product managers,
so they also think about our

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.310
knowledge, but they cannot find
a very good channel to

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.730
learn more skills and tips.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.000
So we find Google Analytics is
a very good knowledge to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.220
attract the people to come here,
and then these connect

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.500
them to share knowledge.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:15.420
So we have the very good
Google Analytics event.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.265
This event has more than 150
people come to the conference.

00:15:21.265 --> 00:15:24.570
BILL LUAN: And the speakers,
they are from where?

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.150
STING CHEN: The speakers
come to [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.260
for mobile company.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.220
He is a translator for
a famous book.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.300
Another is a famous website,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.560
He's very good.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.600
BILL LUAN: And they have
used Analytics before?

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:43.910
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.370
They have more experience.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.400
BILL LUAN: Yeah.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.740
I like it that you leverage
the technology experts in

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.240
different companies,
come to our GDG

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.370
community, share the knowledge.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.550
A lot of people see the examples
of how other people

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.990
did, what other companies
use Google technologies.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.410
It should be very good
inspiration for them to pick

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.200
up new technology, or try.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.490
So, I think that's very good.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.440
In a lot of aspects, it's
actually better.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.470
You have these people's personal
testimonies, use

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.400
their own examples, then a
Google speaker to tell the

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.220
story, right?

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.320
So I really like it that you
have the speakers from other

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.750
companies to share
the knowledge.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:33.160
One other thing that I'm very
interested in is that you do a

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.060
lot of things connected
with universities.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.070
So, as the slides, we have seen
here that you have run

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.170
many programs at universities
in the past.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.350
Could you introduce a little
bit of what did you do in

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.590
terms of working with
these universities?

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.360
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.730
And the first thing is very
hard, but we have a very good

00:16:53.730 --> 00:17:01.810
channel, because Tonji
University has more students

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.510
join the compete last year.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.819
They get bigger prizes.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:13.930
So we connect these people,
tell them we need to come

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:19.650
together and have the very
good event in Tonji

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.780
University.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.670
They say very good,
so [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.684
BILL LUAN: This was happening
this year, right?

00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:26.460
This past [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:26.740
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.420
BILL LUAN: OK, in April.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.380
And how about Jaio
Tong University?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.040
I know that's a very
good school.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.120
Lot of computer science
students, right?

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.250
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.625
BILL LUAN: What did
you do there?

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:37.660
STING CHEN: I also come from
Shanghai Jaio Tong University.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.320
BILL LUAN: Oh, you graduate
from there?

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.030
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.640
There are more people who want
to learn new technologies, so

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:50.560
we have a half-day event for
Shanghai Jaio Tong University,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.560
and we have four speakers
in this event.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:56.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.630
[? Center ?]

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.150
have more support
for this event.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:07.180
We tell them why people need to
learn mobile development,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.670
why need to choose Android,
and how to do develop and

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:16.230
Android, some technologies so
the people are very glad.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.630
And we have a long session
asking question and answer.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.840
People is very good.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.380
BILL LUAN: And where were
the speakers from?

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.960
Where did you get speakers
for those events?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.240
STING CHEN: It's very
interesting.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.250
from the training company.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.315
They can describe why you
should learn Android.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.770
They describe their
dream to students.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.180
BILL LUAN: So they're
very professional.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.440
STING CHEN: Yes.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.490
BILL LUAN: They know
what to do, yeah.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.510
Are they based in Shanghai,
this company?

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.800
STING CHEN: Yeah, it's
based in Shanghai.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.620
Another is our GDG Shanghai
organizer.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.030
BILL LUAN: OK, good.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.680
Right, very nice.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.580
STING CHEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.930
BILL LUAN: The other things I
would like to ask you about is

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.780
your collaboration with
other GDGs in China.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.180
I understand for the very
first time, when we were

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.630
actually beta testing and
launching the Google Hangout,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.630
that you guys in Shanghai
and the GDG

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.850
Hangzhou collaborate together.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.540
[INAUDIBLE] joined Hangout
session, right?

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.910
Tell us about that experience.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:29.760
STING CHEN: Shanghai GDG has a
lot of connections with more

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.160
communities and experts,
but Hangzhou

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.730
don't have more speakers.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:41.400
So sometimes, we try to connect
the two places.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.720
We share the knowledge
by Google Hangout.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.090
The speakers, such as
[INAUDIBLE], he's a very good

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.970
Go lang expert.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.810
He has a big Go lang
presentation, and we use

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.640
Google Hangout to share
this knowledge.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.990
Video and audio, too.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.460
BILL LUAN: You mean
the Go language?

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.160
STING CHEN: Yeah, Go language.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.310
So Hangzhou also can learn
this by video.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.680
BILL LUAN: I see.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.880
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.610
use Hangout, and your guys'
events happen in Shanghai.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.890
The speaker was in Shanghai,
but the GDG Hangzhou, they

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.720
dial in, they watch online?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.810
STING CHEN: Yes, right.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.730
BILL LUAN: And can they ask
questions and your speakers in

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.570
Shanghai be able to answer?

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.650
STING CHEN: They can
ask questions.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.190
BILL LUAN: Live,
through video?

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.680
STING CHEN: Yeah, live.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.780
BILL LUAN: How's the speed?

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.260
How is the quality,
the video quality?

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.400
I always worry about the
cross-city, link together, you

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400
may have a problem.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.190
Did that work at all?

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.410
STING CHEN: Unfortunately, we
found the quality is not so

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:50.010
good, because our computer is
far away from the speaker.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.350
So we use a mobile phone
nearby the speaker.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.690
Solved the problems.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.100
And later, we find we shouldn't
use audio [? line ?]

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.660
to connect to computer.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.430
BILL LUAN: That's a good
lesson, right.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.170
It's very important to have good
audio equipment connects

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:10.440
to the PC so that the audio
is clear, people can hear.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.580
STING CHEN: Yeah, noise
is very clear.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.800
BILL LUAN:, So you guys
are going to try

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.180
again in the future?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.215
This is very interesting.

00:21:16.215 --> 00:21:17.370
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:22.010
In fact, we're trying Shanghai
Jiao Tong University in the

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.910
college tour for Android
development.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.970
BILL LUAN: Using Hangout.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:25.940
STING CHEN: Yeah, Hangout.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.190
And I invite [? HEIFI ?]

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.710
GDG to join.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.510
They just learned how to do
this, and it's very good.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.360
I think this audio
is very good.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.018
And we published the
video to tudou.com.

00:21:42.018 --> 00:21:44.010
We use [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.700
BILL LUAN: For audience that
don't know what tudou.com that

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.730
Sting referred to, it's almost
like a YouTube of China, where

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.910
people can upload the video
clips, so they do that

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.460
locally, hopefully getting
a better speed, right?

00:21:59.460 --> 00:21:59.780
STING CHEN: Yes.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.680
BILL LUAN: In terms of
watching the video.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.950
Yeah, so I'm glad that you
actually tried that.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.960
Hopefully in the future, we'll
do more cross-GDG events, so

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.760
that GDG communities in
different cities, we can get

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.290
them work together, learning
from each other.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.403
This would be very good.

00:22:19.403 --> 00:22:24.040
One other thing I would like you
to talk about is the GDG

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.970
community in Shanghai connects
with lots of other

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.670
communities, right?

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.860
As on the slides, everybody can
see GDG Shanghai has been

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.950
working with many local
developer communities.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.040
And a lot of those names are
probably not well known

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.300
outside of Shanghai or
outside of China.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.140
So it's interesting, maybe
you can explain to

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.980
us, what are these?

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.620
STING CHEN: In Shanghai,
there are more

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.440
communities, such as TopGeek.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.365
I worked for TopGeek community
about two years.

00:22:54.365 --> 00:22:55.270
BILL LUAN: Is it big?

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.970
How many developers there?

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.800
STING CHEN: More than 2,000.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.310
BILL LUAN: More than 2,000!

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.160
Wow!

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.070
OK.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.135
Big community.

00:23:03.135 --> 00:23:03.980
STING CHEN: Because [? it ?]

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.560
[? has ?]

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.480
[? more ?] big conference.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.800
Different areas, so it
has a lot of members.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.600
BILL LUAN: And PMCamp,
that's the one

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.010
you just did Analytic--

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.600
no, that's the one you
did the programming

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.270
model training, right?

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:18.535
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:21.090
This is a product manager
community.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.325
It's also more than 2,000 people
in this community.

00:23:25.325 --> 00:23:27.040
BILL LUAN: And what
about the others?

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.395
Any other notable ones?

00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:34.350
STING CHEN: Such as CPyUG
is a Python community.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.310
ECUG before is Ur lang but
now is for Go lang.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.120
BILL LUAN: OK.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.230
So it's Go language.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.060
STING CHEN: Yeah, Go language
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.000
And HTML5 Dream Factory is
another HTML5 community.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.370
BILL LUAN: I see.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.980
And what's the AgileTour?

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.520
Is that a Agile model thing?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.420
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.580
Agile is a programming model.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.220
BILL LUAN: A programming
management model.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.880
STING CHEN: Management model.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.810
BILL LUAN: OK.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.880
Would you be able to invite
maybe, say, some of the

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.510
speakers in those communities
come to Shanghai

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.140
GDG to give a talk?

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.070
STING CHEN: In fact, more good
speakers want to share their

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.020
knowledge to more areas
and more communities.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.330
You find them and tell them who
are you, and why you can

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.580
help them to do this.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.200
[? We're allowed ?]

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:28.670
to do this.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:28.980
BILL LUAN: I see.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.750
So they may be willing
to come?

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.480
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.620
BILL LUAN: And so if you
organize a Shanghai GDG event,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.680
maybe invite some of these from
PMCamp, TopGeek, as the

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.195
speaker, but speak to
the GDG community.

00:24:42.195 --> 00:24:42.980
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.670
BILL LUAN: And because we have
a huge, like, 700, 800 people

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.270
now that you can have those
speakers talk to

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.160
our members, right?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.730
STING CHEN: Right.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.920
BILL LUAN: And hopefully, you
can maybe do some of those.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.870
And we talked about DevFestX.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.270
Maybe in the future, you can
do events, combine some of

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.305
these communities together.

00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:05.270
Do a joint event,
make it bigger.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.000
STING CHEN: Yeah.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.590
Well, we try to invite more good
speakers from different

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.930
communities or different
companies.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.620
BILL LUAN: And make
things fun, more

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.810
interesting, exciting.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.370
STING CHEN: Right, exactly.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.500
BILL LUAN: OK, that's all.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.440
What we're trying to do, make
learning technologies,

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.970
including Google technologies,
fun and exciting.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:27.710
And hopefully, this little
sharing of Shanghai GDG's

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.740
experience will be helpful
to all of you.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.180
And thank you for your
time to come join us.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.140
And Sting, thank you for sharing
your experience.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.490
And welcome to Google, and enjoy
your stay at Google.
