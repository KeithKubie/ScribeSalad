00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 Brexit! Means that Britain is leaving the EU 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.200
 Maybe it will happen? Maybe not? 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.260
 Or the United Kingdom simply splits 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.620
 Now this is a mess, so let’s talk about it briefly. 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.500
 First of all: How did it happen? 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 In the UK, the number of independent party supporters has grown in recent elections. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.240
 Because the UK used a "simple majority" voting system that was awful. 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 Instead of allocating parliamentary seats in proportion to the number of votes from different parties. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.800
 The supporters of the Conservative Party are slowly being sucked up by the Independent Party. 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.940
 So the Conservative Party promised to hold the referendum in the 15-year election. 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.100
 In order to win the people to vote for themselves 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.780
 Finally the Conservative Party won. But this election became 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.600
 The election in the history of Britain that is the least representative of public opinion. (Click on the map to see the details) 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.300
 And the referendum on the Brexit is still around 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.920
 Eventually passed 52 to 48 in the case of a high voter turnout rate 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 So what's next? 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.040
 Article 50 of the EU Treaty does allow the country to withdraw 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.940
 Basically an "exit button" 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.300
 But the Conservative Prime Minister, who promised to press the button at the beginning 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.560
 But he resigned and ran for the first time. Leading the UK to wait 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.800
 Although I have discussed it again here. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.020
 "This time, it’s really legal to play." 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.620
 Or re-election 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840
 But the new British Prime Minister does not want to do this. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.710
 In theory, this time, Congress needs to pass a 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.680
 "Yes, we really have to quit" law 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380
 But they don’t seem to be in a hurry 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 At the same time, the EU hopes that Britain will leave quickly. But the British plan 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 First determine the relationship with the EU countries in the future 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.820
 But as long as the UK does not withdraw, the EU simply does not want to take care of her. 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.320
 After all, the first negotiation will be beneficial to the UK, and the post-negotiation will benefit the EU. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.220
 Plus the EU can't force Britain to quit 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 This caused a deadlock 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 Finally, because all parties can't figure it out 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.620
 The next step will happen, only the day knows 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.150
 The situation is foggy, so 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.530
 The following are all guesses! 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.080
 As a Brexit gambler, I bet a 15% chance that the UK will go abroad as a whole. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.140
 That is, the United Kingdom as an independent country has the right to decide on its own trade, immigration, and law. 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.200
 The United Kingdom has since become a country that is not in the EU. Just like the relationship between Brazil and the EU 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 If this chance seems too low. Because the new head is relatively reluctant 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.280
 And most of the public opinion also tends to leave the European Union. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 So here are some of my points: first 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.380
 The Conservatives don’t want Britain to really leave the EU 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.560
 Although they have voted for the referendum, they are neutral. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.020
 May even object privately 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.900
 Because the Conservative Party prefers to protect the interests of business groups. 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.540
 And Brexit will cause huge economic turmoil 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.260
 Especially large economies like banks 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.400
 On the eve of the 15-year election, the Conservative Party may feel 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.260
 The people will not be really stupid to agree to Brexit, so they gamble to attack the Independent Party. 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.380
 But in the end, I played off, 52 to 48. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.570
 Even the new prime minister who is firmly supportive of Brexit. 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.750
 Also opposed to Brexit before taking office. Second point: 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.740
 Many Brexit propagators are not sincere. I don’t face reality until the results come out. 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.260
 They are unprepared after leaving the country, as if "we never intended to win" 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.220
 The party leader of the Independence Party resigned immediately, and it seemed very awkward at this moment of cheering victory. 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.980
 Then the Conservative Prime Minister resigned, but those who are the most joyous, but no one is willing to come out 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.800
 Ha ha 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.380
 Another interesting point is that the referendum itself does not have any legal benefits. 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.680
 Just a consensus reached by all parties 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.700
 The vote itself is just a poll, but it is promoted as a referendum. 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.360
 All of this implies that most people don’t really want to leave the European Union. 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.180
 Of course, if the government really ignores this vote, although technically feasible 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.560
 But it will give people a feeling of super undemocrat 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.560
 However, just as Brexit was promoted to enhance national strength and independence, 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.580
 The international market and the domestic economy are singing 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.540
 The distribution of voting areas also indicates that the UK may not be able to leave the EU as a whole. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.640
 After the vote was over, Scotland first indicated that it did not support disapproval. 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.520
 The Scots want and will stay 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.580
 If the UK retreats as a whole, I bet 97% chance that Scotland will leave the UK and stay in the EU 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.260
 On top of this, if Scotland is independent, I bet 45% chance that Northern Ireland will also take off from England and unify the island of Ireland. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.500
 Be crazy again if Scotland and Northern Ireland are independent 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.460
 I will even bet 5% chance of London City leaving England 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.680
 Then join the European Union as an independent city-state. Think about a simple explosion 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.900
 After all, the city state is so cute. 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.400
 This leaves only England and Wales to be lily 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.160
 Of course, neither of them can't go on because there are many similar regimes in the moment. 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.000
 But the international market has clearly stated that "do not want to" the UK as a whole to leave the EU 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.140
 So the future seems very dangerous 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.880
 And the Brexit supporters obviously do not want to end this ending when they vote. 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.660
 But even if you ignore the possibility of the alliance collapse 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.100
 On the one hand, it is the majority of people who voted to leave Europe. 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.660
 On the one hand, entrepreneurs and politicians 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.320
 Neither of these two aspects really wants to leave the European Union. 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.769
 This political consideration is also the reason why I give a low probability to Brexit. 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.009
 So, this is why I think the possibility of 30%, nothing will happen 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.840
 The British government has been consuming this and pretending to continue to move forward, but in fact nothing is done. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.640
 This intricate time will become a new video theme. 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.260
 “About how the UK spends a hundred years leaving the EU” 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.780
 It’s as if two countries suddenly found each other in a state of war. 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.920
 Because there was a xx agreement that forgot to revoke 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.280
 This kind of ending will not be ideal, because the government, enterprises and people do not like to hang in the air. 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.660
 But never underestimate the limits of human procrastination 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.700
 Even Miss Suoh (the Prime Minister) does not want to be in a hurry. 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.180
 Just got things done. 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.949
 But I think the last possibility is the biggest. 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.409
 55% chance that the UK will not leave the country at all 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.480
 The EU has many intricate classifications for member countries. 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.360
 Britain can leave the EU 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.520
 But stay in the European Economic Area. This is also considered to have left the EU. 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.280
 In fact, the UK had negotiated with the EU before the current bad debt occurred. 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.040
 Deepen cooperation in the European Economic Area. But this negotiation was put on hold because of the referendum. 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.540
 But this agreement may still be in a corner now. 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.740
 But this compromise is actually not good on both sides. 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.020
 The initial appeal of the Brexit supporters will not be reached. 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.640
 From immigration, EU membership fees, to EU law, all remain unchanged 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.720
 The only difference is that the UK must give up all seats in the European Parliament. 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.800
 So the UK has no say in the EU and still has to follow EU law. 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.540
 Even EU supporters will not like this ending. 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.880
 But no matter what, I think the possibility is the most likely 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.620
 Because of this, the economic market will remain stable and satisfy entrepreneurs. 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.220
 And politicians can also minimize losses and maintain national unity. 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.680
 Establish an image of "obeying public opinion" 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.640
 Certainly no one wants to be prime minister when the country collapses? 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.380
 All in all: all the above endings are not perfect 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.740
 The overall Brexit is basically the end of the UK 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.140
 And it also violates the principle of economic self-interest. Who knows? 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.890
 But if you don’t do it, you will violate the principle of democracy. 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.599
 The UK is currently at a multi-directional intersection that determines the future 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.079
 Maybe the EU will suddenly collapse because of various problems. 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.400
 And the England-Wales Union is reborn in the ashes 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.520
 Maybe Britain is the biggest loser. Or nothing will change 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.600
 Where is the road, and what is the future? No way to know 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.740
 Britain can only stand in the fog, blindly choose a road 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.760
 Good luck, Britain, no matter what you choose 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.600
