00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.410
So for all that DNA to fit in a cell, the two main ways to it's organized

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.250
are first by compaction, meaning organization by proteins

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.340
called histones. Let's zoom out a bit on our

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.790
DNA strand and imagine our double stranded DNA

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.180
is just this one purple line. The first order

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.580
of organization is that DNA is going to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.380
wrap around these histone proteins. Much like you might

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.160
wrap string in a spool and you can see that it just wraps around and around

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.500
and around. And this allows for some basic

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.220
organization, in the same way that loose string in

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.720
a drawer or your pocket has a tendency to get tangled. If you wrap it around an

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.340
object to keep it steady Then it can't

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.390
get tangled as easily, and that's the same principle

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.610
that's going on here for organization. The

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.430
second way DNA is organized to fit inside

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.480
a cell is that it's split into

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.680
units called chromosomes, which are large collections of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.600
this histone-wrapped DNA. You've probably seen pictures

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.710
of chromosomes before. They're usually these long, large,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.740
linear pieces of DNA in histones called

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.460
chromatin. If you're not sure if you've seen

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.180
a chromsone, then you've probably seen something that looks

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.920
like this, like an X. This is also considered

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.970
a chromosone. And both of these sturcutres are just

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.300
this compacted DNA wrapped around histones. Such that we could

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.560
zoom in on the chromosome here. Just a very

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.770
small region, and this is what we would see. And

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.610
teh same that if we zoomed in here, on

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.520
the DNA strand, this is what we would see here,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.540
teh edoubl helix.
