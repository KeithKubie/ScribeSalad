00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.330
If there's one thing we can all agree on
it's that everybody hates hipsters, right? 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.310
You know, it's the common enemy that
we all have that will unite us, 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.290
that will remove all race and gender
boundaries and we will say we, 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.450
our humanity like Independence Day,
and we will fight against the hipsters. 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.550
Even the hipsters themselves
who, apparently, 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.500
don't even know that they are
hipsters will also hate hipsters. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
Everybody is against the same
thing and its kind of, 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.350
it's kind of beautiful
in a way. 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.970
So you can imagine the horror
that you would experience 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.990
if you started noticing some these hipster-like
tendencies appearing in your life. 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.580
That, my friends, if I can still
call you friends after this, 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.210
is what I am suffering
from right now.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.820
I think the biggest and most telling example
for me was when I bought those glasses. 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.720
I mean, just look at that.
To be wearing the glasses. 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.600
The actual Ray Band Wayfarers that you put
on something to turn it into a hipster. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.480
This is-- That's how you turn Ariel into
Hipster Ariel by putting these on. 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.310
And yet, I am not going to do
anything about it. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.180
Like, these were expensive glasses
and I think I look good in them. 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.480
This is when this worry started
for me was when I was 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.540
sitting in like a trendy
warehouse-type coffee bar, 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.300
looking around me thinking,
"Heh, there's a hipster there. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.120
Oh, there another one.
Look at his funny mustache. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.260
Uh...everyone is a hipster here.
Why am I here?" 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.180
So my interpretation of the hipster-like
personality constitutes a couple things.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.980
First off: you like things ironically. 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.000
That, I think I can comfortably say
is something that I don't do. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.670
I have my things that I like a lot and I like
maybe even to some people too much,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.110
but I don't care 'cause
I like them. 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.600
That to me is a nerd, but then
there's the whole, you know, 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510
"You know that thing that
everybody likes now, 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.430
I don't like it but when
nobody liked it, 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.830
that's when I was a big fan.
Oh, aren't I cool." 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.310
That's the thing I think that we
all center on as being like, 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.550
"Eww. Hipsters.
What rubbish people." 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.910
But I have to be honest
with myself and think, 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.150
"Have I ever been that person? 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300
Have I ever been in the
situation where I'm like, 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.180
'Ooh! I liked that thing before everybody else did.
Doesn't that make me cool?'" 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.170
And honestly, I have. I feel like as much as
I can try to point out and justify 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.430
the things about me that aren't
hipster-esque and be like, 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.630
"No, hipsters are like this,
and I don't do that sort of thing," 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.410
there is a nugget in my heart that
is enjoying things ironically. 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.730
There is definitely a sense of comfort
that I get when I am in a warehouse 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.740
that's been converted to a coffee shop,
surrounded by lots of trendy looking people. 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.130
I feel at home in that--
they're cozy! 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.770
They do a good job decorating. 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.870
I think if there is a moral
to be found here, 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.630
I don't want to find it because the moral is that
I think there's probably--there's either - 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.750
this will be more comfortable - there's either
a little bit more hipster in all of us 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.340
or there is a little bit of hipster
in me, specifically, 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.790
and I am a hipster but I don't want
to have to deal with that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.600
and the consequences
of being that person. 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.500
I could, at least, be the first
person who will actually admit 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.810
that they are a bit of a hipster as
opposed to all of the other hipsters 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.590
that don't want to admit it.
There we go. 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.720
That's how I can feel superior. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.530
Alright. Charlie out. 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.900
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.790
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.320
Okie dokie, last week's video
in case you missed it, 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.380
which is likely because of the way that
YouTube works these days. Hahahaha.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.890
And, also, the trailer for my new
short film because, you know,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.910
I will continue to promote this
until everyone on the planet

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.690
has seen it because that's what
you do when you make a film. 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.097
Thank you very much for sticking around.
Have a nice day.
