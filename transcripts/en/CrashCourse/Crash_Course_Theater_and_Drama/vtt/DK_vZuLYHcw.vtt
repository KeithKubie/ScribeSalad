00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.759
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, and this is
Crash Course Theater.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.200
Yorick, you are looking especially dead today.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
How fitting!

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.910
Because today it’s the Theater of Cruelty,
a style developed by the French genius Antonin

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.960
Artaud—a guy who believed that theater in
the West had become way too hung up on realism.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.350
He wanted theater to get out of the living
room and to return to its origins—magic,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.850
myth, and ritual.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.130
Today we’ll be looking at Artaud’s life,
and his influential book of essays and one

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.920
of his plays—the show about scorpions crawling
out of a wet nurse’s vagina that you never

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.700
knew you needed.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.350
Lights up!

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:48.870
INTRO
Antonin Artaud was born in 1896 in Marseilles.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.080
When he was four, he came down with meningitis.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.059
He survived, but his health was seriously
weakened.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.049
Artaud was a depressed teenager.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.370
He had his first breakdown at sixteen, and
his parents arranged several sanitarium stays

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.370
for him.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.730
In 1916, he was briefly conscripted into the
French army but soon discharged for sleepwalking.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.330
He went back to the sanitarium where his doctor
prescribed opium.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.220
Which is (A) not helpful for depression.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
And (B) a really bad idea BECAUSE IT’S OPIUM.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.970
He developed a lifelong addiction.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.860
In his twenties, Artaud moved to Paris and
hooked up with the Surrealists, acting in

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.450
a couple of films and writing the scenario
for at least one other.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.490
But the Surrealists rejected him.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.780
Not cool, Surrealists!

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.220
Artaud is Surreal as heck.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
Apparently they were miffed because Artaud
wouldn’t renounce theater as a bourgeois

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.580
commercial art form.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.580
You tell ‘em Artaud!

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.630
But if you consider Artaud’s theories and
subsequent theatrical career, this failure-to-renounce

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.190
the commercialism of theater is legit hilarious.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.390
Because there’s uncommercial…

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.540
And then there’s Artaud.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.440
From 1926 to 1928, he co-ran the Theater Alfred
Jarry, producing work by August Strindberg.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.610
In these years, he started to develop the
theories he would explain in

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.010
“The Theater and Its Double”—more about
that in a minute.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.860
And he tried some of them out in his staging
of Percy Shelley’s incest-heavy verse drama,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.860
“The Cenci,” which did about as well with
critics and audiences as you would expect

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.940
an incest-heavy verse drama staged to actively
unhinge the spectator to do.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.540
Then Artaud went to Mexico, took peyote, wrote
some memoirs, and detoxed from heroin (though

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.230
he would later retox ). He returned to France,
went to Ireland, and was brought back to France

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.000
... in a straitjacket, literally, because
he’d suffered a major psychotic break and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.410
tried to attack some people.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.810
He was diagnosed with “incurable paranoid
delirium” and underwent electroshock treatment.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.880
Eventually, he was released, and his friends
paid for him to stay in a private psychiatric

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880
clinic.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.340
He continued writing, including poems and
a script for a radio broadcast that French

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.730
radio never aired, because it was strange
and rude.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.190
Diagnosed with cancer, Artaud died in 1948.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.590
Okay, so he may have had a dramatic life,
but why are we devoting a whole episode to

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.180
a guy who did a little acting, a little directing,
took peyote, and wrote a play or two before

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.980
confronting extreme mental, and eventually
physical illness?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.950
Because his theories are still a huge influence.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.150
Looking at the portrait we’ve painted over
the last number of episodes, you’ll maybe

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.970
have noticed that modern theater had a nonstop
identity crisis about how to capture real

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.060
life.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.870
Sometimes theater is like, we’re going to
make it as real as possible.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.550
Those toilets onstage are going to flush!

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.280
And sometimes theater is like, heck no!

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.550
The only way to capture real life is with
myth and magic, poetry and violence.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.880
Everything on stage is a metaphor for toilets!

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.690
On the anti-realist side, Artaud is pretty
much king.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.239
In 1938, Artaud published “The Theater and
Its Double.”

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.250
The book and its theories had a lot of important
influences: Surrealism, Symbolism, the works

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.129
that he helped produce at the Theater Alfred
Jarry, as well as the works of Jarry himself—all

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.590
super significant.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.400
But maybe the strongest influence was a performance
by a troupe of Balinese dancers that Artaud

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.310
had seen at the Paris International Colonial
Exposition in 1931.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.670
The dance consisted, he wrote, “of everything
that occupies the stage, everything that can

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.359
be manifested and expressed materially on
a stage and that is addressed first of all

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.479
to the senses instead of being addressed primarily
to the mind as the language of words.”

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.499
Now, to be accurate…

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:28.020
Balinese dance does have words.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.020
And stories.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.120
And specific meanings.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.330
Artaud was doing the thing a lot of Western
artists did where they saw what they wanted

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.050
to see in the art of Eastern cultures.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.379
In Artaud’s case, he wanted a performance
style that transcended psychological realism,

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.089
which he called “psychological and human
stagnation.”

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.729
Inspired by the dance, he imagined a style
that would “restore the theater to its original

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:57.150
destiny,” a mix of dance, song, and pantomime,
“fused together in a perspective of hallucination

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.310
and fear.”

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.779
Real talk?

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:00.779
Count me in.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.629
Artaud called this new form, the Theater of
Cruelty, a place

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:09.389
“in which violent physical images crush
and hypnotize the sensibility of the spectator

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.509
seized by the theatre as by a whirlwind of
higher forces.”

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.139
Now, Artaud wasn’t talking about actual
physical violence—well, he wasn’t only

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.189
talking about actual physical violence—but
rather a violent impulse that would rupture

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:29.650
ordinary perception and the boring normcore
way that most people conduct their day-to-day

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.650
lives.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.259
Society, he thought, had become sick, complacent,
lulled by bourgeois illusion.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.740
People needed ceremony and ritual—“a magic
exorcism”—to heal.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.729
Artaud believed that the theater had learned
all the wrong lessons from Aristotle, with

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.759
his emphasis on plot and language, and his
meh attitude toward spectacle.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.469
The Theater of Cruelty was going to be all
spectacle, all the time!

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:00.289
It would use music, dance, and certifiably
bananas lighting design that would wake up

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.539
the audience to how bizarre and violent real
life actually is.

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.899
He wanted a theater that would “leave an
ineffaceable scar.”

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.719
In his words:
“The Theatre of Cruelty has been created

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:19.669
in order to restore to the theater a passionate
and convulsive conception of life, and it

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:26.110
is in this sense of violent rigor and extreme
condensation of scenic elements that the cruelty

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.979
on which it is based must be understood.

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:35.479
This cruelty, which will be bloody when necessary
but not systematically so, can thus be identified

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:42.159
with a kind of severe moral purity which is
not afraid to pay life the price it must be

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.159
paid.”

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.159
Catharsis!

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.690
Let’s book a babysitter and go!

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.779
Artaud called for a style of performance that
would emphasize the mise-en-scene—sound,

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.660
lights, costumes, basically everything that
isn’t text.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.250
And yet, he didn’t really believe in sets
or props.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.610
He wanted actors who would operate not from
a place of psychological realism, but from

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.759
a place of emotion, sensation, and pure physicality.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.669
He called these actors “Athletes of the
Heart.”

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.090
He envisioned a theater in which the audience
would sit in the center, helpless, and the

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.629
play would surround them in an act of “organized
anarchy.”

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:18.430
Take that, proscenium arches!

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.270
Oh, and what’s the Double after “Theatre
and its...”?

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.199
That’s tricky and not completely articulated
in the essays, but the basic idea seems to

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:32.490
be that it’s life, or what life could be
if we allow theater to work on our senses

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.379
and awaken us to something better, truer,
stronger, and way more intense than life as

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:39.379
we know it.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:46.180
To Artaud, good theater should actually be
more “real” than boring everyday life.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.840
Let’s put these theories into blood-spattered
practice by looking at Artaud’s early play

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.919
“The Jet of Blood” or
“The Spurt of Blood.”

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:56.189
I guess it all depends on how you like your
high-velocity blood flow.

00:07:56.189 --> 00:08:00.559
The play was written in 1925—maybe in a
single day.

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:03.569
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:
A young man and a young girl, who may be brother

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.509
and sister, are being all lovey-dovey.

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:11.699
Then a hurricane arrives, and here’s a fun
stage direction: “Two stars are seen colliding,

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:17.529
and from them fall a series of legs of living
flesh with feet, hands, scalps, masks, colonnades,

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:23.490
porticos, temples, alembics, falling more
and more slowly, as if falling in a vacuum:

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.639
then three scorpions one after another and
finally a frog and a beetle which come to

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:34.430
rest with desperate slowness, nauseating slowness.”

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.690
Then a knight comes in, pursued by a wet nurse
who is holding her swollen breasts.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.330
The knight eats some cheese and chokes.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:48.700
Night falls, the earth quakes, lightning flashes,
and an enormous hand comes out and grabs a

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.750
prostitute by her hair and shouts, “...look
at your body.”

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.020
The prostitute shouts, “Leave me alone,
God!”

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.050
And she bites him.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.390
Cue enormous jet of blood.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.450
That title was not a metaphor!

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.940
More lightning—because God does not like
to be nibbled upon!—and then everyone is

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.430
dead except for the prostitute and the young
man.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.020
They fall into each other’s arms .
The wet nurse, who doesn’t have breasts

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.330
anymore, re-enters, dragging the corpse of
the young girl.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.170
Scorpions crawl out from underneath the wet
nurse’s dress and here’s another fun stage

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.790
direction: “Her vagina swells up, splits
and becomes transparent and glistening like

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.790
a sun.”

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.540
The young man and the prostitute run away,
at which point the young girl sits up and

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.020
says, “The virgin!

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.520
Ah that’s what he was looking for.”

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.520
And scene.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.940
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.040
A lot … going on there.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.810
And it all happened in about three pages of
text!

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.560
The whole history of the universe, from the
Garden of Eden to the apocalypse, in three

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560
gonzo pages.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.100
I’m gonna go ahead and say, yup, that’s
the Theater of Cruelty.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.330
I don’t know about you...

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.860
I definitely feel fused together in a perspective
of hallucination and fear.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.520
“The Jet of Blood” was scheduled for the
Theater Alfred Jarry season of 1926–1927.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.520
But it was never produced in Artaud’s lifetime.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.950
Artaud spent a lot of his life in various
institutions, and various states of mental

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.950
discombobulation.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.420
His writing and art, especially in his later
years, is cryptic, strange, and sometimes

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420
gross.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.480
Still, he’s been a huge influence on theater-makers
and theater companies who feel let-down by

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.830
realistic writing and Stanislavski-style acting.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.260
Jean Genet, Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook,
the Living Theater—all big fans.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.140
Also John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and even
Jim Morrison.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.550
As legacies go, not too cruel.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.550
Thanks for watching!

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.280
We’ll see you next time, when we explore
yet one more way to give the theatrical finger

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.280
to realism.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.410
We’re going to meet the mostly Marxist,
totally dialectical, often smelly theatrical

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.110
mastermind Bertolt Brecht.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.310
It’s going to be epic.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:11:15.490
But until then...Curtain.
