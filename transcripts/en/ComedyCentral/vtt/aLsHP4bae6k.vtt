ISSUES, DEMOCRATS AS ALWAYS HAVE

OF ALL, OF COURSE, ARE

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.590 align:start position:0% line:85%
REPUBLICANS.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:28.594 line:91%

TOO MANY NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:30.363 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.503 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:39.906 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WAIT A SECOND. BILLY BOB
THORNTON AND NIRRA TANDEN

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:44.577 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
ARE SUPPOSED TO AGREE ON
EVERYTHING.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.545 line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO WE SHOULD IMPLIMENT IT --

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:46.646 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE --
LOOK --

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.416 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT IT TURNS OUT, KIBBE AND
TANDEN ARE PART OF A NEW

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.288 line:91%
ORGANIZATION IN WASHINGTON
WHOSE SOLE MISSION IS TO, GET

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.489 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS, SOLVE PROBLEMS BY
WORKING TOGETHER.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:00.226 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS ALL PART OF A
COMPLICATED ALGORITHM, STEP ONE,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:06.332 line:91%
IDENTIFY A PROBLEM, STEP 2, WORK
TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
STEP 3, UH, YEAH.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.436 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.575 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;A HUGE EXPANSION OF
MASS INCARCERATION IS NOT

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.776 align:start position:0% line:85%
HELPFUL TO ANYBODY.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:20.213 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE PRISON POPULATION HAS
GONE UP SOME 780 PERCENT IN THE

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:26.219 line:91%
LAST 20 YEARS, WE ARE SPENDING
$80 BILLION A YEAR, IT IS CRAZY.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.421 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I AM HAVING A PROBLEM HERE.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:32.492 line:91%
OKAY?  YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK
AT HIM AND SAY, HEY, YOU RACIST

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.863 line:91%
REAGAN FLUFFING REPUBLICAN, YOU
ARE DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.566 line:91%
THEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK TO
HER AND SAY HEY, GUESS WHAT YOU

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.735 align:start position:0% line:91%
HIPPY, LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD
AND YOU SLAP HIM.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:46.339 line:91%
THEN YOU START CRYING, YOU'VE
COLLECTED THE TEARS IN A COFFEE

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.440 line:85%
CUP, YOU SPLASH IT IN HER FACE.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:48.941 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S THE WAY THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO GO.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:53.246 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WHO ACTUALLY GOT THESE TWO
TOGETHER?  CHRISTINE LEONARD OF

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.781 line:85%
THE COALITION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.284 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT IS EXCITING.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.887 line:91%
ONE THING IS NO ONE CAME TO
THE TABLE AND SAID THERE IS

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.223 line:91%
SOMETHING THAT THEY WON'T WORK
ON SO WHAT WE WILL BE WORKING

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:08.427 line:91%
ON IS SYSTEMIC REFORM, TALKING
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE END UP IN THE

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.164 line:91%
PRISON SYSTEM, TALKING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHEN THEY

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.198 align:start position:0% line:91%
END UP THERE, THINKING ABOUT HOW
WE CAN BETTER HELP THEM

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.232 line:85%
RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES --

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.200 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TREVOR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.003 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND, AND FIND JOBS.
&gt;&gt; SHH, LET HER FINISH.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.237 align:start position:0% line:85%
 SORRY. CARRY ON.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.241 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND SO ALL OF US ARE REALLY
COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER TO

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:27.613 line:91%
TRY AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO
STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM FOR THE

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.215 align:start position:0% line:85%
COUNTRY.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.984 line:85%
&gt;&gt; ASK HER A FOLLOW UP QUESTION.

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.220 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; UM, WHY DID YOU FEEL IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO --

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:39.025 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU SAY UM, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE NOT SURE.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:43.362 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO SAY UM IN YOUR HEAD AND THEN
SAY THE QUESTION.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:46.666 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAUSE IF YOU SAY UM IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU DIDN'T PLAN.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.734 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS TREVOR.

DOING THIS REALLY WELL

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:00.246 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEFORE YOU WERE HERE.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:00.813 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO DEM -- IT CAN ALWAYS BE
BETTER, THOUGH.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.047 size:75% position:38% line:85%
IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.150 line:91%
&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE
NOW WORKING TOGETHER ON PRISON

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:04.483 align:start position:0% line:85%
REFORM.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.751 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:08.921 line:91%
WE HAVE ALL COME TOGETHER FOR A
LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS BUT WE

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.624 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO TRYING
--

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:12.692 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T DO THIS --

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.393 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; JUST IMAGINE I'M NOT HERE.
IMAGINE I'M A VIEWER.

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:17.496 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST REMEMBER, UM, IN THE
HEAD. IN THE HEAD.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.940 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHRISTINE LEONARD WAS ON TO
SOMETHING.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:31.244 size:78% position:39% line:85%
INSTEAD OF THIS AND THIS.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS COULD
WORK TOGETHER.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.883 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE HOPE MAYBE THIS WILL
BECOME A TREND.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.385 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK?  GIVE ME
A HASHTAG.

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.921 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HASHTAG TRANSPARTISAN.

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:43.489 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT MIGHT CONFUSE
PEOPLE.

00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:45.424 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HASHTAG COOPERATION.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:46.759 align:start position:0% line:85%

COOPERATE.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.429 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF THEY WOULD JUST (BLEEP)
COOPERATE FOR A SECOND -- WAIT A

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start position:0% line:85%
MINUTE.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.732 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S IT.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:53.066 align:start position:0% line:85%
(BLEEP).

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.267 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:07.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF I COULD HAVE ONE WISH, IT
WOULD BE THIS ONE.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.750 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WISH MY ELECTED
REPRESENTATIVES WOULD

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:12.518 align:start position:0%
GET (BLEEP) DONE.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:17.623 line:91%
WE THINK IF YOU JUST TRIED YOU
COULD MAKE GET ALONG AND THAT IS

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:24.730 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY WE ARE LAUNCHING HASHTAG
FUCO WITH THIS SONG.

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:29.135 line:85%
WON'T YOU (BLEEP)ING COOPERATE?

RACIST, SEXIST, SELFISH AND

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:37.376 align:start position:0% line:85%
CORRUPT, WE KNOW. 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:45.918 line:91%
CAN YOU BE LIKE PRINCESS ELSA
AND (BLEEP)ING JUST LET IT GO.

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:49.355 line:85%
I KNOW IT SOUNDS KIND OF CRAZY.

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:50.523 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WE KNOW IT IS NOT THE NORM.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:57.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER FOR
JUST A WEE BIT OF REFORM.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0% line:85%
