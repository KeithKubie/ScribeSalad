00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.993
The term modern art sounds like it
means art that is popular at the moment,

00:00:11.993 --> 00:00:17.372
but in fact, modern art is a style
that originated over 150 years ago,

00:00:17.372 --> 00:00:21.555
and includes artists that by now
have attained classic status,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.772
such as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin.

00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:27.863
And what's even more ironic is that
the movement they pioneered,

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:31.341
considered revolutionary
and even scandalous at the time,

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:37.000
was inspired largely by an object
of a traditional and ancient design.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.963
As far back as the Renaissance,

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:44.628
the primary European art movements
emphasized conventional representation

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:47.145
and adherence to classical forms.

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:50.183
But that began to change 
in the late 19th century

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:54.610
as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne
expanded the boundaries of painting.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.534
Soon, a movement arose that sought
to create an entirely new style of art,

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:04.267
and one way of doing so was to look
beyond Western civilization.

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:09.345
For example, Paul Gauguin moved
to the island of Tahiti in the 1890s.

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:14.435
There, he found inspiration in the island's
inhabitants, landscape, and culture

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:20.457
to create artwork that intertwined
European themes and Polynesian lore.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.994
Others looked the cultures 
of the Islamic world,

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:28.629
but the most influential inspiration
would come from Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.013
As European empires expanded
deeper into the African continent,

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:37.645
its artifacts and artworks made their way
into the hands of museums and collectors.

00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:39.960
One such collector was Henri Matisse,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.307
who showed his friend Picasso 
a mask he had acquired

00:01:43.307 --> 00:01:46.398
made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast.

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.842
The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity,

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:55.344
leading him to visit the Trocadéro 
Ethnographic Museum in Paris in 1907.

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:58.625
Founded to house acquisitions 
from colonial conquests,

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.589
the museum boasted 
a collection of African art,

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:04.808
with stylized figures 
and masks made of wood

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:07.931
and decorated with simple colors 
and materials.

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:10.577
The visit was a revelation for Picasso,

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:15.175
who proclaimed that African masks
were what painting was all about.

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:19.043
At this time, Picasso had been working
on a painting of five nude women

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:22.761
in a style that would later come
to be known as Cubism.

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.206
And while three of these ladies
show facial features

00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:27.405
found in ancient Iberian art,

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.888
a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage,

00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:34.714
the faces of the two on the right
closely resemble African masks.

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:38.803
Created in 1907 after hundreds
of sketches and studies,

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:40.463
"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:43.798
has been considered 
the first truly 20th century masterpiece,

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:46.916
breaking with many previously 
held notions in art.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.679
It was at once aggressive and abstract,

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.930
distorted yet primal in its raw geometry,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.050
a new artistic language with new forms,
colors, and meanings.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.980
And these avant-garde qualities
caused a sensation

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.678
when the painting was first exhibited
almost ten years later.

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:06.036
The public was shocked,

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:08.090
critics denounced it as immoral,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.764
and even Picasso's own friends
were simultaneously surprised,

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:12.824
offended,

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:15.555
and mesmerized at his audacity.

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:18.872
More artists soon followed 
in Picasso's footsteps.

00:03:18.872 --> 00:03:23.023
Constantin Brâncuși 
and Amedeo Modigliani in Paris,

00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:25.378
as well as the German Expressionists,

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:29.527
all drew on the aesthetics 
of African sculptures in their work.

00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:32.907
Others looked to a different continent
for their inspiration.

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:37.578
British sculptor Henry Moore based many
of his semi-abstract bronze sculptures

00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:39.925
on a replica of a chacmool,

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:44.593
a distinctive reclining statue
from the Toltec-Maya culture.

00:03:44.593 --> 00:03:48.423
Pre-Columbian art was also a major
influence for Josef Albers.

00:03:48.423 --> 00:03:50.641
He created a series of compositions,

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:54.244
such as the geometrical series
Homage to the Square,

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.924
that were inspired by pyramids
and local art

00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.492
he encountered
on his frequent visits to Mexico.

00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:02.614
Inspiration from ancient cultures

00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:06.515
initiated one of the most revolutionary 
movements in art history,

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:11.151
but were these artists playing the role
of explorers or conquistadors,

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:15.460
appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.517
Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards.

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.735
Perhaps not too long from now,

00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:27.017
the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies,

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:30.914
ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:34.453
drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.
