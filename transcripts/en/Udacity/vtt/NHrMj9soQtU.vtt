00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Male] The next group of questions test how well you understand

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
strings in Python.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The question is given any string s, so the variable s

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
holds the value of any string,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which of the following always have the same exact value as s?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And as a reminder, you should be careful

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to remember that s could be the empty string.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here are the choices.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Check the box corresponding to each expression

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that always has the same value as s

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
no matter what string s refers to.
