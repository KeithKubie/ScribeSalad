00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.470
I don’t know about you, but thunderstorms
scare the hell out of me.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.549
Lightning may never strike in the same place
twice, but based on the following video, I

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.209
think we’re going to run out of places to
hide real real soon.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.410
Hey folks, I’m Matt Lieberman filling in
for DNews.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.390
According to Climate scientists from the University
of California, Berkeley, global warming will

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.230
cause the amount of air to ground lightning
strikes to increase by 50% by the end of this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.230
century.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.489
Now, that may feel far away right now, but
the road to lightning palooza, as it will

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.050
now be called, is not going to be fun for
anyone.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.079
So, how are global warming and lightning connected?

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.070
Well, lightning strikes are caused by charge
separation in clouds, which are composed of

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.230
water and ice molecules.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.929
Atmospheric water molecules are essentially
lightning fuel.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.350
Now, increased global temperatures will cause
more water to evaporate into the atmosphere.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.370
Imagine a bomb dropped into a barrel of gunpowder
in one of those oldschool rooms packed to

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.889
the gills with TNT.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.469
In a house that’s on fire.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.589
The opportunity for explosive deep convection
skyrockets under these conditions, sharply

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.510
raising the risk of human injury and wildfires.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.710
Jeez.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.790
Hold on, excuse me, science?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700
How did we get to this conclusion, science?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700
I’ll tell you, me!

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.930
You see, convection, the thermal transfer
of energy through fluid and gas, has long

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.110
been measured by precipitation, namely, the
amount of rain, snow, and hail that hits the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.470
ground during a given period.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.520
However, that doesn’t account for the ascent
speeds of moisture into the atmosphere.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.120
This is a factor known as CAPE, or Convective
Available Potential Energy, which is measured

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.870
via instruments released twice daily into
the atmosphere via weather balloons.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.670
Essentially, CAPE measures how fast and far
a moist pocket of air could travel into the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.470
upper atmosphere, releasing explosive charges.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.380
Armed with this information, scientists can
actually now predict 77 percent of lightning

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.380
strikes.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.380
Scientists then applied their new CAPE data
to 11 climate models that predict precipitation

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.380
throughout the century and reached their conclusion.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.420
As it turns out, CAPE in the U.S. will rise
by 11 percent for every degree celsius that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.120
our global temperature rises.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.320
Combined with small increases in precipitation
levels and based on the projected four degree

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.990
increase worldwide by 2100, lightning strikes
will rise by 50%.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.409
Just another reason to try to curb global
warming before it zaps us back.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.520
So how do you feel about lightning?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.530
Are you concerned about the potential increase?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.179
