Speaker 1:          00:00          I'll say this is radio lab, the podcast, and you take it from there. Ready? All right. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the BOD pod. Let me say, okay, sorry. This is radio lab, the podcast. Damn you, come on. No, he's like, you know what, actually this is a sort of appropriate because we will want to talk about sharing right now. I, that's all I was doing and I was trying to share the moment with you unsuccessfully. But so our last hour was all about, uh, trying to solve the puzzle of why is there niceness in a very, very cruel doggy dog world. Why would there be any kind of sharing your niceness? And as we asked the scientist in the show, which we call the good show this way, he just kept saying over and over again, well, oftentimes what you would call nice behavior is actually disguised selfishness as critters of one kind or another.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Try to push their genes into the future by being nice to particular folks, to their sisters, to their cousins, to others, and to those who are from their family, which share so many of their genes like according to some, like a real hard ass biologist could argue if you're nice to your sister, you're really just being nice to your own jeans in another person's body. And we were like, Huh, yeah. Is there another way of thinking about this? And so we met a guy, my name is Jerry Wilkinson. I'm a professor and chair of the Department of biology at the University of Maryland College Park. And the story that Jerry told us happened way before he was a chair or anything like that when he was a lowly Grad student. The first summer of my graduate education I went to Costa Rica. This was the summer of 1977 we went all over the country.

Speaker 1:          01:35          You've studied various things and we had an opportunity to apply for money to stay in Costa Rica and do individual projects. And Jerry decided what he was going to study. Where bats, why bats have you always liked that? I'd never actually handled the bat before I went to Costa Rica so I had no prior experience whatsoever and I was like anyone I think may be a little bit uh, hesitant I guess, but he says he just happened to be in this place that had a lot of bats cause I was on a cattle ranch otherwise known as the McDonald's of a yes because there's something we haven't told you here. These were vampire bats, the common vampire bat, which feeds primarily on Mammalian blood and these particular batch Jerry's has lived down by the river in hollow trees, big ones inside. They were like Kate threes along the rivers and every night he says hundreds of these bats would fly out of their trees,

Speaker 2:          02:31          kind of like a cloud move across the fields, hitting towards cow herd.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Basically they will hop up onto a cow, sink their teeth, razor sharp teeth into the cow's neck and start sucking its blood. And in a matter of about a half an hour, they basically swell up like a big tick and fly home to the tree quickly. Then they come back the trees. Anyhow, what Jerry was really interested in was not so much the cow split sucking thing. It was how do the bats behave with each other? Yeah, so one morning he went down to the river where these bats live, found himself a tree. These trees, some of them were so big that I could actually lie down inside the tree without bending my knees. We would use binoculars to look up at the top of the cavity, which could be anywhere from 15 feet to 40 feet above the ground. Now picture this, you're in the street. It's four stories high.

Speaker 1:          03:34          It's dark, it's wet and up at the top. How many are up there? Maybe 20 would be sort of some of the larger groups. What about poop? Weren't they pooping on you because you write in the direct line? Yes. They do that and it's sort of like tar. When they defecate blood, it's very sticky, but day after day he would go into these trees, get pooped on and watch them. Pretty soon he starts to notice that these bats are behaving in ways he really didn't expect. They behave quite a bit like primates, meaning what? They spend a lot of time grooming each other. Really 30% of the time in the trees they spend grooming each other. Huh. So there you were looking at these reputedly evil creatures and seeing them kind of snuggle. I mean, were you surprised by this? Oh yeah. Took me no time at all to become very fond, I guess would be the best way to describe it.

Speaker 1:          04:25          They are very social. They're very interactive. But then Jerry saw one of the dudes something, um, that went way beyond just being social. You know, it's, it's hard to say. Certainly it not a single observation, but basically here's how it would go. One Bat. One Bat will sort of sidle up to another bat and give her a little hug and they sort of clutch each other with their wings, which are folded up. And then the bat that made the move, it came up and gave the hug. You'd see that bat try the lick at the mouth of the other bat. The one it's hugging. And if you have a good view, you can actually see the tongue of one bat going into the mouth of the other bat. Like they're giving each other a kiss. Very similar. Yes. But after seeing this a few times, he realized what really was happening is that the one bat was feeding the other bat.

Speaker 1:          05:18          Yes. Giving it a meal by regurgitating blood into the other bats mouth. And that was a shock. A shock because, well, these weren't moms feeding their babies. I mean that we've all seen and that makes sense. Now these were adult animals eating other adult animals, food that they could've been eating themselves. Right. Just weird. That had not been described before. There's any thought we didn't need a second. I know what's going on here. What? These bats, they're just related. Correct. Their relatives. Close relatives. Yeah. The idea that was in vogue then and is still in vogue now, and certainly it's actually got much more support now than it did then, is that animals tend to help close relatives and sort of never help anybody who's not a close relative. So we thought that must be it. They're related, but you don't just assume it. You must test it if you're a scientist.

Speaker 1:          06:10          So Jerry did, okay, I'm going to check this out. I'm going to set up a little experiment. Yes. So he went out and got a bunch of bats that he knew were not related. Like I had two groups of six total of 12 bats, brought them into my house at the time, went to slaughter house, got a lot of blood, and then every night I would take one of the 12 bats out of the cage and not let it feed while everybody else got access to blood, which means this sad little bag. It's no dinner, but it has to watch the others eat. And it's just getting hungrier and hungrier. Well, how long can a bat go with no blood? Three days at most, at most, and then they're dead. So you can imagine that by the time the sun rises, this bat is literally starving. And then at dawn, I would put the female back in who hadn't fed. She will go and beg from other individuals. And weirdly, instead of them saying to her, you're not my sister, I'll go off. Yeah. According to Jerry, what would happen is that they in hold still part their lips and throw up in her mouth.

Speaker 3:          07:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:14          thank you. I mean at that point I was thrilled that I had found something that seemed to indicate that there, it wasn't just all about relatedness, just to make sure this wasn't a fluke. What I then did over the span of the next two weeks as I continued to take one bat out of the cage every night and you'd do the whole starver Tilden thing and then put her back in the cage with the others and she was always [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:39          and by someone from her group, and occasionally even by more than one individual from her group, sometimes one bat will step up and say, okay, have something. And then maybe another, sometimes a third, and he's talking question, I wonder what's going on here. Is this random or is there some kind of system? He, he just couldn't really tell. So then I just kept track of who fed home while I was there. I was, you know, staying up all night. I wasn't really doing a lot of analysis of the information and I was only there for a relatively short period. I got back up to San Diego, did the analysis and discovered that there appeared to be, to be a pattern. If, um, you know, Sally Fed Agnes on the first day and then I later starved Sally, then Agnes fed Sally on the second night. Right. Let's just go through this one more time.

Speaker 1:          08:33          If on the first day Sally fed Agnes, then on the second day Agnes fed Sally invariably, not always, but invariably, and what is invariably mean in that most of the time, most of the time, most of the time. So if I'm Agnes, I'm only going to feed Sally under the condition that at some later point in time she will repay the favor. I see you, you feed me Agnes seeds, Sally, Sally feeds. And if you think about it that this is kind of what friendship is. I mean we never say that explicitly, but friendship works on these kinds of trees. I'm going to be Pete, Cindy, Cindy feet, Mindy. In variably, in fact with the bats, Gerry at a certain point created a kind of matrix that lotted who had spent time with whom the friendships between the individual bets. And that allowed me to actually calculate a number that measured, you know, who was the best friends and who were the not such good friends. Like a friend number. Yes. Who was this? So eighth grade. And it turns out that number is the best predictor of who will feed him. It's better than who's related to better. Yes. Although it turned out that they both were important. So, but I want to write a headline around this. You're saying that, that, that that buddies beat kin.

Speaker 4:          09:55          Yes. Yes. I'll go with this beans if, if, if friends can beat family than if be first of all, have friends or people that you choose. Yeah. I mean you've stuck with your family, but you can choose your friends. That's in effect an idea that niceness is really deeply chosen. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:11          Well. So what is the, so what is w in the, in the, uh, in the broad scientific community, does this, does this mean what you counted and saw open up altogether? Again, the question of who helps who and why?

Speaker 5:          10:27          Uh,

Speaker 1:          10:29          ah, yes, but now we're talking 1984, that's when this work was published and the Hoe, that's when the sort of, and I gave talks about it various places. So it became well known pretty quickly and, and it was a really big deal. In fact, some scientists thought maybe this is going to revolutionize our whole understanding of niceness and nature and social dynamics and creatures because you know, maybe this behavior isn't just a bad thing. It's everywhere and we just haven't been seeing it. We haven't been working hard enough to see it. Like this Jerry Guy slept in a tree got pooped on for weeks on end. Maybe if we pushed ourselves that far, we'd find this all over the place. But no, didn't work out that way. There are not many convincing cases that I think people identified in those next few years. So the observation you're making may not be large, just may be writ small.

Speaker 5:          11:27          Um, yeah. Well

Speaker 1:          11:30          I'm not sure I would describe it exactly that way, but clearly it's how much we can extrapolate the Vampyr event story to other systems is an open question and well in your, in your most extrapolated frame of mind, maybe when you were sitting in a bar and your three Martinis in and in your gut and your drunk gut at that moment, what is your hunch? Is this a representative case and we just haven't found it elsewhere but we will? Or is this a one off? Oh, I don't think it's unique, but I don't think it's very common. I think it would be quite uncommon. You know, they have, our vets are really pretty special because of this reliance on blood. Here's one story you could tell. It says Jerry way back in the day, 40,000 or more years in the past, the planes where the bats lived were filled with all of these giant creatures.

Speaker 1:          12:19          Big mammals were abundant. Saber Tooth Tigers, mammoth wolves, then giant slaws and all of these things were filled with warm blood. So the bats were very happy. But presumably there was a point in time when all of these large mammals is appeared really fast and there all kinds of theories as to why that happened. The point is it must have created a time when vampire bats all of a sudden had a hard time finding prey. At that point I would think it would have been behoove a vampire bat to come up with some way to deal with periodic food Georges and he thinks the strategy they came up with somehow somehow was to share. If they didn't help each other, I think you would find vampire bats gone. I mean we wouldn't see them. Um, now,

Speaker 6:          13:13          well this is interesting. This is a new way to explore the question we've been exploring all this time and they show their niceness in the world. Yeah, no. Up to now we thought, well mostly niceness is a secret form of selfishness, selfishness, selfishness, Dean's into the future. Yeah. But this is a different version. This one says, you know, under certain circumstances for a group of animals, being nice really isn't an option. It's

Speaker 1:          13:39          the only way. Yeah. Like when the going gets tough, the tough get. Nice. How's that for a bumper sticker?
