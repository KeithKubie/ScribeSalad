00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.140
So, before we continue with this project, I want

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.450
to highlight a few new words that we have used

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.170
in the code thus far. We've identified turtle as

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.540
a class. And brad and angie as instances of that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.210
class. Now, I want to take a moment and

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.040
talk about these new words. You can think of a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.210
class as a blueprint of a building. Now, a

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.590
blueprint as we know, contains certain pieces of information about

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.570
the building. For instance, the height of the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.640
building, the number of rooms in the building. We

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.430
also know that the same blueprint can be used

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.390
to build multiple different buildings. For instance, an office

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.180
with yellow walls, and a residential complex with blue

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.570
walls. A class is like a blueprint. So let's

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.620
take the example of class Turtle that we've used

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
thus far. A class Turtle, much like a blueprint,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.140
contains certain pieces of information about the turtle.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.740
The turtle's size, its color, the fact that the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.710
turtle can move forward and turn right. And from

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.400
this class, or blueprint we can create multiple different

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.560
instances of that class. For example, Brad is

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.300
an instance of class Turtle that draws a yellow

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.130
square, and Angie is also an instance of class

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.330
Turtle that draws a blue circle. So, in summation,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.340
you can think of a class as a blueprint, and you

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.940
can think of its objects as example or instances of that blueprint.
