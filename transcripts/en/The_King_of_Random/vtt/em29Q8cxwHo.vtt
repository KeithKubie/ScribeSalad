Hey guys, I'm out of the hot springs  today because we're trying an experiment today using dry ice. So crazy Russian hacker

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.439
Just posted a video on the internet throwing 30 pounds of dry ice into a swimming pool, and it made a really cool effect

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.420
So got me thinking. I went to the store and cleaned them out, and I just picked up 200 pounds of dry ice

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.499
So I brought my family out to the hot springs today because as far as I know

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.939
nobody has ever tried throwing dry ice into the hot springs

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.829
I need a little bit of help today, so I enlisted my buddy Jeremy to come out

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.970
He's going to be our guinea pig

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.630
And we're gonna get started by smashing up all this dry ice and throwing it in a bucket

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.329
And then we're gonna toss a hundred pounds of dry ice into a pool with Jeremy in. We really have no idea what to expect here

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.070
As long as you keep moving it quickly

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.009
There's not enough time for it to frostbite your fingers, but you don't want to grab on to the stuff for very long

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010
It is cold!

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.870
Now the more we can break up this dry ice the quicker it's going to react with the water because there's going to be more

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.870
Surface area

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.650
The bottom of our bin is cracking and the dry ice is falling out. That's how cold it is.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.989
Oh wow, that's amazing!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.830
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950
The whole bottom fell out of that bucket

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.830
That's completely destroyed

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.330
This is the bucket

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.639
I used to throw the dry ice, but it got so cold on the bottom that the plastic completely shattered. How crazy is that?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.580
Jeremy, how long has it been gone?

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.550
Okay, guys. I can't believe this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.160
We're pushing seven minutes and it's still going strong. This water is so hot, i can't believe that dry ice is lasting.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.259
You can see how thick that fog still is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.249
Now a block of dry ice like this is solid carbon dioxide. When it hits the water, it heats up and the carbon dioxide

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.150
vaporizes and goes back into the atmosphere

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.510
the moisture in the Air is getting so cold that it's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.899
Condensing and turning back into a cloud, and that's what the vapor is that you're seeing here.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020
What kind of sorcery is this?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.809
We've actually got some remnants of the dry ice down here

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.979
May as well throw that in. Oh, my little boy just threw one into this pool. That's cool. We found the secret Stash

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.880
Okay, we're gonna do one more shot into this pool back here and see how that looks

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.739
Jeremy is this what you expected to be doing today?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.130
Beats having a real job. Doesn't it?

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.630
So this is seriously awesome guys. Perfect day to be doing this experiment with all the steam coming off

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.909
It looks like it'd be minus 52 below, but it's not it's more like eighty five. We're loving it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Wow, you're on TV!

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.959
So we used up quite a bit of dry ice. We're down to about our last 40 or 50 pounds

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.109
So I'm going to go talk to the staff and see if they'll turn on the water slides for us

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.110
Maybe we can take these bad boys for a ride

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.070
Where did you go?
