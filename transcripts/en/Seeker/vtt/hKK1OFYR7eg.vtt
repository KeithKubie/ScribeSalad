00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.610
I say the word amphetamine and you’re probably
picturing some illegal powder in a white baggie,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.610
right?

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:13.510
What if I told you they come in a little labeled
orange bottle too?

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.419
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.869
You probably know of amphetamines in their
popular form as a medications for ADHD like

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.180
Ritalin and Vyvanse.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.679
But amphetamine use isn’t a new phenomenon.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.359
It’s usage can be traced back over a century;
it was first synthesized in 1887 and used

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.359
to treat asthma.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.930
But in WWII, soldiers on either side of the
war took amphetamines to stay alert and be

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.930
more efficient.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.079
Today, college kids cramming for tests and
manual laborers pop these pills for pretty

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.199
much that same reason.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.899
Amphetamine is considered a schedule 2 drug
here in the states, meaning that while it’s

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.670
used as medication, it has a high potential
for abuse.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.040
And studies show that more and more students
use and abuse amphetamine to work harder,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.140
faster and longer.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.320
But at what cost?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.460
According to a study published in the journal
Brain Behavior, misuse of ADHD stimulants

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.250
has dramatically increased over recent years.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.281
So called “the good grade pill”, these
schedule 2 drugs are standing in for a study

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.281
buddy.

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:13.940
They’re stimulants which help kids with
ADHD reduce impulsivity and focus.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.510
But for those without the condition, it’s
reported that it boosts energy levels and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.440
increases motivation and focus.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.650
So students use them when studying, like for
pull-all nighters.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.460
For schedule 2 drugs, they’re almost too
easy enough to get.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.640
According to one report from pharmaceutical
supplier Express Scripts, 4.8 million Americans

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450
have a prescription for ADHD medication.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.360
Plenty more get their hands on the drugs through
friends, colleagues, and classmates.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.920
Willy Pedersen, Professor Sociology at the
University of Oslo called amphetamines “a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.860
hazardous substance that is often used by
ordinary people.”

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.740
According to a study published in the journal
Nature, amphetamine affects the brain by disrupting

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.390
the functioning of a dopamine transporter.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.100
As more of these chemicals are released and
their reuptake is blocked by the drug, more

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.480
dopamine floats freely in the brain.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.660
But according to another study published in
the journal Biological Psychiatry, the clinical

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.679
benefits of cognitive enhancement get outstripped
by other less medically desirable effects

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.909
like addiction and a study published in the
journal Brain Behavior states other risks

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.810
like psychosis, heart problems, and even sudden
death.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.360
And one study published in the American Heart
Journal found that young adults who abuse

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.859
amphetamines have a greater risk of getting
a tear in the main artery leading to the heart.

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.549
Another study, published in The International
Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, found

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.970
that long term amphetamine use can lead to
permanent changes in the brain.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.749
The researchers found that long term use causes
chemical imbalances in the brains of mice.

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.060
And imbalances of these brain chemicals like
serotonin, dopamine and nor-ep-in-ephrine,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.150
are associated with mental health disorders
like depression and addiction.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.730
According to a study published in the journal
Seminars in Neuroscience, since amphetamines

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.340
work on dopamine in the brain, they are habit
forming.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.719
Addiction happens slowly as you build up a
tolerance.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.630
People will have to use more of the drug to
get the same cognitive boost.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.920
While doctors might prescribe doses as low
as 10 mg, some students take several doses

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.379
in a row, as high as 400 mg at one time, which
can cause hallucinations, seizures, and often

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.379
hospitalization.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.969
And these kinds of instances are on the rise.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.930
A 2013 report by the federal Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.310
says ER visits from “nonmedical use” of
these kinds of drugs among young adults tripled

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.060
from 2005 to 2011.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.989
So while many kids take these study buddies
“just like vitamins”, amphetamines can

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.980
have profound and devastating effects when
taken incorrectly.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.459
So if you feel like you’re struggling in
school, maybe talk to your doctor about it

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.360
first, instead of your lockermate.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.200
Think abusing amphetamines is cool?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.959
Guess who else abused them.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:44.959
Nazis.

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:45.959
Yeah and ISIS.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.129
Not so cool now eh?

00:03:47.129 --> 00:04:11.769
Head over to TestTube News to learn more how
amphetamines help soldiers deal with the chaos

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.340
of war.
