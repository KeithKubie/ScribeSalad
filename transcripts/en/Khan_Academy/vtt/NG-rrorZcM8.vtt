00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
Let's have a little bit of a primer

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:04.841
on weight and mass, especially if we start talking

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:07.213
about atomic weight and atomic mass.

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:08.910
If we're sitting in a physics class,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.471
weight and mass mean something very, very ...

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:14.865
well, they mean different things.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:16.808
It might be a discovery,

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.923
or a new learning, for some of you,

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:20.442
because in everyday life,

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.065
when we say something's mass, we think,

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.416
"Well, the more mass it has, the more weight it has."

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:26.994
Or, if we think something has more or less weight,

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:29.529
we think, "Okay, that relates to its mass."

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.502
But in physics class, we see that these actually represent

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:35.489
two different ideas, albeit related ideas.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.103
Mass is a notion of how much of something there is,

00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:42.767
or you could say, how hard is it to accelerate

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:44.005
or decelerate it.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.155
Or you could view it as a measure of an object's inertia.

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.616
We typically, it, kind of a human scale,

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.955
might measure mass in terms of grams or kilograms.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:56.617
What's confusing is, if you go to Europe,

00:00:56.662 --> 00:00:58.438
and you ask someone their weight,

00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:01.422
they'll often give you their weight in terms of kilogram,

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:04.473
even though that is a unit of mass.

00:01:04.473 --> 00:01:07.812
Now weight, on the other hand, is not ...

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:09.458
it's different than mass.

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:12.350
Weight is a force, it's how much the Earth,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.690
or whatever planet you happen to be on,

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:16.089
is pulling on you.

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:18.390
This right over here is a force.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.767
And, in the metric system, you measure weight,

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.824
not with grams or kilograms, but with Newtons.

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:26.294
Newtons.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.611
Really, when you ask someone their weight in Europe,

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.714
they should give it to you in Newtons.

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:33.198
If you ask them their mass,

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:35.588
what they're telling you is actually their mass.

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:38.052
They should say, "My mass is 60 kilograms,"

00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:40.659
or, "70 kilograms," or whatever they might be.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.729
It's a very important difference in physics.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.863
If I go from Earth to the Moon, my mass does not change,

00:01:48.863 --> 00:01:51.935
but my weight does change because the force

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.009
with which the Moon is pulling on me,

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.945
or that we're pulling on each other,

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:57.600
is less than it would be on Earth.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.991
In fact, even on the surface of the Earth,

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.346
if you were to even go to the top of a building,

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:02.625
you're just so ...

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.646
Yeah, it would be very hard to measure it,

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:05.936
but you're just slightly further

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.621
from the center of the Earth,

00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.551
so there's a different gravitational force.

00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:11.776
Your weight will change ever so slightly,

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:13.826
but your mass does not change.

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:15.411
You go to deep space,

00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:17.781
and there's very little gravitational influence,

00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.549
you have pretty much, or close to, zero weight.

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.059
But you're in deep space, and if there's no planets nearby,

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.965
but your mass is still going to be

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.717
whatever your mass happens to be.

00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:31.387
That's a primer on mass and weight.

00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:33.336
Now, with that out of the way,

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:35.231
I might confuse you because,

00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:36.699
as we go into a chemistry context,

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.057
it starts getting a little bit more muddled again.

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:45.867
Let me go to chemistry, chemistry.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:48.057
And in any science, if people just talk generally

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:50.096
about mass or weight, this is what they're talking about.

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:53.158
They're talking about a measure of inertia for mass,

00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:54.414
and they're talking about a force

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:55.548
when they're talking about weight.

00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:58.785
But in chemistry, we start thinking about things

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:00.256
on an atomic scale.

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.114
You'll hear ...

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.249
You'll hear the term "Atomic,"

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.865
"Atomic mass."

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:11.654
Atomic mass is, literally, a measure of mass.

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:14.049
It is measured in atomic mass units.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.705
Atomic mass units, which is,

00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:18.351
and we'll talk in the future videos,

00:03:18.351 --> 00:03:22.414
a very, very, very, very, small fraction.

00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:26.474
One atomic mass unit is a very, very, very, very, very,

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:29.867
very small fraction of a gram.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:31.939
It is actually defined

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.091
using the most common isotope of carbon.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.708
It's defined using carbon-12.

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:43.317
The current definition is carbon-12.

00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:47.451
Carbon-12 has a mass,

00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:49.545
has a mass,

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:53.802
has a mass of exactly,

00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:56.307
exactly,

00:03:56.307 --> 00:03:58.166
exactly 12

00:03:58.166 --> 00:03:59.912
atomic mass units.

00:03:59.912 --> 00:04:01.885
So they can then,

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:05.339
you or chemists, use that as the benchmark

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.633
to figure out what the atomic mass,

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:10.344
or the mass of any other atom.

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:12.077
And you might say, "Oh, why didn't they just do a hydrogen,

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.523
"and just say that's one atomic mass unit, and all that,"

00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:16.973
and actually, they had started there.

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:18.868
They had been there at an earlier stage,

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:20.298
but for a whole set of reasons,

00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:22.514
carbon-12 is kind of being the benchmark,

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:27.207
as having 12 atomic mass units, is what people went with.

00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:30.491
Now, what is atomic weight, then?

00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.927
Atomic weight.

00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:34.366
Let me write this in a different color.

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.526
I'll do it in blue.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:41.131
Atomic weight.

00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:43.686
So if you draw the same analogy that we did up here,

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:45.762
you might say, "Okay, this must be a ...

00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:47.661
"This must be a force.

00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:49.369
"It should maybe, you know,

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.797
"an atomic weight unit would be a small fraction of,

00:04:52.797 --> 00:04:55.222
"very small fraction of a unit."

00:04:55.222 --> 00:04:57.084
But it turns out in chemistry,

00:04:57.084 --> 00:04:58.962
when we talk about atomic weight,

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:01.531
we're still measuring in atomic mass units.

00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:03.926
This is still a mass.

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:05.478
Atomic mass units.

00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:09.865
But it's not the mass of just one atom or just one molecule.

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.823
It's a weighted average across many, many ...

00:05:12.823 --> 00:05:16.096
of how typically, what you would see,

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:18.135
or the makeup of what you would see on Earth.

00:05:18.135 --> 00:05:19.570
What do I mean by that?

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.407
Well, on Earth, there are two ...

00:05:21.407 --> 00:05:26.200
The primary isotope of carbon is carbon-12.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.152
Carbon-12, which is defined as having a mass

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:33.445
of exactly 12 atomic mass units.

00:05:33.445 --> 00:05:36.803
But there's also some carbon-14.

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:39.846
Carbon-14.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:42.799
What do these numbers mean, just as a reminder?

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:45.975
Well, carbon-12 has six protons,

00:05:45.975 --> 00:05:48.710
and the six protons are what make it carbon.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.255
Carbon-14 is also going to have six protons.

00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:58.909
But carbon-12, carbon-12 also has six neutrons.

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.675
Six neutrons.

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:05.223
While carbon-14 has eight neutrons.

00:06:05.223 --> 00:06:06.689
I know what you're already thinking.

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:07.819
You're, like, "Well, wait.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.337
"Why don't we say that a proton or a neutron

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:11.695
"weighs one atomic mass unit?

00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:13.223
"Because it looks like this is 12,

00:06:13.223 --> 00:06:14.820
"and I'm guessing that this,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.958
"that this, the mass of this is going to be

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.485
"pretty close to 14."

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:20.073
If you're thinking that way, that's not an unreasonable way to think.

00:06:20.073 --> 00:06:22.543
In fact, when I'm kind of just working through chemistry,

00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:24.172
that is how I think about it.

00:06:24.172 --> 00:06:26.689
But they don't weigh exactly one atomic mass unit

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:27.655
by this definition.

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.949
Remember, the electron is ever so small,

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.077
it has very small mass, but it is contributing,

00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:36.266
or the electrons are contributing, something to the mass.

00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:40.586
So, a proton or a neutron have very, very, very close ...

00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:43.512
They are close to one atomic mass unit.

00:06:43.512 --> 00:06:44.771
Let me write this down.

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:49.749
One proton, one proton,

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.821
or one neutron,

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.747
one neutron,

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.536
very close to one atomic mass unit,

00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:00.091
but not exactly.

00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:02.551
But anyway, going back to what atomic weight is,

00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:03.545
right over here,

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:05.296
the most common isotope of carbon ...

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:06.475
Remember, when we're saying "isotopes,"

00:07:06.475 --> 00:07:07.831
we're saying the same element,

00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:09.368
we have the same number of protons,

00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.198
but we have different number of neutrons.

00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:13.682
The most common isotope on Earth is carbon-12,

00:07:13.682 --> 00:07:16.544
but there's also some carbon-14.

00:07:16.544 --> 00:07:18.201
If you were to take a weighted average,

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.293
as found on the Earth,

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:23.116
of all the carbon-12 and all of the carbon-14,

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:27.082
the weighted average of the atomic masses

00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:29.009
is the atomic weight.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.102
And the atomic weight of carbon ...

00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:32.527
And you'll see this on a periodic table.

00:07:32.527 --> 00:07:34.469
In fact, I have one right over here.

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:35.914
Notice, the six protons,

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.008
this is what defines it to be carbon.

00:07:38.008 --> 00:07:40.615
But then they write 12.011,

00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:42.383
which is the weighted average of the masses

00:07:42.383 --> 00:07:43.575
of all of the carbons.

00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:44.844
Now, it's very close to 12,

00:07:44.844 --> 00:07:46.436
as opposed to being closer to 14,

00:07:46.436 --> 00:07:50.917
because most of the carbon on Earth is carbon-12.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:52.186
We could write this down.

00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:53.568
This is the atomic weight.

00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:57.638
This is the atomic weight of carbon on Earth.

00:07:57.638 --> 00:08:03.946
This is 12.011.

00:08:03.946 --> 00:08:06.839
Typically, if people are telling you,

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.038
"Hey, I'm talking about the isotope.

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.915
"I am talking about the isotope carbon-12,"

00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:16.602
you say, "Okay, if you're talking about a particular atom

00:08:16.602 --> 00:08:18.690
"of carbon-12," you would say,

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.003
"Okay, that's going to be 12 atomic mass units."

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.793
But then if you said, "Hey, you know,

00:08:23.793 --> 00:08:24.557
"I'm randomly ...

00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:28.570
"If I have a big bag of carbon, you could say,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.519
"on average, the weighted average of those carbon atoms,

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.378
"they're going to have an atomic mass,

00:08:35.378 --> 00:08:38.024
"or a weighted average atomic mass,"

00:08:38.024 --> 00:08:39.002
which is atomic weight,

00:08:39.002 --> 00:08:45.238
"of 12.011 atomic mass units."

00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:47.534
AMU.

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:50.592
Hopefully, this clarified it more than it confused.

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:52.934
All right, see you in the next video.
