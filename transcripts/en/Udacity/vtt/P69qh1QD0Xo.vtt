00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, we're going to probe the acceleration due to gravity.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Up until now, we've been saying that this acceleration is just 10 m/s² anywhere on the earth.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've been assuming it didn't matter if you are here, or here, or here, or there.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Little g was equal to 10 m/s².

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, one thing I have to confess that it's actually closer to 9.81 m/s²

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but that's something we're not going to worry about.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What I really want to get in this problem is the underlying cause of this acceleration

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and examine any sort of differences in this acceleration due to, well, let's see.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We know this gravitational acceleration is due to a gravitational force, which we can call FG.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we've talked about how that force is proportional to 1/r².

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, when we stand on the earth, the r that we're talking about is actually the distance

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
between the center of the earth and the center of our bodies, and the distance is about 6,400 km.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's the radius of the earth.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, since the force of gravity has this strange dependence, 1/r²,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and remember, this means if I get twice as far away from the earth,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so maybe if I were out over here somewhere, the force of gravity would be 1/4 as strong

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because 1/4 is 1/2².

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, we know that there's this strange dependence on the force of gravity, it goes like 1/r².

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So that means if I get twice as far away, the force gets actually four times weaker.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now, remember it's this force of gravity which is causing this acceleration due to gravity.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And since force is proportional to acceleration,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
well that means that acceleration like gravity is proportional to 1/r².

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
By what percentage does the acceleration due to gravity change when we stand on Mount Everest?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now, Mount Everest would be somewhere over here.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And the height of Mount Everest is about equal to 9 km. This is a tricky question.

00:01:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But try to think back about what you know about proportionality to give us an answer.
