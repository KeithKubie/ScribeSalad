00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.380
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Welcome

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.750
to the European Division
Library of Congress.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.520
And I'm Grant Harris.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.090
I'm head of the European
Reading Room.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.970
And we're very pleased to have Paul
Miller here today to talk to us

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.530
on -- I don't have actually in
front of me -- there it is --

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.840
Warn the Duke: The
Sarajevo Assassination

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.000
in History, Memory, and Myth.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.380
And I apologize for not
having a larger room.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.690
I should have known that Paul
Miller's star power would bring a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.630
large group in here.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.410
I've always been impressed
with Paul's lectures.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.860
And that's true.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.770
So I'd just like to say
Paul is at McDaniel College,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.440
an associate professor there.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.270
His PhD is in modern European
history at Yale University.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.090
His dissertation, From
Revolutionaries to Citizens:

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.870
Anti-Militarism in
France, 1870-1914.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.630
And that was published
by Duke University Press.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.360 position:56%
In 2004 and 2005 he was a Fulbright
fellow at the University of Sarajevo

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.600
where he wrote on and
taught genocide issues.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.910
From 2011 to 2013, Paul was a Marie
Curie fellow at the University

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.840
of Birmingham in England
where he researched

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.810
and later published
his work on the Memory

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.550
of the Sarajevo Assassination.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.110
And I've been very pleased that
I was able to include Paul Miller

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.290
in a talk we had a couple years
back, I think, a panel discussion

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.460
on Sarajevo in this building.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.480
And I'm pleased that we
have him here again to talk.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.890
And so I'll just turn this
over now to you, Paul.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.190
Thank you for being here.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.010
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Yeah,
thank you very much, Grant.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.310
[ Applause ]

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.620
Yeah. And thanks to your terrific
staff here for organizing this.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.320
And thank you all for coming
on a Friday afternoon.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.900
Grant actually said to me, "Is
there any way you could tie this

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.290
in with an American theme?"

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.540
So first of all, I should
draw attention to the fact

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.040
that Franz Ferdinand is a
band, some of you already know.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.970
So hence, this is a band poster.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.410
The band has nothing to do with
the Sarajevo assassination,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.550
per se; they're in Scotland.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.780
But this is already not working.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.040
Oh, because I have to turn it on.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.710
How do I turn it on?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.010
I'm sorry.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.680
Ah, there it is.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000
Okay. So as an American theme,
I thought what better to start

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.960
with than the Jewish
Hungarian-American Harry Houdini?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.550
And there he is, doing
one of his escape acts,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.640
the famous magician escape artist.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.310 position:56%
The very day Franz Ferdinand and his
wife were shot to death in Sarajevo,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.070
the world-famous magician Harry
Houdini was hanging upside

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.270 position:56%
down in a straight jacket 12 stories
over New York City's Times Square.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.820
Here's another picture.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.590
The ecstatic crowd was
holding its collective breath

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.320
as the escape artist performed one

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.340
of his most audacious
and dangerous acts.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.720
4,000 miles away, another energized
crowd was ravaging Serb property

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.350
in the Bosnian capital.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.630
There, too, if less literally,
danger was in the air.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.470
But even Houdini was not
above the milieu as he dangled

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.040
above Midtown Manhattan; on the
contrary, the great conjurer was

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.220
in the midst of quote, "The
one genuine mystical experience

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.600
of his life," end quote.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.020
It came in the form of a
memory triggered by news

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.810
of the archduke's assassination.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.200
From inside the straight
jacket's darkness,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.710
Houdini suddenly visualized a
scene from six summers earlier

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.590
when on a Sunday drive through
the New York suburbs his auto had

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.390
overheated just opposite a house

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.100
where a little boy
was playing outside.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.850
While the liveried chauffeur
refilled the radiator,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.210
the legendary illusionist had
refreshed his thirst inside

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.650
with the family.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.020
It was as he was leaving that the
now-remembered moment occurred.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.800 position:56%
The boy, entranced like all children
by the magician, had followed him

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.670
into the street and was
standing before the car,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.330
staring at his distorted
macrocephalic reflection

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.220
in the shiny brass
fitting of the headlight.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.610
"Goodbye, sonny," said Houdini.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.820
"Warn the duke," replied the boy.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.840
Then he ran off.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.140
The magician had not given the
cryptic utterance a single thought

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.790
since, not even when he met
the Archduke Franz Ferdinand

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.130
at an air show in Germany
a year later.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.840 position:56%
So this is exactly the kind of story

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.970
that the American writer
E.L. Doctorow likes to insert

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.690 position:56%
into his fiction, one in which
cosmic design lurks just beneath the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.180
outward, arbitrary look of things,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.920
and the characters themselves
remain largely oblivious to it.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.440
In his work <i>Ragtime</i>, as in the
Sarajevo assassination, accident

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.110
and intention intersected at the
very spot Houdini's car sputtered

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.410
and swerved in the curve.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.250
But when the little boy,
who happens to live there,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.240
transmits an authentic
message from beyond,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.610
the imminent illusionist
fails to recognize it.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.070
Thus missing the signal from
a real-life mystic, the boy,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.090
the fake one -- Houdini -- forfeits
his chance to change history

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.560
by alerting Franz Ferdinand

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.760
and averting the flashpoint
of global catastrophe.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.450
Only at the end of the novel
on the day the duke is murdered

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.180
and the moment Houdini
is immobilized

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.990
in midair does the magician sense
that he may have been tripped

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.540
up by something truly magical.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.290
As far as we know, there
was nothing supernatural

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.280
about the Sarajevo assassination.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.200
And yet, every aspect of it has
a whiff of the otherworld --

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.240
from the many warnings
the archduke did receive

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.090 position:56%
to the way events unfolded that day,
the barely evaded bomb, for example,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.930
the fact that Count Harrach got on
the running board later in the day

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.410
to protect Franz Ferdinand
but he was on the wrong side.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.290
And the famous wrong turn
that you've all heard about.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.820
Franz Ferdinand himself had a
superstitious streak once relating

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.590
how a fortune teller had
prophesied that he would quote

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.540
"Someday unleash a world war."

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.780
But the archduke was above
all an ardent Catholic, who,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.340
whenever given a grim account
of the security situation,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.030
confidently fell back on his faith.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.590
Quote, "Our lives are
constantly in danger,"

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.850
he told his [inaudible] chief
of staff on April 18th, 1913,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.670
"One just has to trust
in God," end quote.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:19.660
On June 28th, 1914 God clearly
was not on the successor's side.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.900
Fate, destiny, design, doom --

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.730
these are the usual stuff of
memory rather than history.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.360
They're also a big part of how we
process the Sarajevo assassination

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.820
and in the process transmute
it from historical event

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.570
into mythologized moment.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.480
Fictional and figurative works like
<i>Ragtime</i> do this deliberately,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.460
if at times subtly, inserting a
scene, phrase, image, character,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.670
or storyline that alludes
to some aspect of Sarajevo

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.700
and then leaves readers to reflect
on meaning, assuming, that is,

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.790
that they haven't missed
the metaphor altogether.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.650
Selden Edwards' successful novel --

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.880
fantasy novel <i>The Little Book</i>
is another interesting instance

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.180
of this.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.280
While the work mainly tracks
a time-traveling teenager

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.400
from 1988 San Francisco
to 1897 Vienna,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.480
it opens with a scene
evoking the very deed that in

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.990
so many depictions undid the
era that enraptures the author.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.940
In the scene a 10-year-old
protagonist is walking

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.490
in the wilderness with his mother
when he spies a hawk hovering

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.470
at about 100-foot distance.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.030
Reflexively, as little boys are
wont to be, he picks up a stone

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:37.370
and quote "In one beautifully
unified motion, wings it right

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.260
at the bird," which drops, quote,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.630
"Like an over-ripe
peach," end quote.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.860
His mother is aghast.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.650
The boy is totally stunned.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.750
He can't believe he even came
close, let alone laid the bird out.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:57.370
And he's seized by a strange
sense of shame and awe, quote,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.350
"It was hard to explain,
but something began

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.130
to dawn on him in that moment.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.240
He had felt for just an
instance the connectedness

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.580
of all things," end quote.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.080
The alert reader might well wonder
whether the Gavrilo Princip also

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.010
experienced such mystical
connectedness

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.340
when his shots hit home or more
likely was he clobbered so quickly

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.720
by the crowd that he had
no chance to feel anything?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.660 position:56%
Whatever the upshot, Selden
Edwards could have left his audience

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.590
to its own imaginings.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.670
Yet just to be sure that
we all got the allegory,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.040
he inserts what the boy's mother
hopes will be a life lesson

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:39.210 position:56%
for her thunderstruck son, quote,
"That such tiny and thoughtless acts

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.590
of violence were exactly what
eventually caused the huge

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.170
consequences of world
war," end quote.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:54.530 position:56%
The author's choice of adjectives
is interesting -- tiny, thoughtless.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.840
Certainly in relation to the
First World War, the assassination

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.690
of a single archduke, even
if he were heir to the throne

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.060
of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, may well appear trivial.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.540
Yet in its proper geopolitical
context,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.990
Sarajevo was nothing less
than earth-shattering.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.330
After all, it had been barely five
years since Austria's annexation

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.230 position:56%
of Bosnia led to the Bosnian crisis,
which almost led to a European war.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.090
And in light of the nationalist
feelings in the region

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:27.350 position:56%
and Serbia's accelerated irredentism
since the two Balkan wars in 1912

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.200
and 1913, no one had any illusions

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.490
as to the danger the archduke
courted when he went to Bosnia,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.560
let alone drove through its
capital in a convertible

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.000
on a Serb national holiday.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.100
The emperor himself had
been stalked by an assassin

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.330
when he visited Bosnia
four years earlier.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.700 position:56%
His nephew's murder there four years
later was anything but thoughtless;

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.080
it was a highly purposeful
act of political violence.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.640
Yet rather than censure the
novelist, Selden Edwards,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.370
whose artistic license arguably
allows him some factual leeway,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.150 position:56%
academics and other assumed experts
have contributed to the construction

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.370
of the assassination as
tiny and thoughtless.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.040 position:56%
Around the time of the centenary two
years ago in the <i>New York Times</i>,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.980
the Oxford historian
Margaret McMillan referred

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.190
to the political murder
as quote, "A random event

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.850
in an Austro-Hungarian
backwater" end quote.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.230
And pre-dating this perspective
there's 100-year history

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.760
of reducing Sarajevo to fate,
fluke, chance, and accident

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.370
and the city itself, along with
Bosnia and the Balkans in general,

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.030
to obscure savage, primitive,
remote, and in a word irrelevant,

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.730
quote "A ridiculous mouse" --
the Sarajevo assassination --

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.150
that it probably induced,
quote, "Towering mountain ranges

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.480
into labor," wrote
one British scholar.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.930
In the 1930's an American
journalist decreed it quote,

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.890
"An intolerable affront to
human and political nature

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.520
that these parochial, and
miserable, and wretched,

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.810 position:56%
and shriveled little countries in
the Balkans can and do have quarrels

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.240
that cause world wars," end quote.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.140
The same holds for the randomness
issue, Princip intentions.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.200
There's no shortage of
scholarly works that use language

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.040
which easily lends
itself to the notion

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.270
that sheer coincidence
brought Franz Ferdinand face

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.860
to face with his assassin.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.260
According to Yale historian
and my mentor,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.300
John Merriman's highly
successful textbook,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.710
<i>A History of Modern Europe</i>,
"Princip just happened

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.200
to be only a few feet from the
archduke's car," end quote.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.880
The historian Hew Strachan, one of
the great historians of World War I

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.340
in his book, <i>The First World
War</i>, the assassin was quote,

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.110
"Loitering on the corner when the
successor's car suddenly appeared."

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.400
And in an article published -- I
can give you thousands of examples.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.440
In an article published in the
recent issue of the <i>Journal</i>

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.600
<i>of Modern History</i>,
the author writes

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.920
that the Gavrilo Princip
was quote, "Milling about,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.570
ruminating on his group's
failed attempt

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.410
when the car suddenly stopped
right in front of him."

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.710
Besides the author's sense that
he can read the assassin's mind,

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.220
the historian, as many before him,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.200
also seems to have
overlooked the fact

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.320
that Princip was doing his
milling about or his loitering

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.240
at the precise spot the procession
was supposed to turn according

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.400
to the well-publicized itinerary.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.390
That's why Princip
was standing there.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.350
Not to mention the fact that he had
a gun and a grenade in his pocket.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:39.940
But was he also eating a sandwich,
as the 2003 BBC documentary <i>Days</i>

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.990
<i>That Shook the World</i>
first reported?

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:48.080 position:56%
Well, in case you haven't heard, the
conspirators called off their effort

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.710
after the bomb missed its
mark, but Gavrilo Princip,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.020
understandably starving
from spending, you know,

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.240
the morning in the hot summer sun,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.380
headed to Mortiz Schiller's
Delicatessen for a bite to eat.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.840
And here two destinies
collided to steer history

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.340
in its diabolic direction as
Princip turned up from his lunch

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.200
to see the car stalled
squarely in front of him.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.340
The only question is why the
half-eaten sandwich never made it

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.040
into a museum and obviously
what kind of sandwich it was.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.660
All right.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.810
[ Laughter ]

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.430
It's not as whimsical as it sounds.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.790
One teacher offered his students
extra credit if they could find

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.370
out what kind of sandwich it was.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.020 position:56%
By the way, all my students incoming
now have heard the sandwich story.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.970
That wasn't true ten
years ago, but now it is.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.740
And besides classrooms, the story
has seeped into serious works.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.770
One historian, <i>A Concise History
of Western Civilization</i> --

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.950
this is a historian published
by a serious academic press,

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.490
2011 -- has the sandwich.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.820
Nicholas Rankin's Oxford
University Press published book

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.180
on British cunning in the two world
wars, Gavrilo Princip is quote,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.550
"Consoling himself with a sandwich
when the archduke drops in."

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.380
And I can give you
lots more examples

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.600
of serious university-publisher
books.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.100
Quote, "Whoever made the sandwich
Gavrilo Princip ate on June 28th,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.320 position:56%
1914 has a lot to answer for," reads
the first sentence of an article

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.870
in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> by the
science writer for <i>Time</i> magazine.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.820
Indeed they do.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.070
In the case of the sandwich, the
myth moved in the other direction,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:31.270 position:56%
that is, the story first appeared in
a Brazilian novel that just happened

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.920
to be translated into English

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.500
at the same time the BBC director
was working on his documentary.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.800
In other words, you can't
find before 2003 any reference

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.140
to a sandwich.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.210
Only in 2003 and after
the BBC documentary comes

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.440
out that you start seeing
references to him eating a sandwich

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.240
as the archduke's car pulls up.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.900
In this novel, by the way,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.160
a 12-fingered trained
assassin inserts himself

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.240
into the signal events
of the 20th century.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.030
And on June 28th, 1914,

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.020
the well-endowed protagonist
encounters Gavrilo Princip

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.730
in Sarajevo and he's eating
sandwich in the novel.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.360
So in these and other
ways, then, nonfiction

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.330
and even scholarly
writing contributed

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.900
to the assassination's mythization
through an inviting infusion

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.950
of exaggerated language,
interpretive overreach

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.040
like inbred Balkan barbarism,
the inevitable collapse

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.790 position:56%
of a European order, etc.,
recurring canards like the sandwich,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.380
and rhetoric that leads readers
directly from that hot sunny day

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.260
in Sarajevo to those cold muddy
trenches of the western front.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.510
In this regard, quote, "The first
shots of the First World War,"

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.300
end quote is a catchy
and compelling way

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.780
to describe the archduke's
peacetime political murder.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.290
The expression has thus
appeared in countless contexts

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.900
and configurations and
through all the cultural

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.400
and political upheaval
of the past century.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.570
Its ubiquity, however,
does not make it true.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.900
What it makes it is memorable.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.630
In parallel manner, Houdini's
personal recollection

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.030
of the little boy becomes the
shared memory of the millions

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.430
who read <i>Ragtime</i>, a novel
that is not even about Sarajevo,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.210
the Sarajevo assassination as such.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.510
What Doctorow's classic -- and
if you haven't read <i>Ragtime</i>,

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.430
please do, it's just terrific like
all of Doctorow's novels, I think.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.520
What his novel's about, race
and the roiling tensions

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.340
in American identity during the
transformative years before the

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.160
First World War is
realized and enlivened

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.870
by the author's intrepid
combination of actual history --

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.860
right, Houdini existed -- and
overt invention, the boy didn't.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.270
Most notably, all the characters,
whether fictional like the boy

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.910
or historical like Houdini, are
interconnected in a chaotic pattern

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:51.440
of coincidence, correspondence,
and as we've seen, occult.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.440
Such a setup seems ready-made
for Sarajevo, whose maddening mix

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.940
of randomness -- the wrong
turn, and predictably --

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.020
all the warnings that did happen --

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.910 position:56%
readily provokes a common comforting
assumption that because it happened,

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:14.370
it somehow had to and so, too,
the great power collision itself.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.890
The novel thus taps into two

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:22.780 position:56%
of the assassination's truly
mythical registers of remembrance --

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.010
that it improbably occurred
in this preposterous place

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:32.210
and that it directly gave rise
to the inevitable great war.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.770
So a little theory now
because this is memory study,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.160
so I can't really get
away from it, right?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.790
Ultimately, of course, it's the
latter that matters in terms

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.380
of the measureless
attention we place

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.650 position:56%
on this particular political murder.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.610
Were it not for the
unforetold global fallout

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.830
from Franz Ferdinand's fatality,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:55.100
then Doctorow's Houdini would not
have been told to warn the duke,

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.740 position:56%
right, whose death would merely have
joined the long and lugubrious list

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.400
of political murders
that marked the era.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.960
If Princip's pistol shots
were not literally the first

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.050
of the First World War, they were
outrageously what triggered the

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.340
crisis that came to it.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.100 position:56%
It's precisely this absurd asymmetry
that makes Sarajevo the epitome

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.770
of what the historian Pierre
Nora calls a spectacular event,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:25.250
one quote, "On which posterity
retrospectively confers the

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:31.140
greatness of origins, the
solemnity of inaugural ruptures.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.070
Thus the assassination can be
considered a lieux de memoire,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:42.590 position:56%
a site of memory supremely suited to
contemplating this consequent past."

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.390
Now, for Pierre Nora, such sites
were typically physical spaces

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.800
with national subtexts.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.200 position:56%
And the one where Princip pulled
the trigger can certainly be studied

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.580
as such.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.290
But for our purposes
it's the act itself

00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:01.660
which suffuses popular memory, just
like the lethal limo is displayed

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.800
in a museum, and there it is.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.190
I don't know who that
kid is [Laughs].

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.580
That's my nephew, it's her brother.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:14.240 position:56%
And just as we crack up clumsily
every time the comic explains quote,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.350
"Franz Ferdinand found alive;
World War I a mistake."

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.100
As these select examples suggest,
what we commonly compartmentalize

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.490
as history or memory are
not necessarily polarized

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.460
in the ways we might presume.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.470
This point was not
always so problematic.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.270 position:56%
Only with the emergence of modernity

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.750
in the 19th century did scholars
begin stressing the strict schism

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.120
between history and memory.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.360
Unlike in earlier epochs
when traditional forms

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.340
of imparting the past invariably
conflated these concepts --

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.680
people used to pass down history
as stories, right, inflating memory

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.160 position:56%
and history -- history now in the
19th century modernity came to stand

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.630
for quote, "An ideal of
disinterested objectivity,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:05.380
while memory was increasingly
regarded as inherently subjective."

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.570
Then came post-modernism
in the late 1970's

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.750
with its direct challenge
to objective truth.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.750
And soon enough, historians
were pointing to ways

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:19.950
in which their own discipline was
beset by subjectivities conditioned

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.480
by the confines of
language and context.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.420
Yet rather than belaboring it,
they built upon this insight

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.590
to begin making a cultural
turn as it's called

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.310
in academic milieu towards
studying historical representation.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:37.160
So now monuments and museums,
commemorative acts, rituals,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.430
and even street names were
avenues for interpreting the past.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.380 position:56%
Everything from fiction to folklore,
film, art, images, textbooks,

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:50.170
even children's books became fair
game for ferreting out meaning.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.190
And in this expansive sense,
then, narrative history itself --

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.870
part of my argument --
can also serve as a source

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.340
for surveying representation,
one that's informed and deforms

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.840
in ways strikingly similar
to its alleged other memory.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.790
Make no mistake, I am an historian.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.400
History is still history in
that its intrinsic intention

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.180
is understanding.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.200
Memory has no such motive.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.230
Oh, I should say history may
never be perfectly objective,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.130
but it strives for empirical truth.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.990
Memory has no such motive.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.820
Steeped in meaning, it feeds on
our feelings rather than intellect,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.820
preys upon passions as
opposed to answering questions.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.310
That's why memory is regularly
associated with place,

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.160
such as the actual site of
the Sarajevo assassination.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.320
Politics in time period two
can radically transform how

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.330
and what we remember,
which is why the site

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.520
of the assassination
has seen five memorials

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.960
and three museums in one century.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.360
Of course, history
writing is also influenced

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.310
by temporal and political context.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.390
Just witness the number of recent
studies drawing direct analogies

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.930
to terrorism today, and
there are a ton of examples.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.490
But the example I'm going
to give is the one that came

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.060
to my attention the most
recently not by an historian

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.620
but in the <i>New York Times</i>
by Roger Cohen four days ago.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.050
"The Orlando killer, Omar
Mateen, is the Gavrilo Princip

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.410
of the early 21st century.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.400
Like the 19-year-old Bosnian Serb
nationalist whose bullets ignited

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.390
World War I, Mateen has set a spark
to a time of inflammable anger,"

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:42.310
says Roger Cohen in the <i>New
York Times</i> just a few days ago.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.430
So there you have -- this is the
line I gave a little earlier.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.160
And this is an academic
book [foreign language]

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.560
in Austrian Academic Press.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.590
And you see paired the
World Trade Center in flames

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.670
and the Sarajevo assassination.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:02.130 position:56%
Okay. So if the world changed
forever on September the 11th, 2001,

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.630
then what the heck happened
on the 28th instance

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.860
of June 1914 at 10:50
in the morning?

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.410
This is the title of a film which
I would venture few scholars

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.150
of the war's origins have ever
heard of, let alone actually seen.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.370
That's because it has
nothing whatsoever to do

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.830 position:56%
with the event it's plainly evoking.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.870
Rather, this work is a portrait
of two modern gay artists who are

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.110
so inspired by the Victorian Era

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.540
that they have turned their
entire life work into artwork,

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.460
living without contemporary
conveniences whatsoever --

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.530
no cells phones --
surrounding themselves

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.990
with a 19th century repertoire
of furniture, photographs,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.450
musical instruments,
dress, utensils,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.440
and even historical objects
conserved under glass.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.010
According to the film's website,

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.090
the documentary film
demonstrates the extent

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.370
to which the artists'
lives are subservient

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.260
to their quasiphilosophical
conception of time.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.000
We thus watch them emptying piss
pots, mending vintage clothing,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.610
and pecking away on
manual typewriters

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.400
like the one I learned to type on.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.880 position:56%
And yet, these scenes are all set in
the midst of modern-day Manhattan.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.690
So what can we make of this work
in the context of coming to terms

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.640
with the Sarajevo assassination?

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.440
Is its title merely an
attention-grabbing gimmick?

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.560
By so methodically imposing
the past onto the present,

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.790
are these artists actually just
overnostalgic escapists naive

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.110
to the 19th century's
gross inequities,

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.250
which it would have made
their lives together

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.170
as middle class gay men
impossible in the first place?

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.670
That's certainly one way to see it.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.420
Yet I would suggest there's
something about the preserved past

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.620
in the present lives
of Peter McGough

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.470 position:56%
and David McDermott that's decidedly
exhilarating, not because we want

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.080
to go back but because we might
have done better with the world.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.900
Time is determinative.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.630 position:56%
And its displacement here highlights
the radical change that has occurred

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.720
in the last century, the one
that can be conveniently dated

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.660 position:56%
to the precise moment that Princip's
bullet pierced the heir's bull neck

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.180
and blood spurted onto his tunic,

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.610
which is also displayed
today in a museum.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.090
The blood's fading.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:23.160
It's a moment, moreover, that a
wide range of writers, artists,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.660
and others have regularly
constructed in terms

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.890
of a definitive break with an
idyllic world or directly blamed

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.730
for having brought on
all the bad in this one.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.650
Some of the most amusing examples
-- and here I'm just going to throw

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.190
out a few examples -- are murder
mysteries and related fiction

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.830
that focuses on solving the
crime and saving humanity

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.020
by stopping the Sarajevo
assassination.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.230
There are also nonfiction
works that do this.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.950
Robert Goddard's classic
thriller <i>Closed Circle</i>,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.170
two World War I veterans find
out that there was a conspiracy

00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:00.260
by some very rich financiers to
start a world war and, therefore,

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.560
they would become even richer.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.670
And they're trying to
track down this conspiracy.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.830
There's a counterfictional work

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.050
that I'm hoping will be
translated into English.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.300
It was written in German, it's
called <i>The Comet</i> in English.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.290
And it's a terrific read.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.940
It's got excellent reviews.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.740
It just came out a few years ago.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.800
And in the world that's woven
in this book, Franz Ferdinand,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.730
after the assassination attempt
that fails, earlier in the morning,

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.580
the bomb, he says,
"Oh, what the heck?

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.040 position:56%
Let's go home," goes back to Vienna.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.270
Vienna and Berlin, of
course, there's no holocaust,

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.890 position:56%
so they have their Jewish
populations have become the capitals

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.690
of the world and America
remains cowboy

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.080
and Indian land, totally primitive.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.840
And he weaves this whole tale
about how the world develops.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.140
It's hilarious.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.530
Kids books do this a lot, too.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.240
Actually, my nephew,
I gave him this book

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.720
by a British writer Johnny O'Brien,
<i>Jack Christie's Adventures</i>,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.600
and one of them is the Day of
the Assassins in which two people

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.830
who invent a time machine
go back to try

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.660
to prevent the Sarajevo
assassination.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.060
But one decides that no,
they shouldn't change history

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.030
because then we wouldn't exist and
other positive things that happened

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.330
in the world wouldn't happen.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.960
And they have this big
argument about whether

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.390
or not history should be changed.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.960
So there's millions
of examples like this.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.700
Here's another example that gets
us back to the American theme,

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.110
F. Scott Fitzgerald's short
story <i>The Ice Palace</i>

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.390
in which there's an oblique
reference to quote, "the Serbia,"

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:27.820
quote, "an unknown man who had
not had his trousers pressed,"

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.390
end quote.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:35.330
Tellingly, the Serbia's identity
is irrelevant to what transpires

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.960
when this baggy-pantsed man
is spotted on a street corner

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.250
by the story's protagonists --

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.890
a northerner, think back to the
time period Fitzgerald's writing --

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.820
a northerner named Harry and his
fiancee from the south, Sally.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.140
Now, this is long before
<i>When Harry Met Sally</i>.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.160
So nothing to do with the film.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.290
Harry, mischievous --
Harry's from the north --

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.630
he mischievously reckons
the raggedly figure

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.260
on the street corner a southerner,
then launches into a litany

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.580
of stereotypes about
this whole quote,

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.510
"Hang dog lot of sordid degenerates
who've gotten lazy and shiftless

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.680
from living so long
among colored people."

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.080
Sally, the southerner,
can't bear to hear this.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.860
And what readers then witness is
a clash of worldviews so severe

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.780
as to bring the betrothed
to the brink

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.150
of a dangerously steep
quarrel or war, right?

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.480
All because of some
slovenly man in the street

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.170
in Harry's wholesome hometown, a
stand-in, it seems safe to assume,

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:36.390
for the unkempt miscreant
who murdered the archduke

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:41.190
and plunged the world, the
marriage into Armageddon.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.620
Similarly, the American writer
Askold Melnyczuk's novel <i>What is</i>

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.910
<i>Told</i>, the protagonist
just happened to get married

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.150 position:56%
on the day the archduke is murdered.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.170
The priests -- nobody
really pays attention.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.230
The priest kind of grumbles
about the bad weather that day.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.950
But once the war comes
and the husband is killed,

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:02.430
the young wife swears revenge
against the Serbian prince.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.590
She says in the novel, "Who
do these men think they were

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.860
that she should lose a
husband for their sakes?"

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.020
So that may be quasimythical,
but it's also an eloquent part

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.040
of the painful legacy these writers
are struggling with, that is,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.260
it's much easier to target
the Sarajevo assassination

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.120
than the World War's true culprits,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.890
the leaders of Europe's great
powers -- all men, by the way.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.840
And therein lies one myth that
has made the Sarajevo murder

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.600 position:56%
so memorable, its causal culmination
in the First World War with all

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.400
that conflict's concomitant
consequences from the demise of men

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.110
to the rise of despots in the
destruction of civilization.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:45.870
Here's some quotes, "Except for
Sarajevo, writers and scholars both

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.840
around the world actually, across
the century, Europe's," quote --

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.400
this is a scholar --
"ascending process

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.870
of civilized well-being
would not have been broken,"

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.840
except for the Sarajevo
assassination.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.750
Dialogue on women's rights
would never have been deferred,

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.840
except for the Sarajevo
assassination.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.750
Gandhi's colonial emancipation
could not have happened,

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.740
except for the Sarajevo
assassination.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.620
<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, 1937,
two Serbian assassinations

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.890
and an American massacre.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.820
Okay? And who hasn't heard of
the quote unquote "the sofa"

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.540
on which one could
lay the 20th century?

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.810
That's the sofa that the
archduke died upon and for

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.460
which the Austrian
government paid a lot of money

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.100
in the 1990's to put in the museum.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.400
There it is.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.700
It's more like a chaise
lounge, I guess.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.330
The Museum of Military
History in Vienna,

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.930 position:56%
Austrian Museum of Military History.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.420
[Inaudible] museum in German.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.340
The man who made that purchase,
Dr. Manfried Rauchensteiner,

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.990
did so as director of the Austrian
Museum of Military History,

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.780
which has an entire room
of assassination relics,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.360
including the fateful auto.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.660
Yet as an accomplished historian,
Rauchensteiner also reminds us

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.260
in one of his books,
quote, "That the murder

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.850 position:56%
of Franz Ferdinand did not trigger
a war, but rather a European crisis.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.640
And this crisis could
well have been resolved

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.420
without global conflagration

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.040
as discernibly graver ones
were earlier in the era."

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.770
Is there, then, enough
space in public memory

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.910
to include the failings and foibles
of those leaders truly at fault

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.610
for the World War,
or is it just easier

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.290 position:56%
to proclaim Gavrilo Princip quote,
"The greatest murderer of all time,"

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.560
and assume that events
followed a preordained path,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.770
or as the BBC documentary
stated in 1964,

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.740
"The peace of Europe died
with the royal pair."

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.570 position:56%
In no case -- now I'm going to give
sort of a case study very quickly --

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.650
in no case, perhaps, has this
been more true than for Austria,

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.310
which not only lost the
World War but was forced

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.500
to for sake its 600-year-old
Hapsburg Empire.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.680
Unsurprisingly, the suddenness

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.020
of the ageless empire's
disappearance gave rise to the type

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:02.050
of confusion that typically
takes refuge in nostalgia

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:06.130
as what one scholar called, "Old
Austrians looked back longingly,"

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.310
unquote, the loss of greatness,
harmony, and stability,

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.330
the end of an idyllic world

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.520
and enchanted middle
Europe, middle Europa.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.580
For the great Austrian novelist
Stefan Zweig it was not the

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.460
armistice of November 11th,
1918; it was not the signing

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.770
of the Saing-Germain Treaty
on September 10th, 1919,

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:30.370
which officially dissolved the
Austro-Hungarian, which ended it.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:34.790
No, it was June 28th,
1914 when, quote,

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.260
"In a single second this knowable

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.940
and dependable enchanted world
was smashed into a thousand pieces

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.310
like a hollow clay vessel."

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.590
Similarly, Austrian
efforts to come to terms

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:53.620 position:56%
with Franz Ferdinand's unfinished
legacy have commonly constructed him

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.210
as the first victim of
the First World War.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.700
And there's lots of quotes to this
effect, so I'm going to skip that.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.630
There's never been a monument
or memorial to Franz Ferdinand

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.540
in Vienna, let alone a street
or a square named for him.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.740
But he's been remembered in Austria
since 1934 in the castle gate

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.720
on Heroes' Square where you find
Austria's official World War

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.410
I memorial.

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:20.870
Okay? It's right there on the left.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.810
So this is World War I
memorial, this is the Tomb

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.410
of the Unknown Soldier in Vienna.

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:25.710
This is right on Heroes' Square.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.710
Anybody who knows Vienna's
been there.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.130
So there. Archduke Franz
Ferdinand killed in Sarajevo.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.110
Of course, there was no world
war going on when he was killed,

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.620
and that's sort of my point.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.230
And in 1986 another marker went
up to in the Kaiser's Crypt.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.050
Franz Ferdinand, for
various reasons having to do

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.350
with his morganatic wife,

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:49.020
is not buried in the Kaiser's
Crypt, the imperial crypt.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.100
But they put a plaque up in 1986
in remembrance of Franz Ferdinand

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.800
and his wife, who was also killed,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.300
in memory of the first
victims of the First World War.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.930 position:56%
So "Zum gedenken an die ersten opfer
des weltkrieges" is what it says

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.230
at the top.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.170
Right? And here it is, and there's
Franz Joseph's tomb right there.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.720
And so that's what it looks like.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.710
And this is a tourist play; every
tourist goes to the Kaiser's Crypt

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.950
when they go to Vienna,
right, to see all these tombs

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:18.190
of the various emperors
and empresses.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.740
If Austrian popular memory
could construct Franz Ferdinand

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.960
and his frau as the first
victims of the First World War,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.900
then why not Sarajevo as the
place where the World War began?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.120 position:56%
When in 1927 the great Austrian
writer Joseph Roth went to Sarajevo,

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.460
he cannot quite bring
himself to wish ruin upon it.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.760
"Why should I?

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.900 position:56%
It has good people, beautiful women,
marvelously innocent children,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.610
pets that are happy to be alive."

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:51.060
Yet neither could the author accept
Sarajevo's everyday ordinariness,

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.750
as he also wrote in the Frankfurter
newspaper <i>Zeitung</i>, "Nonetheless,

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.100
the war began here and
the world is wrecked.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.740
And Sarajevo stands.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.230
It should not be a city.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.570
It should be a monument to make
everyone remember with horror."

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.090
While Sarajevo itself cannot be
held accountable for the World war,

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.930
such modes of remembrance remind us

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.460
that it cannot be separated
from it either.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.410
Just as a story and sometimes
bookend the 20th century

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.640
between the Sarajevo assassination
and the city's siege in the 1990's

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.640 position:56%
in order to create a neat,
explanatory framework for the forces

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.660
that shaped the era, writers
who reflect upon the city

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:32.750
in non-scholarly ways also end up
shaping its memory, though in ways

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.060
that are typically more
mythic than accurate.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.260
Quote, "Look deeply into
the history of Sarajevo,"

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.440
wrote the Bosnian author
Hamza Humo in 1934,

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.560
"and you will find
a city characterized

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.440
by an atmosphere of protest."

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.620
For the author the assassination
of Franz Ferdinand was nothing less

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.530
than the heroic culmination
of a rebellious mentality

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.510
that had characterized the
Bosnian capital for centuries.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.590
Now, contrast this
with a poem written

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:05.200
by the very well-known British
writer poet Lawrence Durrell

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.120
in 1951, and I'll read it.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.820
"Where minarets have twisted up
like sugar in a river curdled

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.220
with blind ice drives on,
tinkling among the mule teams

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.140
and the mountaineers under the
bridges and the wooden trellises,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.890
which tame the air and promises
us a peace -- excuse me --

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:27.710
harmless with nightingales,
none are singing now.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.660
Know history much?

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.950
Perhaps. Only this ominous, dark
beauty flowering under veils,

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.130
trapped in the spectrum
of a dying style,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.800
a village like an instinct
left to rust,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.690
composed around the
echo of pistol shot."

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.930
For Durrell, not a
Bosnian, the assassination

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.980
and the ugly world war it
provoked are wholly at odds

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:56.060
with the deliciously serene
natural and prehistorical,

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.050
premodern landscape that
he finds in Sarajevo.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.330
So which picture of
Sarajevo is correct?

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.180
Was it the fate of this peaceful
premodern city to become the site

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.260
of the most famous political
murder in modern history,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.030
or was it completely in accord

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.880
with the Bosnian capital's
rebellious nature?

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.080
Of course, the answer is both
and neither, as these myths,

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.670
like all myths, say more about how
we try to make sense of the world

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.530
than they actually do about
the assassination itself.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.500
In other words, when history and
memory blur, the myths that form

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.580
out of them are liable to
tell us more about ourselves

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.170
than what actually
historically happened.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.800
So I'm wrapping up now.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.000 position:56%
What isn't the Sarajevo
assassination, if not a handy symbol

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.260
for however we wish to
make sense of the world?

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.580
Well, that's certainly
taking things too far.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.100
And the point here is not
to strike an uncritical blow

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.440
at such construals as we've
seen in this talk; rather,

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.320
my aim to illustrate and
analyze the range of means

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.790
by which the archduke's
assassination has been incorporated

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.330
into our collective lexicon,
thus lending it the kind

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.360
of mythical quality that comes
from both too much attention

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.570
to the details -- the warnings,
the wrong turn, the sandwich --

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:09.330
and too little appreciation for
the larger historical context

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.080
in which the assassination occurred
and the truly decisive actions

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.470
that took place in its
immediate aftermath.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.060
But as we all very well know,

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.600
history is always complicating
things.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.780
And the origins of World War
I are very, very complicated.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.080
Memory, on the other hand,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.110
is what makes the past
really interesting and fun.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.960
So an unforgettable finale.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.210
There he is, back to Houdini.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.670
In the end, 12 stories above
ground and upside down,

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.020 position:56%
Houdini escaped the straight jacket.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.970
Ta-da. In questions and
answers I can tell you how.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:54.410
A feat of unbelievable physicality
that he performed regularly.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:57.590
Escaping his own memory,
however, proved impossible.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.730 position:56%
Certainly, there was no way for the
magician to know that at this moment

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:03.400
of mental torment that
the death that day

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.800
of the duke he didn't
warn would affect each

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.520
and every person madly applauding
him in Midtown Manhattan,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.190
not to mention most of
the rest of humanity.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.950
Unless, of course, the
amazing Houdini really did have

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.890
mystical powers.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:20.410
There's no hint of this in the
novel, though there is one thing

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.900
about the conjurer that
connects the coming calamity

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.460
to his troubling memory.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:31.590
For all his renown, Doctorow's
Houdini detests himself.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.970
Despite the prodigious talents
-- his prodigious talents --

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:40.930 position:56%
he regards his professional work as
pure fakery and empty entertainment.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:45.800
The legendary illusionist longs for
the kind of legitimacy we associate

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:51.700
with history rather than memory,
truth instead of trickery,

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.040
or as Houdini says in the novel,
quote, "There was a kind of act

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.920
that used the real world for its
stage -- he couldn't touch it.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.570
For all his achievement,
he was a trickster,

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.870
an illusionist, a mere magician.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.430
What was the sense of
his life if people walked

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.890
out of the theatre and forgot him?

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:17.260
The real world act was what got
into the history books," end quote.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.820
Gavrilo Princip could
certainly attest to that.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.120
What he did on the 28th
instance of June 1914

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.300
at 10:50 a.m. was definitely no
illusion, let alone an accident,

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.950
even if his opportunity to make
history arrived accidentally.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.430
Moreover, not only did it get
into the Bosnian [inaudible]

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.560
into the textbooks and
smud-caked Sarajevo onto the maps,

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.930
in 1999 several people
crowned Princip, quote,

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.970
"The most important person in
the 20th century," end quote.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.330
Single-handedly it has been said
Gavrilo Princip ended Europe's

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.110
Golden Age.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.670
And for almost four decades
his footprints were set

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.710
into the pavement on
the street corner

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.380
that started the 20th century.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.550
There's the footprints, and
there's the street corner

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.230
that started the 20th century.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.780
Just like those of
Hollywood legends in front

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.820
of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in LA.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.400
A museum was even devoted
to Princip's daring.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.120
In 2014 Serbs erected two statues
of Princip and tourists flooded

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.650
into Sarajevo to hear the
Vienna Philharmonic try

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.950
to harmonize the past
with the present.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.910 position:56%
And it all happened because some
terminally ill student somehow found

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.770
himself at the right intersection
at the right millisecond,

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.330
all the while eating a sandwich.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:38.650
Harry Houdini was right, his entire
life's work would never compete

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.980
with a real-world act
like the assassination

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:46.580
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
-- it was much too magical.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.510
Thanks.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.250
I could hear bits and
pieces as I tried

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.730
to get more people
into the room here.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.500
I think we've set a record
for how many we've been able

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.680
to squish into this space.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.720
It's over 40 at this point.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.370
So we have a few minutes
for questions.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.520
I'm going to have to be
an evil time master today.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.110
We have something else happening
in this room just a minute

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.470
or two after 1:00 o'clock.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.200
So I see about 14 minutes
until 1:00 o'clock.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.500

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.200
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: So questions?

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.370
&gt;&gt; I guess just when you were
combining the novel <i>Ragtime</i>

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.720
with the real Houdini things, I
wasn't a hundred percent clear --

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.200
did Houdini in real life
actually say he had this warning

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.500
or was that --

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.800
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: No.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.100
&gt;&gt; -- in the novel?

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.400
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: It's
completely fictional.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.700
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.000
I did that on purpose because
it just kind of creates --

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.720
he wasn't hanging upside
down over Midtown.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.300
He did that a lot, you know,
all over the world he did that.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.600
But yeah.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.210
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] there were
other dukes in the world.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.510
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Sorry?

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.900
&gt;&gt; There were hundreds of dukes.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.480
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: There were
other archdukes, right,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.780
there were other heirs around.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.280
But he was the heir, right?

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.580
He was --

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.160
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: And for questions,
I'll just ask all of you to speak

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.710
up so that this gets
into the webcast

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:17.270
that will come in a few months.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:21.730
&gt;&gt; Another French historian,
Mason, before you wrote this,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.760
said that memory studies
in his [inaudible]

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.090
that history could
no longer be taught

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:30.050
to the current American generation
because they've lost the plot.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.380
They don't understand it.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:39.420
And the only way to penetrate
is shifting to memories.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.720
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Well, yeah.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.880
In another piece that I've
written -- it's actually a podcast,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.430
so I can give you the website for
that through Oxford University,

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.690
the first World War I series
-- I kind of argue that.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.160
I say the sandwich story's
completely ridiculous.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.460
You need the history.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.760
Students need the history.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.670
But because of the sandwich story,
the students remember the history.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:01.260
And that's relevant.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.720
And I say in the webcast I feel
sort of heretical saying this

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.530
as a historian, as an
academic historian,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.120
but nonetheless I think that does.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.420
But when my students,
when I tell them, "Oh, no,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.440
that's completely fictional,"
they're shocked.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.260
And I said, "It just so
happens that you've got the guy

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.850
for your professor this
semester who, you know,

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.730
did this webcast on
this very issue."

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.390
So it's kind of ironic.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:24.690
Yeah.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:28.860
&gt;&gt; I was thinking about your point

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.460
about the memory studies
being subjective.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.270
And sometimes it's
actually objective as well

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:38.050 position:56%
because when we write history about
memory, we're trying to be objective

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.400
about what people's real
memories are, right?

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.700
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Absolutely, yeah.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.000
&gt;&gt; Get as much as we can.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.300
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: It's a good point.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.600
&gt;&gt; Still being objective
when we're studying memories.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.900
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Yeah.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.200
&gt;&gt; And also, studying
subjective memory has gone

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.450
on way before thinking about the
memories of kings or, you know,

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.750
like [inaudible] have
always been [inaudible].

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.050
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Yeah, thank you.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.320
Yeah, that's a great point, yeah.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.620
Wendy?

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.210
&gt;&gt; I'd like to follow up on that
point about memory being objective

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.190
as well, mainly because
you have these memories,

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.850
but you're still trying
to make sense of them

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.330
in a way that's intelligible.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:10.630
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Mm-hmm.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:14.390 position:56%
I guess you could say I'm using
memory as a catch-all term in a way.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:18.490 position:56%
I'm taking all these various
examples from literature, from film,

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:22.910
from monuments, things like this,
and grouping them all as memory.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.630
And I'm studying them objectively
as a historian for meaning.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.280
Like, you know, first victims

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.990
of the First World War,
something like that.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.480
Right? And yet, in this paper,

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.690
I'm also incorporating what is
considered academic histories

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:39.650
and showing the ways in which
some of these mnemonic sayings,

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.750
and phrases, and ideas like that
the assassination was random have

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.430
filtered into history writing.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:49.090
So I'm not so much
scorning history as pointing

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.490
out that history itself
has subjectivities built

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:52.810
into it, I guess you can say.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.850
That's a great point, thank you.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.170
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] you
mentioned Fitzgerald,

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.620
how about Ernest Hemingway?

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:01.920
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Earnest Hemingway?

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.070
Does he have something on
the Sarajevo assassination?

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.110
&gt;&gt; He has writing on World War I.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.410
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Yes, yes.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:14.390
He has his famous -- yeah.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.730
No, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is not
-- I'll call it -- right, right.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.680
<i>Farewell to Arms</i>.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.600
<i>Farewell to Arms</i> is
his novel on World War I,

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.780
but I don't think it mentions
the Sarajevo assassination.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.370
If I'm wrong, I would love -- you
know, you bring up a good point,

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:30.000
actually, because how do you find
sources for a project like this?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.840
I mean, I hadn't read F. Scott
Fitzgerald's short story before.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.170
So first of all, if you don't have
an Internet, you're really hurting.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.140 position:56%
So this project would have been much
harder when I was a grad student

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.390
and the Internet didn't
exist, right?

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:47.430
Secondly, you meet people
who have references for you.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.240
I make a reference in
something else I've written

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.220
to a philosopher, John Searle.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.240
I happened to meet a
philosophy student in a gym

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.690
in Belgrade and he said, "Oh, yeah.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.370
John Searle uses the assassination

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.690
to illustrate something
about intentionalism."

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.800
So these are the ways in
which I discover things.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.970
And people at talks
often point out things.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:11.280 position:56%
There's a famous Nobel Prize-winning
Iceland writer, Halldor Laxness --

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.770
maybe some of you have
heard of him --

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.440
who references the Sarajevo
assassination in a funny way

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.090
because the World War I is
nothing but good for Iceland.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.490
I mean, commerce really
picks up, trade.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:23.970
This is true of US as well.

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:27.640
Until we actually get in
it, we profit tremendously.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.140
So yeah. But I have
to look on Hemingway.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.390
I'll Google "Hemingway Sarajevo,"
see if anything comes up.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:34.690
Yeah.

[ Inaudible ]

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.290
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Okay.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.590
Yes?

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.290
&gt;&gt; Was the decision by
the government to get rid

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.130
of those footsteps [inaudible]?

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.430
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Great question.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:48.060
So what happened was the
footsteps were created

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.870
by Socialist Yugoslavia after 1945.

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:54.520
They were put in the pavement in
1953 and the museum was created.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.360
In fact, Eleanor Roosevelt visited
the museum that summer and writes

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.530
about it in one of
her daily articles.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:07.260
And in 1992 when the war
began, memory also divided.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:12.530
So under Socialist Yugoslavia,
you had fraternity, you know,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.260
the brotherhood -- unity and
brotherhood, right, jedinstvo --

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.520
why am I suddenly forgetting
the phrase?

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.820
Help me out here.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.620
Bratstvo i jedinstvo, right,
brotherhood and unity.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.920
What?

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.220

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.520

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.820
Thank you.

Bratstvo i jedinstvo unity.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.420
And then war began in 1992.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.920
And all of a sudden the Bosnian
Muslims and Croats decided no,

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.270
the assassin was no great
hero because we were part

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:39.790
of Austria-Hungary back then,
and that was a great empire.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.550
We were already in Europe, okay?

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:47.050
And he only is a hero today
for Serbs and Bosnian Serbs.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.240
So we don't know what
happened to the footsteps.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.540
There are various stories.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.530
It seems they were torn out
of the pavement at some point

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:56.340
and then they disappeared.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.570
After the war, there
was an effort to --

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:01.870
there were many different ideas

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.020
as to what we should
do with the site now.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.350
One was to put the footprints back
because they don't necessarily have

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.490
to be worshipful in meaning, right?

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:11.090
They can just exist there.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:15.710
And also have the huge monument
to Franz Ferdinand's wife

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:18.340
that was constructed by
the Austrians and dedicated

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.180
on June 28th, 1917 in
the middle of the war,

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.470
a year before Austria's
going to collapse.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.190
Okay? And to put both of those --

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:31.690
and a part of that huge
memorial is actually

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:35.830
in the Sarajevo Art
Museum, you can go see it.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.900
And that never happened.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.510
But they did recast the footprints,
but they were never put back in.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:45.030
And today there's a museum of
the Austro-Hungarian period.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.740
And there's a plaque.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.710
And the plaque could also be
discussed in terms of memory.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.550
It basically says on
this place this happened.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:57.540
But it's a memory device
telling you the history,

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.600
directly on this place
Gavrilo Princip shot

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.250
and killed the Archduke
Franz Ferdinand and his wife.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:03.550
That's all it says.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:08.090
And interestingly, rather than
being in Latin Serbo-Croatian

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:12.440
and Cyrillic Serbo-Croatian,
it's in English

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.500 position:56%
and Serbo-Croatian in Latin letters.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.040
So it's tourist-oriented.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.520
&gt;&gt; And that museum is gone?

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.010
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: No, it's
a new museum called --

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.510 position:56%
the worshipful Princip part is gone.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:28.850
In my estimation and in an
article I've written on the memory

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:30.150
in the former Yugoslavia --

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.050
in Yugoslavia and the
former Yugoslavia,

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:35.090
I argue that it has now
gone in the other direction

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.730
because there is a massive --

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.200
and inside when it was the
Princip Museum, there were busts

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.450
of Princip and he was glorified.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:46.600
Now there's a huge, massive,
taller than a person statues

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.010
of Franz Ferdinand and his
wife in wax as they're coming

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.450
out of the city hall
into the sunlight

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:54.590
of their last living moments.

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.210
So I think you can interpret that.

00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:02.600
And there's a beautiful portrait
of the pair and things like that.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.440
So yeah.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.190
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Anyone,
last question?

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:14.850
I will just add one thing
before we thank Paul.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:19.870
Our specialist for the South
Slavic countries is Angela Cannon.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.630
Angela, could you stand
just for a second

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:25.130
so we can all see your
sunbeam of a face?

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:29.320
And, Angela, do you have
any cards with you today?

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:35.010 position:56%
Okay. Yeah, we do have really
incredible South Slavic collections,

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:37.500 position:56%
and Angela is our curator for those.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.380
If you have questions about the
collections, you want to get

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:46.600
in touch with her later or
now, do get her card from her.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.340
Well, help me thank Paul again.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.640
This was just incredible.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.940
Thank you, Paul.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.740
&gt;&gt; Paul Miller: Thanks for coming.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.850
[ Applause ]

00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:00.490
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
