00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.970
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Welcome everybody.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.490
Thank you so much for coming today.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.800
It's great to see you all.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.240
I see so many familiar faces,
but welcome to all of you.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.690
I'm Thea Austen, the
public events coordinator

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.880
for the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.690
and on behalf of our entire
staff, I want to welcome you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.850
to this first concert in
the 2016 Homegrown Music

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.760
of America concert series.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.200
This is a little unusual
because these folks are actually

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.290
from the republic of Georgia,
but we welcome them in our hearts

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.250
as if they are our own people.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:59.840
This concert series 2016 is in the
year, the 40th anniversary year

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.230
of the creation of the
America Folklife Center,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.720 position:56%
that's what I wanted to say, and we
have a number of concerts, lectures,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.770
and other special events planned
to celebrate the 40th anniversary.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.070
So stay tuned.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.790
Ooh, so many people coming in.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.480
Well there are a few empty
seats, so please come in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.050
and you'll see little spots.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.380
It's so great to see you all.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.130
This is a very special concert,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.130
and I'm sure you're
really going to enjoy it.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.560
I want to also thank
the Library's African

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.920
and Middle East division
for cosponsoring this.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.240
Mary-Jane Deeb, the
chief of the division,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.960
in particular for cosponsoring, and
Lee Avdoyan, who is our Armenian

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.200
and Georgian specialist, who
is here, I saw him earlier.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.730
I know he's here somewhere.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.030
Oh, there you are.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.990
So anyway, thanks to Ahmed
for cosponsoring this concert.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.310
Our performance today is going to
be recorded for the collections

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.730
and is going to be webcast.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.680
You'll be able to see it online
when it's edited and put up online.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.850
It'll be there in perpetuity and
accessible anywhere in the globe

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.390
where you have an internet
connection.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.140
So this is a good time
to so this is a good time

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.920
to silence your cell
phones or anything else

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.250
that makes a beeping noise

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.110
or else you will too be
archived in perpetuity.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.770 position:56%
We have some guests from the Embassy

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.960
of Georgia coming although I
don't think they're here yet,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.950
so we will welcome
them when they come.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.680
Today, we have a performance
of traditional polyphony

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.070
from the Republic of Georgia,
presented by the Anchiskhati Choir,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.820
one of the world's
leading exponents,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.730
if not the leading exponent of the
Georgian polyphonic choral music.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.760
To tell you more about them, I'm
going to introduce Dr. John Graham.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.050
John currently lectures in the
music department at Yale University

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.710
as a research fellow attached to
the Yale Institute of Sacred Music

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.400
where he also directs
a Georgian chant choir.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.900
His PhD at Princeton University,
"The Transmission and Transcription

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.290
of Georgian Liturgical Music"
encompassed a comprehensive

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.320
investigation of the
written and audio sources

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.130
for liturgical chant tradition
of the Georgian Orthodox Church,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.040
both medieval and modern,
which has been difficult

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.580
at times, as you will find out.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.510
Anyway, please welcome John Graham.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.650
[ Applause ]

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.340
&gt;&gt; John A. Graham: Good
afternoon, thank you everybody

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.560
for coming out at your lunch break.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.850
We have a wonderful
performance in store,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.820
and I will just give some
prefatory remarks today,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.910
and then I will also introduce
various elements of the program

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.640
in between some of the selections.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.240
To begin with, as you
can see in the program,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.410
the Anchiskhati Church Choir is
very important in the revival

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.380
of traditional repertories and also
performance practice in Georgia.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.680
These two are separate.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.020 position:56%
For the liturgical tradition, which
was banned through the Soviet period

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.630
from 1921 until 1990,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.810
the Anchiskhati Choir
has been instrumental

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.310
in recovering this traditional
repertory from archival sources.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.550
These sources are transcriptions
that were written

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.900
in European notation in the
1880's and 1890's and survived

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.110
in the archives but were rarely
studied and were not published.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.570
So the Anchiskhati Choir learned of
these archives, transcribed them,

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.140
began singing them in
the Anchiskhati church,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.330
which is the oldest basilica in
Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.690
and began publishing chant
books starting in 2000

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.560
as well as CD recordings.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.310
And from these books and
recordings a whole generation

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.310
of chanters have learned this
ancient medieval repertory

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.890
that was passed through oral
transmission for centuries.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.440 position:56%
So these gentlemen that will be here

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.300
on stage are really considered
the teachers of my generation

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.790
of chanters in Georgia of
which there are hundreds,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.120
perhaps thousands.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.430
So it's really an honor and a
privilege to have them here today.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.920
Now in the Soviet period,
sacred chant was sung,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.170
but it was mostly a
composed repertory.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.890
Composers composed simple-style
harmonies to basic melodies

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.270
on the Georgian Orthodox
liturgical texts,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.650
and they also performed this
music in a European choral style,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.150
so this was well blended
voices, mixed gender choirs,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.510
a large vocal range, etc., which
is quite different than the way

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.090
that traditional performance was
actually performed, both folk music

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.900
and liturgical music in
the pre-Soviet period.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.070
So one thing that the Anchiskhati
Choir has done in addition

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.830
to reviving this traditional
repertory,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.130
is to go back to the
oldest audio recordings

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.450 position:56%
and to closely examine the ways that
the singers perform their music.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.380 position:56%
And it turns out that instead of
large choirs, they had small choirs.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.420
Instead of multiple people
singing each voice part,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.060
they would have a soloist singing
the top voice and the middle voice

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.940
with perhaps a group
singing the lowest

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.700
of the three-part vocal tradition.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.570
And the reason that
they had soloists is

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.550
so that the upper two voice
parts could improvise,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.230
because it's an oral traditional,
and like many oral traditions

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.530
around the world, there's this
element of variation technique

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.010
and improvisation,
which is fundamental

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.590
to the performance of the music.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.020
And this is where liturgical
music intersects with folk music.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.100
The folk repertory is
largely improvised.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:49.490
Often there are texted
verses contrasted by choruses

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.180
of nonsense syllables, or what we
call vocables, and it's precisely

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.140
on the vocables that you hear
improvisation, and we're going

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.370
to hear those elements
today in the program sung

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.100
by the Anchiskhati Choir.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.360
So for their traditional
performance practice,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.010
they have soloists singing
the upper voice parts

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.890
so that they can improvise.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.000
They sing in more of a natural
voice, a natural timbre, let's say,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.540
that doesn't or tries to avoid any
influences from choral technique

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.250
that we associate with the great
Russian choral schools that came

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.890
into Georgia in the 19th Century--

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.810
what we call generally a Bel canto
style or European choral style.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.580 position:56%
So what you'll hear today is more of
a bright kind of earthy folk style

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.220
of singing both in the folk
music and the liturgical music,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:49.120 position:56%
and this style has been revived from
the old recordings and goes together

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.120
with the traditional repertory.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.530
So those are just some
teasers for you to listen

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.830
for as we get going
with the performance.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.350
Okay, so now a word
about where is Georgia.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.870
I know this is a very educated
audience here in the Library

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.650
of Congress, but still, I
include it just to mention

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.790
that we're not talking
about the state of Georgia.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.970
Neither are we talking
about Gregorian chant.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.530
So please don't ask me about
Gregorian chant after the show.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.440
This is Georgian chant of the
Orthodox rite, and as you can see

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.470
on this little map that I've
included over on the screen

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.480
on the right, Georgia is a
very mountainous country.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.800
The Caucasus mountain range,
which stretches from the Black Sea

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.060
to the Caspian Sea is the northern
geographical border of Georgia

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.000
and historically separated
Georgia culturally and politically

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.460
from the steppes to the north.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.350
As well, if you look to the south,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.320
the eastern Anatolian plateau is
also a massive mountain range.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.600
And these mountains are higher
than the Rockies and Alps,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.560
so it's a significant
geographical barrier.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.840
And within these mountains there
are many, many different cultures.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.500
Just in Dagestan alone I believe
there are 29 mutually distinct

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.970
languages and culture groups.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.150
The Persians called this area
the mountain of languages,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.880
and within Georgia there are four
languages that are closely related

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.440
but mutually unintelligible.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.170
Think of French to
Italian to Spanish.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.150
So there are four languages
like that

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.140
in a group called the
Kartvelian language group,

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.920
and these are not Indo-European,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.240
and they have no analogue
elsewhere in the world.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.280
Georgian culture goes
back 5000 years.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.420
They say that wine was
invented in Georgia,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.310
and indeed they found grape pips
and buried amphoras in Georgia

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.040
and in the Armenian region,
which is a source of great pride

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.040 position:56%
for all Georgians, and in fact
today it's still a living tradition.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.300
Many villagers, many people take
pride in making their own wine

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.640
in their own buried
amphoras in their backyards.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.330
So there's a great viniculture
tradition, which goes hand in hand

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:56.980
with singing as we all know,
so that's why I mentioned it.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.920
A political map from
the mid-20th Century.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.920 position:56%
You can see that Georgia is bordered
to the south by Turkey, Armenia

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.700
and Azerbaijan, to the north by the
various North Caucasian Republics

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.150
such as Chechnya, Ingushetia,
Kabardino, Balkaria

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:18.260
and various other states that are
now part of the Russian federation.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.900
When we talk about music, we talk
about 12 regions within Georgia

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.590
that have their own distinct
dialects, cuisine, clothing,

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.910
and musical styles, and these
musical styles have something

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.430
in common, which is that they
are mostly all three-part harmony

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.220
folk-singing traditions.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.240
There are folk instruments, but
they generally accompany a singing

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.940
tradition, which is
almost always polyphonic,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.790
and that distinguishes Georgian
folk music from other music systems

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.860
in the area, which are
mostly monophonic; that is,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.130
highly ornamented solo lines that
are played on instruments or sung

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.110
by vocalists, but the
Georgian music is polyphonic,

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.510
so this is a big difference.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.980
Now within Georgia we have as
I mentioned the 12 regions,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.600
and I've designed the program
today such that we'll be starting

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.640
in East Georgia, and we'll be
hearing a chant or two, two chants,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.950
and then a folk song from East
Georgia, and what I'd ask you

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:21.350
to listen to are the ways in which
the harmony of the folk music

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.060
and chant resemble one
another in this region.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.930
And then as we move into
central Georgia and then finally

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.700
to West Georgia you'll hear how
the harmony of both the folk

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.320
and sacred music influence
one another.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.500 position:56%
So it's most scholars opinion that
Greek monophonic chant melodies came

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.250
into Georgia maybe as
early as the fourth century

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.690
when Georgia converted
to Christianity,

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.910
but it's through a process
of vernacularization

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.570
of both the biblical
text and the way

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.760
that those biblical texts were
performed in the ritual services

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.750
that probably very early on these
monophonic melodies imported

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:02.210
from Jerusalem and Antioch would
have been sung in polyphony.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.550
So the dating of when
this polyphony,

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.430
or polyphonic vernacularization,
occurred is under debate.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.880 position:56%
Some scholars say it was as early as
the fourth, fifth, sixth centuries.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.090
Other scholars say there's no
evidence, maybe it happened

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.310
in the middle ages, the 10th, 11th
centuries, but you get the idea.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:24.710
This is a very old, polyphonic
performance of liturgical melodies,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:30.060
which is unique to this
eastern segment of Christianity.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.790
Of course Russian polyphony
exists but it occurs much later.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.790
We'll have a Question and Answer
session afterwards, so I'm putting

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.080
out a lot of teasers, and
I know there will be a lot

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.040 position:56%
of questions having to do with this.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.010
So we'll start with East Georgia,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.810
which is on the map
the area indicated

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.380
by these monasteries here...

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.680
if this doesn't work...

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.640 position:56%
but numbers four, five, and six, and
then later in the program we'll go

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.040
to the monastery, Gelati Monastery,
number three, in central Georgia,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.130
and finally to the
Shemokmedi Monastery,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.330
number one, on the Black Sea Coast.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.490
So, at this point, let's welcome
the ensemble to the stage,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.510
and here's some Georgian polyphony.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:32.510

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.550
So now we'll move to Central
Georgia, and I'll just say quickly

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.300
that in East Georgia, what we just
heard, you hear drone polyphony.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.650
You hear this strong bass
drone in the lowest voice part.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.210
As we move across the Central
Georgian mountains into the west,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.510
you don't hear that anymore.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.980
So in this next little section,
you'll hear more improvisation

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.650
within the bass voice, but what
we'll lose a little bit is the

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.470
ornamentation in the upper voices.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.340
In East Georgia you have all these
beautiful little elaborations

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.600
and ornamentations
in the solo parts,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.050
and in West Georgia
you have less of that.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.280
It's a little more specific
to the pitch choices,

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.060
but you have more improvisation

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.710
in all three voices,
not just the upper two.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.250
So now to Central Georgia,
the Gelati Monastery School

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.510
and a folk song from Samegrelo,
which is a nearby region.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.500
Before we move to West Georgia,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.380
I'll just say a quick
note about the instrument.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.410
This is the chonguri, a four-string
lute that we find in West Georgia,

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.380
all the West Georgian regions,
that has one fixed string.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.150
So it's like a banjo.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.360
The actual strumming is on three
strings, but it's unfretted,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.870
which allows the instrument

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.840
to accommodate the unique
Georgian intonation system,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.890
which we'll be talking about a
little bit later in the Q and A.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.450
So now as we move to far Western
Georgia, these are the hills

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.130
of Guria and Achara on
the Black Sea coast.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.640
This area of the country was
sometimes under Ottoman control

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.990
for the last 400 years,
sometimes under Georgian control.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:41.410
First we'll hear the Kriste
Aghdga, Christ is Risen.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.880
We'll hear three versions
as recorded in 1966,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.930
by the last master chanter,
Artem Erkomaishvili.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.510
So you'll hear the ways that he
plays with the model melodies,

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.220
the ways that he improvises
and varies his own melody.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.240
And what I will say that
distinguishes this harmony

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.980
from the harmony that we've
been listening to so far is

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.160
that they love the dissonances in
the Shemokmedi Monastery region.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.260 position:56%
So you'll hear a lot of close second
intervals in the upper voices,

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.700
and he also loves wide
open fifth chords,

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.060
so the upper voices will
have an interval of a fifth

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.070
with another fifth below
it, what we call a ninth.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.050
So you'll hear a lot of
this fifth-ninth harmony,

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:27.240
sometimes in parallel,
which is similar to tenth

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.890
and eleventh century polyphony
as it started in Europe,

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:35.210
but it quickly developed away, and
as we know from music theory 101,

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:38.580
no parallel fifths or octaves
are allowed in western music.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.000
Well not in Georgia.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.010
In Georgia they kept the parallel
fifths, octaves, and even ninths.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:47.480
So now we're in far Western
Georgia, and after this,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.300
in lieu of an intermission
as written in the program,

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.810
we will have a Question
and Answer session,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.040
which will include the
choir singing a single chant

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.240
from all three schools,
a single text

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.280
so that you can hear how the
three schools fit together

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.470
under the banner of one text.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.270

the concept of the model melodies,

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.240
which I talked about a little bit
in the introduction and the ways

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.530
that these model melodies are
harmonized in all three regions.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.550
So, again, I put up the map here.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:18.510
We're going to start with singing
in the East Georgian version.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:25.120
[ Foreign Language ]

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.030
Let's see, which do we
have in the program first?

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.050
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.350
We have East Georgian.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.380
Yes, so we're going to start
with the East Georgian version

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.620
of this chant, which is
the Troparion to St. Nino,

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.920
Enlightener of Georgians,

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.210
the one that brought
Christianity in the fourth century.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.900
This is a chant that is sung
within the Orthodox rite

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:53.980
on feast days associated with
St. Nino, usually January 27.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.490
So here are the model melodies
I put up on the screen.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.280
I know they're small on
this screen, but basically,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.230
you see what the first voice,

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:06.460
the top voice that we
hear, will be singing.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.820
You see, there are six
phrases, and then the way

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.670
that these model melodies are
harmonized is what changes quite

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.530
drastically between
the three regions,

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.300
which I think we've
already demonstrated

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.890
in this program how
difficult the harmony can be

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.690
between the three regions.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:27.020
Within tone four, within the genre
of Troparia assigned to tone four,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.120
there are in fact more
model melodies

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.140
that could be used hypothetically.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:37.340
I did a study of 17 different
Troparia assigned to tone four

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.910
and came up with a larger
segment of model melodies,

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.660
which I won't bore you
with, but essentially

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.090
when you have these 17
different texts here,

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:48.380
you can align the model
melodies in different orders

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.860
so you can pick and choose.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.970
You can start with model melody
one, go to two, go to three,

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.150
or you can start with one and
jump to three, go to four,

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.750
and come back to two, etc.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:01.500
So this is the way the Eight Mode
system works as it's been inherited

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.460
through oral transmission
in Georgia.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:07.990
And this is of interest for
liturgical scholars and folks

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:11.730
that study chant transmission,
the Eight Mode system,

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:18.260 position:56%
so it manifested itself in different
ways in the various centers

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:23.600
of Christianity, whether in Milan,
Rome, Spain, St. Gall, Jerusalem,

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:30.990
the various Eastern churches such
as Ethiopia, Coptic Egypt, etc. So,

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.520
without more introduction,

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:38.210
let's hear the choir sing the
three versions of this chant

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.170
that we've inherited
through oral transmission,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.730
and you can see their
details in the program.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.840
The first version was inherited

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.170
through the Karbelashvili master
chanter family in East Georgia.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:54.870
It was transcribed by one member
named Vasili and published in 1898.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:59.600
The second version was transcribed
in 1885 from three master chanters

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.810
in the Gelati Monastery
region, and the final version

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:07.010
that we'll hear was
again recorded in 1966

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:10.500
by that last master
chanter, Artem Erkomaishvili.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.860
And the idea here is to hear
how the melody is similar,

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.510 position:56%
but the harmonies are different, and
I think that will be quite obvious.

Let me take this opportunity to
introduce the members of the choir.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.640
Here on your left is
David Shugliashvili.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.510
He has a--

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:32.060
[ Applause ]

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.700
He has a doctorate in musicology.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.990
He teaches at the Tbilisi
Conservatory.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.890
His dissertation was on model
melodies, which is why I wanted

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.010
to bring this up, because
he is the world expert

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:43.890
on this particular aspect
of the Eight Mode system,

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.690
so if there are questions of
that, I'll ask him to answer.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:50.320
And he also is a founding
member of the Anchiskhati Choir,

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.810
teaches in the chant school
of the Georgian Patriarchate

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:58.290
as do all the members here, and
works for the Patriarchate Library

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.810
as the head of division of
the audio/visual materials

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:04.090
for the library system, so
he's familiar with libraries.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.510
Here we have Zaal Tsereteli--

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:13.050
[ Applause ]

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.200
Zaza is also a founding
member of the choir in 1988.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.180
Actually he joined one
year later in 1989.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:25.230
He is trained as a mathematician,
he works as a computer programmer,

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:29.440
and he supplied a mathematical
model that he developed himself

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.430
for studying the otherwise
undeciphered medieval neume system.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.000
That is, the graphic symbols

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.540
that represent the
Georgian chant tradition

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.980
in 10th century manuscripts.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.190
In the second half of the 10th
century we have six manuscripts

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.950
with this type of neume notation

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.700
which musicologists haven't been
able to figure out, but Zaza,

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.030
with statistical models, has come
up with some good theories for how

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.840
to look at these neume groupings
and how to make sort of sense

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.800
of what they mean, so
that's some of his work.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.510
Next we have David Zatiashvili--

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:05.630
[ Applause ]

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.980
Dato [phonetic] is from East
Georgia and therefore specializes

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.070
in this East Georgian
ornamental technique,

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.210
but he has also developed
the krimanchuli yodeling

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:15.930
from West Georgia.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.750
Zaza works for the
Georgian government;

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:22.980
or Dato works for the Georgian
government, in the division

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.420
of education and helps
develop curriculum

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.180
for the national school system.

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.150
He is a lifetime educator
and also a founding member

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:30.450
of Anchiskhati Choir.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.510
And finally, Levan Veshapidze--

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:38.150
[ Applause ]

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.900
Levan trained as folklorist
in the conservatory

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.660
and continues to teach folk music.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.090
He's published several
books and CDs especially

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.280
on Acharian and Gurian folk music.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.590
As you can see, he
plays the chiboni,

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:54.730
which is the rare goatskin
bagpipe from the Achara mountains,

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:58.800
and Levan also teaches chant
and has the foremost theory

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.960
on the Georgian intonation system.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.960
He devotes lots of time to
developing chants and folk songs

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.730
that are set in the
tuning, the original tuning,

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.760
and post these videos on YouTube,
so he's a leader in the new,

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.960
sort of our generation
of scholarship

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.490
on the intonation system.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:20.140
So for these four members of
the larger Anchiskhati group,

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.940
let's welcome them once more.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:35.060
[ Applause ]

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.660
And finally, before we transition
to a Question and Answer session,

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.830
I just wanted to speak a
little bit more briefly

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.180
about this intonation
system, this tuning system,

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.290
which I think is really
interesting and something

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:47.070
that Georgian music has to offer.

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.110
And since we have these experts
here, we might as well mention it.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.410
There are various theories.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:55.320
One is that there's an
octave species as you see

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.760
on this little graphic, where
certain pitches are tuned higher

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.660
or lower, and there's conjunct
and disjunct tetra chords.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.960
Various theories map the
ancient Greek music theory

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.890
onto the Georgian scale.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:11.430
Levan and Zaza's theory is
that the octave is divided

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:17.010
by equal heptatonic steps, so 7
steps in the scale instead of 12.

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:19.830
You can see from this little
graphic that I made up.

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.560
On the left you have
equal tempered tuning.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.310
The darker shaded gray areas are
half steps, what we were familiar

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:31.330
with from guitar tuning, piano
tuning, etc. These are measured

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:32.630
by what we call cents [phonetic].

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.470
So a half step would be 100 cents,
as you see here dark shaded,

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.160
and a whole step would be
200 cents, or two half steps.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:44.090
Meanwhile Georgian intervals
are more like 160 or 170 cents,

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.870
so they're neither half steps nor
whole steps, and we can hear this

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:51.170
in all of the recordings that
we have from the master singers

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:53.930
and master chanters,
especially Artem Erkomaishvili,

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:55.470
that we've heard from today.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.100
So, I'm sorry the graphic
is a little bit small,

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.710
but if you see the darkest line,

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.850
horizontal lines, the
octaves are equal.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:07.880
The fifth below the high octave,
it's about equal in the Georgian

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.240
and the tempered tuning,
but the pitches

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.950
that really differ are
the third and the sixth,

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.070
so this sort of comes close to
what we call just intonation

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.090
or baroque intonation in Europe,

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:22.080
where you have neutral
thirds and neutral sixths.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.660 position:56%
I'm not talking microtones, not
tiny tones, these are actually wider

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.860
than a half step, and what we get
are these kind of neutral chords

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.800
that neither feel minor nor major.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.430
So with that, I'll ask
the Anchiskhati Choir

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.980
to sing one last folk song
in this intonation style,

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.470
and with that we'll sort of
close our program and open it

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:43.950
up to Q and A. Thank you.

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:45.530

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:47.030

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:53.450
Ah, yes. Okay.

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:54.750
Good idea, Zaza suggests

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:57.910
that we first hear the
scale as best we can manage.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.510
So Levan, we'll volunteer
you to sing the scale.

So this is the song Odela
[phonetic] from Imereti [phonetic],

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:32.710
and it doesn't have a text.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:35.160
It's just sung on vocables,
and as I mentioned before,

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.510
that allows for more improvisation.

sometimes sing Georgian litanies,

perform a Georgian litany.

in some ways, being a
neighbor mountain region,

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.930
but interestingly it also,

01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:42.120
Rachan harmony also resembles
Eastern Georgian harmony,

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.650
which is very curious since it's a
Western Georgian mountain region,

01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:50.360

Also the-- whenever
they start clapping,

that's usually an indication
that the young dancers will come

and dance in front of the choir.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.960

a whole genre of songs,

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.200

called rounds dance songs,

which were performed by the whole
family or the whole village,

many, many minutes usually

in an antiphonal type of setup

where there are two choirs

One has a verse, the other responds,
and they continue a round dance.

And the footwork is
often quite difficult.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:26.460
It looks simple, but it's on a
different rhythm than the singing.

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.110
I know because I taught

with melodic movement.

they'll be specifically placed

that we observe in the

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.280
that the chants end in unison.

in some theology.

So there's an 11th, 12th
century philosopher, theologian,

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:43.480
who taught at Gelati
Monastery named Ioane Petritsi.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.000
In one of his writings,
he makes this analogy

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.850
where the three voices
are like the Holy Trinity

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:55.210

so we see the analogy, Dato says,

01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:58.510
in the chant where
three voices become one.

of this, the Troparion to St. Nino

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.760
where the Apostle Andrew
is mentioned.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.060
Now we're with you.

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:27.430
And the answer is that Apostle
Andrew is said to have visited

01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:29.280
and proselytized on the
Black Sea coast in Georgia

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.620
and in fact martyred, I believe,

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:36.320
on the Black Sea coast
according to hagiography.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.340
And so St. Nino follows
in his footsteps,
