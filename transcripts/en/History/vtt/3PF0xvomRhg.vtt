00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.330
- It's the story of a real mummy
the real world thought was

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.040
fake until a 1970s
TV show inadvertently

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.830
exposed the gruesome truth.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.500
This is "Dark History."

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.170
[somber music playing]

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.170
October 4, 1911--
a gang of bandits

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.920
stop a train carrying
$400,000 in cash.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.420
They board the train, ignoring
the screams of passengers

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.710
as they frantically
search for their bounty.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920
But it's nowhere to be found.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.540
They stopped the wrong train.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.080
A posse forms to track down
the gang of thieves who

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.750
have managed to only
steal $46, a watch,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.000
and two jugs of whiskey.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.420
The gang splits up.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.580
One member, Elmer McCurdy,
starts a gunfight.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.880
He hits none of the
lawmen, but one hits

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.210
him, directly in the chest.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.210
Elmer McCurdy dies instantly.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.250
His body is taken to
the Johnson Funeral Home

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.250
in Pawhuska, Oklahoma.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.000
There is no immediate
kin to contact,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.540
so it is embalmed,
remaining preserved for when

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.250
someone comes to claim it.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.540
Surely someone will
come to claim it.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.920
But no one does.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.040
So the funeral
director improvises.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080
He dresses Elmer's body,
puts it in street clothes,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.380
props him up like
a taxidermy trophy,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.460
and leans a rifle by his side.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.290
He then charges people
$0.5 to look at it.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.080
For five long
years, Elmer's body

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.250
remains in the corner of
this Oklahoma funeral home,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.750
until one day, he's claimed.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.960
Two men requesting the
body present themselves

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.290
as Elmer's long lost brothers.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.960
The funeral director
is suspicious.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.710
But the attraction
has grown old,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
and he feels the body
deserves a decent burial.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.580
It doesn't get one.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.080
The two men, James
and Charles Patterson,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.620
bore no relation
to Elmer McCurdy.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.330
But as carnival proprietors,
they knew a good attraction

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.920
when they saw one.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.620
In the ensuing
years, Elmer's body

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.120
is featured in carnivals,
haunted houses,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.670
and wax museums.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.750
Elmer's corpse is even
used to promote films,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.000
like the 1933 movie, "Narcotic."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.500
The body's gruesome tour
goes on for 60 years,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.750
during which the real
story of Elmer McCurdy

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.460
fades into obscurity.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.250
His very real corpse comes
to be seen as nothing more

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.830
than a scary prop until 1976.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.750
By then, Elmer's body is
featured at the Pike Amusement

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.620
Zone in Long Beach, California
as part of the Laugh

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.750
in the Dark haunted attraction.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.620
His corpse now hangs by
a noose in a dark corner

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.290
of a second rate haunted
house, a bad prop

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.210
provoking a fleeting scare.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.120
That year, Pike
Amusement Zone is serving

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.210
as a shooting location for
the television program,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.120
The Six Million Dollar Man."

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.540
As the show's art director
makes small adjustments

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.380
to the scene's background, he
tries to move what he thinks

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.040
is merely a hanged man prop.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.710
But in doing so, he accidentally
tears Elmer's arm off.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.880
He tries to glue the arm back
on until he notices the bone.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.710
On April 22, 1977, Elmer is
buried in Guthrie, Oklahoma.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.540
In order to make sure his
body is never again disturbed,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.290
two feet of concrete is
poured over his coffin.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.460
Elmer McCurdy, a failed
bandit in life who saw much

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.750
more of the world in death.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.670
And for you, a cautionary tale--

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.880
the next time you find yourself
looking for some cheap thrills,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.580
you might want to
look a little closer,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.380
because sometimes, the imaginary
can be very, very real.
