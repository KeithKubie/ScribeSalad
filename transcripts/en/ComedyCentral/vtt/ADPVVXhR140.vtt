You can see the latest casualty

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:04.271
of the Donald Trump presidential
train wreck continued today

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.573
with fast food executive
Andrew Puzder

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:09.710
withdrawing his nomination
for Secretary of Labor,

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.346
leaving him free to go back
to his job being the guy

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.781
at Illuminati sex parties
who shouts "Ass to ass!"

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.417
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-Ass to ass.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.621
-Ass to ass! Ass to ass!
-HARDWICK: Yeah.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.223
-That's definitely him.
-(laughter)

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.360
-Uh, so, all the Trump...
-WIL WHEATON: I feel like

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.762
we need to acknowledge
that footballstud6969

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.330
-put that...
-Yeah.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.732
...on the Internet for-for,

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:32.833
-like, for all
of humanity to have. -Yeah...

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.034
HARDWICK: You know,
what a bummer that there were...

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.269
-DREW CAREY: I wonder where the
copies are. -Yeah, I know.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:39.373
It was a bummer that there were
already 6,968 football studs

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:40.707
-that he had to put
that lat one. -(laughter)

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.510
-Well, it's a big country.
-HARDWICK: It is. So,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.146
this Trump drama never ends.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.115
Every day, it feels like
an episode of <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.783
where you're like, "How can they
keep cramming all this drama

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.219
and treachery into such
a short amount of time?"

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.354
-(laughter)
-We just need Elizabeth Warren

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:55.622
to swoop in on a dragon,

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.759
or Justin Trudeau
to show his dick like Hodor.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.095
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-So comedi... Yeah.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.133
HEATHER ANNE CAMPBELL:
It's so...

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.734
-It's-it's... <i>wide. </i>
-HARDWICK: Yeah, it is.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.770
-It's really wide.
-HARDWICK: Yeah, it is.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.171
It's gorgeous.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.507
CAREY:
It's in... it's in Canadian.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.142
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
Oh, 100 points to Drew for that.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.743
That is one exchange rate
I can get behind.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.545
-(laughter)
-CAREY: Or in front of it.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.214
Maple syrup lube?
You got it.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.149
-(laughter) -Next up...
What do you think...?

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.618
What crisis do you think
the Trump administration

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.220
will face tomorrow?
Anyone can buzz in.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.754
Wil Wheaton.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.691
Kellyanne Conway
will deny her own existence.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.526
HARDWICK: I think
that's possible. Yeah. Points.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.361
-(laughter, applause)
-Mr. Drew Carey.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.864
They're gonna run out of feet
to shoot themselves in.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:39.333
-(laughter, applause)
-All right, great. Points.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.767
Heather Anne Campbell.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:40.868
Trump and Putin will be caught
in bed 1969-ing.
