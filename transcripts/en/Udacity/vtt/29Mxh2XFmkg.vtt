00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.150
A key aspect to connecting your genome

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.840
into populations all over the world, often

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.250
includes understanding allelic distribution. Remember, unlike a

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.820
disease that spreads laterally from person to

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.220
person, alleles are spread across generations from

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.630
parents to offspring to offspring to offspring.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.590
Of course this is an inherently slower

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460
process and it changes depending on reproductive

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.990
habits of various populations. We learned a bit about

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.470
this in lesson six, when we discussed natural selection

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.490
and genetic drift playing a role. Take this map

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.770
for the allele of lactase persistance. Now, it may be

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.800
a little hard to see here but we have

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420
an outline of Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania and some

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.890
of the Pacific islands. We also have an inset

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.340
here of Central America and South America. Now each circle

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.000
represents a snapshot currently of the prevalence of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.260
the T allele or the C allele. Remember the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.060
T allele correlates with lactase persistence. And the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.640
C allele correlates with lactase non persistence. And you

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.600
can see just looking at this map each

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.990
circle from each spot represents the prevalence of that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.900
allele in that region, in that given population. So

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.720
although allelic frequencies and distributions can change over time,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.900
we can get individual snapshots at any given moment. And

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.950
at this particular moment you can look at this map and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.900
see the regions where lactase persistence would be prevalent based

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.280
on the prevalence of the T allele. And where lactase non-persistence,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.290
would be prevalent based on the prevalence of the C

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.000
allele or the darkened region of the circle. Now selection pressures

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.380
in milk drinking populations. Really only, maybe 5,000 years ago, have

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.310
resulted in the rapid spread of the C allele throughout the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.590
world. The T allele. So if I tell

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.350
you that I am lactase persistant, which regions

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.610
of the world would you assume that I

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.100
do not share ancestry? Now there are multiple answers

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.730
to this question, so make sure you check

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.950
any and all that apply. And if you're absolutely

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.620
terrible with geography, I've actually labelled the different

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.980
regions or answers here in the map for you.
