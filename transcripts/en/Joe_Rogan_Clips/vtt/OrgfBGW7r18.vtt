00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.030
I had a thought once while I was under the influence and it was um,

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.730
a thought that one day computational powers will reach a point where they will

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:19.701
be able to take into consideration all of the objects on earth and what we know

5
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.930
about the history and vividly recreate the past through,

6
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.370
through computation to the point where you could actually know who did what when

7
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.970
people did things.
And that,
I mean,

8
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:36.150
I don't even know if this would be physical today,
certainly not be possible,

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.330
but with the exponential increase in computational power and technology and

10
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.920
innovation that one day we'll reach a point where you'll be able to watch,

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.700
you'll be able to see what happened and they'll be able to recreate what

12
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.480
happened exactly.
And that this would be something that would be,

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.790
it's impossible for us to imagine that someone would be able to do that right

14
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.624
now.
Yeah.

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.660
But that one day with technology as it gets more and more advanced and we will

16
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:07.350
reach some sort of,
uh,

17
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.920
some innovation or some sort of an invention that will allow us to go back and

18
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.430
see,
literally see what,
what happened,
how things were done.

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.620
Tech technologies is changing.

20
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.760
Our whole understanding of the past and what you're envisaging is perfectly

21
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:27.480
possible.
We will,
we will come to a time,
if the hundred years,

22
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.330
$500 less,
if we don't,
you know,

23
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.000
first destroy ourselves entirely as a civilization.

24
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.530
We will come to a time where our cleverness and our techniques will allow a much

25
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.440
wider opening up of the past then has presently happened,

26
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.960
but it is already happening.
Um,

27
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990
one of the areas of science that I go into in America before his genetics,

28
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.930
uh,
and,
and DNA,
uh,

29
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
this is an area of science that sa was not much informing archeology until about

30
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.320
the 1990s,

31
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:02.760
but since the two thousands has become very important in archeology because the

32
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:07.761
technology has been developed where ancient DNA can be extracted and tested,

33
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.850
and you can actually genotype an entire individual from DNA that may be 15,

34
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:16.110
20,000,
20,000 years old.
Um,
and this,
uh,

35
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.350
new technology of genome sequencing and DNA is another factor that is raising

36
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.700
huge question marks over the past of the Americas.

37
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:31.701
And one of the issues I go into a in this book is the presence in the Amazon

38
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.810
rainforest of a very specific,

39
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.660
clearly identifiable pattern of DNA,

40
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.460
which is only found in one other place in the world.
And that is in Australasia,

41
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.750
uh,
in Papua New Guinea and amongst Australian aborigines,

42
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:52.620
it's Australasian Dna.
Uh,
now South American,

43
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.030
not only in South America,

44
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:58.410
but in the depths of the Amazon rainforest amongst tribes who have only been

45
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.380
contacted in the last 20 or 30 years.
Uh,
and further more,

46
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.140
although skeletal remains are rare,

47
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.060
it has been found in ancient skeletal remains that are close to 11,000 years old

48
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.541
in the Amazon.

49
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:15.160
So that tells us that this DNA signal has been in the Amazon for at least 11,000

50
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.880
years.

51
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.230
The geneticists think that it came to the Amazon during the last ice age and

52
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.550
this raises a huge mystery because the peopling of the Americas is supposed to

53
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.840
have occurred from Siberia across the Bering Straits,

54
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.020
down through that ice free corridor into North America,

55
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.990
down through North America,
into South America,
into Central America,

56
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:38.770
and finally into South America.
If that was the whole story,

57
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980
then we would find this DNA signal in North America and in Central America.

58
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.080
We would not find it only in the Amazon.

59
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.300
When I talked to some of the leading geneticists about this,
but specifically,
um,

60
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.210
sq.
Professor Sk Willis live at the University of Copenhagen,

61
00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.250
there's been the lead author in a number of major studies of Ancient Dna.

62
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:04.840
And I asked him,
what do you make of this Australasia in DNA,
uh,
in,
in the Amazon?

63
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.130
And he said,
honestly,

64
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.000
we don't have a proper explanation for it at at the moment.

65
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.110
But what he did say is that the most parsimonious explanation,

66
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.400
he used that specific word,

67
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.430
the most parsimonious explanation is that a group of people during the ice age

68
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.770
crossed the Pacific Ocean and settled up and ended up in South America and

69
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.420
settled in the Amazon and brought their DNA with them.

70
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.930
That would account perfectly for the DNA data.

71
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:34.690
And when a scientist says the most parsimonious explanation,

72
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.110
what that scientist is saying is he likes that explanation that it's a simple,

73
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:43.000
direct,
clear explanation of the DNA mystery.
But then he added however,

74
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.430
it doesn't make practical sense.
And I asked him,
well,

75
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:47.110
why doesn't it make practical sense?
And he said,

76
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:52.111
because the archeologists tell me that no human population was capable of

77
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:55.270
crossing the Pacific Ocean during the Ice Age,

78
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.250
at which point it was natural for me to say,

79
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.550
do you really trust the archeologists?
And he said,
well,

80
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:04.060
in science we do trust the work of other scientists.
We don't really question it,

81
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:06.220
we don't really investigate it.
That's their side of the,

82
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.970
their side of the business.
Um,
and,
and my,

83
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
my view is that that is rather than rather than excel,

84
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.150
rather than taking this weird anomalous Australasia and DNA signal,
uh,

85
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.250
in the,
in,
in the,

86
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.270
in the heart of the Amazon as something to be explained away and there's

87
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:28.780
something to be for it to be denied,

88
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.990
that it could be connected to a voyage across the Pacific Ocean.

89
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.160
Maybe it's the first compelling evidence that voyages were taking place across

90
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.470
the Pacific Ocean during the ice age.

91
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.490
And maybe we should be opening up that whole issue for exploration.
And again,

92
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:45.580
I think I lost a lost civilization is the best answer.

93
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.430
And that near the end of the ice age when,

94
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.080
when the younger dryas cataclysm unfolds,
it's not an overnight thing.

95
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.660
It's very bad.
12,000,
800 years ago,

96
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.250
there's about 1000 hundred years of horror.

97
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.550
I don't think the civilization went down in a single day and night.

98
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.940
I think there were survivors,
I think bits of it were left.

99
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.970
I think that project was to restart civilization.

100
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.770
And I suggest very strongly that where they tried to mount that project was

101
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:17.771
amongst the hunter gatherers who coexisted in the world with them at that time.

102
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.230
We ourselves are an advanced civilization,

103
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.850
at least that's what we call ourselves and we coexist in the world with hunter

104
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.210
gatherers.
Uh,
it's not an odd idea that an advanced civilization,

105
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.750
a hunter gatherers should coexist and there is separation between us and the

106
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:33.890
Amazonian hunter gatherers.

107
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.340
There are tribes in the Amazon that are uncontacted and that we,

108
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.370
that we don't know even exist if catastrophe on the level of the younger drivers

109
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.760
were to occur today.

110
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.360
I don't think that our civilization would make it through.

111
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.480
We are the spoiled children of the earth.

112
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.410
We are just used to having everything laid on,
you know,

113
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.610
the supermarket shelves are groaning with,
with food.

114
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:05.060
We can get food delivered to our homes.
We have roofs over our head,

115
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:07.940
we have shelters,
we have coding.
Everything is taken for granted.

116
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.710
I guess you're an exception,

117
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:13.850
but very few people in modern western culture know how to survive.

118
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.190
They don't have survival skills.
They don't know how to hunt.

119
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.510
They don't know how to gather.

120
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.470
They don't know how to grow crops because they've handed that responsibility

121
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:22.161
over to others.

122
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.550
We live in a society that's highly segmented and specialized in different people

123
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:26.780
specialize in different things,

124
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:31.700
but nobody has the vast general survival skill that a hunter gatherer has.

125
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.990
So in a global cataclysm,
actually at first counter,

126
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:39.110
intuitively the people who would survive it would be the hunter gatherers and an

127
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:43.400
advanced civilization would be smart if they were survivors to seek refuge

128
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.680
amongst hunter gatherers,
uh,
to,

129
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:49.250
to make that the place where they might try to start,
restart their civilization.

130
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:54.251
And that's why I think that this Austria Lazy and DNA signal in the Amazon may

131
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:58.730
be part of the evidence for a sort of outreach effort that was being made by a

132
00:07:58.731 --> 00:07:59.630
lost civilization.

133
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:03.170
Seeing the disaster coming down on it and realizing that something needed to be

134
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:03.350
done.
