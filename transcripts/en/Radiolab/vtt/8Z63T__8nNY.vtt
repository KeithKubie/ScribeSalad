1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.760
Okay. You Ready? Yup. All right. Let's open the show today. Test, test,

2
00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:08.470
test on a sunny street corner. Okay. In New Jersey. Oh, where are we now?

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.120
We are on Washington Street, which is the main thoroughfare in Hoboken.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.530
It's a nice day in Hoboken.

5
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:17.080
People are out and about after work cause that Sangria.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.650
Where do you guys go here and we're here with a guy. His name is John Horgan.

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.150
I'm a science journalist.

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.180
He's also a teacher and John is out today with our producer Lulu Miller doing

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.540
what he often does,

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.640
which is to go up to someone who doesn't know we're doing a survey.

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.940
Only take a minute at [inaudible] and ask them this one question as the

12
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:44.170
question. Will humans ever stopped fighting wars once and for all?

13
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.203
No.

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.270
Because of greed and one upsmanship to explain.

15
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.150
John has been asking this question,

16
00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:00.350
will humans ever stop fighting wars for years? Because for him, this question,

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.620
it's not just about war. It gets at something really basic.

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.190
Do we feel we can change who we are?

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.580
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

20
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.801
<v 2>any case.</v>

21
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:14.120
The first time it popped out of his mouth who was 2003 and a friend had asked

22
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:18.890
him to give a talk at a church just a few days after the first invasion of Iraq.

23
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.980
And so here I was in this church and I can remember the mood was very somber.

24
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.160
I was determined to try to make people feel that, okay,

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.110
this is a setback, but still you've got to believe that peace is possible.

26
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:37.850
And I tried to list all the reasons

27
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.903
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.230
<v 2>and as he was making his case and getting worked up,</v>

29
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.620
you looked at the 60 or so people who were there in the audience. He said,

30
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:50.210
all right, how many of you here believe that war will end someday?

31
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.830
And I think one or two people raised their hands at a 68

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.540
<v 0>and John Thought, wait, is this really who we are?</v>

33
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.890
And so that's actually when I started reading as much as I can about all these

34
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:12.891
things and dug up some surveys from the 1980s what he found was that about 20

35
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:15.810
years ago, 80 people were asking this question,

36
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.970
do you think war will ever end taking surveys? Now,

37
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.070
granted they were not the most scientific of surveys,

38
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:25.071
but what the results seem to indicate is that we used to be optimistic back in

39
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.620
the 80s only one in three thought that war is inevitable.

40
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.880
It is a minority. Yeah. Whereas today, well,

41
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.600
humans ever stop fighting wars once and for all.

42
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.710
If you take that question to the streets of Hoboken as we did, you will find,

43
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.500
no, no, no, no, no, no.

44
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.330
Not Nine out of 10 people say, no,

45
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.030
no, no, never. No, never. No.

46
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.420
Now depressingly, the worst part is that when he asked him the next question,

47
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.650
why do you this?

48
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 3>Invariably he gets something like,</v>

49
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.350
<v 4>cause I think there a human nature's too for greed and to always want more.</v>

50
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.960
It's just human nature. A lot of people are big,

51
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:11.420
dumb animals and they're just gonna keep fighting over useless things in our

52
00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:13.400
genes. It's just the way people are.

53
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.100
And I don't think we're ever going to learn. Why do you say that?

54
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.950
I just think that it's too ingrained in our human nature, so,

55
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.023
so,

56
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.970
<v 3>so, so, so we want to challenge that last statement</v>

57
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.150
<v 4>too ingrained in our human nature. That one. Okay.</v>

58
00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:30.430
We know some things have been handed

59
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.050
<v 3>down to us from our primate ancestors. Violence. Maybe who knows.</v>

60
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.650
Question is how ingrained is that stuff? Well, yeah,

61
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.090
<v 0>I mean if you think that we have inherited something yet,</v>

62
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.830
what can we do about it? Or are we stuck? Or

63
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.730
<v 3>can we change if we make the right choices?</v>

64
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.910
So we've got for you this hour or three stories

65
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.720
<v 0>where choice, individual choice challenges, destiny, right?</v>

66
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.650
Maybe we help. Yeah,

67
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.020
I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab stick around

68
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.440
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.410
<v 0>to get things started, let's just take the question that was just in the air.</v>

70
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.680
Are we human beings violent forever and forever and forever. Amen.

71
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.680
Is that just who we are? That's a good question. It's a good question. Right?

72
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.240
And the people who usually say yes,

73
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.490
we say yes because in part because of our ancestors, we like them.

74
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.720
They're like us. That's how it goes. On the other hand, let me tell you a story.

75
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.290
I was hoping there would be another hair. Yes. Do you remember this guy? Um,

76
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.840
Robert Sapolsky on? Oh yeah, that's Robert Sapolsky.

77
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.390
We've had him on the show a couple times. He's a neuroscientist.

78
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:39.391
Spends most of the year at Stanford being a lab rat scientist doing neurobiology

79
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.480
in the lab. But in the summers, most summers, um,

80
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:44.290
I go and spend time in east Africa,

81
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.170
in the Serengeti studying wild baboons there. Why?

82
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.220
What is your, what is he working on?

83
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.490
What's his reason to suppose he's interested in studying stress?

84
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.560
The effect that stress has on the body.

85
00:04:55.561 --> 00:05:00.561
And it turns out baboons are a perfect source of data because they're always

86
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:03.510
under stress. You know,

87
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:07.260
the one thing we know about baboons and have known forever is that they fight

88
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.670
baboons constantly. Not just metaphorically,

89
00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:15.671
but literally have been the textbook example of a highly aggressive male

90
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:21.161
dominated hierarchical society because these animals hunt because they live in

91
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:24.740
these aggressive troops on the Savannah parentheses,

92
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.790
just like we humans used to invest. We evolved very similarly.

93
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.940
They have a constant baseline level of aggression,

94
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.900
which inevitably spills over into their social lives,

95
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.430
which is why he studied them.

96
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.970
So what's supposed to he does basically is he goes into the bush and he watched

97
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.370
it. Your field notes some,

98
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.950
there's a floor them there and a whole shelf is offices covered with these field

99
00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:49.550
notebooks.

100
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.420
Each one containing detailed notes of who groomed who and who's not getting

101
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:56.180
along with who and who's messing around with who in the bushes.

102
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.980
He tells the following of a particular moment in his baboons watching,

103
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.310
which completely changed his life,

104
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.730
changed how he sees the world. It happened about 30 years ago.

105
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.660
Spolsky was a young guy just out of Grad school studying his first troop, my,

106
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.350
my first baboons troop. He really loved. These were animals.

107
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:20.150
I was very connected with the most ways. It was a pretty average group. Yeah,

108
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.040
you're basic bad balloon troop.

109
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:25.220
The females were highly affiliated with each other. Um,

110
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.580
they had a very stable ranking system. The males, meanwhile,

111
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.690
the highly aggressive dumping on each other cause that's just what males do,

112
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.250
right? Oh, you silly thought.

113
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.050
Mid Eighties, a big boom in tourism in Canada,

114
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.970
wonders for the economy, lots of new lodges, lots of large expansions.

115
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.230
And there happened to be the next territory over the tourist lodge.

116
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.490
And this one particular lodge, he says he'd gotten really big really fast.

117
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:58.300
And during the time the lodge greatly expanded their garbage dump,

118
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:01.120
which means basically that they just dug a hole out behind the lodge.

119
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.750
Then each day attractor came out with the leftovers and dumped it there.

120
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.890
So what we're talking about here, if you can nasally imagine,

121
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.600
is he big steaming pile of [inaudible] trash,

122
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.850
half eaten food, baking in the sun,

123
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.910
smell wafting in the breeze from miles and miles and into the nostrils of

124
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:22.300
baboons everywhere.

125
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:26.740
So it was not long before a troop of baboons not supposed skis,

126
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:30.010
but one nearby discovered the garbage and just started feeding on it.

127
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.020
And here where there are eating leftover desserts and chicken whatevers,

128
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.510
all dump full of food must be to a Bevin like,

129
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.910
like venturing into heaven, Manna in the wilderness.

130
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.990
So this troop almost immediately shifted their entire behavior to,

131
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:53.920
they just slept in the trees above the garbage dump and instead of getting up at

132
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.080
six in the morning to start foraging, uh,

133
00:07:56.081 --> 00:08:01.000
they would waddle down around two minutes of nine and the tractor would show up

134
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:05.890
at nine o'clock and dump the food and they would have 20 minutes of sheer frenzy

135
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.810
and then they'd go back to sort of being couch potatoes.

136
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.360
And this is how it went for awhile.

137
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.450
So they're over there living off of garbage and somehow some of the males in my

138
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.290
troupe figure this out. These males think we got to get in on this.

139
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.750
We've got to go over there and take their food.

140
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.780
What emerged was each morning a bunch of males would run a kilometer or so a to

141
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:32.520
the garbage dump and fight their way.

142
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.313
<v 6>Okay.</v>

143
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.520
<v 0>Get some of the garbage. So every morning there'd be a showdown basically. Yeah.</v>

144
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.890
And they would come back with canine slashes and stuff like that,

145
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.450
but they'd also have drumsticks, cakes, hamburgers,

146
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.440
and this ritual. Suppose ski went on for years,

147
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.930
year and then a few years into it,

148
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.410
I got word that there were a couple of baboons in this garbage dump troop that

149
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.640
looked awful and something was wrong with them.

150
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.590
Some guys from the lodge had called them and said, hey,

151
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:06.960
you better get down here and look at this. And when he got there,

152
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.780
what he saw was horrible,

153
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.290
almost with rotting hands walking on their elbows,

154
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.120
just really bad. So trying to figure out what this is about,

155
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.810
get veterinarians involved and we finally figure out his tuberculosis.

156
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.080
Turns out some infected meat had been thrown in the dump and then eaten by the

157
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:25.680
baboons.

158
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.420
And this was really bad news because while tuberculosis and people is a really

159
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:31.500
slow moving disease,

160
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.720
he be kills nonhuman primates and weeks and it's a nightmare of a disease for

161
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:41.610
them. In just a short time, the garbage jump troop was completely decimated.

162
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.910
Not to mention that the tough guys and supposed skis. True.

163
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.620
The ones that had gone to the dump every morning,

164
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.880
they got it to have the same kind of rotting hands and they all die of it.

165
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.130
That must've been really kinda tragic to witness.

166
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.370
And this was not a good period for me.

167
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.773
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

168
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.120
<v 2>no, these were my animals. I had, I had grown up with these guys.</v>

169
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.020
<v 0>But you know, while Polsky was heartbroken,</v>

170
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.690
now that half of the Alpha males in his troop were dead,

171
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.140
he didn't notice some strange things started to happen.

172
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:19.710
<v 1>Mm.</v>

173
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.520
<v 0>Changes. How do they change? Well, grooming spiked grooming.</v>

174
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:28.470
So you and I sit on a branch and I take little fleas out of here for, yes. Well,

175
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.670
usually when a female grooms a a male, the males never reciprocate,

176
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.980
but suddenly they were even weirder.

177
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.580
<v 2>You saw adult male sitting in contact with each other and grooming each other.</v>

178
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.990
<v 0>You know how, how, how rare that is. B,</v>

179
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:47.991
like if I'm suddenly in the middle of round five of a heavyweight bout Mike

180
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.050
Tyson just decided to stop boxing and that's all his photo clerk comb Evander

181
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:52.950
Holyfield's hair.

182
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.580
<v 2>You'll be like that if you were a bad mood ologist it would have been less</v>

183
00:10:57.581 --> 00:11:02.581
shocking if these guys had wings or were photosynthetic or something up to then

184
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:06.970
I had seen like 30 seconds of male male grooming in the course of 15 years,

185
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.430
but at the time supposedly kind of wrote it off.

186
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.460
This was just some freak event that wasn't going to last.

187
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.510
So he actually stopped studying even after that big investment of time.

188
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.080
Scientifically they were ruined by such a non-natural event,

189
00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:23.590
removing half the study subjects as scientist.

190
00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:26.290
It became less interesting to you. That was the rationale.

191
00:11:26.291 --> 00:11:29.260
It was just too painful to go and watch these guys.

192
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.900
So I moved to the other end of the reserve

193
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.630
<v 0>about 40 miles away and started with a new troop there and for six years I would</v>

194
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:40.830
not go anywhere near this corner of the park is, I just didn't want to be there.

195
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.960
Now fast forward six years and we come to the moment.

196
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.760
That really changed things for him.

197
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:52.050
Really flipped him into a different way of thinking and it happened kind of by

198
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:53.860
accident. So about six years later,

199
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.920
I'm out there for the first time with who was soon destined to become my wife

200
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.840
and decided I wanted to kind of show her where I had grown up.

201
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.950
What part of the park you want to go to? The old haunt. Um, yeah, basically.

202
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.820
So went there and the troop was there and they were acting pretty much the same

203
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:16.780
as before. Lots of grooming, not so much fighting that isn't that nice.

204
00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:20.050
And they're still like this great remnant trooper and he's sitting there with

205
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:22.180
his wife. He just pointing out all the different baboons on.

206
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.820
There's Tiva and Arizona, I don't know whoever.

207
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.950
And then it hits him this [inaudible] whatever. Wait a second.

208
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.670
There was only one male left. We'd been there at the time of the TB outbreak.

209
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.720
Dawn, don't know. Follow this one meal. Stick with me for just one second.

210
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:43.120
And you will get the thing about male baboons,

211
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.960
first thing you to understand is around puberty, the males get a little antsy,

212
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:51.910
they get itchy, they're bored, and they just pick up and leave. So in a troop,

213
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.730
any of the adult males grew up someplace else,

214
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.140
which meant that these new guys that were coming into polsky's troop were coming

215
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:02.620
in from the outside, from the old world order Jerky,

216
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:05.620
real dog eat dog world out there. So you got to figure,

217
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:09.340
these new males are coming in with old expectations that they're going to have

218
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:11.680
to kick ass to be respected,

219
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.710
which would mean that this whole Koombaya situation should evaporate the moment

220
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:22.580
these guys show up. But it didn't

221
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.070
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

222
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.650
<v 0>it stuck. Oh my God, the new guys are learning.</v>

223
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.750
We don't do stuff like that here. And if the new guys are learning a new way,

224
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.220
well that means the old way,

225
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:40.330
the violent way isn't the only way that this,

226
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.910
this Florida

227
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.711
who was one of those moments,

228
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:48.830
it will be one of the three or four best silence moments of my life.

229
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.850
The key question was how to these guys unlearn their entire childhood culture of

230
00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:00.790
aggression, Blah, blah,

231
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.710
and somehow learned we don't do stuff like that around here. Well,

232
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.510
well what, well, how do they unlearn something that it was supposedly built in?

233
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.800
Um, well he doesn't really know exactly, oh but, but, but,

234
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:18.310
but here's suppose skis, hunch. Here's this hunch and this is really cool.

235
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:23.110
I may have to do with that precarious moment when the new guy comes in.

236
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.610
Now normally what happens in this sort of status quo is that the new guy arrives

237
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:31.000
and it's just a really bad experience for him. It's awful.

238
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.040
I mean you look at them and you just identify with like freshman year in college

239
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.100
or something, they're completely peripheral.

240
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.670
Every male who's higher ranking dumps on them. And even worse,

241
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:45.820
this freshman math boon is completely ignored by the ladies.

242
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:48.760
You just sit there and say, somebody groom him. My God,

243
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:52.460
I went to a sophomore year until somebody groom him. Come on,

244
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.860
why don't they go to them? Well, because if they did,

245
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.350
some adult male would have attacked them. Oh,

246
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.130
so the ladies hang back while he's out there biting and climbing and trying to

247
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.340
scratch his way in. What you've got here is a cycle

248
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.690
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

249
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.860
<v 0>that has existed for a long, long time. But if you make one small change,</v>

250
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:14.240
just remove the Alpha male. Take him out of the equation.

251
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:14.950
Suddenly

252
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:19.950
<v 2>the females are more relaxed and more likely to take a social gamble of reaching</v>

253
00:15:20.201 --> 00:15:21.370
out to somebody new.

254
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.820
The key thing is the females both ski thinks that it's all about timing.

255
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.970
If the females can get to the new guy early enough,

256
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.890
everything is different. It's remarkable. In your typical troop,

257
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:38.230
it's three months on the average before the first female grooms you in this true

258
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.150
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

259
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.720
<v 0>six days can out six days as a compared to three months.</v>

260
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.020
<v 9>Yeah. In a world in which from day one, as an adolescent male,</v>

261
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:51.130
you're treated better. Something about the aggressiveness melts away.

262
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.713
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

263
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.290
<v 9>The thing though is jab at a, before we get too carried away,</v>

264
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.370
we do have to ask the question just how permanent this change is.

265
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.600
As Nice as it is.

266
00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:08.770
So I explained this whole story that you've just told to a professor at Harvard

267
00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:13.300
named Richard Wrangham, him, his, he's an evolutionary biologist,

268
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.840
studies chimps particularly, so I asked him, well, okay,

269
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.250
you've heard the story about the baboons. What do you think? Yeah, no, it's,

270
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:25.030
it's a nice example of the potential for some change.

271
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.520
Clearly we should put boundaries on it. You know,

272
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.780
lots of baboons had been started across Africa and this sort of example has

273
00:16:31.781 --> 00:16:34.300
never been found in a natural context.

274
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.610
But I think these guys, wild baboons, they just happened upon a a garbage dump.

275
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:39.911
Yeah.

276
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:44.110
It's just not a very natural context to have humans provide food that leads to

277
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.310
several males dying.

278
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.880
But at that means that I could imagine going on a helicopter all over Africa

279
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:52.940
shooting all the Alpha males and then giving all the ladies a chance to um,

280
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.100
create a different baboon culture and meet at what I guess I'm wondering is do

281
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:01.690
you think an absurd situation like that that the baboons are,

282
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:03.730
he might change its essential nature?

283
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.950
I don't think it'll change its essential nature.

284
00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:10.951
I can see that there can be a cultural influence that may last a little bit of

285
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.003
time,

286
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.810
but the larger influence clearly is the set of,

287
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.870
of genes that produce a particular kind of brain of a boon is basically a baboon

288
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:24.460
until you get some kind of genetic change.

289
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.140
And that is something that supposedly has not seen though. So professor, yeah.

290
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.780
<v 0>Once a genetic change to make sure that this is really real permanent and yeah,</v>

291
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.290
but it's, but here's the thing.

292
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.730
I don't know if this constitutes a genetic change, but it has been 20 years.

293
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.010
Yes. 20 years. And suppose skis,

294
00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:46.090
original baboons troop is still operating in this peaceful mode,

295
00:17:46.091 --> 00:17:48.550
even though dozens of new males have come and gone at this point.

296
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:54.350
And the idea that something that was thought to be so unchangeable could change

297
00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.780
and change quickly and then stay changed as a result of something so airy and

298
00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:05.821
undefinable is culture will that has caused Robert Spolsky dare I say it to

299
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.800
hope. Absolutely. In, it's not something that I do by, by nature.

300
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.710
Not a hopeful guy by nature. But no, not at all. In fact,

301
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.240
this story got him so hopeful.

302
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.350
He decided to send it to Foreign Affairs magazine,

303
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.350
which is a magazine read by a lot of politicians. Yeah. Um,

304
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.300
and they went forward and so we had to ask him after it was published.

305
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.520
Did anyone write you back? Um,

306
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.630
no. Basically not. I basically heard nothing from anyone. No.

307
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.600
From anyone. Yes. Big Yawning. Silence. I, I,

308
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.900
I'm sure George Bush and Cheney read it each evening and tremble at its

309
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.960
implications. But no, basically, as far as I can tell,

310
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:56.910
it was a huge waste of time for me to write it. Ah, well when you read it,

311
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:03.820
yeah. Thanks. My Mother didn't even [inaudible] radio.

312
00:19:03.821 --> 00:19:04.900
That will continue in a moment.
