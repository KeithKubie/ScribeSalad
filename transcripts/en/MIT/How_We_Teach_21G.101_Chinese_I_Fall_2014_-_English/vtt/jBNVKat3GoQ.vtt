HAOHSIANG LIAO: Here
at MIT, we usually

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.680
require students to prepare
for a one hour class

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.239
for about an hour and a half.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.725
So that's the time
that we expect students

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:23.820
to give to this course,
because it's a 12 unit course,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.800
so that's a pretty
reasonable time expected.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.650
And students, they
can usually do it.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.880
But how can students, then,
make the best out of those 90

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.790
minutes is a totally
different field,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.250
that so far we don't have
enough resources to know

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.660
what do they exactly do
during these 90 minutes.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.950
Because too often,
students would

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.070
say that I followed every
procedure that you recommended,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.860
but I feel the result is
not that satisfactory.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.700
What am I supposed to do more?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.120
And in this case, we usually
provide individualizations.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.910
So we have the students come
into our office and tell them,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.280
show me how you prepare
for class, and observe.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.500
So I give you 10 minutes.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.570
So you do your preparations
here in my office,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.920
and I observe, and based
on those 10 to 15 minutes

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.020
students, I give
you my feedback.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.120
What I observe is A, you spend
too much on this and this,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.810
and you are too silent.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.030
You cannot be too silent
when you prepare for classes,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.350
because in class it's
about production.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.800
Productions are very
loud, so this kind

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.220
of loudness or the loud
part should reflected

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.350
from your preparation.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.740
And from the 10
minutes or 15 minutes,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.850
you're silent for 12 minutes,
which is not the case in class.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.480
Whenever student is say well, I
do this, this, this, and this,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.320
you really don't know how much
you can trust them in that way.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.050
So the best way to check is
to have them here and show you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.480
how they prepare for the class.
