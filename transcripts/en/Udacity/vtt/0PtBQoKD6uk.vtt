00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:02.340
Okay, I think we're ready to really test your

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.630
knowledge of what we learned in this lesson. There are

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.870
a lot of really awesome concepts that we've learned really

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.155
in all the lessons up to this point. And we

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:13.773
can start building an entire framework around how to understand

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:18.710
particular traits. Let's use an example that combines the concepts

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.080
of mutation selection and allelic frequency. The CCR5 gene is

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.940
located on human chromosome three and it produces a protein,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.520
the CCR5 protein, that you can see here

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.012
in green. And it resides on the surface of

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:35.435
T-cells. T-cells are immune cells that fight infection. Now,

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.080
although T-cells do a pretty good job at fighting

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.000
infection, in fact they do an amazing job really.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.190
There's a virus out there that can really take

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.810
them out. It's called HIV, or the Human Immuno-deficiency

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.990
virus. You might have heard of it before. The

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.830
HIV virus binds really well to this protein called CCR5. And when it does,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.560
the whole complex gets internalized. And this is how HIV gets inside T-cells. It

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.410
hijacks this protein and uses it to get inside the T-cell, infect it. And

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.170
then infect the entire immune system. So if you have a normally functioning CCR5

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.100
allele, then you're at risk for HIV

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.320
infection. However, there's an allele of CCR5 that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.310
creates a very dysfunctional version of the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.370
protein, rendering it pretty much non-functional, and it

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.880
can't even get to the cell surface

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.530
of T-cells. Without that CCR5 protein, the HIV

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.044
simply can't get in the T-cells. The T-cells

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:41.390
are thus resistant to HIV infection. So here's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.110
your first question using this example. Is the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.000
mutation for the dysfunctional protein that makes the T-cell

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.500
HIV resistant more likely in the coding or non-coding

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.935
DNA of the genome? I want you to check

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:57.210
one of these boxes and then explain why you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.890
think that's the answer in this text box here.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.240
I want you to save your answer, because guess

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.080
what, you're going to need it in the next video.
