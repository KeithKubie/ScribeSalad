00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.750
We've already explored a
two-dimensional version

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.940
of the divergence theorem.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.880
If I have some region-- so this
is my region right over here.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.550
We'll call it R. And let's
call the boundary of my region,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.860
let's call that C. And
if I have some vector

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.710
field in this region, so let me
draw a vector field like this.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.130
If I draw a vector
field just like that,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.320
our two-dimensional
divergence theorem,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.220
which we really derived
from Green's theorem,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.570
told us that the flux across
our boundary of this region--

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.810
so let me write that out.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.090
The flux across the
boundary, so the flux

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.980
is essentially going
to be the vector field.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970
It's going to be
our vector field F

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.040
dotted with the normal
outward-facing vector.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.080
So the normal
vector at any point

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.230
is this outward-facing
vector, So our vector field,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.745
dotted with the normal-facing
vector at our boundary times

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.120
our little chunk
of the boundary.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.880
If we were to sum them all
up over the entire boundary--

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.960
let me write that a
little bit neater--

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.300
that's the same thing as summing
up over the entire region.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.740
So let's sum up over
the entire region.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.490
So summing up over this entire
region, each little chunk

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.730
of area, dA-- we could call
that dx dy if we wanted to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.410
if we're dealing
in the xy domain

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.667
right over here, but each
little chunk of area times

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.500
the divergence of F,
which is really saying,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.080
how much is that vector
field pulling apart?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.910
So it's times the
divergence of F.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.540
And hopefully, it
made intuitive sense.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.780
The way that I drew this
vector field right over here,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.350
you see everything's
kind of coming out.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.308
You could almost call
this a source right here,

00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:57.990
where the vector field seems
like it's popping out of there.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770
This has positive
divergence right over here.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.670
And so because of
this, you actually

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.177
see that the vector
field at the boundary

00:02:05.177 --> 00:02:07.510
is actually going in the
direction of the normal vector,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.635
pretty close to the direction
of the normal vector,

00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:10.419
so it makes sense.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.860
You have positive
divergence, and this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.310
is going to be a positive value.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.950
The vector field is
going, for the most part,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.533
in the direction of
the normal vector.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.130
So the larger this is,
the larger that is.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.770
So hopefully, some
intuitive sense.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.520
If you had another
vector field-- so

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.700
let me draw another region--
that looked like this, so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.270
I could draw a
couple situations.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.560
So one where there's
very limited divergence,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.070
maybe it's just a constant.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
The vector field
doesn't really change

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.860
as you go in any
given direction.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.150
Over here you'll
get positive fluxes.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.060
I don't know what the
plural of flux is.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.040
You'll get positive fluxes,
because the vector field seems

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.440
to be going in roughly the same
direction as our normal vector.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.650
But here, you'll
get a negative flux.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.230
So stuff is coming in here.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.370
If you imagine your vector
field is essentially

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.500
some type of mass
density times volume,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.480
and we've thought
about that before,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.650
this is showing how
much stuff is coming in,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.330
and then stuff is coming out.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.690
So your net flux will
be close to zero.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.791
Stuff is coming in, and
stuff is coming out.

00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:15.290
Here, you're just
saying, hey, stuff

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.281
is constantly coming
out of this surface.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.780
So hopefully, this
gives you a sense

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.670
that here you have
very low divergence,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.010
and you would have a low
flux, total aggregate flux,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.200
going through your boundary.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.866
Here you have a high
divergence, and you

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:30.820
would have a high
aggregate flux.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.230
I could draw another situation.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.550
So this is my region
R. And let's say

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.110
that we have
negative divergence,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.809
or we could even
call it convergence.

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.600
Convergence isn't an
actual technical term,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.140
but you could imagine if the
vector field is converging

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.570
within R, well,
the divergence is

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.349
going to be negative
in this situation.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.890
It's actually converging, which
is the opposite of diverging.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.650
So the divergence is
negative in this situation.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.790
And also the flux
across the boundary

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.790
is going to be negative.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.200
Because as we see
here, the way I

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.100
drew it, across most
of this boundary,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.840
the vector field is going
in the opposite direction.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.590
It's going in the opposite
direction as our normal vector

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.280
at any point.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.779
So hopefully, this
gives you a sense

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.390
of why there's this connection
between the divergence

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.381
over the region and the
flux across the boundary.

00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.089
Well, now we're just
going to extend this

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.560
to three dimensions, and it's
the exact same reasoning.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.900
If we have a-- and I'll
define it a little bit more

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.440
precisely in future videos--
a simple, solid region.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.530
So let me just draw it.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.500
And I'm going to try to
draw it in three dimensions.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.370
So let's say it looks
something like that.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.986
And one way to think
about it is this

00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:43.360
is going to be a region that
doesn't bend back on itself.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.010
And if you have a region that
bends back on itself-- well,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.593
we'll think about
it in multiple ways.

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:49.794
But out of all the volumes
of three dimensions

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:51.460
that you can imagine,
these are the ones

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.539
that don't bend
back on themselves.

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.080
And there are some
that you might not

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.490
be able to imagine that
would also not make the case.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.050
But even if you had ones
that bent back on themselves,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.520
you could separate them out
into other ones that don't.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.820
So here is just a simple
solid region over here.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.320
I'll make it look
three dimensional.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.830
So maybe if it was transparent,
you would see it like that.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.950
And then you see the
front of it like that.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.990
So it's this kind of elliptical,
circular, blob-looking thing.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.610
So that could be the back of it.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.390
And then if you go
to the front, it

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.350
could look something like that.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.760
So this is our
simple solid region.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.940
I'll call it-- well,
I'll call it R still.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.870
But we're dealing with
a three dimensional.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.260
We are now dealing with a
three-dimensional region.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.240
And now the boundary of
this is no longer a line.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.490
We're now in three dimensions.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.640
The boundary is a surface.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:57.020
So I'll call that S. S
is the boundary of R.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.250
And now let's throw on
a vector field here.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.330
Now, this is a vector
field in three dimensions.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.913
And now let's imagine
that we actually

00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:06.160
have positive divergence
of our vector field

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.490
within this region
right over here.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.990
So we have positive divergence.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.450
So you can imagine that
it's kind of-- the vector

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.250
field within the region, it's
a source of the vector field,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.080
or the vector field
is diverging out.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.260
That's just the case I
drew right over here.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.468
And the other thing we want
to say about vector field

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.360
S, it's oriented in a way that
its normal vector is outward

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.600
facing, so outward
normal vector.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.130
So the normal, it's oriented
so that the surface--

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.170
the normal vector is like that.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.660
The other option
is that you have

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.150
an inward-facing normal vector.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.820
But we're assuming it's
an outward-facing N. Well,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.600
then we just extrapolate
this to three dimensions.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.750
We essentially say the
flux across the surface.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.790
So the flux across the surface,
you would take your vector

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:01.220
field, dot it with the
normal vector at the surface,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.330
and then multiply that times
a little chunk of surface,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.860
so multiply that times a
little chunk of surface,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.305
and then sum it up along the
whole surface, so sum it up.

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:12.930
So it's going to be
a surface integral.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.620
So this is flux
across the surface.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.490
It's going to be equal
to-- if we were to sum up

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.045
the divergence, if we were to
sum up across the whole volume,

00:07:31.045 --> 00:07:32.420
so now if we're
summing up things

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.232
on every little chunk of volume
over here in three dimensions,

00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:38.690
we're going to have to take
integrals along each dimension.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.060
So it's going to be
a triple integral

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.870
over the region of
the divergence of F.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.730
So we're going to
say, how much is F?

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.480
What is the divergence
at F at each point?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.800
And then multiply it times the
volume of that little chunk

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.120
to sense of how much
is it totally diverging

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.130
in that volume.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.220
And then you sum it up.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.970
That should be
equal to the flux.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.720
It's completely
analogous to what's here.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.690
Here we had a flux
across the line.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.290
We had essentially
a two-dimensional--

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.623
or I guess we could say it's
a one-dimensional boundary,

00:08:12.623 --> 00:08:18.090
so flux across the curve.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.680
And here we have the
flux across a surface.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.210
Here we were summing the
divergence in the region.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.710
Here we're summing
it in the volume.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.412
But it's the exact same logic.

00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:27.870
If you had a vector
field like this

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.330
that was fairly constant
going through the surface,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.230
on one side you would
have a negative flux.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.799
On the other side, you
would have a positive flux,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.252
and they would
roughly cancel out.

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:36.710
And that makes
sense, because there

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.380
would be no diverging going on.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.854
If you had a converging vector
field, where it's coming in,

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.520
the flux would be
negative, because it's

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.010
going in the opposite
direction of the normal vector.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.370
And so the divergence
would be negative as well,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.250
because essentially the vector
field would be converging.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.500
So hopefully this
gives you an intuition

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.400
of what the divergence theorem
is actually saying something

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.060
very, very, very, very-- almost
common sense or intuitive.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.584
And now in the
next few videos, we

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.250
can do some worked
examples, just so you

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.830
feel comfortable computing or
manipulating these integrals.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.600
And then we'll do a couple of
proof videos, where we actually

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.132
prove the divergence theorem.
