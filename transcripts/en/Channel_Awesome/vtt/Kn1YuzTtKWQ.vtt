Nostalgia Critic: (as Imhotep) You shall rest from life,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.700
like the setting sun in the West.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.800
But you shall dawn anew in the East,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.700
as the first rays of Amon-Ra

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.800
dispel the shadows.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.920
[glass break]

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.500
Rick: Hyah!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.120
Not today, mummy guy!

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.200
Shwing!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.200
Evelyn: *gasp*

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.700
Rick: I, being totally from this time period,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.300
am here to stop you!

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.400
NC: Cut, cut, cut!

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.840
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.660
Tamara (British): Well, you told us to dress up as the original Mummy movie.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.220
NC: Yeah!

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.700
1932, Boris Karloff!

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.600
Tamara and Malcolm: (chuckling)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400
Malcolm: Everybody knows that the original Mummy
is the Brendan Fraser version.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.620
Tamara (still British): Why are you dressed up as Grunkle Stan and talking like Frankenberry?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.160
NC: Oh, my God, I'm so sick of people saying this.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.460
The Brendan Fraser one is not the original!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.000
Malcolm: Sure it is.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.800
That's why when the crappy remake came out,
everyone said it's not as good as the original.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.840
Tamara (normal): Yeah, isn't that true?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.500
NC: No!

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.060
I mean, yes!

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.560
I mean...

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.960
It is a sin against nature...

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.419
Tamara: And this is that original film.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.060
NC: Nooo.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.840
This was the first crappy remake!

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.820
Malcolm: You didn't like it?

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.700
NC: I didn't say that.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.080
Malcolm: But you said it was crappy.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.240
NC: Well, it was meant to be crappy.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.340
At least, I pray to God it was.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300
Tamara: Let's just all come together and agree that the Tom Cruise one

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.820
sucks.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.380
NC: Yes.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.880
I mean, no!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.380
I mean...

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.320
I want to show people what a great Mummy movie was supposed to be.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.680
Tamara: You thought the Tom Cruise one was great?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.000
NC: THERE'S MORE THAN TWO MOVIES!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.800
Malcolm: Well, people remember the Fraser one.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.000
You should talk about that.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.720
NC: Fine.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
I'll leave it to the audience.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.760
How many of you would-

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.420
GODDAMN IT!

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.740
YOU UNCULTURED SWINES!!

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.300
Tamara: Told ya.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000
NC: Oh, piss off 'til I need an Eragon joke!

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.520
NC: Sad to say that, in recent years, when many people refer to the original Mummy movie

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.500
this is the one they're talking about.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.780
The 1999 hit quickly established it had as much to do with the original Mummy as, say

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.340
The Last Airbender has to do with the original Avatar.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.200
Except a little less penis hair.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.040
Nevertheless, it found its audience, not as a horror film, but rather a corny light-hearted adventure.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.720
It spawned sequels, spin-offs,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.180
even a children's cartoon.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.100
And let me tell you it is no Jackie Chan adventures!

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.300
So, after years of popularity

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.420
and yes, even future remakes taking more from THIS than the original source material

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.280
it does make sense to see if this still holds up or if, honestly, it was ever really meant to hold up.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.520
Let's take a look at 1999's-

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.480
Malcolm: The original!

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.100
NC: SHUT UP AND WATCH SOMETHING BLACK AND WHITE!

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.940
Tamara (British?): NEVEEEEEERRR!!!

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.260
NC: ...The Mummy.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.440
It starts off in...

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.060
Oh! I'm sorry.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.840
I apparently put out an episode of the cartoon.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.680
OH!

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.720
Doubly sorry.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.300
These are apparently "really convincing effects"

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.660
Not to knock what is admittedly pretty CG

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.660
but Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes as Moses and Rameses fit a little too well into this "realistic backdrop."

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400
Narration (Ardeth Bay):
Thebes, crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti I

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.120
Home of Imhotep

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.780
pharaoh's high priest

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.380
Keeper of the Dead.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.300
NC: (as Ardeth) Who enjoys sitting really close to the screen playing Assassin's Creed: Origins.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.300
Oh! Again, I mean, uh...

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.880
looking over realistic Egypt.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.640
(normal) I'll give the film credit that has fake as everything looks

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.040
it is still a gorgeous and artistically pleasing body of work.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.860
... and the CGI ain't bad either.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.360
Richie:
AM I RIGHT BOYS!?

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.540
NC: Imhotep has an affair with the pharaoh's mistress

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.500
...which seems redundant the more I think about it.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.760
but the golden Festers are unable to block cock for a long!

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.420
(speaks bad Ancient Egyptian)

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.700
NC: (as mistress) I had an itch.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.120
What, Egyptians never have an itch?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.360
Or you can kill him! That works.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.360
NC: (normal) But the mistress has a plan for the guards who came to arrest her!

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.240
Ha-ha! That showed 'em!

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.000
Imhotep plans to resurrect her though, as-

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.640
Wait, I can't not play this:

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.500
♪[Arabian Nights plays]♪

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.960
THIS IS ALL A CARTOON!

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.340
Don't believe me?

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.880
Look at the effects when trying to bring his love back to life.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.360
Oh my God!

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.700
We're in the remake of The Haunting!

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.460
DESTROY EVERYTHING EXCEPT
YOUR BI CATHERINE ZETA JONESES!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.600
NC (as mistress): *shudders*

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.500
I dreamed I was attached to a giant bomb with Tom Cruise!

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.420
(normal) Imhotep has to kill her to resurrect her

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.120
but he's stopped and mummified, covered in CG bugs while also given apparently the worst of all curses:

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.900
Ardeth: The Medjai would never allow him to be released

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.460
for he would arise a walking disease

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.700
power over the sands and the glory of invincibility!

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.540
NC: Kind of a dumb curse when you think about it.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.949
"Ah yes. You will suffer for years and years

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.160
and if by chance somebody saves you

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.200
you'll become the most powerful and invincible entity known to man."

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.160
Were there no other curses that left that part out?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.800
Wha- was that curse on sale?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.460
Ardeth: And for 3,000 years, we, the Medjai

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.320
the descendants of Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.100
kept watch.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.880
NC: Ah, geez, these guys have the laziness of the Cruciform sword of written all over them.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.300
If you did your job well, we wouldn't have a movie!

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.780
We come across a desert battle and meet our main character Rick, played by Fraser

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.300
and his comic relief, Beni.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.380
Beni: Wait for me!

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.100
NC: Don't worry.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.300
He'll be back soon to confused charming side antagonist with

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.740
"SHUT UP! J-J-JU SHUT UP!!"

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.400
soon enough.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.900
Thank God they set their rifles to "around target" instead of "on target"

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.300
as Spooky-face-in-the-ground scares everyone away including Fraser.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.340
Banish him to Monkeybone.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.020
Meanwhile, Rachel Weisz plays a librarian named Evelyn

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.580
who's searching in the S section for "Suck-ass comedy".

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.220
It's funny because...

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.380
Nope.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.760
I'll give them a point that they actually knocked all these bookcases over in one shot with no CG involved.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.060
It almost excuses the lame-ass exposition we have to sit through.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.600
Dr. Bey: Why do I put up with you?!

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.940
Evelyn: W-Well, you put up with me because I can-I can read and write ancient Egyptian.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.400
And I can-I can decipher hieroglyphics and hieratic.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.500
NC: (as Evelyn) I force plot-points with no natural rhyme or rhythm.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.160
(normal) She thinks she hears a noise, so she grabs one of those necessary

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.980
TORCHES KEPT AROUND ANCIENT ARTIFACTS!

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.840
I guess electricity wasn't a common thing yet.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.500
OH WAIT!

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.140
where she's led to her piss-poor fake-out.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.780
*screaming*

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.960
Evelyn: Have you no respect for the dead?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.740
NC: Uh, yeah, messing with priceless corpses in Egypt?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.240
Best-case scenario: fired

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.000
Worst-case scenario: death!

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.220
This is Jonathan, Weisz's brother

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.900
who just happened to find the Hellraiser box which contains a map to Egyptian tombs and treasure.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.520
This looks like a job for pervy George of the Jungle!

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.280
Rick: Who are you?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.480
And who's the broad?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.060
Evelyn: You were actually at Hamunaptra?

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.140
Rick: Yeah, I was there.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.220
Evelyn: You swear?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.060
Rick: Every damn day.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.100
Evelyn: No, I didn't mean that.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.520
Rick: I know what you meant. I was there.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.340
Seti's place, City of the Dead.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.740
NC: (as Rick) My slightly dirty skin and perfect white teeth are ready for rugged adventure!

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.460
(normal) So, yeah, Brendan Fraser sticks out like a member of Scrubs in an Indiana Jones movie

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.080
but given the film's goofy tone, you could argue that's the point.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.020
It is a silly environment, so his mismatched voice and look doesn't go unwelcome.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.020
Rick: Then get me the hell out of here!

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.980
My problem is there would have been so many other non-matching actors that would have been even cooler!

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.360
Can you imagine Bruce Campbell in that role?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.300
It'd make no sense, but it'd be awesome!

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.980
Rob (as Campbell): Who are you and who's the broad?

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.580
Get me the hell outta here and, by God

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.900
tell me why that guy's in that hamster wheel!

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.820
IT'S NOT EVEN ATTACHED TO ANYTHING!

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.240
NC: Sadly, though, Fraser is said to hang, and...

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.860
Short movie.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.020
Actually, his neck doesn't break which 
allows Weisz time to bargain for his life

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.540
telling his captor that if he releases him, she'll lead them to the treasure.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.200
He agrees not realising forced romantic interludes
are a shitty-ass Lucas wipe away.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.180
Evelyn: He's filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.380
I don't like him one bit.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.320
Rick: Anyone I know?

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.520
Evelyn: Oh.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.400
NC: (as Evelyn) Oh!

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.800
My horniness totally forgot what I was saying.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.760
Rick: My whole damn garrison believed in this so much

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.780
that without orders, they marched halfway across Libya and into Egypt to find that city.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.200
And when we got there, all we found was sand and blood.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.260
NC: (as Rick) Like, it totally put me off my surfing lessons.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.060
I'm a rogue.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.260
Evelyn: One of the most famous books in history is buried out there.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.520
The Book of Amun-Ra.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.760
Rick: And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold makes no nevermind to you.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.420
Right?

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.340
NC: (as Rick) I was thinking of dyeing my hair gold.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.340
Would that be cool?

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.240
I'm a lowlife.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.220
Evelyn: Why did you kiss me?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.880
Rick: I don't know. I was about to be hanged.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.180
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.660
NC: (as Evelyn): I thought we had something,
man I've known for less than a day!

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.340
Rick: What?

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.880
NC: (normal) They sail on a ship, discovering that another troop happens to be looking

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.080
for the exact same thing

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.480
on the exact same ship.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.420
They even come across the exact same wormy comic relief.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.160
Beni: You're alive!

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.100
I was so very, very worried.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.060
NC: Bartok the Bat?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.260
Beni: They pay me only half now, half when I get them back the Cairo.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.180
Bartok: Am I supposed to believe that thing woke up 
after all these years?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.480
Beni: You never believed in Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.300
Bartok: Oh, sure, blame the bat. What the heck?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.240
We're easy targets.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.500
NC: Admit it, you are not gonna unhear this!

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.020
But a Universal stunt show breaks out, and everybody is forced to abandon the ship.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.080
They manage to come across some camels, and, surprisingly, they DON'T focus on their flatulence.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.740
You missed a cinematic diamond mine.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.180
...and they travel to the ruins, using day for night, and dumb for smart.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.600
David Daniels: What the hell are we doin'?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.580
Beni: Patience, my good barat'm.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.320
Patience.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.000
Bartok: You know, sir, really, you should watch your blood pressure.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.480
Stress, it's a killer, sir.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.080
Rick: We're about to be shown the way.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.100
NC: You sure it's not just playing a DuckTales cartoon?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.600
My God, these effects!

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.100
David: Can you believe it?

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.460
Bernard Burns: Hamunaptra.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.700
Rick: Here we go again.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.460
NC: (as Rick) Derp.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.000
So they make it to the city and start looking for riches.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.120
Film was used to shoot that rope scene.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.920
I think we all acknowledge it was worth it.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.200
They journey inward to see what they can find.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.100
Rick: They ripped out your guts and stuffed them in jars.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.600
Evelyn: And then they'd take out your heart as well.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.420
NC: Well, that's the end of them.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.140
No, they just missed it

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.920
...goddammit

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.700
...and find the Book of the Dead.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.420
Fraser's captor, however, finds one of the deadly bugs

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.800
concealed in a Cadbury egg

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.440
that somehow survived all these years

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.300
despite being in a Cadbury egg.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.680
Oh, no!

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.380
I'm being Photoshopped to death!

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.200
NC: Christ, is Macaulay Culkin in that tomb with them?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.220
He died as he lived.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.300
Like Curly Howard.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.400
The Cruciform Morons show up a day late

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.220
proving they suck at what they do

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.300
and making them even more dumb when they just tell them to leave, and then, they leave.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.080
Ardeth: Leave.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.400
Leave this place or die.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.400
NC: Oh.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.460
Those are our choices, huh?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.840
Hey, you notice how their backs are to us right now?

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.980
Of course, having half your crew killed and your life threatened

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.600
doesn't mean you can't get smashed the exact same night!

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.360
Evelyn: I know when to say no.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.260
Rick: And unlike your brother, miss, you, I just don't get.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.820
Evelyn: I am going to kiss you, Mr. O'Connell.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.080
Rick: Call me Rick.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.200
NC: Kurt Russell.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.920
That would have been a weird but badass choice.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.300
I could totally see him in that role!

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.800
Rob: (as Russell) Call me Rick.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.460
And, for God's sakes, grow your eyebrows back.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.700
What are you doing?

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.800
NC: (as Rick) Well. I'd say never on a first date

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.620
but this never happens on a first date.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.260
(normal) *snickers* Okay.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.500
That's the one thing Brendan Fraser could add that nobody else could add.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.100
This whole entire performance might be worth it just for that one reaction!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.560
You hold on to that, Fraser!

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.800
Let no one take that from you.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.060
But they discover Imhotep's corpse and are surprised to find he's still decomposing after all these years.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.160
Perhaps it has something to do with the remains of the bugs in his tomb.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.000
Evelyn: They can stay alive for years, feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.080
Rick: So somebody threw these in with our guy and then they slowly ate him alive?

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.900
Evelyn: Very slowly.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.960
NC: Yes. As we already saw

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.060
they really take their time there.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.780
They're like flesh-eating snails.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.300
The other guys find ancient soap dispensers, unaware that they hold some of Imhotep's vital organs.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.180
This'll make him happy, though, when he wakes up after Doof and Doofus

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.100
read the passage that resurrects him from the Book of the Dead.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.800
See how much cooler that would be?

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.640
This unleashes a plague of fake-ass locusts, sadly not led by James Earl Jones.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.960
All hell starts to break loose as even more of those bugs are released.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.200
Still eating people super-slowly, as you can see.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.420
Evelyn: Very slowly.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.380
NC: You know, has anyone considered she has no idea what she's talking about?

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.100
Thus, only an hour in, we finally get our mummy, and...

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.600
Pretty sure Legends of the Hidden Temple would've done him better.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.080
Yeah, it's...pretty bad.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.300
I mean, given the time period, it's...

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.700
pretty bad.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.280
NC: Okay, now we're trying to do a Trollface

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.600
if it was on a...

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.980
if it was on a tree from The Wizard of Oz.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.940
What are we doing?!

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.140
Fraser saves her by blasting his Imho-dick.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.400
But the crucified schmucks block them off.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.920
Ardeth: I told you to leave or die.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.040
You refused.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.400
Now you may have killed us all.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.780
NC: You know, I love the way this guy says everything.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.000
No matter what he's talking about, I feel like it should always be followed by

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.880
"Man!" or "Ya know?"

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.580
Ardeth: I told you to leave or die.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.260
NC: Man!

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.660
You refused.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.500
NC: Ya know?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.940
Now you may have killed us all.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.640
NC: Man!

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.680
Rick: Relax, I got him.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.660
Ardeth: No mortal weapon can kill this creature.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.260
NC: Ya know?

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.340
He's not of this world.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.060
NC: Man.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.480
But Imhotep comes across Beni, who quite amusingly prays to every religion he can think of.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.300
Bartok: Actually, considering how long you've been dead, you look pretty good.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.280
NC: Were you just keeping those in your pelvic bone?

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.500
You have no skin

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.040
you have no clothes.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.140
There's nowhere else you could keep it.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.180
This really needs an answer despite how much I don't want it!

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.200
So Fraser suggests they leave

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.480
Weisz suggests they stay

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.080
and the rest of us debate if this sounds more like Will and Grace or Mad About You.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.660
Rick: I told you not to play around with that thing.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.800
Didn't I tell you not to play around with that thing?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.600
Didn't I tell you not to play around with that thing?
Evie: Yes, right then.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.300
Me, me, me, me, I, I, I woke him up, and I intend to stop him.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.420
Rick: Oh, yeah? How?

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.520
You heard the man.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.180
No mortal weapons can kill this guy.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.220
NC: Christ. At this point,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.000
I'd take Archer in this role.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.320
(as Archer) Look, you can either tag along with me or stay here and try to save the world.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.460
Do you want mummies?

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.000
'Cause this is how you get mummies.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.600
LANA!!!

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.900
(normal) Fraser goes to the bar to get hammered, where an ex-pilot talks about his woes about there being no adventures anymore.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm sure absolutely nothing in the near future will tie into this.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.060
Havlock: Chucked it in with the others and gone down in flame and glory

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.780
instead of sitting around here

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.100
rotting of boredom and booze.
Rick: rotting from boredom and booze.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.880
NC: Yes, Chairman Mouse from The Rescuer movies.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.060
Oh. It...

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.000
actually is him.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.600
Random.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.100
NC: The mummy and Beni locate one of the people who took the sacred jars.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.320
Benny: I'm afraid more is needed

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.820
Burns: (whimpering) Wha?...

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.460
Beni: The prince must finish the job and consummate the curse...

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.140
Bartok: I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be, huh, sir?

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.200
Beni: ...which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.740
Burns: Wait! No!

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.540
NC: (as Burns) *screams*

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.140
On a side note, that was very nice of you to fill me in before you kill me.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.440
I mean, I know you got a lot on your plate right now

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.880
and time is probably of the essence

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.340
so it was very considerate of you to do

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.600
*resumes screaming*

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.500
Rick: We are in serious trouble.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:35.800
NC: You know, I should probably count how many times a good one-liner is instead replaced by Brendan Fraser making a stupid face and stating the obvious.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.700
Rick: We are in serious trouble.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.120
That happens a lot around here.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.500
I'll be seeing you again.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.500
These guys just don't quit, do they?

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.660
This just keeps gettin' better and better.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.860
We are in very serious trouble.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.740
NC: The mummy moves in on Weisz, but gets pussy whipped being afraid of cats, who are revealed to be the guardians of the Underworld.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:01.320
Weisz's boss was in cahoots with the Cruciform Dorks and helped him in their terrible job of protecting the world.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.300
Dr. Bey: Apparently, even after 3,000 years...

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.400
Ardeth: He's still in love with her.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.180
NC: Man!

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.440
Ardeth: Perhaps he will once again try to raise her from the dead.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.000
NC: Ya know?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.380
Jonathan: And he stretched forth his hand towards the heavens

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.080
and there was darkness throughout...

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.000
NC: Oh, yeah, because that brother character is entirely useless

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.540
they try to justify him by having him quote the Bible every time something plaguey happens.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.900
Jonathan: ...and there was darkness throughout the land of Egypt.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.100
And the rivers and waters of Egypt ran red and were as blood.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.200
NC: Oh, shut up, VeggieTales, you're still pointless!

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.240
So Fraser decides to lock Weisz in her room

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.980
leave the other rogues to look after her

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.620
and bring the brother with him to find Imhotep.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.560
Rick: She doesn't come out, and no one goes in, right?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.060
Henderson: Right.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.940
Rick: Let's go, Jonathan.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.100
NC: Wow!

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.960
Every single one of those choices was wrong!

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.880
She knows the most about the mummy, so she should go along.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.400
They're more qualified to fight, so they should go along.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.700
And he, I refer you back to useless.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.949
Does anyone know how to do their job in this movie?

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.920
I guess he didn't want a repeat of what happened:

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.100
him running into Beni

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.820
the mummy killing another scrounger

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.100
putting the moves on Weisz

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.220
a plague happening and being scared by a cat.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.280
So, what happens?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.580
He runs into Beni, the mummy kills another scrounger, puts the moves on Weisz, a plague happens, and he's scared by a cat.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.120
Mr. Salt: We've just come through there!

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.480
NC: Yeah, with the exception of the explanation with Weisz's boss, which, even then, I feel we could have figured out

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.700
the past eight minutes are just a repeat and totally should've been deleted.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.340
But, at least two more souls are sucked dry, which means the mummy must look at least a little more realistic now.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.240
...as realistic as a cartoon mouth app on your phone.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.660
Is this mummy meant to be scary or adorable?

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.400
I'm gonna say "ascarable".

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.200
Imhotep hypnotizes an army and forces them to go after our heroes.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.160
Jonathan: Faster.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.760
Evie: Patience is a virtue.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.120
Rick: Not right now, it isn't.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.800
They escape through the back, but the mummy has a extra trick up his sleeve.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.400
Okay.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.800
Glad you got that out of your system.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.000
The army eventually corners them, as the fully regenerated Imhotep approaches.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.400
And is Weisz is anything like she was earlier, she's probably like...

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.180
NC: (as Evelyn) Ooh!

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.180
That's what he looks like when put together?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.700
Imhotep: Keetah mi pharos...

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.900
NC: (as Evelyn) Whatever he's asking, yes.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.540
Imhotep: ...isirian.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.740
Beni: (translating) "Come with me, my princess."

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.800
"Take my hand, and I will spare your friends."

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.300
Bartok: Is this the face of a bat who would lie to you?

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.800
NC: She decides to go with him, under the condition that he spares her friends.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.220
He agrees...

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:32.800
He agrees to disagree.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.040
Evie: No!

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.620
Let go of me!

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.920
NC: It was the noble...

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.160
stupid thing to do.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.600
Her boss sacrifices himself so the rest can escape

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.200
and they go to Chairman Mouse for the use of his plane.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.840
Havlock: What's the challenge, then?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.520
Rick: Rescue the damsel in distress

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.480
kill the bad guy

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.260
save the world.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.960
NC: (as Havlock) Oh, one of these bullshit movies.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.600
Right-o!

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.260
(normal) Imhotep travels via Warp Whistle, and I gotta say

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.440
for being in the sandstorm

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.620
they look pretty damn good.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.640
But Mr. Sandman isn't done yet.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.700
NC: My God!

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.480
This must be Anakin Skywalker's worst nightmare!

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.000
Anakin: I don't like sand.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.700
NC: Look out!

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.800
Sand F. Murray Abraham!

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.900
He swallows the plane up

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.400
though, I guess, not too deep, seeing how there's plenty of blue sky insight

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.880
but Weisz has an idea.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.760
NC: (as Rick) Oh, God, now the storm's tongue is attacking us!

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.740
What's going on?!

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.180
(normal) But it appears to not be enough.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.020
Beni: I like the whole sand wall trick. It was beautiful...

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.360
...bastard.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.100
NC: (as Rick Sanchez) You don't need to impress me, Morty.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.860
(normal) Sadly, the only character I sympathize with

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.000
the drunk who just wants to die, gets killed.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.200
But if we're lucky, maybe we can go for two.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.960
NC: YES!

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.200
"Very slowly" eat him alive!

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.500
Evelyn: Very slowly.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.040
NC: Sadly, he's saved, but Imhotep hears them and sends his biggest threat yet...

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.760
mummies that are actually there!

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.000
Oh, my God!

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.440
They're actually right in front of us!

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.680
I mean, really right there!

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.120
It's not Jar Jar shit!

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.000
RUN!!

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.900
Oh, whoops. Don't worry, we still got the fake shit over here.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.340
Yeah, surprisingly, playing the exact same effect doesn't make it look any more real.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.920
It still looks like a Smurf sneezed milk through his nose.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.500
The mummy of Imhotep's bride comes to life, though, but before he can make the human sacrifice

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.760
Fraser saves the day.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.200
Imhotep: Im yub set na.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.400
NC: They forgot to subtitle that scene, so

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.460
I'll just throw my own in.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:48.480
And for creature as powerful as a god, Imhotep doesn't really do that much, outside of just watching them fight and go

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.340
"Thank God I'm not the butt-ugly CGI Rock in the shitty-ass sequel."

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.100
And when he does finally fight, he just utilizes more Mario Paint effects.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.300
*snickers* You know, call me crazy, but

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.200
dropping your jaw like the Patrick the starfish meme doesn't seem particularly scary.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.160
Look at that!

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.700
Did the Genie lend you some acting advice or something?

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.100
This was meant to be a Disney film, right?

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.280
But Weisz reads one last passage that takes away his invincibility, making him mortal.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.620
Of course, everything starts falling apart, and Beni is left behind in the treasure room.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.160
(as a scarab) Hello.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.700
We'll be your comeuppance for the evening.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.700
Bartok: This can only end in tears!

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.800
NC: (as Beni) At least you'll very slowly eat me.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.200
(as a scarab) What dumbass told you that?

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.000
Evelyn: Very slowly.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.200
NC: Run, camels, run!

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.500
I care more about you than any of the main characters!

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.060
(as Rick) I'm only kissing you 'cause I think I'm gonna get hanged later.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.500
Jonathan: How 'bout you, darling?

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.180
Would you like a little kissy-wissy?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.560
NC: Well, it's no camel fart

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.680
but his entire character is close enough.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.700
So that was the remake, not the original, of The Mummy.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.740
Does it hold up?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.300
No, but I don’t think that was really the point.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.940
It’s kind of like a high-budget B-movie

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.080
self-aware, silly and over-the-top.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.140
Some would say the bigger budget makes it less of a B-movie, but look at these effects.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.180
They look like the effects of today’s B-movies.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.400
So I feel like it still kind of qualifies.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:47.500
On top of that, it is still visually pleasant and fairly imaginative that I think, for a silly little waste of time, it’s fine.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:53.700
It’s in no way comparable to the original, but I think even the makers of the film knew that it wasn’t going to be.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.460
The best way I can put it is

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.700
“enjoyably dated”.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.100
NC: Right, now we're going to talk about The Mummy film that's worth talking about!

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.520
Nerd: You said it, Critic.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.160
NC: NEEEERRRRRR-

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.060
Wait, what are you doing here?

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.540
Nerd: I want to help you talk about The Mummy movie that's worth talking about.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.560
NC: Oh, of course.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.020
With your love of monster movies, it only makes sense that you want to talk about...

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.300
Nerd: ...the 2017 Tom Cruise version.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.800
NC: WHAT, ARE YA OUT OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.420
Nerd: No.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.420
But the movie is!

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.300
It's one of the most dumbass reboots ever, and we need to talk about it.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.800
NC: Yeah, but...what about the original Mummy?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.900
Nerd: You mean the 1932 classic with Boris Karloff and the Kharis series starring Lon Chaney Jr.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.880
or the 1959 Hammer version with Christopher Lee?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.680
You mean...

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.760
THE GOOD ONES?!

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.340
I already talked about them on Cinemassacre.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.000
Here's the link.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.760
NC: Wha- *stammers*

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.600
Don't advertise your channel on my channel!

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.300
Nerd: Look, everything about the classic versions has been already said.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.720
They're masterpieces.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.200
But this new one, we need to give it what it deserves.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.460
NC: *sigh* Oh, my god...

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.640
So we're really ending Nostalgia-Ween like this?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.400
Will it still even be October by the time this comes out?

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400
Nerd: It doesn't matter.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.400
To defend the honor of the classic Mummies, we have to do this.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.000
NC: *sigh* Fine. All right.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.400
Next week, we'll review one of this year's biggest nostalgic cash-grabs resulting in one of this year's biggest bombs.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.000
Nerd: Oh, Amun-Ra, God of Gods.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.560
Death is but the doorway to new life.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.940
We live today, we shall live again.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.180
In many new forms shall-

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.000
NC: Oh, shut up.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.340
Beni: (praying in Hindi)

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.980
Hey. Doug Walker here doing the charity shout out once again.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.700
And if you've been watching the news you're probably aware of the fires going on in, California.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.900
But rather than me talk about it one of our producers who lives out in California

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.500
Bennett The Sage, is going to tell you all about it and what you can do to help.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:42.680
Bennett: On October 8th 2017, the city of Santa Rosa experienced unprecedented destruction.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:50.800
A wildfire, which has hence been titled the Tubbs Fire, had rapidly formed fueled by large amounts of dry vegetation due to years of drought

00:27:50.800 --> 00:28:02.180
and Gusts of wind that reached hurricane level speeds the havoc it rot left over 5,000 buildings destroyed five percent of the total housing area of Santa Rosa with over a billion dollars in total damages.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:10.200
This, combined with the staggering casualty total of 22 lives lost, makes the Tubbs fire the most destructive in California history.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.500
As of October 19th the Tubbs fire has been 90% contained

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.920
but the after-effects of this disaster will be felt for years to come.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.460
but in times of devastation

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.000
the human capacity for kindness and generosity will always shine through.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.800
And I'm here to ask for that same light to help my city recover.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.080
Right now, a donation page has been set up by the chief financial officer of Santa Rosa to help those that have been affected by the Tubbs fire

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:41.200
and I urge everyone who sees this video to donate what they can to help those that have lost everything to a chance

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.020
and cruel moment of chaos.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:48.860
Click on the link in the description to donate or go to you caring comm and search for Tubbs fire victims

00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:55.419
Please also share this video on social media to help this Culver aid with your help, Santa Rosa can rise again

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.870
Thank you
