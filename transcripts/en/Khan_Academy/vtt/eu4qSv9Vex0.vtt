00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.792
- [Instructor] We are told
that quadrilateral ABCD

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:07.254
is dilated about point P.

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:08.879
So this is our quadrilateral

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.178
that's going to be dilated around point P.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.710
And then they ask us some questions.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.264
Are the coordinates of
the vertices preserved?

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:18.097
Are corresponding line
segments on the same line?

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:20.768
Are angle measures preserved?

00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:23.368
Are side lengths, perimeter,
and area preserved?

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:26.898
So pause this video and
see if you can answer it.

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:28.152
So now let's work through it together.

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:29.405
So one thing you might be thinking

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.729
is they're just saying it's dilated.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.494
They didn't say what the scale factor is.

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:34.189
We know it's dilated about point P,

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:35.953
but what's the scale factor?

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.416
Well since they didn't tell us,

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:40.481
I guess these questions would
apply to any scale factor.

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.455
But to help us visualize this,

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.289
let's just supply a scale factor here.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.772
Let's just say that our scale factor,

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:51.070
scale factor, so it fits on this page,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.601
is equal to 1/2.

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:55.180
So what would result here?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.384
Well right now point A is one, two, three,

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:01.008
four, five, six, seven, eight

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:02.796
away from point P.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.932
So its image if we do
a scale factor of 1/2

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.325
would be four away.

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:07.997
One, two, three, four.

00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:12.827
So right over there, point
A' could be right over there.

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:14.290
It would be along the same line,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.170
it would just be 1/2 as far.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.816
Point D is right now one, two,
three, four, five six away.

00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:21.983
So D' would be three away,

00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:25.598
half as far away.

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:28.709
And so this would be the segment A'D'

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.008
which corresponds to the segment AD.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.192
Now let's see,

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.816
point B, if we have a scale factor of 1/2,

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:37.440
it is one, two, three, four,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.739
five, six below A.

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.898
But if we have a scale factor of 1/2,

00:01:41.898 --> 00:01:43.965
it's going to be three below A.

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:45.965
So this would be our B'.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.304
And so you could also see
that if you connect a line

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:55.041
going from point P to B that
B' is also on that line.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.734
It's just 1/2 as far, scale factor of 1/2.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:58.734
Now point C,

00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:01.240
there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.468
To go from point P to point C,

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:07.254
we have to go four down
and two to the left.

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:09.135
So if you apply a scale factor of 1/2,

00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:12.897
you go two down and one to the left.

00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:15.799
So this would be C' right over here.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.132
And so A'B'C'D',

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:24.460
the image of quadrilateral
ABCD after the dilation

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.714
around point P,

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:27.549
and I picked an arbitrary
scale factor here

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.104
that I felt that I could draw,

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:30.172
you see it right over here.

00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:31.844
And the reason why I
did that is it makes it

00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:34.213
a little bit easier to
answer this question.

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:37.255
Are the coordinates of
the vertices preserved?

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.320
Well every vertex, all the vertices,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.015
are different coordinates here.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:45.637
So we would say no, none
of those are preserved.

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:47.727
Are the, and the whole
idea here is to appreciate

00:02:47.727 --> 00:02:48.841
what gets preserved

00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:52.347
or doesn't get preserved under dilations.

00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:56.248
Are corresponding line
segments on the same line?

00:02:56.248 --> 00:02:58.083
Well let's see, no,

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.987
they're all parallel to each other,

00:02:59.987 --> 00:03:02.866
so AB is parallel to A'B',

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.783
AD is parallel to A'D',
and so on and so forth.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.948
But they're not all, none of
them are on the same line,

00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:11.759
so I would say no.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.824
And then we say are
angle measures preserved?

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:17.843
So this is something that
dilations do preserve.

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.419
So this angle is still
the same as that angle.

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.159
This was a right angle before,
it's still a right angle.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.340
This angle is still equal to that angle

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.174
or the measure of those angles.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:30.637
Likewise the measure of that angle

00:03:30.637 --> 00:03:32.936
is still equal to the
measure of that angle.

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:35.072
So angle measures are preserved.

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:36.535
And that's a general thing
that you could take away

00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:37.868
about dilations.

00:03:38.857 --> 00:03:41.899
Are side lengths, perimeter,
and area preserved?

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.684
Well dilations are a
non-rigid transformation

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.540
which tells you that side
lengths are not preserved.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.187
The distance between corresponding
points are not preserved.

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:52.812
You can see it very clearly here.

00:03:52.812 --> 00:03:54.322
And if side lengths aren't preserved,

00:03:54.322 --> 00:03:56.249
then perimeter is
definitely not preserved,

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.385
and then area would not be preserved.

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:00.986
So this would be no for all of these

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:02.403
under a dilation.

00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:05.955
If we were talking about
a rigid transformation

00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:08.532
like a translation or a rotation,

00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:11.133
then these three would be preserved.

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.216
Let's do another example.

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:19.887
So we're told triangle ABC
is dilated about point C.

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:21.930
Once again they don't tell
us what the scale factor,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.368
and then they ask us
the same four questions.

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.295
So like before, pause this video,

00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:29.012
see if you can figure it out on your own.

00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:30.429
Now let's work through it together,

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:32.333
and I'm just going to
apply a scale factor.

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.514
In fact you know might as
well do a scale factor of 1/2.

00:04:35.514 --> 00:04:39.252
So scale factor, I'll
just do S.F. for short,

00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:40.808
let's say it's equal to 1/2.

00:04:40.808 --> 00:04:42.689
And I'm just picking one
so that we can visualize

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.357
what its image would look
like after the dilation.

00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:47.867
So let's see,

00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:49.608
right now and remember this is interesting

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:51.628
because we're dilating around a point

00:04:51.628 --> 00:04:55.483
that happens to be one of
the vertices of the triangle.

00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:58.014
So let's see, point A, to go from C to A,

00:04:58.014 --> 00:04:59.931
we go three to the left

00:05:01.404 --> 00:05:03.935
and we go two, four, six up.

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:04.768
Six up.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.180
Just like that.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.992
So two to the left and then six up.

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:13.548
So if you have a scale factor of 1/2,

00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:16.752
or sorry not two to the
left, three to the left,

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:19.307
three to the left and six up.

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:21.396
And so if you have a scale factor of 1/2,

00:05:21.396 --> 00:05:24.508
instead you're gonna go 1 1/2 to the left

00:05:24.508 --> 00:05:26.133
and then three up.

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:28.734
And so you're gonna end
up right over there.

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:29.984
Now this is A'.

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.609
And so notice this is actually
sitting on the segment AC,

00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:36.420
and that happens to be the case

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.674
because once again,

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:39.554
our center of dilation
is one of the vertices

00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:42.155
of our actual triangle.

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:45.359
Now let's look at think
about where B' would be.

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:48.123
To go from C to B we go two to the right,

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:51.745
and then we go four up, plus four.

00:05:51.745 --> 00:05:55.205
So if we are talking about
a scale factor of 1/2,

00:05:55.205 --> 00:05:57.271
we'll go 1/2 as far to the right

00:05:57.271 --> 00:05:59.082
and 1/2 as far up.

00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:00.267
So one to the right and two up,

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:02.426
so this would be where B' is.

00:06:02.426 --> 00:06:04.678
And so there we have

00:06:04.678 --> 00:06:08.486
the image, and of
course, C would map to C'

00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:13.107
because it's actually the point
that we are dilating about.

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:15.360
So this would be our
image right over here,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.610
A', B', and C'.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.908
So are the coordinates of
the vertices preserved?

00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:25.321
Well only, only C is preserved.

00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:26.900
The other ones are not preserved.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.781
And the only reason why C
was preserved is because

00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:30.661
that is the point we are dilating about.

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:33.076
It's third time I said it, my apologies.

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:36.049
Are corresponding line
segments on the same line?

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:37.216
Well A'C' same

00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:44.802
on same line I guess you could say,

00:06:44.802 --> 00:06:45.802
on same line

00:06:48.727 --> 00:06:49.560
as AC.

00:06:51.258 --> 00:06:53.138
And similarly,

00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:55.471
C'B' or I can say B'C' same.

00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:59.803
I'm just gonna use a
little bit of shorthand.

00:06:59.803 --> 00:07:02.566
And once again that is
because we are dilating

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:05.515
about a point that is one of the vertices.

00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:07.744
The other segment A'B' is not.

00:07:07.744 --> 00:07:08.577
Not A'B'.

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:12.434
It's not on the same line.

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:13.595
It is parallel.

00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:15.058
This is parallel to that,

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:17.241
but it is not on the same line.

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:18.866
Are angle measures preserved?

00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:20.004
Well we don't even have to look at this.

00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:21.653
This is going to be a yes.

00:07:21.653 --> 00:07:23.115
This is one of the things about dilation,

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:25.019
angle measures are preserved.

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:27.040
That angle's equal to that angle,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.571
the measure of this angle
is congruent to that angle,

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:31.591
or this angle's congruent to that angle,

00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:34.934
and of course this is the
same angle in both cases.

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:37.396
Are side lengths, perimeters,
and area preserved?

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:38.626
Once again no.

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:40.089
When we're doing a dilation side lengths,

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.552
and if side lengths aren't preserved,

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:42.643
perimeter's not gonna be preserved

00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:44.687
and area's not gonna be preserved.

00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:45.741
And we're done.
