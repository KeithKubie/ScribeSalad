00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk about one more vulnerability in TLS.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
That's an information leak.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now we'll assume that the encryption works fine. The handshake is good.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All of these messages are encrypted.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But the attacker can listen in on this channel.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Assuming the attacker can't break any of the encryption

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but can observe the message on this channel,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
what does the attacker learn?
