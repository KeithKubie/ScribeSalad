00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.478
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:06.733
is talk about roughly 1,000
years of Japanese history

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:10.453
that take us from what's
known as the classical period

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:14.278
of Japan through the
Japanese medieval period,

00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:16.966
all the way to the early modern period.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.735
And the key defining characteristic
of the classical period

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:24.691
is this is when Japan
really began to unify

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.357
and have an imperial form

00:00:26.357 --> 00:00:29.062
and began to borrow a
lot of the traditions

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:32.478
and philosophy and even
religion from China.

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:34.498
Then as we get into the medieval period

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:36.342
Japan gets fragmented,

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:38.622
it comes under military rule,

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:41.193
and then as we get into
the early modern period

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:44.070
it gets reunited.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.482
So, as I mentioned

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:49.130
China had a huge influence on Japan.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.343
Even though China never conquers Japan

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:54.334
because of how close they are

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:58.501
many things like the idea
of a centralized bureaucracy

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.202
the Japanese borrow many of these ideas

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:06.470
from China during the classical period.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.802
In fact, the Japanese rulers

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.350
send delegations to China
in the seventh century

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.686
in order to understand
all of what the Chinese do

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:17.615
in order to run their government,

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:18.851
to run their country

00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.598
and they start to borrow
a lot of the ideas

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:23.919
of Buddhism and Confucianism,

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:27.023
and merge it with some
of their own beliefs

00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:28.815
which are often known as Shinto,

00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:33.082
which you can view as the
original Japanese belief system.

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:35.210
So, the first part of the classical period

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.098
that we're gonna go into some depth

00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:39.746
is the Heian period,

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:44.298
its capital at Heian-kyo,
modern day Kyoto,

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:45.947
and as I mentioned it was known

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:48.622
for taking a lot of
these ideas from China,

00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:51.870
and particularly the
Tang Dynasty in China,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.382
and bringing them to Japan,

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:55.764
and the Heian period

00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:59.652
was known as a golden age of Japan.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.814
It was a time of culture, it
was a time of architecture.

00:02:02.814 --> 00:02:05.928
People in the imperial court
would focus on the arts,

00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:08.317
they would focus on philosophy.

00:02:08.317 --> 00:02:11.309
As an example, this right over here

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.189
is the Byodo-in or the Byodo-in Temple

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.284
in Kyoto which shows the level,

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:19.883
and this is actually only part of it,

00:02:19.883 --> 00:02:22.899
and it shows the level
of cultural advancement

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.848
of this time.

00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:26.961
As I mentioned, the arts were a big deal,

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:30.574
and women in the imperial
court of Heian China

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:31.753
had a lot of influence,

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:33.609
in fact, the most influential family,

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.806
the Fujiwara family
maintained its influence

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.924
by having the emperors of the Heian period

00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:42.300
marry women from their family,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.604
and those women would end
up having a lot of control

00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:47.124
over the emperor and of
course the next emperor

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:49.860
but to get a sense of
the arts of this period

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.650
here's an excerpt from the Tale of Genji,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.162
which was written by Lady Murasaki,

00:02:56.162 --> 00:03:00.626
who was believed to be a
member of the Fujiwara family.

00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.739
And Lady Murasaki gets a lot of credit

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.523
before Chaucer, before Shakespeare,

00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:08.899
she is by many historians viewed

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.380
as the first true novelist

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.099
that we know of in human history,

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.288
not just Japanese history

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:16.372
but I encourage you to read it.

00:03:16.372 --> 00:03:18.696
It's actually quite riveting,

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.097
the Tale of Genji.

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.957
And this is just a small
quote from that story

00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:24.117
or from that novel.

00:03:24.117 --> 00:03:27.573
It's about a very handsome prince Genji.

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:31.095
The difference between
enlightenment and confusion

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:32.899
is of about the same order

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.895
as the different between
the good and the bad

00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:37.343
in a romance.

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:39.700
If one takes the generous view,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.617
then nothing is empty and useless.
