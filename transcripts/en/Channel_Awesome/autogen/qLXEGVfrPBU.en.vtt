you<00:06:20.910><c> know</c><00:06:21.030><c> shaky-cam</c><00:06:21.450><c> a</c><00:06:21.660><c> lot</c><00:06:22.020><c> of</c><00:06:22.080><c> times</c><00:06:22.289><c> it's</c>

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
you know shaky-cam a lot of times it's
 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.180 align:start position:0%
you know shaky-cam a lot of times it's
overused<00:06:23.400><c> and</c><00:06:23.580><c> silly</c><00:06:23.940><c> but</c><00:06:24.650><c> actually</c><00:06:25.650><c> a</c><00:06:25.680><c> lot</c><00:06:25.919><c> a</c>

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 align:start position:0%
overused and silly but actually a lot a
 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.250 align:start position:0%
overused and silly but actually a lot a
lot<00:06:26.340><c> of</c><00:06:26.400><c> times</c><00:06:26.580><c> can</c><00:06:26.729><c> be</c><00:06:26.789><c> very</c><00:06:26.970><c> effective</c><00:06:27.260><c> like</c>

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
lot of times can be very effective like
 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.580 align:start position:0%
lot of times can be very effective like
here<00:06:28.590><c> where</c><00:06:29.220><c> the</c><00:06:29.610><c> Dragons</c><00:06:30.150><c> come</c><00:06:30.390><c> out</c><00:06:30.659><c> and</c><00:06:31.020><c> the</c>

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 align:start position:0%
here where the Dragons come out and the
 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
here where the Dragons come out and the

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
camera is slightly shaking out asking
 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
camera is slightly shaking out asking

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 align:start position:0%
myself why does this
 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.139 align:start position:0%
myself why does this
work<00:06:35.929><c> here</c><00:06:36.499><c> and</c><00:06:36.710><c> not</c><00:06:37.219><c> in</c><00:06:37.429><c> other</c><00:06:37.610><c> moments</c>

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:38.149 align:start position:0%
work here and not in other moments
 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.169 align:start position:0%
work here and not in other moments
because<00:06:38.300><c> there's</c><00:06:38.449><c> lots</c><00:06:38.719><c> of</c><00:06:38.929><c> times</c><00:06:39.229><c> I've</c><00:06:39.770><c> seen</c>

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:40.179 align:start position:0%
because there's lots of times I've seen
 

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.969 align:start position:0%
because there's lots of times I've seen
just<00:06:41.179><c> people</c><00:06:41.659><c> standing</c><00:06:42.169><c> around</c><00:06:42.259><c> and</c><00:06:42.770><c> the</c>

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 align:start position:0%
just people standing around and the

camera can't really be moving its effect
 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.850 align:start position:0%
camera can't really be moving its effect
they<00:06:49.069><c> put</c><00:06:49.249><c> it</c><00:06:49.339><c> later</c><00:06:49.580><c> and</c><00:06:50.529><c> sometimes</c><00:06:51.529><c> it</c><00:06:51.740><c> can</c>

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 align:start position:0%
they put it later and sometimes it can
 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.109 align:start position:0%
they put it later and sometimes it can
be<00:06:51.889><c> so</c><00:06:52.069><c> distracting</c><00:06:52.580><c> other</c><00:06:52.729><c> times</c><00:06:52.939><c> it</c><00:06:53.089><c> can</c>

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
be so distracting other times it can
 

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:54.519 align:start position:0%
be so distracting other times it can
really<00:06:53.360><c> work</c><00:06:53.539><c> and</c><00:06:53.689><c> I</c><00:06:53.749><c> felt</c><00:06:53.869><c> really</c><00:06:54.289><c> worked</c>

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529 align:start position:0%
really work and I felt really worked
 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.139 align:start position:0%
really work and I felt really worked
here<00:06:54.709><c> when</c><00:06:54.800><c> those</c><00:06:54.949><c> dragons</c><00:06:55.369><c> came</c><00:06:55.550><c> out</c><00:06:55.699><c> you</c>

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149 align:start position:0%
here when those dragons came out you
 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.449 align:start position:0%
here when those dragons came out you
felt<00:06:56.629><c> the</c><00:06:57.110><c> size</c><00:06:57.379><c> and</c><00:06:57.740><c> the</c><00:06:57.800><c> weight</c><00:06:58.039><c> of</c><00:06:58.309><c> these</c>

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:58.459 align:start position:0%
felt the size and the weight of these
 

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.969 align:start position:0%
felt the size and the weight of these
dragons<00:06:58.729><c> I</c><00:06:59.059><c> realized</c><00:06:59.569><c> why</c><00:06:59.869><c> it's</c><00:07:00.259><c> because</c><00:07:00.830><c> what</c>

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 align:start position:0%
dragons I realized why it's because what
 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.260 align:start position:0%
dragons I realized why it's because what
they're<00:07:01.129><c> doing</c><00:07:01.159><c> is</c><00:07:01.490><c> that</c><00:07:01.550><c> they're</c><00:07:01.699><c> circling</c>

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 align:start position:0%
they're doing is that they're circling
 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.529 align:start position:0%
they're doing is that they're circling
around<00:07:02.389><c> and</c><00:07:02.959><c> so</c><00:07:03.889><c> what</c><00:07:04.729><c> it</c><00:07:04.849><c> feels</c><00:07:05.149><c> like</c><00:07:05.360><c> it's</c>

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 align:start position:0%
around and so what it feels like it's
 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.709 align:start position:0%
around and so what it feels like it's
doing<00:07:05.869><c> is</c><00:07:06.020><c> that</c><00:07:06.319><c> the</c><00:07:06.949><c> wind</c><00:07:07.399><c> and</c><00:07:07.819><c> the</c><00:07:08.330><c> weight</c>

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
doing is that the wind and the weight
 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
doing is that the wind and the weight
and<00:07:08.749><c> the</c><00:07:09.169><c> strength</c><00:07:09.559><c> of</c><00:07:09.770><c> them</c><00:07:10.069><c> circling</c><00:07:10.520><c> around</c>

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 align:start position:0%
and the strength of them circling around
 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.049 align:start position:0%
and the strength of them circling around
is<00:07:11.180><c> shaking</c><00:07:12.169><c> the</c><00:07:12.349><c> camera</c><00:07:12.619><c> so</c><00:07:13.459><c> there</c><00:07:13.759><c> it's</c>

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:14.059 align:start position:0%
is shaking the camera so there it's
 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.209 align:start position:0%
is shaking the camera so there it's
really<00:07:14.360><c> justified</c><00:07:15.139><c> it</c><00:07:15.379><c> isn't</c><00:07:15.709><c> just</c><00:07:15.830><c> shaking</c>

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:16.219 align:start position:0%
really justified it isn't just shaking
 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.189 align:start position:0%
really justified it isn't just shaking
for<00:07:16.369><c> no</c><00:07:16.490><c> reason</c><00:07:16.909><c> it</c><00:07:17.059><c> makes</c><00:07:17.389><c> you</c><00:07:17.539><c> actually</c><00:07:17.930><c> feel</c>

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
for no reason it makes you actually feel
 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.929 align:start position:0%
for no reason it makes you actually feel
the<00:07:18.469><c> size</c><00:07:18.800><c> of</c><00:07:19.219><c> these</c><00:07:19.369><c> things</c>

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:19.939 align:start position:0%
the size of these things
 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.170 align:start position:0%
the size of these things
and<00:07:20.059><c> it's</c><00:07:20.479><c> such</c><00:07:20.689><c> a</c><00:07:20.839><c> subtle</c><00:07:21.259><c> little</c><00:07:21.919><c> touch</c><00:07:22.309><c> but</c>

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 align:start position:0%
and it's such a subtle little touch but
 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.379 align:start position:0%
and it's such a subtle little touch but
I<00:07:23.360><c> imagine</c><00:07:23.689><c> that</c><00:07:24.020><c> scene</c><00:07:24.199><c> if</c><00:07:24.349><c> you</c><00:07:24.499><c> took</c><00:07:24.770><c> out</c><00:07:25.389><c> the</c>

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 align:start position:0%
I imagine that scene if you took out the
 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.509 align:start position:0%
I imagine that scene if you took out the
little<00:07:26.809><c> shaking</c><00:07:27.259><c> of</c><00:07:27.409><c> it</c><00:07:27.589><c> I</c><00:07:27.740><c> mean</c><00:07:28.009><c> it'd</c><00:07:28.279><c> still</c>

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:28.519 align:start position:0%
little shaking of it I mean it'd still
 

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.829 align:start position:0%
little shaking of it I mean it'd still
be<00:07:28.669><c> good</c><00:07:28.879><c> but</c><00:07:29.089><c> it</c><00:07:29.149><c> wouldn't</c><00:07:29.300><c> be</c><00:07:29.389><c> nearly</c><00:07:29.659><c> as</c>

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
be good but it wouldn't be nearly as
 

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:33.369 align:start position:0%
be good but it wouldn't be nearly as
impressive<00:07:30.319><c> just</c><00:07:31.219><c> that</c><00:07:31.509><c> little</c><00:07:32.509><c> shaking</c><00:07:33.169><c> when</c>

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:33.379 align:start position:0%
impressive just that little shaking when
 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
impressive just that little shaking when
the<00:07:33.619><c> dragons</c><00:07:34.459><c> are</c><00:07:34.639><c> circling</c><00:07:35.059><c> around</c><00:07:35.649><c> worked</c>

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:36.649 align:start position:0%
the dragons are circling around worked
 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:38.469 align:start position:0%
the dragons are circling around worked
out<00:07:36.830><c> really</c><00:07:37.249><c> really</c><00:07:37.459><c> well</c><00:07:37.999><c> and</c><00:07:38.149><c> that</c><00:07:38.209><c> sound</c>

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
out really really well and that sound
 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.540 align:start position:0%
out really really well and that sound
does<00:07:38.629><c> I</c><00:07:38.749><c> do</c><00:07:38.809><c> with</c><00:07:39.169><c> the</c><00:07:39.319><c> drive</c><00:07:39.649><c> room</c><00:07:39.919><c> although</c>

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550 align:start position:0%
does I do with the drive room although
 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.579 align:start position:0%
does I do with the drive room although
those<00:07:40.969><c> sounds</c><00:07:41.509><c> going</c><00:07:41.689><c> at</c><00:07:41.959><c> me</c><00:07:42.050><c> that</c><00:07:42.229><c> that</c><00:07:42.469><c> was</c>

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:42.589 align:start position:0%
those sounds going at me that that was
 

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:43.179 align:start position:0%
those sounds going at me that that was
really<00:07:42.709><c> great</c>

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:43.189 align:start position:0%
really great
 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:45.459 align:start position:0%
really great
but<00:07:43.580><c> I</c><00:07:43.759><c> think</c><00:07:44.089><c> something</c><00:07:44.749><c> about</c><00:07:44.839><c> that</c><00:07:45.139><c> shaking</c>

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:45.469 align:start position:0%
but I think something about that shaking
 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:48.489 align:start position:0%
but I think something about that shaking
again<00:07:45.740><c> uh</c><00:07:46.479><c> it</c><00:07:47.479><c> just</c><00:07:47.719><c> gave</c><00:07:47.869><c> it</c><00:07:47.990><c> that</c><00:07:48.110><c> little</c>

00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:48.499 align:start position:0%
again uh it just gave it that little
