and if you had access to their speed you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570
and if you had access to their speed you
 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.780
and if you had access to their speed you
could write a fairly simple bit of code

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
could write a fairly simple bit of code
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.310

certain threshold say four miles per
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.840
certain threshold say four miles per
hour then this person must be walking

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850

thank you thank you so hi everybody
we've seen a lot of great stuff that's

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:40.220
we've seen a lot of great stuff that's
 

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.220
we've seen a lot of great stuff that's
available on Android we've seen how some

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:42.230
available on Android we've seen how some
 

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.900
available on Android we've seen how some
of the native API is and Android can be

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:43.910
of the native API is and Android can be
 

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.520
of the native API is and Android can be
used with machine learning and we've

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:45.530
used with machine learning and we've
 

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.040
used with machine learning and we've
also seen how ml kits can be used with

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:48.050
also seen how ml kits can be used with
 

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.290
also seen how ml kits can be used with
pre-existing models as well as building

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:50.300
pre-existing models as well as building
 

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.270

your own models I'm gonna switch gears a

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:52.280
your own models I'm gonna switch gears a
 

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.040
your own models I'm gonna switch gears a
little bit and talk about tensor flow

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:54.050
little bit and talk about tensor flow
 

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.140
little bit and talk about tensor flow
and how tensor flow can be used for

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:56.150
and how tensor flow can be used for
 

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.120
and how tensor flow can be used for
building custom models that could be

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.130
building custom models that could be
 

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.770
building custom models that could be
deployed into ml kit or could be

00:32:59.770 --> 00:32:59.780
deployed into ml kit or could be
 

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.590
deployed into ml kit or could be
deployed directly to your device who

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600
deployed directly to your device who
 

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.830
deployed directly to your device who
here has never heard of tensor flow okay

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840
here has never heard of tensor flow okay
 

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.880
here has never heard of tensor flow okay
I'm doing my job good one so going back

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:09.890
I'm doing my job good one so going back
 

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.650
I'm doing my job good one so going back
to what matei mentioned earlier on so

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:11.660
to what matei mentioned earlier on so
 

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.870
to what matei mentioned earlier on so
tensor flow is our API for building

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880
tensor flow is our API for building
 

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.580
tensor flow is our API for building
machine learning and for running machine

slides from earlier on the whole idea

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:19.460
slides from earlier on the whole idea
 

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.250
slides from earlier on the whole idea
around machine learning is I like to

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:21.260
around machine learning is I like to
 

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.720
around machine learning is I like to
think of it as a new programming

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:22.730
think of it as a new programming
 

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.330
think of it as a new programming
paradigm we're also for developers and

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:25.340
paradigm we're also for developers and
 

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.160
paradigm we're also for developers and
it's a new way for us to write code to

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:27.170
it's a new way for us to write code to
 

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.740
it's a new way for us to write code to
open up new scenarios and instead of us

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:29.750
open up new scenarios and instead of us
 

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.540
open up new scenarios and instead of us
thinking of the rules and expressing

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:31.550
thinking of the rules and expressing
 

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.790
thinking of the rules and expressing
them in code ourselves what if we could

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:33.800
them in code ourselves what if we could
 

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.700
them in code ourselves what if we could
actually label a bunch of data and then

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:36.710
actually label a bunch of data and then
 

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.800
actually label a bunch of data and then
have the machine in fair the rules that

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:38.810
have the machine in fair the rules that
 

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.020
have the machine in fair the rules that
make that actual data and that you know

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:41.030
make that actual data and that you know
 

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.400
make that actual data and that you know
if you come away with nothing else about

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:42.410
if you come away with nothing else about
 

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.900
if you come away with nothing else about
machine learning think about it in that

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:43.910
machine learning think about it in that
 

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.720
machine learning think about it in that

Android so I'm going to give a quick

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:23.899
Android so I'm going to give a quick
 

00:34:23.899 --> 00:34:26.070
Android so I'm going to give a quick
demo if we can switch to the laptop

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:26.080
demo if we can switch to the laptop
 

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.840
demo if we can switch to the laptop
so here I've designed a simple

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:28.850
so here I've designed a simple
 

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.430
so here I've designed a simple
neural network that I could come up with

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440
neural network that I could come up with
 

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.670
neural network that I could come up with
at the back if you cannot read this code

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:33.680
at the back if you cannot read this code
 

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.750
at the back if you cannot read this code
just go like that you cannot read it

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760
just go like that you cannot read it
 

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.250
just go like that you cannot read it
okay I'll make it bigger or do you just

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:39.260
okay I'll make it bigger or do you just
 

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.690
okay I'll make it bigger or do you just
like doing this is that is that good if

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:43.700
like doing this is that is that good if
 

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.680
like doing this is that is that good if
you can read it go like this okay

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:46.690
you can read it go like this okay
 

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.720
you can read it go like this okay
so this is the simplest neural network I

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:49.730
so this is the simplest neural network I
 

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:50.830
so this is the simplest neural network I
could come up with where if you can

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:50.840
could come up with where if you can
 

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.170
could come up with where if you can
imagine your neural network is a series

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.180
imagine your neural network is a series
 

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.760
imagine your neural network is a series
of connected layers of these things

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:54.770
of connected layers of these things
 

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.340
of connected layers of these things
called neurons and so in this one I have

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:57.350
called neurons and so in this one I have
 

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.470
called neurons and so in this one I have
a single layer and it has a single

00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480
a single layer and it has a single
 

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.900
a single layer and it has a single
neuron in it so it's basically just a

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:01.910
neuron in it so it's basically just a
 

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.100
neuron in it so it's basically just a
simple function that calculates

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.110
simple function that calculates
 

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.800
simple function that calculates
something so I'm going to feed that with

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:05.810
something so I'm going to feed that with
 

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.480
something so I'm going to feed that with
a bunch of data and here's the

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:07.490
a bunch of data and here's the
 

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.880
a bunch of data and here's the
relationships between the data on here

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:09.890
relationships between the data on here
 

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.170
relationships between the data on here
my X's and my Y's

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.180
my X's and my Y's
 

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.390
my X's and my Y's
can anybody figure out what these data

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400
can anybody figure out what these data
 

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.920
can anybody figure out what these data
are actually doing if you're on my

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:14.930
are actually doing if you're on my
 

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.390
are actually doing if you're on my
earlier talk you've seen this already I

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400
earlier talk you've seen this already I
 

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.880
earlier talk you've seen this already I
know but the 0 and the 32 might be a

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:18.890
know but the 0 and the 32 might be a
 

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.210
know but the 0 and the 32 might be a
clue yeah it's Celsius to Fahrenheit

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:22.220
clue yeah it's Celsius to Fahrenheit
 

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.460
clue yeah it's Celsius to Fahrenheit

by the name F to see how I thought that

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:26.780
by the name F to see how I thought that
 

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.730

was French to Cantonese but so what I'm

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:30.740
was French to Cantonese but so what I'm
 

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.930
was French to Cantonese but so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna give it a

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:31.940
gonna do is I'm just gonna give it a
 

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.730
gonna do is I'm just gonna give it a
bunch of data and then what a neural

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:33.740
bunch of data and then what a neural
 

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:34.870
bunch of data and then what a neural
network will do is it will iterate

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880
network will do is it will iterate
 

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.460
network will do is it will iterate
across that data and figure out the

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:36.470
across that data and figure out the
 

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.320
across that data and figure out the
patterns between them so I'm gonna run

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:38.330
patterns between them so I'm gonna run
 

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.000
patterns between them so I'm gonna run
that I know we're short on time and the

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.010
that I know we're short on time and the
 

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.380
that I know we're short on time and the
party's coming up so let me run through

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:41.390
party's coming up so let me run through
 

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.510
party's coming up so let me run through
it quickly so it's gone through five

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520
it quickly so it's gone through five
 

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.490
it quickly so it's gone through five
hundred iterations of trying to figure

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:45.500
hundred iterations of trying to figure
 

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.920
hundred iterations of trying to figure
out the pattern and at the bottom this

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:47.930
out the pattern and at the bottom this
 

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.780
out the pattern and at the bottom this
is so big I have to scroll forever and

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:49.790
is so big I have to scroll forever and
 

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.780
is so big I have to scroll forever and
then at the bottom I'll go on to this

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:52.790
then at the bottom I'll go on to this
 

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.820
then at the bottom I'll go on to this
node so if I for example pass it and a

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:54.830
node so if I for example pass it and a
 

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.010
node so if I for example pass it and a
hundred and a 100 degrees centigrade is

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.020
hundred and a 100 degrees centigrade is
 

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.590
hundred and a 100 degrees centigrade is
212 Fahrenheit if I run it I'm getting

00:35:59.590 --> 00:35:59.600
212 Fahrenheit if I run it I'm getting
 

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.380
212 Fahrenheit if I run it I'm getting
211 point 3 because I only had a small

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:02.390
211 point 3 because I only had a small
 

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.630
211 point 3 because I only had a small
amount of data I only had 6 values and

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640
amount of data I only had 6 values and
 

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.580
amount of data I only had 6 values and
it's given me a very high probability of

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:06.590
it's given me a very high probability of
 

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.590
it's given me a very high probability of
the relationship between those in the

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:08.600
the relationship between those in the
 

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.450
the relationship between those in the
two numbers being centigrade to

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:10.460
two numbers being centigrade to
 

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.400
two numbers being centigrade to
Fahrenheit so now I've built a model

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:12.410
Fahrenheit so now I've built a model
 

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.830
Fahrenheit so now I've built a model
it's a very very simple model but what

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:14.840
it's a very very simple model but what
 

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.030
it's a very very simple model but what
am I gonna do with it I want to use that

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040
am I gonna do with it I want to use that
 

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.390
am I gonna do with it I want to use that
on mobile so we're tensorflow the first

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400
on mobile so we're tensorflow the first
 

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.100
on mobile so we're tensorflow the first
thing that you have to do is you save it

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:21.110
thing that you have to do is you save it
 

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.080
thing that you have to do is you save it
out and we've got a format called saved

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.090
out and we've got a format called saved
 

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.730
out and we've got a format called saved
model which is used as a consistent

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:24.740
model which is used as a consistent
 

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.040
model which is used as a consistent
format across everything so I'm gonna

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.050
format across everything so I'm gonna
 

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.140
format across everything so I'm gonna
save this out as a save model with the

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:29.150
save this out as a save model with the
 

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.690
save this out as a save model with the
save Kerris model like this and when

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:31.700
save Kerris model like this and when
 

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.610
save Kerris model like this and when
that saves out hopefully if it does

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:33.620
that saves out hopefully if it does
 

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.740
that saves out hopefully if it does
after a bunch of warnings it's gonna

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:35.750
after a bunch of warnings it's gonna
 

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.690
after a bunch of warnings it's gonna
give me the path that it saved it to and

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:37.700
give me the path that it saved it to and
 

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.380
give me the path that it saved it to and
I'm gonna take that and this notebook is

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:41.390
I'm gonna take that and this notebook is
 

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.760
I'm gonna take that and this notebook is
online I'll share the code

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:42.770
online I'll share the code
 

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.890
online I'll share the code
for it in a moment and I'm gonna run

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:44.900
for it in a moment and I'm gonna run
 

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.230
for it in a moment and I'm gonna run
that in here and now what it's doing is

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240
that in here and now what it's doing is
 

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.750
that in here and now what it's doing is
it's calling the TF light converter to

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760
it's calling the TF light converter to
 

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.910
it's calling the TF light converter to
convert that model to TF lye and it's

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920
convert that model to TF lye and it's
 

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.520
convert that model to TF lye and it's
given me a number here 620 can anybody

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:54.530
given me a number here 620 can anybody
 

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.870
given me a number here 620 can anybody
guess what that number is it's not an

00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880
guess what that number is it's not an
 

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.750
guess what that number is it's not an
HTTP code it's the size so that model

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760
HTTP code it's the size so that model
 

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.370
HTTP code it's the size so that model
that I just built that's the size and

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:03.380
that I just built that's the size and
 

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.520
that I just built that's the size and
bytes so 620 bytes and I have a model

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.530
bytes so 620 bytes and I have a model
 

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.040
bytes so 620 bytes and I have a model
called TF lights

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:08.050
called TF lights
 

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.840
called TF lights
sorry called model TF light that has

sorry called model TF light that has
 

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.970
sorry called model TF light that has
been saved out of my temp directory and

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:12.980
been saved out of my temp directory and
 

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.530
been saved out of my temp directory and
it's right here so I can now download

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:14.540
it's right here so I can now download
 

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.210
it's right here so I can now download
that model and use that on Android

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:16.220
that model and use that on Android
 

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.830
that model and use that on Android
can we switch back to their slides

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:17.840
can we switch back to their slides
 

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.820
can we switch back to their slides
please so now that I have that model

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:21.830
please so now that I have that model
 

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.800
please so now that I have that model
this is the conversion process that I

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:23.810
this is the conversion process that I
 

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.750
this is the conversion process that I
went through I built an intense flow I

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760
went through I built an intense flow I
 

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.310
went through I built an intense flow I
saved it out I used the TF light

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:27.320
saved it out I used the TF light
 

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.410
saved it out I used the TF light
converter and then I created a TF light

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:29.420
converter and then I created a TF light
 

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.240
converter and then I created a TF light
model out of that and here's the code

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:31.250
model out of that and here's the code
 

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.060
model out of that and here's the code
that I showed to do that this QR code is

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:34.070
that I showed to do that this QR code is
 

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.760
that I showed to do that this QR code is
the URI of the notebook that I just

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:36.770
the URI of the notebook that I just
 

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.260
the URI of the notebook that I just
showed so if you want to play with the

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:38.270
showed so if you want to play with the
 

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.200
showed so if you want to play with the
notebook for yourself it's on there so

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:41.210
notebook for yourself it's on there so
 

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.870
notebook for yourself it's on there so
now what runtime the model the the

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880
now what runtime the model the the
 

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.150
now what runtime the model the the
diagram becomes we feed data into the

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160
diagram becomes we feed data into the
 

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.640
diagram becomes we feed data into the
model and we get predictions out so what

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:48.650
model and we get predictions out so what
 

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.140
model and we get predictions out so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run this model

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.150
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run this model
 

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.630
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run this model
on mobile using Cartland so to be able

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640
on mobile using Cartland so to be able
 

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.550
on mobile using Cartland so to be able
to do that first of all I deploy my

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560
to do that first of all I deploy my
 

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.370
to do that first of all I deploy my
model to my Android device as a as an

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.380
model to my Android device as a as an
 

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.800
model to my Android device as a as an
asset file that asset filed again can be

00:37:59.800 --> 00:37:59.810
asset file that asset filed again can be
 

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.660
asset file that asset filed again can be
just treated like any other assets in

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:01.670
just treated like any other assets in
 

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:04.510
just treated like any other assets in
Android now one thing that on Android

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520
Android now one thing that on Android
 

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.220
Android now one thing that on Android
and the number one bug when I work with

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:06.230
and the number one bug when I work with
 

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.349
and the number one bug when I work with
people who use TF light one thing is

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359
people who use TF light one thing is
 

00:38:08.359 --> 00:38:11.340
people who use TF light one thing is
that when you deploy assets to Android

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:11.350
that when you deploy assets to Android
 

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.599
that when you deploy assets to Android
Android itself actually zips up those

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:13.609
Android itself actually zips up those
 

00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:15.820
Android itself actually zips up those
assets it compresses them and TF light

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:15.830
assets it compresses them and TF light
 

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.320
assets it compresses them and TF light
won't be able to interpret it if it's

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:17.330
won't be able to interpret it if it's
 

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.960
won't be able to interpret it if it's
compressed so in your a apt options make

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:19.970
compressed so in your a apt options make
 

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.680
compressed so in your a apt options make
sure you say do not compressed EF light

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:22.690
sure you say do not compressed EF light
 

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.530
sure you say do not compressed EF light
then I in my builder cradle I just set

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:26.540
then I in my builder cradle I just set
 

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.090
then I in my builder cradle I just set
the implementation to give me ten to

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.100
the implementation to give me ten to
 

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.070
the implementation to give me ten to
float our lights are tense flow light

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.080
float our lights are tense flow light
 

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.710
float our lights are tense flow light
and now in my code I'm gonna do a couple

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720
and now in my code I'm gonna do a couple
 

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.270
and now in my code I'm gonna do a couple
of things so first of all I have to

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280
of things so first of all I have to
 

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.520
of things so first of all I have to
create an instance of a TF light

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:36.530
create an instance of a TF light
 

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.109
create an instance of a TF light
interpreter and something called a

00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119
interpreter and something called a
 

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:40.599
interpreter and something called a
mapped byte buffer the map byte buffer

00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:40.609
mapped byte buffer the map byte buffer
 

00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:42.310
mapped byte buffer the map byte buffer
what I'm doing said that's just reading

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320
what I'm doing said that's just reading
 

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.230
what I'm doing said that's just reading
the model out of assets so that I can

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240
the model out of assets so that I can
 

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.910
the model out of assets so that I can
create an instance of that model I'm

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920
create an instance of that model I'm
 

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.130
create an instance of that model I'm
gonna set in the options the number of

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:48.140
gonna set in the options the number of
 

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.870
gonna set in the options the number of
threads I want the model to run on and

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880
threads I want the model to run on and
 

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.880
threads I want the model to run on and
then the interpreter itself can then run

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:51.890
then the interpreter itself can then run
 

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.430
then the interpreter itself can then run
on those my code itself and I'm gonna

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440
on those my code itself and I'm gonna
 

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.630
on those my code itself and I'm gonna
skip over this slide because we're

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640
skip over this slide because we're
 

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.180
skip over this slide because we're
running at it

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:56.190
running at it
 

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.250
running at it
I'm just gonna show it in the demo so

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260
I'm just gonna show it in the demo so
 

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.740
I'm just gonna show it in the demo so
can we switch to the demo machine please

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:02.750
 

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.349
so I have a very simple application

00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359
so I have a very simple application
 

00:39:06.359 --> 00:39:08.510
so I have a very simple application
running in the emulator here this

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520
running in the emulator here this
 

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.250
running in the emulator here this
application all it has is a single

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260
application all it has is a single
 

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.260
application all it has is a single
button that says do inference but when I

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:12.270
button that says do inference but when I
 

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.880
button that says do inference but when I
click that I'm gonna get a breakpoints

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:13.890
click that I'm gonna get a breakpoints
 

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.650
click that I'm gonna get a breakpoints
and now here's the breakpoint with my

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660
and now here's the breakpoint with my
 

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.020
and now here's the breakpoint with my
actual code so I want to pass the number

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.030
actual code so I want to pass the number
 

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:21.230
actual code so I want to pass the number
100 into the model and get back like 211

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240
100 into the model and get back like 211
 

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.359
100 into the model and get back like 211
and change so that's the conversion of

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:23.369
and change so that's the conversion of
 

00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:25.849
and change so that's the conversion of
one temperature to another so I've

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859
one temperature to another so I've
 

00:39:25.859 --> 00:39:27.829
one temperature to another so I've
created an array and it's just a simple

00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839
created an array and it's just a simple
 

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:29.780
created an array and it's just a simple
array with one element in it and that

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:29.790
array with one element in it and that
 

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.280
array with one element in it and that
element contains the hundred that I'm

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:31.290
element contains the hundred that I'm
 

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.829
element contains the hundred that I'm
passing in my output value is going to

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839
passing in my output value is going to
 

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:36.140
passing in my output value is going to
be a byte buffer because the model is

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.150
be a byte buffer because the model is
 

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.670
be a byte buffer because the model is
gonna feed me back a stream of bytes

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680
gonna feed me back a stream of bytes
 

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.950
gonna feed me back a stream of bytes
we're going really low level with this

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960
we're going really low level with this
 

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.960
we're going really low level with this
but I know that those bytes are gonna be

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:41.970
but I know that those bytes are gonna be
 

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:44.240
but I know that those bytes are gonna be
a float and a float is four bytes so I'm

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:44.250
a float and a float is four bytes so I'm
 

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.920
a float and a float is four bytes so I'm
just allocating a byte buffer with four

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:45.930
just allocating a byte buffer with four
 

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.839
just allocating a byte buffer with four
bytes and then I'm gonna step through

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:47.849
bytes and then I'm gonna step through
 

00:39:47.849 --> 00:39:50.839
bytes and then I'm gonna step through
this and I'm gonna run it and when I run

00:39:50.839 --> 00:39:50.849
this and I'm gonna run it and when I run
 

00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:52.579
this and I'm gonna run it and when I run
it I'm passing to tensorflow lights

00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:52.589
it I'm passing to tensorflow lights
 

00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:55.490
it I'm passing to tensorflow lights
interpreter the input value of my input

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500
interpreter the input value of my input
 

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.500
interpreter the input value of my input
value array and then my output value

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:57.510
value array and then my output value
 

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.120
value array and then my output value
array where it's gonna write the answer

00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.130
array where it's gonna write the answer
 

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.000
array where it's gonna write the answer
so it writes the answer into that and

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.010
so it writes the answer into that and
 

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.339
so it writes the answer into that and
now I can read the answer out of that by

00:40:04.339 --> 00:40:04.349
now I can read the answer out of that by
 

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:06.410
now I can read the answer out of that by
just calling the get float of that byte

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420
just calling the get float of that byte
 

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.329
just calling the get float of that byte
buffer and we'll see here in the debug

00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339
buffer and we'll see here in the debug
 

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.910
buffer and we'll see here in the debug
that it was 211 and change so it's a

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920
that it was 211 and change so it's a
 

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.480
that it was 211 and change so it's a
very very simple example and it seems a

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:14.490
very very simple example and it seems a
 

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.309
very very simple example and it seems a
little bit complex with me using these

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319
little bit complex with me using these
 

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:17.990
little bit complex with me using these
arrays and these byte buffers to do it

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000
arrays and these byte buffers to do it
 

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.700
arrays and these byte buffers to do it
but the idea is that it's going to be

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:19.710
but the idea is that it's going to be
 

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.829
but the idea is that it's going to be
exactly the same code pattern that you

00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839
exactly the same code pattern that you
 

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:24.050
exactly the same code pattern that you
use for a far more complex example we

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060
use for a far more complex example we
 

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.309
use for a far more complex example we
kind of just want to make it so that

00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319
kind of just want to make it so that
 

00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:26.900
kind of just want to make it so that
it's consistent regardless of the

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:26.910
it's consistent regardless of the
 

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.000
it's consistent regardless of the
example that you use and I also want to

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.010
example that you use and I also want to
 

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.160
