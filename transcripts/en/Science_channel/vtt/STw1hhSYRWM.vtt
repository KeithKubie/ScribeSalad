Narrator:
DUMPLINGS ARE A POPULAR CUISINE

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.367
MADE BY A VARIETY OF FLAVORS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.567
THEY CAN BE SWEET OR SAVORY,

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.367
STEAMED, BOILED,
BAKED, OR FRIED.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.434
IN CHINESE CUISINE, DUMPLINGS
HAVE BEEN REFINED TO AN ART FORM

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.434
AND ARE OFTEN EATEN ON SPECIAL
OCCASIONS LIKE CHINESE NEW YEAR.

00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:26.667
TO MAKE A DUMPLING,
YOU FIRST WRAP A THIN LAYER

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.968
OF DOUGH AROUND A FILLING.

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:31.934
DUMPLINGS CAN COME IN
MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:34.501
THESE ARE FILLED
WITH SHRIMP AND PORK.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.734
FOOD-PREP TECHNICIANS
AT THIS FACILITY PEEL, DEVEIN,

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.901
AND SORT SHRIMP FOR
DIFFERENT KINDS OF DUMPLINGS.

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.467
AS THEY WORK,
THEY DOUBLE-CHECK EACH SHRIMP

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.434
FOR FRESHNESS AND QUALITY.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:50.734
THE 30 PEOPLE WORKING
AT THIS STATION

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:55.133
CAN PEEL 10,000 SHRIMP PER HOUR.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.367
TO MAKE THE DUMPLING DOUGH,
TECHNICIANS BEGIN THE PROCESS

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:02.501
BY POURING ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
INTO THIS LARGE MIXING BOWL.

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:10.434
THEY ADD WATER AT A RATIO OF TWO
PARTS FLOUR TO ONE PART WATER.

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:13.868
A LARGE DOUGH HOOK MIXES
THE TWO INGREDIENTS TOGETHER.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:20.400
PERIODICALLY, THE TECHNICIANS
STOP THE MACHINE

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.534
TO MANUALLY TEST THE DOUGH
FOR CONSISTENCY.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:26.767
IT'S NOT READY YET.

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:29.501
AFTER MORE MIXING,
THEY TEST IT AGAIN.

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:33.767
THIS TIME, IT'S JUST RIGHT --
SOFT AND STILL ELASTIC.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:38.901
TO STRENGTHEN
THE DOUGH STRUCTURE,

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:42.501
A WORKER BEGINS FOLDING
AND ROLLING IT INTO LENGTHS.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:48.868
♪♪

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:51.667
AT THE NEXT STATION,
FOOD-PREP TECHNICIANS

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.067
RIP SMALL CHUNKS OFF THE ROLLS.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.334
THEN THEY WEIGH THE CHUNKS
TO ENSURE

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:03.300
THEY MEET THE PARAMETER
OF JUST 0.28 OUNCES APIECE.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.901
TWO ADDITIONAL TECHNICIANS
COLLECT THE CHUNKS

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:10.234
AND FOLLOW A TWO-STEP PROCESS
IN WHICH THEY STAND EACH PIECE

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:13.000
ON ITS ROUND END
BEFORE FLATTENING IT.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:20.000
THEY SPRINKLE THE ROUND DISKS
WITH FLOUR TO KEEP THEM

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.834
FROM STICKING TO EACH OTHER
WHEN MOVED TO THE NEXT STATION.

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:31.067
THE NEXT STEP USES
TRADITIONAL COOKING TOOLS

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:34.200
TO TRANSFORM EACH DISK
INTO A WRAPPER

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.834
FOR A DUMPLING KNOWN
AS SHAO MAI.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:42.100
THE FOOD-PREP TECHNICIANS
WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100
TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.434
IN-HOUSE QUALITY CONTROL
INSPECTORS TEST

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:50.033
THE AIRBORNE BACTERIA LEVELS
IN THE FACILITY EVERY MONTH

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:53.167
TO ENSURE THAT IT MEETS
THE NECESSARY STANDARDS.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:57.634
♪♪

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:02.033
CREATING THE SHAO MAI WRAPPER
REQUIRES HIGH LEVELS OF SKILL.

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:05.834
THIS WORKER'S RIGHT HAND ROLLS
THE DOUGH WHILE HIS LEFT HAND

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:09.434
ROTATES THE WRAPPER IN
PERFECTLY COORDINATED MOVEMENTS,

00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:12.834
TURNING OUT WAFER-THIN ROUNDS
AT HIGH SPEED.

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:18.634
A SECOND WORKER USES A DIFFERENT
STYLE OF ROLLING PIN

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:20.767
TO CRIMP THE EDGES
OF THE WRAPPING.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.934
THE TECHNICIANS ON THE LEFT USE
A WOODEN SPATULA

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:30.234
TO SCOOP A PORTION
OF FILLING INTO EACH WRAPPER

00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:34.467
BEFORE PLACING THEM ON A SCALE
TO ENSURE THE WEIGHT IS CORRECT.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:41.667
TECHNICIANS ON THE RIGHT TOP
OFF EACH DUMPLING WITH A SHRIMP.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:48.501
INSERTING THE SHRIMP
IS ANOTHER STEP

00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:51.701
THAT REQUIRES CAREFULLY
ORCHESTRATED HAND MOVEMENTS

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.734
TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK
WITH SPEED AND ELEGANCE.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:59.334
THE WORKER IS ABLE TO CAREFULLY
TUCK THE SHRIMP INTO PLACE

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:02.067
WITH EFFORTLESS MOVEMENTS
OF ONE HAND.

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:08.767
DUMPLINGS
COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES.

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:11.834
AT ANOTHER TABLE,
WORKERS ASSEMBLE A DELICACY

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.501
IN THE SHAPE OF A HALF-MOON.

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.133
THESE DUMPLINGS START OUT WITH
THE SAME DISK-SHAPED WRAPPER

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.934
AND THE SAME SHAO MAI FILLING.

00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:25.601
NEXT, A WORKER USES A SPECIAL
CRIMPING TECHNIQUE,

00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.467
PINCHING A SERIES
OF SMALL CREASES IN THE DOUGH

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.167
TO SEAL THEM IN
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.734
BY CAREFULLY ARRANGING
EACH DUMPLING,

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:40.734
TECHNICIANS CAN FIT NEARLY
88 OF THEM IN ONE PAN.

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:43.334
THANKS TO AN AMAZING ARTISANAL
ASSEMBLY LINE

00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:44.868
OF SKILLED WORKERS,

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.968
THE FINAL PRODUCT IS
ALMOST TOO BEAUTIFUL TO EAT.
