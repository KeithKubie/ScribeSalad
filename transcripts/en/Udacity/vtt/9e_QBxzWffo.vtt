00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:03.154
If there’s lots of oxygen down here, means there’s

00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:06.423
less oxygen up here where planes fly. And in

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:08.769
fact if we go to 10,000 meters, which is about

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.588
cruising altitude for your typical jet, the pressure

00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:15.820
is one-third of what it is at sea level. And therefore the

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.019
density is also one-third of what it is at sea level. So,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.019
maybe you’re ready to answer our original question.
