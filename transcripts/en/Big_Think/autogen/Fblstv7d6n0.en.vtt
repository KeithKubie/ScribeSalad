00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
whatever that's just plainer and to some
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149
whatever that's just plainer and to some
extent it is you know I think that this

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
extent it is you know I think that this
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.050
extent it is you know I think that this
up I think there's an element in our in

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
up I think there's an element in our in
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.129
up I think there's an element in our in
a kind of there's almost like a sort of

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:10.139
a kind of there's almost like a sort of
 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.860
a kind of there's almost like a sort of
I think probably in every novelists in a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
I think probably in every novelists in a
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.100
I think probably in every novelists in a
way

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
way
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.690
way
you know it comes out it'll be right

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
you know it comes out it'll be right
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.220
you know it comes out it'll be right
here I think this is an element of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230
here I think this is an element of
 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.870
here I think this is an element of
wanting to sort of to try different

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
wanting to sort of to try different
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.460
wanting to sort of to try different
