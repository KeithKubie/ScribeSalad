00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:07.456
&gt;&gt;For about eight or nine years,
we were considered a failing school

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.336
and we knew that we
had to restructure

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:12.066
in order to keep our school open.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.076
&gt;&gt;My name is Shana Oliver and
I'm the academic facilitator here

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:17.976
at Cochrane Collegiate Academy.

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:22.326
&gt;&gt;The big part of what we do here is
the professional development piece.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:25.516
&gt;&gt;You know, the way we do
professional development

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:29.976
and training is very specific
on enhancing their skill set.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:46.276
&gt;&gt;Shana: -- the key learning
and the unit essential question.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.446
The concepts are going to change
because we're going to look

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:52.496
at so many different components of
professional development as we go.

00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:55.346
My job here is to provide
our teachers

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:59.236
with professional development
strategies that they can learn

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:03.536
in here, through modeling,
through experience, and take those

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:05.766
out to our students
to help our students

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.516
to be successful in the classroom.

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:11.886
&gt;&gt;We have to have them say
and do from beginning to end.

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:14.626
And that's why we call
it interactive learning.

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.836
It's just not interactive
when it's time to work

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:17.876
on the independent practice.

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:21.446
&gt;&gt;The non negotiables are,
I guess, like the rules

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:24.836
that govern our classroom practices.

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:27.856
Every day, every teacher in
every classroom must adhere

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:29.136
to the non negotiables.

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:32.456
These are the things that we
learn that we have to do in order

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.716
for our students to be successful.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:37.336
The essential question is the big
question that the students have

00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:39.386
to be able to answer at
the end of the lesson.

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:42.256
That's the first of our
main non negotiables.

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:45.616
That's how we know whether our
students got it or didn't get it.

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.456
&gt;&gt;Angela: It says, how
do character motivations

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.666
and character traits work together

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:52.196
to help readers better
understand a character?

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:55.526
Why does a character
behave in a particular way?

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:58.146
Why does a character say
the things that they say?

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:00.856
&gt;&gt;Shana: An activating
strategy is the thing

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:03.026
that gets the students
motivated about the lesson.

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.836
What are you going to do, as
the teacher in the classroom,

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:09.266
to whet their appetite to want to
learn whatever you're teaching them?

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.496
&gt;&gt;Angela: All right, so
this is what we're gonna do.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:13.446
We're going to look
at some characters

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:16.006
that you may be familiar with,
or you may not be familiar with,

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:17.676
and gonna look at some
of their attributes.

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:23.336
&gt;&gt;So for my classroom, you may see
a movie clip, or you may see a clip

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:27.356
of the 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:34.516
I want them to interact and see
things that are relevant to them.

00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:35.976
&gt;&gt;Gimme some basic
characteristics of Urkel.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:39.906
&gt;&gt;Shana: One of our non
negotiables is limited lecture.

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:43.876
Research says that students can
only maintain their attention span

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:47.176
for their age plus
two or three minutes.

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:52.026
So when that time has elapsed,
teachers must stop at that point

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:54.066
and have students do something.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.406
&gt;&gt;Angela: I know my attention
span is pretty short,

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:59.016
so I definitely know my
students' attention span is short.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:02.636
So I probably talk for
maybe three or four minutes,

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.276
and then I let them
have a conversation.

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.506
&gt;&gt;I'll tell your group the
character type and then you guys have

00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:11.316
to draw your representation
and your scenario.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:12.086
Any questions?

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:14.816
Everybody understand
what they're doing?

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:18.376
Okay, I'm gonna allow you to choose
your own groups, groups of three.

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:18.956
Let's move.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:27.826
&gt;&gt;Shana: One of our most important
non negotiables is the use

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:29.216
of graphic organizers.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:30.446
&gt;&gt;Rosalyn: I want us to go and walk

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:33.036
through the graphic organizer
that you're gonna make.

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:34.546
It's gonna be in the
form of a Frayer diagram.

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:37.966
&gt;&gt;Shana: We know that it's
important for our students to be able

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:41.156
to conceptualize whatever
information we're giving them,

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:43.396
and that doesn't happen
with pages and pages

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:45.016
and lines of notes and copying.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.296
&gt;&gt;In the middle, you're
gonna put FOIL.

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:52.096
&gt;&gt;That graphic organizing frees
them up from taking notes,

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:55.866
allows them to plug and play and
still be involved with the lesson.

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:58.936
&gt;&gt;When I do the professional
development sessions with teachers,

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:02.926
I set it up exactly the way that
it should look in a classroom.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:06.106
&gt;&gt;It should look similar
to this in your classroom,

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:07.986
whether you're working
it down or across.

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:12.496
So for our classroom in here,
this is going to stay the same,

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:15.316
the key learning and the
unit essential question.

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:16.466
&gt;&gt;Rosalyn: The modeling that is done

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:19.926
in our profession development
interactive learning has the teacher

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.396
have to flip in their mind
from teacher to student,

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.766
which is a very interesting mindset--

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:30.556
&gt;&gt;Angela: Learning focus and those
non negotiables has been phenomenal

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:33.706
for our school, because it allows
the students to collaborate

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:38.536
and the teachers to not only involve
the students, but to engage them.

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.746
I think that was the piece
that was missing before.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:45.816
&gt;&gt;In the 2006, 2007 school
year, we were listed as one

00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:49.316
of the 30 worst performing schools
in the state of North Carolina.

00:04:49.836 --> 00:04:54.046
We have more than doubled what
our percent on grade level is

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.166
since that point in time.

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:57.106
This is the success.

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:59.906
This is what's making a
difference in our students' lives.
