00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.450
Music means a lot to us, By just putting a
record on it helps us process emotions, escape

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.089
reality, or just get really pumped up about
something.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.010
But how did that sound get on a piece of vinyl
in the first place?

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.020
And how does it make music to our ears.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.050
Hey Audiophiles Julia here for DNews

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.210
I know it seems like a simple thing, but how
do we record sounds on to vinyl?.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.929
How does this vibration produced in our throats
get carried through the air, and capture on

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:27.929
disc?

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.029
Well it wasn’t easy. for centuries there
were attempts to transcribe sound on to paper.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.510
Back in the mid-19th century, scientists were
studying how sound waves move through the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.750
air and vibrate.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
Inspired by studies of the inner ear, French
scientist Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850
tried to recreate the ear drum with a thin
membrane.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.850
Attaching this membrane to a stylus or etching
pen, he could trace the vibrations that hit

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.210
that membrane onto a piece of paper or glass.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.680
But it took at least 20 years for anyone to
realize that hey… these 2d lines on a paper,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.850
if turned into 3d grooves in something, could
be played back!

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.050
The earliest attempts at recording the human
voice go back to the 1870s.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.950
And like most inventions of that era, was
developed at Thomas Edison’s labs.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.460
Once we had sound waves figured out, there
had to be a way to mark them down somehow

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.170
and re-play them later.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.270
Edison’s labs came up with a cylinder covered
in tin foil with a needle attached to a thin

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.221
membrane called a diaphragm.

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.230
As sound waves hit the diaphragm they jiggled
the needle which etched the vibrations and

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.290
movements into the cylinder.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.250
But he wasn’t the only one working on it.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.770
Emile Berliner developed a similar system,
but his had hand crank that turned not a cylinder

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.260
but a flat disc cutting 3-dimensional grooves
of sound waves directly into it.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.740
The needle or stylus would “read” the
grooves, producing a sound that was amplified

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.450
by a horn or cone.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.250
And thus the gramophone was invented in 1887.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.220
And that’s still how analog sound is played
today.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.071
Records work on a similar principle, only
instead of recording it fresh each time, it's

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.220
recorded to a master disc and then pressed
into vinyl Today’s record players have the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.550
stylus, usually made from diamond or sapphire,
attached to a tone arm, that’s the thing

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.800
you pick up and move to put on a record.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.230
Tone arms can be straight or curved, and there’s
some debate as to which is better.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.870
And the sound isn’t amplified mechanically,
they are carried through the tone arm to a

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.660
cartridge containing coils in a magnetic field.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.780
These coils take the vibrations and amplify
them electronically through speakers.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.900
But on a warmer note, many record fans say
they sound just that.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.490
They believe records sound better and warmer
than other forms of recording because of its

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.490
fidelity.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.030
But that’s an arguable case.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.790
But maybe the rise of record players lately
is simply because many vinyl-philes say they

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.120
have an emotional connection to records.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.970
Some say it’s a nostalgia factor, others
like that records are so tangible, they’re

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.920
something you can really see and feel.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.640
Maybe it’s the appeal of the ritual, the
taking off of the jacket, placing the record

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.510
on the table and finally get the stylus, literally
in the groove.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.260
So while some might get a little down on digital,
it can be awesome, I mean modern scientists

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.370
have even found a way to listen to those Scott
de Martinville’s recordings using a virtual

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.060
stylus.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.750
Seriously.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.140
it’s creepy.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:05.400
give it a listen, there’s a link in the
description.
