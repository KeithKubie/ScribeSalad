BRIAN: Yeah!

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.900
FRANK: How you doing?
ROBBIE: Rob Wolfe.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.230
FRANK: You talked
to Danielle on the phone?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.600
BRIAN: I did.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.870
FRANK: Frank Fritz.
BRIAN: Nice to meet ya.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.030
FRANK: Pleasure.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.300
Danielle might have went
over some of this stuff.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.570
BRIAN: I grew up on a farm
in a real rural area.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.730
I like old things.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000
I've been around them
all my life, basically.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.530
BRIAN: Come on in, guys.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.730
Uh, I didn't clean.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.870
FRANK: Okay, that's good.
We like that.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.670
We like it dirty.
ROBBIE: We like it that way.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.500
ROBBIE: Oh, wow.
FRANK: Well, now we're talking.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.770
ROBBIE: Yeah, holy cow.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.070
BRIAN: Well, I've been
hauling some stuff in here.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.230
FRANK: He's got advertising,
he's got toys, he's got...

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.370
I mean, a little bit
of everything in here.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.100
Just the kind of place
you want to go to.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.700
FRANK: Gotta ask, how about
the Foremost Ice Cream?

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.200
I mean,
I'm a ice cream guy.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.130
BRIAN: Got that in Tolna.
It's local to Tolna.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.630
The store's no longer there,
but I bought it from a gentleman

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.570
that had connections
to the store.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.800
FRANK: I'll tell you
what I'm trying to do;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.430
I'm trying to make
ice cream hot.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.300
BRIAN: [chuckles]
FRANK: What are you thinking?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.170
BRIAN: 200.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.630
FRANK: Let me take
a quite look at it here.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.230
Let me grab it.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.370
BRIAN: Watch out for my bull.
FRANK: Oh, I see that.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.470
FRANK: I mean, it's got a crack
in the... it's got a crack in it

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.800
and stuff, but it's definitely
not a deal-breaker.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.200
I'll do 150.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.270
I mean, I could probably go a
little higher, but it's cracked.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.170
BRIAN: Could you go 175?

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.630
FRANK: I could go 160.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.000
BRIAN: 165.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.470
FRANK: [laughs]
You got it.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.870
Thank you.
BRIAN: More ice cream.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.570
FRANK: I'm bringing
ice cream back.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.070
It's gonna be huge!

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.870
FRANK: Oh-oh-oh!
[laughter]

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.700
FRANK: Ah!
ROBBIE: Wow, cool!

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.270
BRIAN: Isn't that neat?
FRANK: Rubber heels, non-slip.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.130
ROBBIE: Listen...
You wanna know something?

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.970
I have the display
that goes to this.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.130
BRIAN: You're kidding!

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.430
ROBBIE: It's a guy
standing there with a kit--

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.700
FRANK: You're kidding me.
ROBBIE: No, with a black cat.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.030
FRANK: Really?
ROBBIE: It's cool as can be.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.230
BRIAN: The price is going up.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.630
FRANK: Oh my god,
he's gotta have it.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.530
I could use a couple
extra inches height.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.870
ROBBIE: Well, here you go,
right here.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.170
Here's the big box.
BRIAN: [laughs]

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.230
FRANK: I need
the big one, yeah.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.330
Oh, yeah, that's
the 5/8th 2-inch ones.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.400
Yeah, that's me.
Anything to make me taller.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.600
BRIAN: What's your offer on it?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.700
ROBBIE: 150.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.100
BRIAN: You were alright
on the light, so...

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.030
ROBBIE: Okay, 150.
I appreciate it.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.170
BRIAN: I'd have them
back in a heartbeat.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.430
ROBBIE: It's been
a good day, Brian.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.100
BRIAN: I felt it's sincerely
going to a good home.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.270
I know it's cared for.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.930
We talk the same language.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.170
ROBBIE: Brian.
Hey, seriously...

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.630
FRANK: Thanks for calling.
BRIAN: You're welcome.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.930
FRANK: Appreciate it.
ROBBIE: Yeah.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.130
FRANK: See ya, Brian!
BRIAN: See you guys!

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.730
FRANK: Take care now!
BRIAN: Alright!

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.130
