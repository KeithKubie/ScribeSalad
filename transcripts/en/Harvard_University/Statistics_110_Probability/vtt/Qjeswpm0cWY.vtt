00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.770
Thought we'd start with a little
puzzle I'm trying to solve.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.530
Maybe you can help me with the puzzle,
okay?

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.900
Maybe make a little less volume, thanks.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.020
I don't need to echo that much.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.350
All right, so here's the puzzle.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.240
I thought this was
a pretty interesting one.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.405
And maybe related to what we're gonna do.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:26.658
Okay, so the question is,
what's the next number in the sequence?

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:30.942
0, 1, 2,

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:34.512
any ideas?

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:35.379
&gt;&gt; 4.

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.367
&gt;&gt; 4.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:37.602
&gt;&gt; 3.

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:38.840
&gt;&gt; 3.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.550
Any other suggestions?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.050
&gt;&gt; 1.
&gt;&gt; 1.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.350
&gt;&gt; 0.
&gt;&gt; Okay, no one has said the same number

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.265
twice, so we have no consensus at all.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:49.040
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; We have 0, 1, 4.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.880
&gt;&gt; 3.
&gt;&gt; 3.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.285
3, 2,
&gt;&gt; 5.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:52.785
&gt;&gt; 5.

00:00:56.874 --> 00:01:00.800
42, that's a good one.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.743
1 over e would be a good guess.

00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:05.645
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, any other suggestions?

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.390
One-half, one-tenth, okay.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.050
Well, I don't want to get a reason for
each of those.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.510
Is there any majority opinion on this?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.850
&gt;&gt; 3.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.618
&gt;&gt; 3, that's a, why do you say 3?

00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:22.230
&gt;&gt; Integers.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.980
&gt;&gt; Integers.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.270
Okay, 0 is an integer.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.840
Why 3?

00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:33.276
Yeah?

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:35.207
&gt;&gt; It's a value that
the Poisson could take.

00:01:35.207 --> 00:01:39.640
&gt;&gt; It's a value that
the Poisson could take, okay.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.750
But I don't have to list
them in order though,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.468
I could have listed them out of order.

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:50.880
All right, well, okay, a lot of you seem
to like the number 3, but I haven't yet

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.800
heard a good reason why.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.832
I'm kind of interested.

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:57.749
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; It's an arithmetic sequence,

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.270
I hadn't noticed that.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.230
So I guess you're pointing out that it's
an arithmetic, hey that's pretty cool.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.725
So you go from here,
add one, add one, add-

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:06.570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.360
&gt;&gt; Arithmetic sequence,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.530
okay, that might have been what
the puzzle writer had in mind.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.760
I've been trying to solve this for
the past couple days, I got stuck.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.110
&gt;&gt; I haven't thought of 3 yet.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.605
The best answer I thought of so
far was 720 factorial.

00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:25.590
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; We can debate a little bit,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.650
is that more correct or is 3 more correct?

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:33.190
Anyone,assuming it does goes this way,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.177
anyone wanna guess the next term
&gt;&gt; 3.

00:02:38.177 --> 00:02:42.068
&gt;&gt; 3 [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.330
All right, I think you got it.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.850
All right, so let me tell you why
I'm talking of this sequence.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.590
Well, it's probably just like,
I always really,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.690
I love puzzles since
the time I was little.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.760
But, I hated this kind of puzzle, because
there never seems to be a principle for

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.620
coming up with an answer.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.710
You can make up one,
I make up one thing and

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.760
the answer is suppose
to be something else.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.340
Well, what's the measure,
what's the better, right?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.930
I mean, it's a measure of
maybe the simplest answer,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.350
but will two people always
agree on what's simpler.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.030
No, right,
you need some complexity measure or

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.548
something to actually make that
into a valid, well-defined problem.

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:23.190
So in a sense,
this is just as good an answer as 3,

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:29.990
Some of you had a might an arithmetic
sequence, that's a good suggestion.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.440
But I was thinking of 0, well, 0 is 0.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.154
1 factorial, 2 factorial factorial,
3 factorial factorial factorial,

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:45.520
4 factorial factorial factorial factorial.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.170
Which one of you just
suggested it in thought.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.864
That's 0 with no factorials, 1 with
one factorial, 2 with two factorials,

00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:54.560
etcetera.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.290
Okay, and probably should put parentheses,
but that's gonna,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.920
because this double factorial is also
used to mean the skip factorial,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.630
where you go down by
two numbers each time.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.110
But anyway, that's doing 3 factorial,
4 factorial, etcetera.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.022
All right, so, well I mean, that's
what one interpretation, it could be.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.675
So the general question is,

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:24.760
if we have a sequence of numbers,
how do we extend it, okay?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.560
And I was thinking of this example cuz
I was thinking about factorials and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.160
how I wanna explain standing factorials.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.362
So, like,
if you ever wondered what's pi factorial.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.530
We're gonna talk about
questions like that.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.240
If you didn't ever wonder
what pi factorial is,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.340
that's okay, you'll see other uses for
this kind of thing.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.270
The question is if you plot it, what
does the factorial function look like?

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.210
Well, 0 factorial is 1.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.060
That's 0.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.380
1 factorial is 1.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.800
2 factorial is 2.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.011
3 factorial is 6.

00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:08.990
4 factorial is 24.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.148
5 factorial is 120.

00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.828
6 factorial is 720.

00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:14.204
Can't draw it anymore.

00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:19.650
It goes way, it starts out pretty small
and then it grows extremely fast.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.870
Very, very beautiful formula that
gives you the approximations for

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.090
factorial is called Sterling's formula,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.980
which if you haven't seen before,
everyone should know this formula.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.420
It's both beautiful and useful,
says that n factorial is approximately

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.510
square root of 2pi n
times n over e to the n.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.310
This is actually an extremely
good approximation.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.690
Even if you try this out on
a calculator where n is like 12 or 20,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.800
it's actually very, very good.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.650
Not only that, but
this approximation is so

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.480
good that if you take the ratio of this,
divided by this, it will converge to 1.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.680
As n goes to infinity.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.820
So, that gives you some,
that's just a cool looking formula.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.910
By the way,
we can prove this using probability and

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.290
I'm not going to do that today,
but I might do that at some point.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.650
We can give this a probability
interpretation by thinking about

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.850
Poisson's.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.990
But anyway, this gives us some sense
of how fast does a factorial grow.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.350
This square root thing is not so
important.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.260
The main thing that's driving
is this n over e to the n.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.180
So basically we have
this n to the n behavior.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.030
It's discounted by e to the n.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.200
But, n is, if you're letting n go to
infinity, that's dominating over the e.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.290
So anyway, that's Sterling's formula.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.890
So, that gives a sense
of how this thing grow.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.090
But now my question is,
how would you connect the dots?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.280
That is, if you want to, this function was
only defined on non-negative integers, and

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.178
if we want to interpolate.

00:06:57.178 --> 00:07:02.330
Well, it's like many ways you could draw
some function that connects those dots,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.210
infinitely many ways to do it.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.430
The question is whether there's
some way that's more, so

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.750
if I ask you what's pi factorial?

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.674
And you have as many ways as you want to
try to connect the dots between 3 and

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:16.880
4, then what should you do?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.960
Well, it turns out that there's one
really standard famous way to do that.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.210
Some of you may have seen, but not at all,
I'm assuming that everyone has.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:31.250
That's called the gamma function, so
that's what we need to start with.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.130
We need the gamma function because
we're going to be introducing

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.030
something called the gamma distribution.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.300
We're not done with beta,
we were doing beta a lot last time, and

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.150
hopefully it wasn't too scary,
despite it being Halloween.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.010
We'll come back to the,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.990
the beta turns out to be extremely
closely connected with the gamma.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.020
So to understand the beta, we need to
do the gamma, which we're about to do.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.960
The gamma distribution is named
the gamma distribution because

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.820
it stems from the gamma function which is-

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.740
Which is one of the most famous
functions in all of mathematics.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.350
Like if you had a top ten list,
top ten most famous functions in math,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.420
gamma should, I haven't seen anyone
make quite a list like that.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.970
I've seen people make lists of
the ten most famous constants, but

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.040
not the ten most famous functions.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.830
I'm sure someone has, and
if they haven't, or if they have and

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.400
they did a good job, they would put
the gamma function on the list, okay?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.250
So it's very, very important in math, not
just in probability and statistics, but

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.420
it's also important in statistics,
which is why we need it right now, but

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.932
it has its own life
outside of this subject.

00:08:38.932 --> 00:08:42.100
All right, so here's the definition
of the gamma function

00:08:44.097 --> 00:08:52.320
That's just a capital letter Gamma of
a is defined by the following integral.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:59.801
Integral, 0 to infinity,
x to the a E to the minus x, dx over x.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.085
Usually, you'll see it written as an x
to the a minus 1 here, which of course,

00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:06.940
is the same thing.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.250
Cuz you can cancel out one of the xs.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:15.460
But for certain reasons, it's convenient
keeping kind of one x on hold over here.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.660
Just a different way to write it,
but the same thing.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.434
And this is defined for
any real a greater than 0.

00:09:25.228 --> 00:09:30.216
[COUGH] If you try letting a equal zero
here or if you let a be negative and

00:09:30.216 --> 00:09:36.070
you think about how this integral is
gonna behave, it's not gonna behave well.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.930
It's not gonna exist.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.510
So, for example, if a is zero,

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.400
this part is gone,
we just have e to the minus x over x.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.716
And then like look at what
happens to that near 0, okay?

00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:50.281
So I'm not going to
rewrite the whole thing.

00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:54.790
Just pretend that the x to the a is
gone because we let a equal 0.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.090
We just have this.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.560
Look at what happens when
x gets very close to 0,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.100
x is close to 0, either minus x is just
close to 1, so it's not doing much, right?

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.837
Either 0 is 1, so this part is very
well behaved, it's just approximately 1,

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:09.300
nothing much going on.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.170
So what's driving the integral is this 1
over x, the integral of 1 over x is log x,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:21.180
log of 0 is minus infinity, and
that causes major problems.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.722
So, Anyway, but

00:10:25.722 --> 00:10:30.470
as long as a is greater than 0,
this is okay.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.680
Same argument,
what happens when x is near 0?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.070
Well, this e to the minus
x doesn't do very much.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.870
But here, we just have x to the a minus 1.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.620
And integrating that is gonna be fine.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.080
You can just do the anti-derivative and
you'll see it converges.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.600
So it's okay.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.140
That's when x goes near 0.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.070
It's also, you also have to consider
what happens when it goes to infinity.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:04.510
When x goes to infinity either the minus
x is the dominate part ,this thing,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.590
even if a is a million,
than this would be x to the 999,999.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:14.710
Completely irrelevant compared to even
minus x, which is exponential decay.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.100
So that integral is gonna converge.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.605
So okay, so it exists for
any real a greater than 0.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.410
This is an extension of
the factorial function.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.159
It will be a little bit more convenient
if gamma of a is a factorial.

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:35.887
It turns out that gamma of
n is n minus 1 factorial.

00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:39.560
So you just have to be
a little bit careful.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.740
That's just for
historical reasons pretty much.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.550
This is for n, for
any n a positive integer.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.036
So as I said,

00:11:57.036 --> 00:12:01.710
there's other ways you can extend
factorials to the positive real numbers.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.570
But this one turns out to be the one
that has at least found the most

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.010
different applications in math,
so this is the most natural and

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.410
best one known in a certain sense.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.720
So why is this true?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.288
Well, let me write down
another identity for Gamma.

00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:26.730
Gamma of x plus 1 equals x gamma x.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.500
So this recursive formula for gamma.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.750
You don't need to know much about
the gamma function for this course.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.210
Depending on what kind of math you do
later, you might need a lot of gamma

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.400
stuff, but for our purposes, you should
know the definition, you should know that

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.070
it extends factorials in this way,
you should know this identity.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.940
Notice that this is very
closely related to this, right,

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.920
because let's just look for
a second at gamma of 1.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.010
We let a equal 1, x is cancel,
integral of e to the minus x,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.996
we've seen several times that
that's just 1, so gamma 1 equals 1.

00:13:05.996 --> 00:13:09.304
And then if we plug that in here,

00:13:09.304 --> 00:13:14.696
it says that gamma of 2,
that's 1 plus 1 equals,

00:13:14.696 --> 00:13:19.870
gamma of 2 equals 1 gamma of 1,
which is 1.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.240
It would be nice if gamma
of 2 was 2 factorial, but

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.450
according to this gamma of
2 its still 1 factorial.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.910
So that's still correct, gamma of 2 is 1.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.850
And now if we look at gamma of 3,
well we do 2 + 1, 2 gamma of 2,

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.750
and we would get 2, and so on.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.690
So, notice that this is the same recursive
formula that the factorial will satisfy.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.700
So basically this formula immediately
implies this one just by,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.950
we have the starting point, right?

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.070
And then both things, both factorials and

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.280
gammas satisfy the same recursion, so
then they must stay the same forever.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.390
Okay, and to prove this thing
is just integration by parts,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.360
which I'll let you do if you feel like it.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.330
If you tried to do this integral,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.240
just using kind of like the most basic
integration by parts, like AP calculus.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.770
What you would do is, you would not
just get an answer for the integral.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.820
But what you would get is something that
looks exactly like the gamma function

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.540
again and

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.600
you would get this identity, just from
a straightforward integration by parts.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:31.649
Okay, so not the gamma function and
that's what happens for factorials.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.900
One other thing about the Gamma
function that's worth knowing

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.880
is what's gamma of one-half?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.690
Just in case you ever wonder what's
the factorial of negative one-half.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.576
What does that mean?

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:52.482
Well, gamma of one-half,
so when it's an integer,

00:14:52.482 --> 00:14:56.870
we just get factorials which are integers.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.898
Gamma of one half is square root of pi.

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:05.450
Kind of a curious looking fact.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.610
And where have we seen
square roots of pis before

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.940
Normalizing constant from the normal.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.954
So we proved that the normalizing
constant for the normal is we have

00:15:17.954 --> 00:15:23.710
1 over square root of 2 pi,
blah blah blah, for the normal PDF.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:30.580
So if you let a equal one half here,
it doesn't look exactly like the normal.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:38.460
But actually, it's similar to what
you would get if we have this normal,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.530
take our normal density, let's say,
e to the minus x squared over 2 dx.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.770
Let's say, we were just trying
to do that integral, right?

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:52.010
And when we did this using the cool
trick of writing it down twice, we

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.250
took into rule, couldn't do it wrote down
a second time and then we could do it.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:00.350
But if we didn't know that trick, we might
say, well, let's make a substitution.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.770
For example,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:07.360
I guess the most obvious thing to do
might to let u equal x squared over two.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.860
Right, so du = dx, right?

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.071
And so, Sorry xdx.

00:16:20.408 --> 00:16:24.710
So, I mean that will be
one thing we can try.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.040
This would be a natural thing to try.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.970
Just because it's kind of annoying having
this x squared up in the exponent.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.250
So if I do this then at least it's
just gonna be e to the minus u,

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.720
that's very nice up in the exponent.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.390
But the problem is we don't actually

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.700
have a x here, right?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.876
So you can still do the substitution,
but what you're gonna get is,

00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:57.693
you'll have an x there, and
x is essentially square root of u.

00:16:57.693 --> 00:16:59.517
I mean,
there's some other nonsense going on.

00:16:59.517 --> 00:17:04.635
So you're gonna get a square root of u,
which is like what you would have here,

00:17:04.635 --> 00:17:07.520
or you would be dividing
by square root of u.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.180
So anyway, I'm just saying.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.886
I mean, you can work through
the substitution if you want.

00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:14.580
But I'm just saying if you do this kind
of substitution on the normal integral.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.930
You're gonna reduce it to something
that looks like gamma of one half.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.680
So you could either think of
that as if you knew this fact,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.160
this would give you another way to get
the normalizing concept of the normal.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.662
Or, the way we actually have it is we
already know from a different method,

00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:34.887
the normalizing constant of the normal,
then we can prove this fact.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:38.865
So once we have gamma of one-half,
then we know gamma of three-halves.

00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:46.590
(3/4) = one plus one-half.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.740
So if we use this formula,
just says it's 1/2 gamma of 1/2.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.003
So that would be square root of pi/2 and
so on.

00:17:55.003 --> 00:17:59.672
So, then we could get gamma of
five-halves, gamma of seven-halves and

00:17:59.672 --> 00:18:01.945
get all the half integers that way.

00:18:01.945 --> 00:18:04.740
All right, so that's just a quick
introduction of the gamma function.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.303
What's on this board is all you need
to know about the gamma function.

00:18:09.303 --> 00:18:13.282
But now let's talk about the gamma
distribution to connect it back to

00:18:13.282 --> 00:18:14.186
probability.

00:18:14.186 --> 00:18:20.689
Okay, so here's kind of a simple

00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:25.809
naive way to create a PDF.

00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:32.180
Based on the gamma function.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.078
So we have this integral here.

00:18:34.078 --> 00:18:39.010
That's just the definition of gamma of a,
okay?

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:44.201
And suppose we wanna somehow
guess that some kind of

00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:51.938
PDF that's gonna be related to the Gamma
function, and we want a valid PDF.

00:18:51.938 --> 00:18:55.975
And to have a valid PDF, all we need
is something that's non-negative and

00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:57.074
integrates to one.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:58.974
What would you do?

00:19:01.925 --> 00:19:03.873
Normalize it, how?

00:19:08.554 --> 00:19:09.957
How would you normalize this thing?

00:19:12.322 --> 00:19:16.840
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Just divide by that value.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:22.677
So if we divide both sides by gamma of a,
that's a PDF.

00:19:22.677 --> 00:19:28.113
So 1 = integral 0 to infinity,
1 over gamma of a,

00:19:28.113 --> 00:19:33.353
x to the a, e to the -x, dx/x, Right?

00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:37.880
That's what I call just like a simple
naive trick, that we have that integral.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.661
Just divide by gamma of
a now we have a PDF.

00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:45.936
So this thing here, Is called

00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:51.347
everything we're integrating, including
this 1/x it's easy to forget this 1/x.

00:19:51.347 --> 00:19:55.307
You could put it up there as x to the a-
1, but then it's easy to forget whether

00:19:55.307 --> 00:19:58.008
that should be a or a- 1,
I like to write it this way.

00:19:58.008 --> 00:20:04.049
This is called the Gamma of (a,1) PDF.

00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:10.704
There are two parameters,

00:20:10.704 --> 00:20:15.160
we only see the a right here
because the other parameters is 1.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.946
Gamma is very closely related
to exponential distribution.

00:20:18.946 --> 00:20:23.830
So the more general one
would be Gamma of a lambda,

00:20:27.235 --> 00:20:30.221
And that one would be obtained just by,

00:20:30.221 --> 00:20:35.480
remember how we got from exponential
one to any exponential lambda?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.960
It's the exact same idea that
we're just putting in a scale.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:45.910
So this is just a scale or
a one over is a scale.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:50.971
So to get this one we're just
gonna make a change of variables,

00:20:50.971 --> 00:20:56.719
let's say we wanted y to be gamma of
a lambda and we wanna find it's PDF.

00:20:56.719 --> 00:21:01.681
Then we're gonna define it as, Y =,

00:21:01.681 --> 00:21:05.893
this is exact same thing we did for
the exponential.

00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:08.880
We're just gonna let y
equal x over lambda.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.157
We just defined gamma of (a,1).

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.552
That's what we just defined as this PDF,
and now we want gamma of

00:21:18.552 --> 00:21:23.535
a lambda all we're gonna do is take
a gamma (a,1) divide by lambda, okay?

00:21:23.535 --> 00:21:25.446
And so now at this point,

00:21:25.446 --> 00:21:30.010
this is just like a really
simple transformation, right?

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.570
Just multiplying by a constant,

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.587
and we've been talking about what happens
with more complicated transformations,

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:38.780
non-linear stuff and
all kinds of complicated transformations.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.840
Here we're just multiplying by a constant.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.420
So if want the PDF of Y just to remind
you of your change of variables.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:54.940
The PDF of Y is fx(x) dx/dy, right?

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.952
And in this case we
have y = x over lambda,

00:21:58.952 --> 00:22:03.434
which we could of course
write as x = lambda y.

00:22:03.434 --> 00:22:08.097
So dx/dy = lambda.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.179
So we just right down the gamma PDF,

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:20.412
and we just replace x by, x is lambda y,

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:25.329
so I'm just replacing x by lambda y,

00:22:25.329 --> 00:22:30.424
to the a, e to the- lambda y, 1/x.

00:22:30.424 --> 00:22:31.692
And x is lambda y.

00:22:34.358 --> 00:22:38.196
Times lambda, so
that lambda cancels that lambda.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.710
And that's what it looks like.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:47.066
I should emphasize the possible values,
this is for x greater than 0,

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:49.110
this one is for y greater than 0.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.770
So this is like the exponential,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:58.190
that gamma is a continuous distribution
on the positive real numbers, okay?

00:22:59.938 --> 00:23:04.657
So, I mean that's just, all right,
so that's a cute trick,

00:23:04.657 --> 00:23:09.940
how do we get to convert this famous
function into a distribution.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.647
That doesn't really say that that's gonna
be an important distribution, right?

00:23:13.647 --> 00:23:16.860
That's not like a math trick story.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.680
It's not a probabilistic or
statistical story.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.543
So I wanna show you now how
this relates to the gamma, no,

00:23:23.543 --> 00:23:28.630
the gamma distribution relates to
the exponential distribution, okay?

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.970
That's why we use the letter lambda and
this is analogous to what we did for

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.640
the exponential, so
why does that work out?

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.430
So for that we just need a picture.

00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:45.230
That's actually related
to the Poisson also.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.580
Gamma relates to the normal
distribution we'll see later.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.225
It relates to the beta distribution, it
relates to the exponential distribution,

00:23:52.225 --> 00:23:54.037
it relates to the Poisson distribution.

00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:58.698
And by the way, so we've already
discussed all the famous discreet

00:23:58.698 --> 00:24:01.408
distributions we need in this course.

00:24:01.408 --> 00:24:04.570
We're almost done with continuous
distributions as well.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.100
Not done like studying them,

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.270
but done with like famous ones
that You need to know by name.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:15.980
There's a few more, but all of
the remaining ones are just variations

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:21.940
in some sense of Gammas or
possibly with normals.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.700
But as you'll see later,
Gamma is closely related to normal.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.730
So once we have the Gamma and

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.540
the normal, we can create the rest
of the distributions we'll need.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:38.090
So to talk about the Gamma,
and Exponential connection,

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.160
we need to think about a Poisson process.

00:24:49.975 --> 00:24:54.010
Okay, so, we've only talked a little
bit about Poisson processes.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.718
Which is if you take that, 71,

00:24:55.718 --> 00:24:59.510
which is processes you can do
a lot of Poisson process stuff.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.760
For our purposes we just need
to know a couple basic facts.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.429
First of all what is a Poisson process?

00:25:06.429 --> 00:25:08.143
You've seen them before, but

00:25:08.143 --> 00:25:13.250
just to quickly remind you we're
imagining emails arriving in an inbox.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:19.940
Where the number of emails in some
time interval let's say N sub t

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:26.900
equals number of emails up to time
t we just have this timeline here.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.010
And the Poisson process is called
a Poisson process because we're assuming

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:40.650
that that's Poisson with rate lambda,
lambda times t.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.590
So in a time interval of length t,
this is true,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.510
I stated this as you know
you're going from zero to t.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:53.410
But we're actually assuming that this is
true in any time interval of length t,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.030
it's gonna be Poisson lambda t.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:26:00.141
And there's only one other assumption for
a Poisson process,

00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:06.321
that is that the number of arrivals in
disjoint intervals are independent.

00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:10.153
That is the number of emails you get from
this time to this time is independent of

00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:13.480
the number of emails you get from
this time to this time for example.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.210
So those,
there are only those two assumptions.

00:26:24.692 --> 00:26:27.824
So a few weeks ago we
saw what the connection

00:26:27.824 --> 00:26:30.787
with the exponential distribution is.

00:26:30.787 --> 00:26:34.170
And that was before we had even
defined the exponential distribution.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.160
So, I'll remind you of what that was.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:47.950
So, we're just drawing Draw an x
every time you got an email.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:53.120
That kind of picture,
that is the picture we have in mind.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:59.231
So what we proved a week ago was
that if we call this one T1,

00:26:59.231 --> 00:27:05.180
T1 is the time of the first email,
that's exponential lambda.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:12.087
And the proof for that is just to say,
Just to remind you,

00:27:12.087 --> 00:27:16.580
what's the probability
that T1 is greater than t?

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:23.020
That's the same thing as saying at time t,
I haven't yet gotten any email.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.895
That's the same thing as
saying that N sub t equals 0,

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:31.120
cuz that's just the same thing,
no emails up until time t.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.299
Well, that's just given by
Poisson e to the minus lambda t.

00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:41.210
The rest of the Poisson stuff is just 1.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.690
So it's just this one line calculation
that shows that, and then say that's just

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:53.160
one minus the exponential lambda CDF so
that's true.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.770
So this first time is exponential.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:02.110
Using a similar argument we get that
that's the time from here to here.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:07.384
Using the same argument repeatedly,
The time you have

00:28:07.384 --> 00:28:12.028
to wait from the first email to the second
email is also gonna be an exponential and

00:28:12.028 --> 00:28:15.380
it's independent of the first exponential.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.880
Just use the memoryless property.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:24.250
Memoryless property says,
no matter how long you've waited,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.140
waiting for this second email but
starting at this point in time

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.770
it's just starting over again so
it's just the same problem again.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:38.280
Same method says that here to here
is another exponential lambda, and

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.040
from here to here is
an exponential lambda.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.820
Exponential lambda, and so on.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.050
So all of these times between
arrivals are exponential lambda.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.420
So our assumption, so

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.320
that's actually an equivalent way
to state the Poisson process.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.349
Rather than stating with Poisson,
we could say that the inter-arrival times,

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.292
that is just these distances
between Xs and this timeline,

00:29:03.292 --> 00:29:09.899
interarrival times, Are i.i.d.

00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:15.842
Exponential lambda.

00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:22.060
So those are the inter-arrival times.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.800
But what if we wanted to
know the actual times?

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.860
So if we call this T2 and
T3, T4, T5, and so on.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.270
Well, that's the actual
time on the timeline,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.680
not just the distance between two times.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.030
We want to know that distribution.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.263
So therefore we can think of Tn So

00:29:47.263 --> 00:29:50.898
let's define Tn to be
the time of the nth arrival,

00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:57.010
nth email, nth phone call, or whatever.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:05.940
We can think of that, to get Tn, we
just add up the first waiting time, then

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.480
the waiting time from the first to the
second, and a second to third, and so on.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.330
So we can just think of that as
the sum of Xj, j equals 1 to n,

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:18.670
where these Xj's are these
inter-arrival times,

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:24.040
which we just said are exponential lambda,
i.i.d.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.010
This is the most important story for
the Gamma distribution, at least for

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.940
the integer.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.170
So right now I'm assuming n is an integer.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.620
Over here,
a did not need to be an integer.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.262
But if we assume that it is an integer,

00:30:41.262 --> 00:30:46.060
then this is gonna be Gamma of n lambda.

00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:55.551
We haven't shown this yet, so that's
something we need to prove, that this kind

00:30:55.551 --> 00:31:00.619
of a sum of i.i.d exponentials will be
Gamma, that's what we're gonna show next.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:08.600
But they can see the analogy, remember
the negative binomial and the geometric?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.630
The geometric you're waiting for
one success in discrete time.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.100
Negative binomial you're waiting for
however many you know,

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.600
seven success say, right.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.170
If you can think of the negative binomial
as the sum of geometric, so you wait for

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.290
your first success, then you wait for
your second, and then third.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.630
And so on, in discrete time.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:30.290
The exponential is the continuous
time analog of the geometric.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.830
So this is the continuous time
analog of negative binomial.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:40.550
How long do you have to wait for
n successes in continuous time?

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.760
Where in this case,
success just means getting an email.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.200
So that's a pretty weak
definition of success.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.065
But anyway, that's what's going on.

00:31:51.065 --> 00:31:51.636
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So

00:31:51.636 --> 00:31:56.100
success is however you
wanted to define it.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.720
But in this case,
we just mean the arrivals.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:03.860
All right, so let's prove this fact now
because just from what I've written,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.960
I'm saying this is true, but just from
what I've written here, here I said add up

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:13.450
exponentials, and here I said Write
down this PDF with the Gamma function.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.570
What does that have to do with that?

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.970
Not yet clear, right?

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.790
So we need to check the best true, okay?

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.630
So let's do that.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.890
There's two ways to do it, at least two.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.419
There's two ways that we
know how to do right now.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.410
One would be to do a convolution.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:42.034
So, that thing over there is
just a convolution, right?

00:32:42.034 --> 00:32:45.820
This is a convolution,
it's just adding up an IID exponential.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.280
We could do a convolution integral.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.170
You could do that for practice.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.790
It's not that bad,
actually stuff will cancel and

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:58.040
it's not bad, and
then you could involve X1 and X2.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.195
Then take that thing and involve it
with X3, and then take that thing and

00:33:03.195 --> 00:33:07.011
involve it with X4, or you get pretty
tired of it pretty quick soon.

00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:10.283
But hopefully before you got tired of it,
you would see a pattern and

00:33:10.283 --> 00:33:12.870
you could prove it by induction.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.520
But I don't wanna do it that way.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.700
We have a much better method
available that is MGFs, okay?

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:26.506
MGF, right,
because we're adding up IID things.

00:33:26.506 --> 00:33:29.520
And in class, we already derived
the MGF of an exponential.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:34.600
It's a nice looking thing, and so
we may as well use that, okay?

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.700
So that's what we're
gonna prove right now.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:43.265
So a proof that, Proof that,

00:33:43.265 --> 00:33:47.234
let's say T = the sum XJ,

00:33:47.234 --> 00:33:53.744
J = 1 to N with XJ IID exponential lambda.

00:33:55.954 --> 00:34:02.260
Let's do exponential one first,
is Gamma of (n,1).

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.750
As long as we can do this when lambda
is 1, then we immediately get this for

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.990
all lambda, because you could just
multiply or divide by lamdba.

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:14.510
Lambda was just a rescaling, and
so just scale everything later.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.730
It's not really harder to do it with
general lambda here, it just makes

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:22.480
the notation more cluttered, having all
these lambdas floating around everywhere.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.024
So I'd rather just set it equal to 1,
and then we can always multiply or

00:34:26.024 --> 00:34:27.276
divide by lambda later.

00:34:27.276 --> 00:34:28.040
It's not a big deal.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.960
All right, so let's do that using the MGF.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.169
So the MGF of XJ,

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:43.967
MGF of X1, since they're our IID,
they all have the same MGF.

00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:50.045
It's the same as MGF of X2 and all XJs is.

00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:59.250
It's just 1 over 1- T, Which we can
also think of as a geometric series.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.870
So we used this before to
get all the moments of X1,

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.590
all at once using the geometric series.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:11.580
And this is valid for T less than 1, Okay?

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.820
So we did that before, Therefore,

00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:21.980
We can write down the MGF of T.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:29.371
I'll call it Tn,
just as a reminder that there's n of them.

00:35:29.371 --> 00:35:33.100
MGF of Tn, easy just raise
this to the nth power, right?

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.915
Cuz we're adding independent things and
multiply the MGF.

00:35:35.915 --> 00:35:39.810
So just multiply that by
itself a bunch of times,

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.753
we'd have 1 over 1- t to the n,
where t less than 1, okay?

00:35:44.753 --> 00:35:46.620
Very little work required to do that.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.590
I just put an n there.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.170
That's a lot easier than
doing a convolution.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:36:00.590
On the other hand, how do we know
that this is the MGF we wanted?

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.475
Well, to answer that question,

00:36:04.475 --> 00:36:11.284
we need to look at the MGF of
a Gamma distribution, right?

00:36:11.284 --> 00:36:15.126
I'll make a new notation just so
that I'm not doing circular reasoning.

00:36:15.126 --> 00:36:20.070
Well, let's just say Y.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:26.650
Let Y be Gamma of n1, and
let's find its MGF, okay?

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:31.628
And we said before that there's no
masquerading distributions that pretend to

00:36:31.628 --> 00:36:36.430
have a certain MGF and aren't actually
what they appear to be, right?

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:41.750
So if, in fact, Y has this as its MGF,
then we're done, right?

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:45.924
So that's what we need to show,
so find its MGF.

00:36:45.924 --> 00:36:52.590
Well, its MGF is the expected value,
e to the TY = LOTUS.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.979
I'm just gonna write e to the ty, And

00:36:57.979 --> 00:37:03.401
then I'm gonna write down
the gamma PDF which was,

00:37:03.401 --> 00:37:08.583
I'll take out the constant,
1 over Gamma of a.

00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:15.690
Y to the a, e to the -y, and a is n here.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.822
So that's Gamma of n, y to the n,

00:37:21.822 --> 00:37:25.157
e to the -y, dy over y.

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:34.830
That's just this thing, and
just using LOTUS, okay?

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.570
So that's not even conditioned,
write down, right away.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.210
That's why it's LOTUSed.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.830
It shouldn't require much thought
to write this down, okay.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.090
Now, it may take some thought.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.620
How do we actually do this integral?

00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:56.410
Well, I guess we can
simplify a little bit.

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.610
Collect these two terms.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:04.039
So this is really just 1 over Gamma of n,

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:11.083
integral 0 to infinity,
y to the n, e to the minus.

00:38:11.083 --> 00:38:14.035
And let's just collect
these terms together,

00:38:14.035 --> 00:38:21.162
1- T, Times y, dy over y.

00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:27.118
Cuz we have e to the -y and
we have e to the TY, okay?

00:38:27.118 --> 00:38:31.620
All right, so
that may look like a difficult integral.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:37.530
But on the other hand,
if you stare at it for

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.638
a little while,
it should start to look familiar.

00:38:40.638 --> 00:38:45.488
It kind of looks pretty similar to
the integrals we've just been doing.

00:38:45.488 --> 00:38:48.658
And it has some extra constant up here,
but

00:38:48.658 --> 00:38:54.755
this should seem pretty reminiscent
of the Gamma function itself, right?

00:38:54.755 --> 00:39:01.140
I mean just in general in this course,
it's not really a big deal how good

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.110
you are at integration by parts and stuff
like that, you'll rarely have to do that.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:10.160
But what you do need to be able to do
is pattern recognition and see well,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.132
this looks like a Gamma integral.

00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:15.900
it's just I have this extra constant here,
that's really no big deal, right?

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:21.950
Just make a change of variables just
to make this e to the -x again, right?

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:29.965
So we're just gonna let, x = (1-t)y.

00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:43.414
So that dx = (1-t)dy, Okay?

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:49.500
So t is less than 1,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.850
so that means that this is
actually still positive.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:57.299
So the limits of integration, so now,
let's just rewrite that integral.

00:39:57.299 --> 00:40:00.414
So I'm just making a change of variables
just to make that e to the -x again,

00:40:00.414 --> 00:40:02.100
cuz that's gonna look more like.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.590
It looks very similar to a Gamma, now,

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.880
let's just make extremely similar,
that's all I'm doing.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.448
So we do 1 over gamma of a.

00:40:10.448 --> 00:40:15.463
Limits of integration stay 0 to infinity,
because when Y is 0,

00:40:15.463 --> 00:40:21.280
X is 0, and one goes to infinity,
the other goes to infinity.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.650
And y to the n is just well,

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:32.280
y is x over 1- t, so
we are gonna get 1- t to the -n.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.770
That looks pretty promising, right,

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:36.560
cuz that's actually exactly
what we wanted over there.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:42.533
And then we're gonna have x to the n,
e to the -x.

00:40:44.782 --> 00:40:48.222
And one convenient thing about
kind of keeping this as dy over y,

00:40:48.222 --> 00:40:49.698
instead of cancelling it.

00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:52.739
Is that this multiplicative
thing is gonna cancel,

00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:55.790
so dy over y is actually
the same thing as dx over x.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.230
That actually makes this
kind of thing easier.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.310
And that is again gamma of n,
not gamma of a, or just let a equal n.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:09.948
So that's why it's handy,
dy over y is same thing as dx over x,

00:41:09.948 --> 00:41:14.280
just makes it a little bit
easier with the algebra.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.342
Well, that was exactly the gamma function
again, so that's just 1- t to the -n,

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:19.557
which is what we wanted.

00:41:22.707 --> 00:41:24.440
It's the same thing.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:33.188
MGF is the same, so that proves
that this statement is true, okay?

00:41:33.188 --> 00:41:38.864
So that's nice,
that's the connection with the,

00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:44.030
that's the connection
with the exponential.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.890
Well, another thing we need
to do is get the moments.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.966
So again, that sounds like
it could be a nasty problem,

00:41:53.966 --> 00:41:59.370
but it actually is not bad at all,
once you see the pattern.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:04.491
Okay, so let's let

00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:09.789
X ~ Gamma(a1).

00:42:09.789 --> 00:42:15.061
And by the way, this calculation here
actually, in this last line here,

00:42:15.061 --> 00:42:20.520
in this part, I actually never assumed
that n was actually an integer.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.709
So this actually shows that
this is the correct MGF,

00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:27.130
even if n could be any
positive real number here.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.220
To have the interpretation of the sum of
the exponentials, then we need an integer.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.245
But this is the MGF in general,

00:42:33.245 --> 00:42:37.820
cuz that didn't rely on
assuming that was an integer.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.330
All right, so now let's get some moments.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.262
Of course we can use the MGF,
but actually,

00:42:44.262 --> 00:42:48.631
I think in this case it's even
easier just to directly use LOTUS.

00:42:48.631 --> 00:42:54.009
So let's say we want to

00:42:54.009 --> 00:42:59.109
find E(X to the C).

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:02.760
Where I don't even need for

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:08.325
c to be an integer, c is just some number.

00:43:08.325 --> 00:43:13.216
I'm not saying this will exist for all c,
we'll have to see whether it exists,

00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:15.333
okay, but c is just any constant.

00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:18.451
In particular,
we can let c = 1 to get the mean,

00:43:18.451 --> 00:43:22.880
c = 2 to get the second moment,
then we can get the variance of that.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:27.812
Well, it's just LOTUS, so
this should be pretty quick.

00:43:27.812 --> 00:43:33.301
I'm gonna write down the,
I want E(X to the c),

00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:39.591
change big X to little x,
just LOTUS, right, X to the C.

00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:44.220
And then then I'm just gonna write
down the gamma PDF again, right?

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:49.017
So we had 1 over Gamma(a), x to the c, and

00:43:49.017 --> 00:43:54.619
then we had an x to the a,
e to the minus x, dx over x.

00:43:56.731 --> 00:44:01.761
Well okay, obviously we can combine

00:44:01.761 --> 00:44:07.274
this to be X to the a + c, 0, infinity,

00:44:07.274 --> 00:44:12.160
x to the a + c, e to the -x dx over x.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.011
That integral should look very,
very familiar again, right?

00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:23.481
Just pattern recognition, that's x
to a power, e to the -x dx over x.

00:44:23.481 --> 00:44:28.460
That looks very very much like
the gamma function again, right?

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:34.182
That is the gamma function,
that's just Gamma(a + c) over Gamma(a).

00:44:38.615 --> 00:44:40.150
That's just the gamma function.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.846
Or if you want, you can multiply and
divide by Gamma(a + c) and

00:44:43.846 --> 00:44:47.180
say, we just integrated
the Gamma(a + c) PDF.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.543
Must get 1,
if it's a PDF it has to integrate to 1.

00:44:50.543 --> 00:44:56.608
So you don't need to do any calculus here,
really, that was just algebra.

00:44:56.608 --> 00:45:00.830
This times this, and
then recognizing that's a gamma, right?

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:02.540
So gamma has very,

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:07.832
very nice properties in that sense,
beta has some similar nice properties.

00:45:07.832 --> 00:45:10.700
All right, so
that's Gamma(a + c) over Gamma(a).

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.420
And our assumption has to
that a + c is positive,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.498
because the gamma function is
only defined on positive numbers.

00:45:21.498 --> 00:45:25.730
If a + c less than or equal to 0,
then it just doesn't exist.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.080
So okay, let's use this just
to just quickly get the mean.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:38.320
E(X) =, now let's just let c = 1,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:45.938
so that's gonna be Gamma(a
+ 1) over Gamma(a).

00:45:45.938 --> 00:45:52.879
But then remember that identity,
Gamma(a+1) is a Gamma(a).

00:45:52.879 --> 00:45:59.550
So this is a Gamma(a) over Gamma(a),
which is just simplifies to a.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.933
Very easy-looking formula for the mean,

00:46:03.933 --> 00:46:07.411
now let's check whether this
makes sense intuitively.

00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:09.697
In the case when a is an integer, and

00:46:09.697 --> 00:46:14.750
we use that interpretation over there,
we already knew the answer, right?

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:18.271
Cuz exponential 1 has mean 1,
you add up n of them,

00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:21.240
you have to get mean n by linearity.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.111
So we already knew this is
correct in the integer case, and

00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:28.281
this says it's true even
if a is not an integer.

00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:33.840
All right, and
let's get the second moment, E(x squared).

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.380
Well, that's just Gamma(a
+ 2) over Gamma(a).

00:46:42.515 --> 00:46:48.930
Gamma(a + 2) is (a + 1) Gamma(a),
(a + 1) Gamma(a + 1).

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.880
I'm just using the same thing again,
right?

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:56.000
Just replace a by (a + 1), so
it's (a + 1) Gamma(a + 1).

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.940
But gamma of (a + 1) is a Gamma(a),
so again, the Gamma(a)'s cancel.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:08.243
And we would just get a squared + a,
and that tells us the variance.

00:47:08.243 --> 00:47:13.000
Variance is E(X squared)
minus E(X) squared, so

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.860
we're subtracting a squared, so that
tells us the variance of x also equals a.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:22.949
Again, that's easy to remember.

00:47:22.949 --> 00:47:29.113
So it says that Gamma(a + 1)
has mean a and variance a.

00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:33.110
Sounds a little like the Poisson,
where the mean equals the variance.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.010
But this is kind of a special,
for the Poisson,

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.350
the mean is always equal to the variance.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:42.117
And this is kind of,
just because I let lambda equal 1.

00:47:42.117 --> 00:47:48.723
So now if we bring back the lambda,
gamma of a lambda.

00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:55.266
Well to get that, we define that just
by rescaling, by dividing by lambda.

00:47:55.266 --> 00:48:00.531
So gama of a lambda has
mean a over lambda, but

00:48:00.531 --> 00:48:05.809
the variance becomes
a over lambda squared.

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:10.777
Because remember, when you multiply by
a constant, remember, when you multiply by

00:48:10.777 --> 00:48:15.230
a constant and you take the variance,
then the constant comes out squared.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.130
So gamma a lambda has this mean and
this variance.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:23.243
But notice that it was just easier to
do this thing with lambda = 1 first,

00:48:23.243 --> 00:48:27.552
as long as we don't forget at
the end to bring back the lambda.

00:48:27.552 --> 00:48:33.530
All right, so this is just kind of an
introduction to the gamma distribution and

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:37.510
the gamma function,
how it connects with the exponential.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.760
Next time, I'll show you how it
connects to the beta and the normal.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.060
Thought we'd finish
a little bit early today,

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:46.630
cuz I don't wanna scare you again
with the beta til next time.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.172
See you on Friday.
