Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

Speaker 1:          00:00:06       And we're going live. Yes sir. [inaudible] your social media people love you, Bro. People love you too. Oh, we're live. We're doing it right now. So we've, we've uh, God, Oh, what's the word? Gawked what's the word when you are gold over someone's body? Sure. Dude, you got jacked. Skinny to shredded. Yeah. Yep. You're pretty serious about MMA training, man. It's really just about like the lifestyle, you know what I mean? You're a martial artist, so, you know, freak in the mind and the body and the soul go together. So yeah, for sure. These things I'm learning about them. Um, I'm able to put them all together. You can't be a complete person until everything is together. So, um, you know, spiritually I've already ascended above my peers. Now I'm taking my body up there. How are you doing spiritually through that giant jug? A weed you got on the table.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Exactly. Yeah. They have. Yeah. For the folks who only listen with his, brought literally like a mason jar held with we. Yeah. Yup, Yup, Yup. It is like halfway for a specific strains that you like. They asked smoke the KK Khalifa Kush. Oh, you've got your own shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Because I got tired of smoking or different types of weed. Um, it's like a drink. You know what I'm saying? Like alcohol, people only drink dark liquor. Whiskey or I only smoke cocaine. Only take care. Yup. If you mix it up though, you'll get a big hit. Right. Have you switch it up to somebody else's stuff? You're like woo, the body's not ready for it. In my head will go crazy. Like I'll really feel it. You'll see me like over in the cornerstone, so I only have this smoke. KK, that's it. That's the weird thing about, we'd write it like you, you get used to a certain strain.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Yeah. Like I'll get physically like ill if I don't smoke my strain, I'll get runny nose coughing. Yeah. Yeah. I need an Ekka. Wow. Yeah. Yup. How much do you smoke a day? Probably a ounce. Like the cool is we burned in the cooldowns. How about you? I don't smoke that much. Yeah, no. Like a joint while I got joint a day. I'm like, yeah, I would think that you were like just getting stoned all day. I get stoned all day when I don't have shit to do. Got You. But if I have too much shit to I get stoned all day. That shit doesn't get done. Oh you said you like blitz. Yeah. White light blues cause the little tobacco gives you like this little extra high. Yep. I'm glad you admitted it. Yeah. No people who smoked blessed, they don't, some of them they don't know that their tobacco inc and they try to mask it and say no, you know it's a leaf and it's like no bro.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       You like tobacco is tobacco with weed? Yep. It's all like a combo high. It cuts it a little bit too. I like it before I go on stage. That's my favorite before I go on stage. That's certainly a little pickup but a little bit high but a little like, Yay, I'm happy how legal weed is these days because it's like I would, I, my son had a spring concert yesterday and I would feel like shit back in the day walking in there smelling like bud had, cause he goes to the private school, let me know this reflection on him. Yeah. So it's like, you know you got the weed head dad, Blah Blah Blah and other things. But it's like nowadays I should just cool like no one cares. Nobody gives a fuck. I've seen it happen cause I have a 22 year old daughter but then I also have an 11 and a nine year old and with the 22 year old when she was growing up it was all weird.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       It was weird. It was like you were a loser for smoking weed lay dates. You know what I'm saying? People coming over your house. You got weed at the house. Yeah Bro. Parents get weird. I live like right up the street from the school. So like I'm getting real technical with it. Like I'm in a school zone. You know what I'm saying? Like legitimately like I could be not here right now. Incarcerated for real lady. They locked up today in Dallas. Did you see that shit? Nah, no. I See lady a grandmother. They locked her up cause she had CBD on her. Yeah, she was a Dallas airport outside even psychoactive. And I think she had the oil like first skin. Right. [inaudible] hey, it's just ridiculous. She's a old lady, old lady who needs it for arthritis as trading. My wife's mom uses it for arthritis.

Speaker 1:          00:04:04       It's great. So older folks, Shit, my, uh, my, I started to call her my ex baby's mom. She's still my baby's mom, but she has another baby on the way in or a new relationship. But she's able to take a CBD during her pregnancy to help her, uh, her nausea and all of that stuff. I was like, why would you hate on CBD Bro? No, it's amazing. It's the shit. It's, my friend's son had some seizures. He has like some sort of an epileptic seizure, gives them CBD. It's gone. He said every day he doesn't have them anymore. That's amazing. I love that. It's incredible. It's so good. It's almost, you feel like you're lying, right. Does so many different things that when you talk about weed you feel like you're lying. Yeah. I mean like these days, in this day and age, I was just telling somebody the other day, smoking pot is going to be old school.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       Like, you know what I mean? We're still going to do it, but it's totally moving towards just ingesting it, rubbing it on and all that shit sprays so people just scared of it and it works. Yeah. Like fuck. Like, you know what I mean? The thing about the animals though, it puts you in a weird place if you get too much. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen some people melt down. Edibles are crazy. So I got a homie who just took a THC pill yesterday and he was talking about types of Shit. Like that shit knocked him out. He's probably still asleep, but yeah, the edibles fuck you up. You do edibles. Yeah, I do. But yeah, I've had some bad experiences like someone, not bad but like, like completely lost touch with this dimension. Damn. You know what I'm saying? Like I had a friend who may THC pills.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Yep. And I was taking him at a party once and it was a party for a Jujitsu tournament. So cause there was a Jujitsu tournament and then there was this party afterwards and by the time the pills would kick in, I have no idea how much it was in there cause he was like some handmade shit that this guy put together himself. A little capsules that you buy. It was as high as I've ever been in my life to the point where I wasn't even seeing people. I was seeing like a two dimensional cut out of the person and behind them I was seeing like their true intentions are so like a really high fuck. And I was talking to this one dude and he was just, he was a high level Jujitsu guy was who was a really odd, it was a very strange feeling.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       I got talking to this cat then I'm like a month later he was on the run for rape. Yeah. He uh, raped some woman and then he escaped and then he was so addicted to Jujitsu. The story was that he started training again with a fake name, but he was like this high level black belt. And there's only that this, especially back then when this happens, it's like the early two thousands, there's only a certain number of high level black belts that are running around. Right. So he put on this fake Brazilian name and started training and like the Pacific northwest, but he's strangling black belts and everybody's like, what the fuck is, who is this guy? So people ask, hey, someone took a picture of him and I go with that. Guys want it for right. Oh Shit. But I remember talking to him on these THC pills being like, like some, there's some wiring that's not correct. Oh fuck yeah. Damn dog. That's an whoa. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       THC pills. They expose things they do, Bro. I did mushrooms in it. Exposed there yet. Do you do shrimps? Yeah, yeah, Yup. I fuck with mushrooms because that's what happened with me when I was on mushrooms. I was able to see people's true intentions because being a rapper and shit like that, you know, you'd be having to peel back the layers, layers and layers and layers and I was trying to peel my own layers back. It just for my own shore personal every way I ended up. Yeah. Yup. And I ended up being like backstage somewhere and I was like fuck. I was like, I'm around all these people and like I really see the true intentions. Then there was like, I see what crowd they are and it was like, I felt like I was separated, you know what I mean? I mean it was like I was on a boat all the way out here and they were on the, on a all on an island party and then I was like, damn, yeah, I can see what's going on over there.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       But it was cool. Like I do mushrooms every now and then. I don't fuck with it all the time. I haven't done them in like three years because they help you see shit like that. So it's like for me, I'll take that experience and I'll just live with it. Yeah. I don't need to keep going through it over and over. Like you've probably seen that dude and was like, oh shit. Now I know people who are rapey. As soon as I see him, I knew he was dangerous. Like he was a legitimately dangerous person. Like not just saying Bro, not just to train killer, but he was dangerous. Like the way he thought about things. Oh, that's why there's people like that out there. Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you, you don't know until you experience it. And that was a mild experience compared to most people's counters to psychos out there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       Fucking crazy motherfuckers bro. I know, I know. Just probably in fighting too. That's why I feel like more people need to like smoke weed and a and train. I think so too because it balances. Training's great man. He alleviates all that shit with most people. But there's going to be some dude's just like that guy that are just, they're just out there. It's taken it to that level, like, yeah, yeah. Yup. That's crazy. When you think about the world of fighting and competition, I mean, you're dealing with people that are taking the biggest risks. They don't, they don't have to do that. Right. This is like a choice. Right. They can get a job. The choices. I want to get a job trying to fuck up other people who have a job trying to fuck up people. The killers, the trained killers is going after each other.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Right, right. And when you're around those dudes, one of the things you want, one of the things you realize very early on you have, you can have your preconceived notions about them being like, Meh. Like mean people are violent people. They're people of character. Yes, sir. You have to have extreme character to pull off what they do. Yeah. Yup. There's some of the best people I've ever met in my life are fighters. Yep. Yep. They, they're, they're a different breed of human being. Yeah. They chose that path. They chose it, knows no one's forcing them or not in more. Right. They decide to go and do that. And that's why it's so exciting to watch. Right, right. Cause you know that they're putting everything on the line. Right. I look at it like, like you said, they chose that. So to become an athlete to, to choose to fight, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       Like, and a lot of them are really, like you said, smart, they're technical and especially how the sport is developing these days because people don't want the longterm damage, but they want to still like, you know what I mean? Go hard. So they're coming up with fucking all types of ways to do this shit. And it's like, at the end of the day, you have to be creative or you have to have some type of something up here. You know what I mean? You're not just fighting to be fighting, you know? So yeah, I think they all go in and for the same reason, they're all there. They're trying to find out if they can do it right and the beginning get up and they have a just a drive to prove that they're the best. Right. I was just talking to somebody the other day about that. Um, it was like a crazy argument because they were saying how fight fans are just there for knockouts and I was like, you definitely have your, your knockout fans.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       It's was like, those are probably the people who pay the most. You know what I mean? It's like, but I was like, you got to give credit to a lot of people who understand fighting and love it and are viewing it for that aspect. It's like, yeah, you know, when you, you watch football, like a lot of people played football and you know, wished they could have been that person on the field. They just haven't, you know what I mean? So I was trying to explain to him, I was like, it was a huge crowd of people who actually know about this shit and who are knowledgeable in those people support it as well. It was weird. Yeah. I feel you. I know exactly what you're saying. There's some people that just want to see people get beat up and some people didn't want to see Floyd Mayweather duck punches.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       Right. You know, one of the best things about Floyd Mayweather and Canelo wasn't that Floyd beat Canelo up. He out boxed him. Right. But he showed this level of defense. If you're a boxing fan, you're like Jesus Christ. Like he knows everything. That's comment. Yep. He's always in the right angle is always one step ahead and that's why he's so good. His defenses Floyd's only been hit like a few times. His whole career. Really hard. See like Shane hit him a couple times. Uh, was it my Donna, Donna hit him really hard one and they fucking like save the clip and play it over and over. Just cause like so he can be hit. Yeah. Really think about other boxers, how much they get hit and compared to the flu. I love watching that. I love watching someone who could move like that. My favorite fighter to watch the UFC was mighty mouse. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:12:25       not just because he was the best pound for pound fighter on the planet, but because he was not getting hit right. He was occasionally someone would tell like John May org attacked him on the straight leg. Occasionally some guys hit him, but most times things are just grazing. Yeah. Things are getting blocked. Right. Even if he gets hit, he's moving. He's a puzzle. Right? Like if you're a fan of martial arts, you want to see the master of the puzzle. Exactly. Hell yeah. And I don't, I don't count them people out and I wouldn't fucking sit in front of the dude and let him just be like, oh yeah, everybody will see knockouts like, Nah Bro. Like it's not like that fail. I think everybody likes both things though. It's like when you get like Arturo Gotti versus Micky Ward, did you ever see that fight? Uh, I will have to track.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       It was a trilogy of fucking wars between these two guys that weren't not champion. They were, they were like one step below at the time of their career being like championship level. So they weren't like in threat of fighting for the title. No one talked through like Floyd was better than both of them by far. Right. But what they were doing was showing the two guys that are similarly talented can put on like the most entertaining fight in the world. It was incredible. It's crazy to watch it back and forth, back forth. I like watching that too. Yeah. Yup. You know? Yeah. I want to see a good fight. Me Personally, I like watching both things. I like watching someone just completely Willie pep, somebody just like pronounced Whitaker used to do. Yeah. Yup. He's a great boxer. He couldn't hit him. Nope. He was so slick.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       Nope. You know when you can only do that for so long, like in any sport, you know, it'd be at the top for so long. Watch those performances when those guys were at the top, that shows you what's possible. Hell yeah. And it's just good to see somebody like master their craft to, yeah. Cause you see him come up like you watch him be I and then it's like they become the shit and it's like, oh yeah, that, you know what I mean? I seen this dude like start from just being okay and now he's just fucking shit up. You see them learn and you see them develop and all of that stuff is fun. Like you grow with them. That's a good combination of getting to the bottom of shit. His weed and martial arts, that's a good combination. 100% really is, I do like a lot of my thinking is just from like after I train I just sit there and just think about nothing. But you know what I mean? Ideas come to me how to deal with situations, you know what I mean? Because it just, I don't know. It just happens like that just flows. Yeah. Yeah. It flows

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and I think like the training helps you get all the bullshit off your back, right? Hell yeah. Right. Yeah. Yup. Especially for me too, cause like I party a lot and I'm in the studio till like five, six in the morning. I'm drinking and stuff like that. So to just be going down that path and doing that every day, bro, I look crazy. I'll feel crazy. Like I have to get that off of me, like out of me. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's why your gym is crazy. But I need to do something like that for myself. It's nice to have at some point. Like that's how I look at you like the old g. So it's like I'm not going to go do it tomorrow. Like, hey, everybody built me a gym. But you know, eventually that's the goal. When I look back, I'll be like, I seen Joe's gym in us.

Speaker 3:          00:15:36       That's what made dude, you train hard. I've seen your videos. Yeah. I get to work. You work at an unbreakable, your spot. That's a great gym. Yeah. It's a really good gym. Uh, Jay Glazer. Yeah. He owns that spot. Very, very impressive place. He put together an awesome place. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. The team there is good. Um, like I said, it's not all about like just fighting and being, you know, the biggest, baddest, meanest motherfucker. Like they really taught me about my body. That's what they do. They teach you there, whatever your goals are, they bring you, you know, up to that speed. So it was like, I weighed like 140 pounds ever since I got out of high school and I was like, fuck, I gotta get some ways. They helped me out and does it snoop train there too. This is video. Snoop sparring.

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       He's fine. Daniel Seraphim. Daniel's fucking crazy. Yeah, I know that guy. He was fights before. He said tank. He is crazy. You like guys a tank. Nuts. His thing is like, Yo, I gotta get hit. I'm like, all right Daniel. You know he's got to get him to wake himself up. Wow. There is those hits and his barn with them. Yeah. The soup was going at it. So he's trying to take him out. Dude. Snoop throw some good shots of them right there. Yeah. Snoop skills. He really does. I'm glad Daniel Duck that one. Yeah. I mean, let him smoke. I guarantee you snoop Dogg. That's funny right there. A lot of people in the regular fist fight. Yeah, he's tall. His Shit to look at him and at him like that. Look at those arms. Yeah, bit. Ugh. Ah, you can look pat. Go ahead snoop.

Speaker 3:          00:17:10       So that was ah, that Seraphin kinds of tank. Yeah. He fought in UFC for awhile. They're still fighting. Still active. Yeah. I think he's in Brazil right now. Yeah. Yup. He was working at the gym for a minute. Then he, I guess he chilled out. Yeah. It's, anyway, my point was the videos. It's nice to see because you're training hard, like watching you do more time. Get the pads. You're really putting in work on this, sir. Yeah. Yeah. It's a everyday thing. It's a journey. Like, you know what I mean? I'm just trying to learn. Ernie. Ernie Reyes is my, uh, oh shit I sent you. I right there. That was fun. He was teaching me some stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Why was early though? I suck right there. It's still though. Do you are sparring right there with one of the greatest Muay Thai fighters, if not the greatest of all time. Yeah. Dues. Super tiny. He's amazing. Yeah, he's really good. His videos like highlights. You ever see that jumping left? Switch kick. He knocked that dude out with yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Outstanding. Crazy kick. So how cool is that man, you, you're sparring with one of the greatest of all time. It's fun as fuck. Cause it's like those people like, you know about fighters, they're the majority. Like you said when you meet them they, they're cool as hell. Yeah. So to meet him and him not wanting to whoop my ass or like tell me like, hey, you look goofy. Sit down. He's like showing me shit that I could use later. So it was like, it was cool.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       Well the Thais have a really interesting way of sparring. Some of them do, they play right. They don't hit each other full blast. They're like tap and they'd laugh around and joke around. They're just developing their timing cause they fight so often. Yep. John Wayne Pars, a friend of mine from Australia, multiple time world champion and he, you know, he would, uh, talk in depth about how they would play. They just play. They just hit each other. Just slap each other a little bit and then you like that way they get understand the timing of it, but they never worry about it and they don't get hurt and they can do it all the time. It's a really smart way to do it. But you'll see guys like Seraphina and he's capable of doing that so he could spar with a guy like snoop or it got like sand track.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       It's barley with the guy like you and just play with you. Everybody just have a good time and it's fun at the end. Yep. Super Fun. Yeah. Yup, Yup. Hell yeah. Definitely seen that a lot. Like on Instagram and even with my trainers, we'll do it like mid, early. We was just doing that yesterday where it's like developing the timing of the kicks where it's like, you kicked me, I kick you, I can't you, you kick me, I kicked you twice, you kicked me three times. I kick you was like you said, just play it around. Yeah. And like when you got a good sparring partner, you can take care of each other. Exactly. Don't hurt each other. There's no ego involved and the ties they do like knees, they'll, they'll need the fuck out of each other. Like it looks like kind of hard, but they're just making their bodies harder like you said for later because it's like they're used to it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       A lot of times they'll slap each other with the side of their leg to write in and really drive the knee and you'll just hear yeah, they're just slapping each other a little bit. But it's obviously it's very effective. Like they figured something out. You got some crazy kicks. Thank you. Yeah, I seen uh, what was it a sidekick that you did? Probably turning sidekick. Yeah. You gotta teach me then I'll teach you that. Yeah, I want that. I just need the form because I'm learning just a regular psyche like a slide, you know what I mean? Go to like a taekwondo school. They'd be the best at showing you how to do. I'll definitely show you how, but if you need a place to train, find like a really good taekwondo school. Cause one thing talk window has some things that you know won't work in MMA.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       If you're adding take downs and punches to the face, but because they don't punch to the face and tournaments you get used to doing crazy, cacs crazier. They have a lot of weird, a lot of weird leg dexterity stuff. And if you get good at that stuff, I think that's a good, I had a kid that wanted to fight, I would say let's just do some kill cushion or some taekwondo first. Just do some karate. Something where you develop in leg dexterity. Paleo, Dan, as you get a little older than move you into Moitai. Right. So you could do both things because if someone's caught you when guys are like constantly chopping at the legs, they never really developed the kind of spinning kicks that you guys do where they don't kick the legs. Those are the guys that developed the best spinning kicks cause it's so easy to chop the legs and effective the chop the legs out.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       So a lot of those techniques don't really get that dialed in to the level that they get dialed in from a taekwondo guy cause they can't kick each other in the legs. Right, right, right, right. It's kind of a dumb way to fight cause you should kick the legs, but at the end of the day it, it allowed them to develop some crazy shit and a lot of weird spinning stuff spilling. Know some of those guys are so fast and the powers insane. Yeah, yeah. Cause just all momentum in torque and book crazy shit. But it's just, it's hard to develop, right? It's hard to develop those texts like a lot of posture and you gotta really, you gotta be balanced and you got that knee is everything. You gotta that Shit how you aim it. So it's like when you're spinning or even if you're just standing there, you have to have correct posture and to be able to do a couple of kicks.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Like you said, it's like a lot going sh coming at somebody spending blitz and doing all types of Shit. So it's different for show, it's really good for your balance to do that as a young kid than learn some other shit later. Right. You'll have balance. Yeah. That's what I've seen when you kicked the fuck out of that show was like yellowish, like really balanced and straight. Like, you know what I mean? The, the tech, cause a lot of people you might be strong as fuck, but you could see technique. Right, right, right. You know what I mean? And this, if you do the shit over and over and over and really perfected, that's different than just being able to throw a strong cake. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Um, techniques, everything man that way in Jujitsu so that way. And it's gotta be that way in music.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       It's going to be that way in everything. Yeah, definitely. Man. I'm in a studio like all the time practicing, like I could write a song before this interview's over, but that's because I practice, you know, it's not because like I'm the most lyrical person in the world. It's like I just fucking rap every day. Like, you know what I mean? So it should come easy. So when you write, do you write things out or do you, do you do it out in your head? Like, I know Jay z supposedly doesn't write anything. Right. It just keeps it all in his head, which is incredible. It's awesome that he can do that. Right? It's kind of insane. Yeah. Yeah. Yup. I have, I have different processes. So like for me, I kind of, I've melodies, like I'll sing and I'll wrap. So it's a lot easier for me to just have a melody in my head and make

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       up the words as I go. But if I'm writing lyrics, like writing words down where I actually wrap it, that's when I'm going to use the paper, you know? But there's different ways to do it because I honestly, this is what my studio set up looks like. It's like a chair. The Mike is right here. I don't go in the booth for anything in my engineer's sitting right there. So it's like we're, we're coming up with it as, as we go. Like I'll take a little break, just write something down and then I just jumped, jumped straight back on it. You know what I mean? So there's different techniques though. Cause a lot of the Times sometimes I won't write shit. I'll just go and just make it up and just keep going, keep flowing. Or there's times where I could just lay a melody and then write the words to it later.

Speaker 3:          00:24:28       So it's just different, you know, ways to approach it. So you just do it based on however you feel that day, whatever to track really calls for. It's like if, if the song is something that I get instinct inspiration, I'm like, oh, I'm a knock it out right now. Or if some that I want to live with for a little bit, I'll just do as much as I'm happy with at that point and then move on to the next thing, come back to it later and just make sure everything is fresh. I like to keep everything fresh, keep it fun, keep it loose. And I don't really overthink anything. If it's not there, then I just go, go away from it and find something that's more fun. Hell yeah, that's a, it's a beautiful freedom to be able to do that. You know, obviously pick the right fucking job.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       I swear like, you know, it's, it's, uh, it's work because I, I'm always looking for what's next. You know what I mean? For the fans, for the listeners, for the people who supported me all the way to this point, right. Like, okay, I got to push myself, I've got to do what's next. I gotta it's gotta be crazy. You know what I mean? I've got a son, he's sick. So I was like, I got to impress him. I couldn't have him just listening to a whole bunch of other rappers and not my music. So I was like, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:25:42       Yeah. It's uh, you know, it is an interesting responsibility you have, right? Yeah. Yeah. And a guy like you becomes famous to interesting. Like you have so many people that want, you know, and I think we need to call it a different thing other than work. Yeah. Cause it's like there's work, like, fuck, I work for ups. Yeah. That's cool. They've got good benefits, but that's work. Right. But what you're doing is like, you love it. Yeah. Hell yeah. You know, when you love something and almost we needed better word. Yeah. For sure. It's the same word as working at Mcdonald's. The same word work,

Speaker 3:          00:26:16       work. Uh, mark. The word would be you need a better word, like a passion project and able to do what you want to do. Exactly. Whatever that thing is. Yeah. Yup. No, I believe that that's, that's a good point. Cause it's not the same work. That's not the same thing. No, it's not the same thing we needed. We've done a work put in the work. Yeah. Yeah. That's why we had shit

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       job at, in your life. You know what that is? That's work. Yeah. We put in the work. We've done that, but saying I'm going to work. When you go on to do something you love, you're excited about. Yeah. It's, we need a better word. Yeah. That's why I think. No, it's true. That's why people get pissed at me. They're not going to work. It is a hundred girls there. [inaudible] Bro. I had to punch in just like you. Yeah. And that sense, the world is just not fair. You know, some people's jobs are not the same. Yeah. I mean fuck you stop and think about how fortunate you are. Yeah, Yup. Yeah. I thank God every day, Bro. Beautiful all the time. Cause it is, it is a blessing. I'm literally like last night I'm like right in a song and the only problem that I had was like a girls as was right on me and I was like, baby, like I, I'm enjoying this as much as you are, but I gotta like physically, right. So it's like your ass is like moving my arm around. Like you can do that, but just right there, you know what I mean? Like I know and I started thinking about it, I was like, wow, these are my problems. Like yeah, that's cool. Just snapped a little bit of discipline. I'm cool with that.

Speaker 4:          00:27:57       That's amazing. Well, I'm cool with that for sure. That's amazing. Yeah. Yup. And the song got written so we beautiful job got done. Yeah. That's it. There's another word, right? [inaudible] you were off work here. You're working, obviously you've been working at it, but it needs a better word, a nobler word. The fans will come up with the word for shorter. They're way more creative. You've got way more time on their hands. Yeah, I think they will figure it out and we'll report back for show. Find it. I did just make sense. There's no way. It's the same thing. It can't be, Nah, hell Nah for show. Nope. Yeah, and that's why I was telling people when people always try to think down there was trying to think, man, that's easy for you to say or not everybody can make it. Yeah, you're right. Not Everybody can truth, but maybe you can write like, what do you, what does that mean?

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       Not Everybody can. Everybody can. Everybody's going to do everything that everybody's going to walk to the top of the hill. That's the thing. Some people are gonna stop halfway and go, I can't do things. That's the thing. People limit themselves in a crazy way. They're like, oh yeah, everybody can't do it. It's like you said, it's like, no, everybody can't do it. It takes a lot. You know what I mean? You gotta fucking go through the Shit to get it. But when you get there, it looks awesome. Right? So yeah. I mean fuck, it's whatever it is. Try to figure it out and go do it. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Like you said at the top of the hill, it looks great, but some people settle for the middle. Yeah. And they get mad if people get to the top. This motherfucker, you know, they get mad. Yeah. Yup. At the top, man, there's no one who's like you. It doesn't work hard. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       So that's the myth, right? That's the thing too. It's like, man, it's a, again, the wrong word for it, right. Passion, hard, whatever it is. I mean, you dedicated to your craft and maintaining it is, there's an art to that, right? Because you work so freaking hard to get to where you're at. And then you get there and it's like, oh fuck, what do I do? Like there's no rest. There's no rest. And everything that was acceptable before becomes unacceptable because now you're up here. Uh, you know what I mean? So it's like, yeah, you have to, you have to, you have to pick your shots and like, you know what I'm saying? Can't really like, just go crazy like you did back in the day. So there's a art to it, you know what I mean? And that's how you really maintain and stay in that spot and even level up.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       So do you consciously think, okay, a balance out enjoyment with things that I have to do to stay disciplined? 100% yeah, 100% that's a very smart way of looking at it. Yeah. Yup. 100% like those, there has to be a balance of each because it's like, all right, now I'm at this new level. Like whether I want to behave like this or not. I put myself here, I worked hard, now I'm with these elite motherfuckers. So this is the, this is how I have to act because I'm not down here anymore. I worked from here to get here. So what happens? You balanced, you put things into place, you do a little bit of this little bit of that instead of a lot of that, you know what I mean? And you just pick your shots and it's like you're going to get everything in the end.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       This is how it's just planning how it's supposed to be, but you just piece it together just a little bit differently. Like I just turned 31 walk down. I'm about to be 32 as young too. A lot of people that's old to some people as well, but for me it's like there's a whole new mind state, you know what I mean? And I feel like through my twenties I was actually like a fucking teenager and like now I'm an adult. So now I look at things a little bit differently. It's like, Yo, I was really a kid. This is how you behave as an adult for the rest of your life. And it still involves a whole bunch of partying and having fun, but the business gets handled and things get approached totally differently. That's a balanced way of looking at it. Man, I love it. Enjoy it. That's how they think too. Like people have to understand too, to be someone like you, to be a very successful rapper and to not expect you to live the way you talk about all the time. It's so ridiculous. Right, right, right, right. Like you don't think he wants to party. He's talking about partying all the time. I think he wants to party [inaudible] party. This is just an act. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       It's weird. Right? It's crazy as fuck because people, they want you to be you. They want me to be myself. Right. They want to party. They didn't want

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       to take shots. They want to smoke weed. They want to stay up all night. Yeah. Why is that bad? It's not so many people want to do it, but it gives us a image in some people's minds like frivolous life. [inaudible] frivolous thinking, partying [inaudible] what are you doing? Drinking and smoking. What are you enjoying yourself? And then they come around and do the same thing cause they want it. It's like I have like a weird place in life where I think I'm like the key to a lot of shit because it's like if you want to enjoy yourself, I'm a guy. You know what I mean? It's like, aw man, I'm just fucking going to live through wisdom. It shows up. He's going to light the joint. It's going to be amazing if you want to fucking be professional, like especially in what I do, because there's a whole lot of rappers who like aren't business, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       They're not thinking like that. So for those guys, I'm their guy. Like they're, they look at me like where's has his shit together? Like he really handles his business. He talks to people, he shows up, he does this, he does that. So to be the party guy and the business guy, it's like amazing. You know what I mean? It's a, it's a lane that I kind of car for myself, but it's me in real life. So it's like, that's the only thing I have to do is really just completely be myself. Just be 100 fucking show up. Do my business thing. Tell people, do the right thing and fucking light to join. You know what I mean? That's it. That's a crazy business, sir. I'm, I'm good. I'm straight like that. That's amazing. Yeah. Yup. People listening to this support like wow, he could beat yourself for a living, for a show, bro.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       This blessing. It's a blessing. I, John Witherspoon on yesterday, but the son, j d okay. You know, pops with a spoon. Yeah. Yup. And that's basically what he is. He's one of the funniest fucking human beings that's ever lived and just keep a camera on them. Just keep a camera on him. That falls the guy from mass phase it in real life. Oh, he's amazing. He's so funny. He's, he's legit. My face was hurting today. Like the cheekbone muscles. They're like, ah, hey. He probably got some crazy ass stories. Oh yeah. That motherfucker been in the game forever and he's, that's who he is. He got paid to be who he is. Figuring out how to just be who he is all the time. Yup. It's the same damn bro. Yeah. Yeah. It's not limited to a one or two of us right now. There's a bunch of different paths.

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       That's the Copart. Yeah. Nope. Yup. Hell yeah. So how many years you've been trained in martial arts now? Uh, this is my second year. Wow. Only two years. That's amazing. Again, what? 35 pounds. He'll pull up a video of him hitting pads. That's incredible. Is it? Cause I don't know. Tell him, tell him what, what video is probably going to be old. But it's all good though. You know how we are. You can hit hard. You have good technique. You turn, you turn your hips and shoulders in the bay. Yeah. Yup. You do it right. So it's very that it's only two

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       years in. Yo, I'm learning that. Yeah. I love it. I love it when people take a chance to try something new. Yeah, that's old. But you know, we'll get there. So how many months had you been in here? Like you say, this is old. This was probably like a year. A year ago? Yeah. Yep. Still seriously though. Good technique for someone who's been doing it a year. The way you're moving. I mean, there's no fat to your movements. See what I'm saying? Like everything you're doing, it might not be the fastest in the world are the most devastating, but you're doing it perfect. Thank you. Doing exactly how you're supposed to do it. And then you just get better and better from there. There you go. We're talking about is the change in your physique, but mean you became fucking treaded. It's oppressive. Yeah. Thank you. That's only through hard work. You can't do it any other way. Yeah, just, just work and eat. And I was all, oh, I'm sorry. That's mine.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       That's hard to cut that off. Sorry about that guys. That's no worries man. Welcome to the wonderful world of convenience. There we go. Bam. Um, yeah. Eating like a motherfucker, bro. I, yeah, I had to like force myself to eat, um, to gain weight, to gain weight. I'm fucking just moving around so much. I already have a quick metabolism, so then you add working out to that. So it's like I'm burning so much old setting alarms to eat really little. Yeah. Yup. Getting a little bit more arrest. Too many alarms he eat like how's that work there? Like wake up and then you eat and then go to sleep, eat, go back to sleep train. He kind of to by Jesus Christ. I do a lot of like, like ginger shots. I'm like shit like that to help like yeah, to read all of that shit too.

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       Cause like you said that fuck your stomach up. Why? Who told you to get up in the middle of the night? Neat though. My trainer. Yeah. Yeah. Yup. I would, uh, I would say that your sleep cycles more important than anything. It wasn't, it's not like breaking my sleep. It's like more like yo eat. Oh you mean like you set an alarm like while you're awake? Yeah. Oh, can I see what you're saying? I've never heard anybody telling someone to wake up in the middle of the night and eat. Nah, not like to hear that. That's why it was weird. I heard that from a, there was that movie with Clint Eastwood where he played a boxing trainer and his daughter, that famous actress play the boxer. Man, that billion dollar baby or toddler. Yeah. Yeah. When that actress, what is her name? Hillary Swank. Hilary Swank. The job. Hillary. Thank you. We can change on the ball job man. When she was training for that, I think that's what I read, that they had an alarm set but she would wake up in the middle of the night and have a protein shake. Oh really? And then go back to sleep again. Now I'm not doing that. Okay now. No, no breaking asleep. Uh, just regular eating habits just reminded myself, you know what I mean? Cause I was eating like twice a day on some, just some rock star Shit. Can't live like that, bro.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       That shit is wack. Do you have a nutritionist or someone who handles your meals? Meal preps. Yeah. You got that. Because I don't cook. Right. So it's like they just deliver my meals. That's nice. Yeah. Yup. It's really nice actually. Yeah. Cause I'm single so it's like I don't really got nobody in the house like cooking or making all that shit happen for me. So it just comes through the door so you can make sure everything's healthy. Exactly what you want all that up for you. It's fresh every couple of days. That's a good thing to not have to think about the food. The food is like a big part of it and working out as one thing. People just want to get big. Like you said. I'm a, well like we were talking about, it's like mind, body and soul. Right. So the food is further, so keep that fucking meet alive yet.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       Keep the body moving. Yep. Are you, uh, do you ever do yoga or anything like that? I would. You would? Yeah. Yep. I need a yoga instructor. Who's the best yoga is, I don't know man. You do yoga? Yeah, I love it. Yeah. Yup. How long do, how long you, oh yeah, I see. You do like some hot yoga and shit. Yeah, man. Yup. Yeah, she's intense, right? It's kind of intense. Yeah. But it's a, it's great for you, man. Just stretches you out. Loosens you up. That's what I need to do. I need to stretch, you know? Yeah, I do like regular normal stretching, but some yoga would be hot. Yeah, it's good too because because of the heat in the room, everything gets real loose. Yeah. You can really kind of dig into like certain things stressed your frack to test your flexibility to stretch things out a little bit more.

Speaker 4:          00:40:08       Gotcha. Just keeps you pliable. Gotcha. You know when you're doing a lot of hard things like Moy Thai or weightlifting, everything's hard. Like there's not, not enough stretching things out and totally maintaining your range of motion. Yeah. Especially as you get older, how often you do it. I tried to do it at least once a week, but I often fail, but a two times a week in a good week. Okay. Yeah. It's all mixed. It, I can't do one thing every day board, so in order to stay active I just have to do a bunch of different things. That make sense. It's whether it's martial arts running or lifting or whatever it is. I feel like through time you like added those things in, right? Yeah. It was just like, all right, I'm going to do this. Yeah. The hill down into the most recent thing. Okay, cool. So what's hill running?

Speaker 4:          00:40:54       Cause I take my dog running through these steep ass fucking hills and then you know, sprinting up these, it's the most ruthless workout. Right. And you know if you've ever run hills. Yes. Yeah. Yes. The worst sand dunes. I don't like it. Sand dunes are the worst. That's probably sucks. It sucks. You have never get up there. He just, he keep, you keep pushing and you're pushing sand and pushing Sam. There's no hard, you don't ever bounce off anything, right. You just pushing through soft shit. It's, you're trying to find like balance and yeah. That's some real martial arts shit though. Yeah, for sure. That's a mental shift. Exactly. Yeah. You're learning about yourself and you're running up a fucking sand dune. You're mastering a fucking moving thing. Things Melton the whole time you're trying. Yeah. Wow. Okay. And you're forcing your brain, your body to do what your mind wants it to listen, bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:41:43       I know you don't want to do this. You're going to do this. That's like a, I heard the Diaz brothers do some crazy shit like swimming. Oh yeah, they do triathlons. Yeah. Fuck that Nick Diaz. I think it's now five times that he swam back from Alcatraz. Fuck that. Yeah. I'll contrast man. Sharks. Sharks. That, that's why I'm with you. Fuck that. That's so crazy. Those guys are so crazy. That's like you and the sand dunes though. Well, I haven't do, I don't do sand dunes. Oh, if I had one near me, I would do it. I run hills, which is definitely easier than sand dunes, but it's still hard as fuck. Good. Steep ass hill. It's the best for transit grass. Yeah. Dirt, dirt, rocks. Just anything. Just as trails. Damn, Bro. Yeah. I'm gonna get there someday. You'll see me come see me blazing.

Speaker 4:          00:42:38       I'll take you out. We'll go running together. I like to hike. It's a, it's a great workout, man. And the thing about it is it amps everything else out. Yeah. So like, um, it makes your kicking stronger. There's more wind. It just accentuates your ability to explode because you're running hills, so you're always going up. It's like you're doing these crazy plyometrics and use develop this. Does that forward a stronger power in your legs and your lower trunk? Boom. Yeah. More kitten power. Yep. That makes sense. Yeah. I feel like I will fuck with it. Dude. You'd love it. Cause I like to just tune shit out and just go. Yeah. So like the pain from running up the hill would just, I would be like, yes. Yeah. I'm not even gonna think about this. Let me think about something else. Yeah. Well, and you get a goal, right?

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       You set a goal like a mile, put yourself at one mile who and then turn around and go back for the other mile. Woo. Yeah. And if he can, if he can do that, I'm good. Steep ass hills. When you're done, you feel like you fought a battle with your brain. Woo. It's like, you know, you didn't want to do that, but you did didn't dog. All right. That's nothing compared to like some people do. Yeah. But Dot. That's, that's, that sounds like, you know, something that we could unlock later on in my life, I think for everybody. Doing something that's super strenuous for all the time is important. Yeah. For show for sure. That's part of the reason why I fuck with training, you know so much. Cause it's not easy and it it, it breaks you. Yeah. But you reach points where it's like, okay, now I'm just cruising so I need another challenge. Like you're just sharpening the shit after a certain point. So it's like, all right, now I'm gonna go run some sand dunes. Yeah. Swim from Alcatraz. So yeah, I can get it. There's doing somewhere down there like Orange County or they're pretty famous. 10 run up Manhattan Beach Park. That makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       It's a park. Yeah. Yeah. I was just, there's a video of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook train in there. I was about to pull up shit that we want to see somebody run on those dunes. Okay. Last broke be doing it. I know a lot of fighters do it in Australia. I believe Robert Whitaker does it. Yeah. See I'm backwards. When you do shit like this on Sam, that is phenomenal for your blog is so hard to do, man. Dying. Dying. That's so hard to do. And I wonder if they're running with just socks on. It looks like they are. Yeah. That's amazing. Too difficult. Fuck man. Cause that makes your feet strong cause you just, you've using every muscle in your toes to push through that sand. That's difficult. Fuck. There's levels to this life. Yeah. That's literally who's going to go to the top or who's going to stop in the middle?

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Yep. Yeah, yeah. Fuck those little decisions you make every day. I just seen my whole life just running up some dude. Yeah, that was cool. Yeah. That's awesome. It's like a mental martial art to wow. You're testing the mind hellion and like getting stronger at the same time. That's the cold part. Yeah. So it's like you could be up here the whole time and you're building all of this and becoming more explosive and more dangerous. The lighter on your feet and just when you started training and seeing these awesome benefits will you like, God dammit. Why wasn't I doing this all the time? Um, I'm actually happy that I, that I waited for a little bit cause I enjoy it. It's not like, oh, to me, you know what I mean? It's not something that I'm tired of or that that's a chore. I'm still figuring out new shit like all the time and getting better, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       And like, uh, for me I feel like the physical was probably like the first thing to come to me, uh, as like a, as a reward, as benefit. Like I see the, the, the physical shit, but now it's like the feeling that I get, you know what I mean? Or like, like we said, like posture and balance and technique improving and shit like that. So it's like learning that and feeling that and having that being a part of the process, I'm happy that now is, is happening as opposed to it being like old and played out to me. That's interesting. I think you'd love it either way. Yeah. I still love it. I still love training and I've been talking forever and forever. I'm 51 I started training when I was really seriously when I was 15. Oh Shit. Damn. So what the fuck was I doing? Yeah, I was feeling, I was rapping. We wrap it when you're 15 wow. When did you first get into student? That's one thing I really admire about a lot of rappers because we're always working. Rappers are always in the studio. Hopefully that's like a big thing though. It's like there's a discipline

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       aspect to it then I don't think that gets appreciated. Yeah, you have to be, you're always in the lab. They always working on constantly. It's like training and you gotta be, you gotta work at it. It's competitive. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta be in a studio, work with producers. You got to becoming new fucking no one who's next and who's like working with them and shit like that. So like at the end of the day, yeah, it's a crap. The Shit. I've been in the studio since I was like 1415 and there was times where my dad used to have to tell me like, Yo, get out of the studio. Like go play with your friends, be a kid, be normal. Like wow. Sound like there was times that shit happen. And even now, like I don't really do normal shit. You know what I mean? I might like go to the movies or like go to Dave and Buster's or something like that, but like I don't do shit. Like I just go to the studio much rather just, you know what I mean? Create. Well that's amazing that you figured it out so young. How old were you when you knew you wanted to be a robber? Uh, I think I was in third grade, so real shit. I think I was in third grade. That's amazing. I want to, I wanted to be an Ninja turtle and I wanted to be a rapper and I think a rapper was like a little bit more realistic. I'm working on being a Ninja turtle now.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       That's amazing. Fifth Grade, third grade, third grade again, you're nine, you're not. Yeah. Yeah. That's when I started writing my first raps and shit is hilarious. I was like watching music videos and I remember seeing like puffy and biggie bone thugs and harmony is like one of my favorite groups. So it was like, Yo, if I could do that I'll be high. And then, um, by the time I was like 13, uh, that's when the Internet was really popular so you could download like instrumentals and shit like that. So you didn't have to like have beats or anything. Then they started introducing, you know, uh, at home equipment they had like little task him for track little bullshit thing that you could, you know what I mean? So I started fucking around on that. Mike doing my own little home studio. Then fruity loops came out, started making beats.

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       Cool. Edit pro was like the, the program back then before protools and yeah, that's how I got my start. Like just in the fucking in the, in the crib, just putting it together. Then I turned like, then by the time I was like 16, I got like an internship at a, at a studio in Pittsburgh where I was literally like answering the phones and running errands and going to pick up like office supplies and shit like that. And in return they will pay me with studio time. So like I will just record like off, you know what I mean? Off the clock. You know what I mean? I had like four or five songs and that turned into the record. Do. Wow. Yup. Got My first deal at 16 that's an amazing story. That's wild. That's, that's a movie story. That's crazy. You always knew.

Speaker 3:          00:50:31       Yeah. Yup. It was something that I worked at for sure cause it was like being in in Pittsburgh. You ever been to Pittsburgh? Yeah. You know it's pretty crazy out there. Right. Crazy. How like it's just a really wild city, like the Midwest. So it's like there's either a couple of things you can do and there's not a lot. And working a job is like the last thing that anybody wants to do in Pittsburgh. So all my cousins and everybody that I know do different shit than what I was willing to do. I was like, Yo, I'm not trying to be that guy. Like, like that. So it was like, how am I going to make a way for myself? You know what I mean? How the fuck am I going to get still be fresh still. You know what I mean? Enjoy myself. Have a good time but be safe and like have fun.

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       It was music so it's amazing. You nailed and nailed it young. Yup. That's a beautiful thing to know what you want to do. Yeah. And just be working towards it. Have for many people that's the real problem. The real problem was like finding a thing. Yeah. You know, finding a thing that they really love so much to fit all their energy into. Yeah. I mean I'm blessed to grow up in a time to where technology was like taking over and shit and I think like if you're my age and you like make music or got a camera or you know what I mean? Anything around that you good like and now I think it's like if you have anything to do with weed, like you know what I'm saying? You're not to grow it. If you could sell it, if you could brand it, if you could come up with light technology or whatever it is like that's going to be the future for this generation.

Speaker 3:          00:52:07       It's like pot. This is going to be a lot of that for sure. It's going to open up to everybody. I think once they realize how much money there really is and pot and how safe it is in comparison to liquor and all these other established things that we evolved. No one has a problem with alcohol companies, right? No, no, no. Nobody has a problem with them. Nobody has a problem with you drinking at 12 in the fucking afternoon. Like I get on planes all the time. People will be like, Yo, let me get a little, it's like people getting fucked up, Yo on a plane. That's totally fine. We just have to shift attitudes. Yeah. Yup. People just have the wrong attitude about it. They, they think it's something negative and something that could be negative to some people, but that's like everything else.

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       That's like food, sex, gambling, everything, shopping, everything. You had been shopping for sure. People go crazy. People lose their mind chopping. Yeah. They can't buy enough things. Buying crazy shit. Just cause just cause yeah, that's, that's as much of a addiction as anything. Nope. But pod can definitely for some people derail them. I don't think it's for everybody. Nah, it's a medicine. So you got the right dosage. That's, that's a good way of looking at it. I think some people react to it weird too. Yeah. I mean certain people's experiences on everybody else's experience. So it's like if you got fucked up on weed, that's you. So I was like, don't put that off on everybody else. And I think like, like anything, it takes time to, you know what I mean? Like I can't take Percocet because it's like that shit will fuck me up cause I don't do painkillers.

Speaker 3:          00:53:39       But I think over a certain amount of time, if I had an injury, my body will start to react differently to certain amount of Percocet. But like off rip, it's gonna fuck me up. You know what I'm saying is I'm gonna throw up, I'm going to do all types of Shit. But you know, after awhile, you know what I mean? There's people who just popped that shit and just walk around like, you know what I mean? Normally, yeah. That same way with me smoking a joint and it's like there's some people who could hit this and be in that corner for the rest of the day. For me, I'm going to go do everything that I have to do. So it's a medicine, it's a dosage and you have to train your body for it. I think that's true, but I also think some people might not react to it correctly in terms of like biologically.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Yeah, I think they might have an allergy. Like it might be like Broccoli or something. There's people out there that are allergic to weird shit. Right. There's some people I think that just, I've heard of that that experience is just not good for their, like they're allergic to it. I don't, I mean, you know, I'm just guessing. I don't know. I mean it made sense. I think it's opinion like if you, if you believe it or not, you know what I mean? Like, if you want to believe that, I feel like you're entitled to believe that. And if you don't want to believe that, then it's like, okay, cool. You're, you're that guy too.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       Okay. I don't know either what you said. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know either bro, because it's like I'm on the fence because it's like, you know, on one hand people, I mean, I don't know. Fuck yeah, yeah. Whatever. It's medicine. It's fucking medicine. And I like it. A lot of people that like it, it's not what everybody thinks it is, is wrong idea of it. One of the things I found out real early on, it's how many Jujitsu guys smoke weed and do Jujitsu. Yeah. You've seen the high rollers state? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hi. Rowers has, uh, all these awesome events where they do, they smoke weed and then they fight in a Jujitsu match. Yup. My partners, uh, are, are, are a big part of that. Lonnie and breeze. And they're the ones who actually got me like kind of, you know, into fitness.

Speaker 3:          00:55:41       So to see them like, and I'm the one who got him in the weed. So it's like to see it like crossover. I never would have known like, you know what I'm saying? How many Jiu Jitsu dudes like smoke weed and like our about it like, yeah, the House that she helps her Jujitsu, it really does. It helps like slow it down for you. Right. I don't even know if it's slow it down. It's like a tunes out the rest of the world. Like you me become freer. It's very weird. Like more creative. There's, it's definitely uh, it's better for rolling than it is for drilling guy. Just like when someone's trying to teach you something, sometimes your brain's just not just hide, your brain's not taking in. But if you were sparring it would be good. Got You. You just, you flow better. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       That makes sense. That makes sense. I haven't done Jujitsu yet. I'm gonna get there eventually. You would love it and you've got long limbs, man. You'd be perfect for choking people. Yep. Armbars triangles and shit. And I'm going to get there. You could do it. Yup. I told like bill for it. I feel like I'm going to just fuck with stand up for like a couple of years and then just gradually do other things like, and I'm saying, yeah, I'll just probably do Jujitsu for like four or five years. Yeah. And for sure you should just learn some shit. Yeah, that'd be great for you man. Yeah. You're like I said, you're built for it almost the perfect frame for fighters as long it seems to be a long, as long as you're strong. It's like the John Jones frame. That's the perfect frame, right? It's, you can't get close enough to him.

Speaker 4:          00:57:09       He can hit you when he wants to and then when he grabs a hold of you, he's strong enough and he's better at wrestling. He's going to throw you around. Like if you could come up like that's the perfect, the perfect combination as long and strong. Oh yeah. Perfect. Yeah. Tweet dude's like [inaudible] they, they bucked that trend, right because it just tanks. But the best I, it seems to me like just mechanically than best frame is the long frame. So you have like the best frame for fighting. Fuck graduations. Thank you. I'm in there. It doesn't guarantee success, but it's a fucking awesome base. There we go. I'm starting. I'm working with some. Yeah. Yeah. Just like short dudes like me can't put big guys and dry angles. I was going to have enough leg room does not enough. Like mechanically. I'm sure you could figure it out.

Speaker 4:          00:57:55       Not really. Yeah. Is he going to give up on that one? But a long guys can get triangles from all kinds of places. Okay. You'd love it. Super. It's a thinking man's game too. You know? It's like, are you, you're playing a game. Yeah. You know? Yeah. The thing that I like about it too is that you can go full blast. Okay. Whereas like if you're sparring, you don't really want to go full blast or hurt each other. Right. You want to be tempered, measured, and just kind of touch each other. But when you do sparring in Jujitsu, silly because you're not striking each other. You just wrestling and grappling. You can go full blast. Okay. That's amazing. I'm with it, bro. I'm super with it, like the little bit that I've done, I was like, all right, cool. I could see. Right. Yeah. And I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm down.

Speaker 5:          00:58:41       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:41       Definitely got to go there. I just love the fact that you're interested in doing different things. Yeah, for sure. So I'm alerted. Do you do read books? Do you, uh, do you watch documentaries? I watch documentaries. Yeah. I have read some books, uh, that I gravitate towards. What kind of documentaries you gravitate towards? Dyke music really always about, always about music. Um, let me see what else. Yeah, it's always about music. Like musicians searching for sugar man. What was that one that was about this dude who was a guy who was making music? I F belong, I want to say it was in the 70s and he had a like a little bit of buzz on his album and then it died off for him and he went back to work as a construction worker, but his music became insanely huge in South Africa. He was a superstar and there was all these legends about him that he was dead.

Speaker 4:          00:59:44       That, you know, the, just the, just crazy stories about who we was. Me and mom, this guy was working as a construction worker, so in South Africa, he's a fucking mega superstar, like sells out arenas and spoiler alert, it's a great documentary. Should see it, but he eventually goes to South Africa and does this concert there. You'll cry, you'll cry. You're like, oh my God. Can you imagine this guy was working as a laborer? And the whole time was, he was a superstar and he didn't even know it. And the people see him, they're singing along to his music. I mean, the guys blown away. I would love that. It's a crazy document. I checked that out. It, it's, it's insane to watch. Like how could this be true? Eh, Eh, Dale, it's amazing. I kind of feel like I heard the name, but I never, never, never got to watch it grow.

Speaker 4:          01:00:36       Yeah. It made me cry. I gotta check that out. At the end of it, you'd be like, wow, I'll Haley hajj in this guy's experience. They almost like being released from jail or something. Yeah, exactly. Damn. Yeah. That's incredible. Holy Fuck. Yeah, I'm gonna check that out ma. And seeing how comfortable he gets on stage to wow. There's amazing dam. Yeah. His music is good too, man. Varying. Very interesting. Is he still alive? I believe he is alive. That's fine. He's alive, right? Yeah. So he's able to see the proceeds from his movie and his, yeah. Hell yeah. But someone said, I think he gave away all his money. Really? I read something about that might be more of those rumors and legends allege on another myth. Damn sure.

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       Yeah. Jamie, find out that dude gave his money away cause I felt like I read that. I was like, Bro. But life to him is so surreal. Anyway, truth maybe he felt like he couldn't be a real bonafide artist unless he gave away his money or something crazy because you've got, the guy was living in like this. That's why I don't want to do Iowasca or anything like that. God, I feel like that's what's going to happen to me. You want to give away your money here? Fuck that shit was like, whoa. No, no, no, no. That's hilarious. It's too tricky. You could, you could get, so, you know, so, so charity driven, just give away everything and then you're working for charities, which is walking the earth barefoot to her last year to run theaters all over the good shit. Sugarman. He's back. He's back. He's smacking her so much. That documentary did, he gave away all his money yet. Dave Matthews covered one of his songs and then went on to help blow him up. Oh Man. Oh yeah. Damn. You just doing good. So he ain't giving away nothing beautiful. He might have, but I don't see anything back. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       it's, the documentary is really amazing. That's one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, that's a good one. Tell me a good one. My documentary. Oh man, it's called behind the camera. Yeah. So apple music. Oh, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Yeah, just did that. I just did that. I just did that.

Speaker 3:          01:02:53       Beautiful Man. Not um, I like to watch, like I watch this pink Floyd documentary about how they put together, uh, their albums, shit like that. Um, there's another one about like, uh, background singers who never liked, became super popular. But they're like potter part of uh, songs that you hear and that you love. And it's just like telling them the story, like how writers and you know what I mean? Being in studio, home wit, it's like to live that life. It's really cool cause I listen to the harmonies a lot. I don't know if when you hear music I hear like all the textures of it. So it's like I get interested in what goes on sometimes like in the background. And that was a cool story. I'm fucking, what was the last one that I actually watched? I just watched, I'm watching this show actually. You ever heard Trenoble hurt? Hardly shows. Amazing that shit. It's kind of cool. I heard it's great man. It's pretty awesome. But that's not music though. What is that on? Is that Netflix, HBO, Hbo Coming Back, game of Thrones didn't kill him to Nobu. Is it really? Yeah. Good. I'll show lit. It's all you need. Here's a big show in HBO is back.

Speaker 3:          01:04:06       Chernobyl. What is it about the, the accident? Yeah. How many episodes is it? I'm not sure. They're like streaming them now. So it's like, oh, it's streams. Yeah. Yup. It's on like the fourth or fifth episode. I think all those networks that don't stream everything. Yeah. Like they must be, it must suck to have like a show that has to be on Thursday night at eight losing out just today. So weird man. Want to watch things whenever they want it right now? Yes,

Speaker 4:          01:04:33       for sure. Five apartment, new series. The last episode is coming up this week.

Speaker 3:          01:04:37       Oh, okay. There you go. How do you think the movie theaters were always be here? Mm hmm. Shit. Nah, I want that thing. Eventually. Ain't gonna be gone. What do you think? I don't know. Just it's one of the, I kind of, I liked it. They're real, you know, there's a,

Speaker 4:          01:04:53       a place you go, they're already kind of came and gone twice. If you look around all the Hollywood, there's old theaters that aren't theaters anymore, but there's new theaters that have taken over them. But those buildings are still there for whatever reason. I still use the number. Well, people still like going to the movies. It's like a, it's a night out

Speaker 3:          01:05:09       saying, yeah. You know, I go like it costs so much to like keep screening, actually put movies in and then you

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       got the popcorn. It's like, but it's one of the few things that we do in with strangers is like be a part of an audience. It's like one thing, the few things we ran, we do at giant groups of strangers. I feel like technology is like removing that because people don't like that. I think people are uncomfortable with it because most of the time we spend on devices for communicating through devices and especially with like virtual reality becoming more popular. You know, like people love access. So it was like if you're making them feel like they're, they're like, why would you want random dude walking across your lap when you can just be in the movie? Like yeah, I feel like they would just spend to spend that money on, you know, keeping you at home, like where you want to be. That's just my opinion.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       I don't know. No, I think you're right. And I agree with you 100% but I also think as a community of human beings, it's nice to have things that we all do together. Yeah. It fosters like a kind of getting along better and friendship. I love that. People that you don't know. I think that's what's good about sports. I like concerts because of the concerts. Yeah. Yeah. When you go to grow the whole group of people to see something like it's nice you connect to tell you it feels good. Baseball Games cause I've had fun at games and I gave a fuck about what was going on, but it's the community that was going on for sure. 100% that's what I mean. I mean never everyone's kind of drinking. I'm fun. That is an important part of cities. Communities. That's one thing that I think that or like a movie theater does provide.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       Yeah. I mean for sure. Concert for sure. And I'm not even mad that people don't really go to the movies like that now because it's like when you actually do want to go, you can go and it's not full and it's not, you know what I mean? Like it'll be people there, but it's not overwhelming to the point where you got like, it fucks up your movie experience. So it's like, it's kind of, you know, it's doable. It's enjoyable. It's handleable. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. It's fun. I like where the movies is that right now I am worried that people are eventually going to all be living in some sort of a VR world. Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's designed to move that way. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like you give people something and they're going to use it and they're going to get better.

Speaker 1:          01:07:40       Yeah. A new one. Yeah. Yeah. It was going to have extra features. Yeah. So it's like, all right, like, you know, I get it. Like, fuck, have you fucked with any of that VR stuff? Yeah. VR is awesome. Do you ever do that? There's a thing outside of Disneyland where you uh, there's a VR game that you go through. You go through like this little like they have a like a giant room and the room set up for them. What it was they called the void. Is that what it's called? Yeah. Holy Shit. Void VR. And there's a star wars one and there's a wreck it Ralph one. Okay. And they're hilarious. I mean you're, you're walking around, you feel heat from fire, they pick up a gun, you shooting

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       at storm troopers and it's crazy. It's crazy. And while you're doing it, you'd like, this is just step one. Exactly. This is going to be, is saying there's one a year in those pieces. Bits and pieces. It's like they already have more. Do you think that Oh for show 100% I don't think that really. Yeah, cause I think that what they're showing you right now, state of the art, they're selling it. It's the best. Again, that's in competition. It's getting better and better all the time. But that's a good way to look at it because they put it up myself, my find me. No worries man. Yeah. I just think these people were very competitive. Yeah. The money is in getting the best shit out the quickest. Okay. And they're all competing with each other. So they're putting out like the bootleg virgin and letting somebody smarter, uh, test it, work it and make the better version.

Speaker 4:          01:09:06       Then they'll come back and do that later. Well that definitely happens to, I mean that's a what China does better than anybody. I take some shit and just redo it. I'd be feeling like, this is just, my theory is like VR. Right? It might be so fucking dangerous that they don't know like how it will live it out. Yeah, exactly. So it's like they give us like little bits and pieces of it. Let us, you know, they spoonfeed it to us so they don't kill us and the world just go crazy. And it's like, you know what I mean? Like, cause they probably tested it on somebody and they died like Taylor. You know what I mean? For sure. Yeah. They was like, Oh shit, we went too far. It's like, oh, let's like pull it back a little bit and just give them this, like you said, give them this version of it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:53       You know what I mean by, I feel like there's more, well, I think when they, when you really don't know what the fuck is going on, that's with military stuff. I think military stuff like weapons and you know, space ships and aircraft that they're developing. We don't know what the fuck they're doing. They're doing some shit that we have no idea. But I think with things like consumer electronics, like technology, I think what you see is what you get. I think this is as good as they can do anything. Now. They're working on the newest best shit. Right. You know, and that's coming around. They're always constantly in development, but they're all competing against each other. There is no way they would hold anything back. Really? Yeah. I don't think so. Damn. I feel like there's a phone that charges in two seconds. It's like, okay, if you're way you didn't have it out if you're in a war.

Speaker 4:          01:10:39       Right. And your cellular device goes down. It's like you can't plug it in and charge it. It, it has to like happen quick. Right, right. So like they have that, in my opinion, they just don't give it to us. But that all that stuff, the, I can see your argument because it's, you're in a war. They might have better batteries like that the military develops or some new kind of battery that's possible. But there's so much money in batteries. Like there's so much money. If they had a better way of doing it, right. If Samsung came out with a phone, right. Charged 100% in 30 seconds and it you, apple would have to do it. I have to figure out how to compete with them. They would have that out. Right. I wouldn't hold onto that. No one would hold on to that because that would just dominate the market. It would dominate the market too. Powerful. But that happens. That's what always happens to me. That's how blockbusters out of business. Right. You know? Right, right, right, right. That's why there's no more tower records. I'll let, I'll let shit happen in our lifetime.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       Yeah. For show like 100% music isn't even physical. Right. Like, and I make music in this. It's not real. Right. It's a sound. It's a sound and fuck, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:11:56       That is a crazy way to look at music. [inaudible] what is this? The [inaudible] 17 pro, which the company's latest is the fastest charging smartphone in the world. It advertises that 35 minutes is all it takes to entirely fill up a dead battery seven months ago. So, so it's probably faster than again, something like that. For sure. 35 minutes. So what do you think they can do? Like for a full battery, I would say that there's probably a hundred cell phones out there that can charge in five minutes. There's not a million, cause they can't source that much. Maybe charge more than this, Ken. Like yeah, I would say like there's a military phone that they might have a hundred of them around the military, but it's not mass produced can charge up in five minutes. Sure. For sure. For sure. If this can do 35 minutes, Youtube, she's seven times fast. You guys are all good spirit toward [inaudible]. It's

Speaker 3:          01:12:44       just, yeah, I mean to meet as normal leap to me, that shit is normal. This is energy that we're talking about. Right, right, right bro. Like cars still move off of gas. Like that shirt. It's like the stone age Bro. Like shit's going electric. You know what I'm saying? Like that's awesome. Spaceships Shit. So they, I mean like at the end of the day, like they have this shit, they just can't give it to you because they, they're killing people testing it. It's like, it's like food, you know what I mean? Like they have to approve this shit before it comes out. But they have a car that goes, it just crashed into the wall, you know what I mean? And somebody died in and they're like, well we can't put this on the streets yet. It's like all of that shit energy. Yeah. Like, well you think they have a car that's so fast, they can't put it on the street. They had, I just feel like transportation in general. You know what I mean? Communication, transportation, technology. The way we hear music, the way that we do things and shit like that. Our whole experience, tech, technology, tick, whatever the fucking word is, we're being spoonfed, facetime. You know what I'm saying? It was like you used to have to have the service to facetime. Now everybody can facetime. You know what I mean? It's like people don't even call each other no more. They just facetime, so we feel like, oh man, came up

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       this, this is blah, blah, blah. Like we feel good about that. We feel excellent about it, but there's more. I feel like that's just me. I just feel like they're just sitting on it. You know what I mean? They're waiting to give it to us. I don't think companies have any reason to do that. Yeah. The only reason to do that would be to get rid of the stock of the stuff that they're already selling. That'd be the only reason. Cause sometimes when companies announce a new products, common people stopped buying the old product. Like corvette is having a problem with that right now. Cause the corvette [inaudible] excuse me. They got in this car, the Zr one thing. It's a demon. It's ridiculous. So you could go to a store and buy a car that has that much horsepower, but a lot of people don't want to buy them because then there's a new corvette coming out in like a year.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       That's a mid engine total read new design that we want to be stuck with the old one. Gotcha. People get weird. Yeah, that's true. So in that sense, they might be holding out on what they're about to be able to do, but like we saw with that foldable phone at Samsung tried to come out with and then they had to take it back because it was so defective. So many of them were breaking. It was a giant embarrassment and they pulled the whole thing and now they're trying to rework it and figure out what to do with it. That that's like if a company has something like that happen, and that's the number two smartphone company in the world. They're number one, right? Samsung's number one while ways number two, apples number three. That's a number one cell phone manufacturer in the world and they got that kind of a fuck up.

Speaker 1:          01:15:33       There's no way they're not holding back anything. I don't think so. I think they're trying to sell the best shit they have right now and then they're in development with the next level shit right now. But as far as like what they can bring to market but they have is what they bring to market. I think like those onscreen fingerprint sensors that didn't use to be able to do that and now they can just touch the glass and it reads it all. That shit is like, they're just trying to get it dialed in to the point where they could sell it to enough people and it doesn't break like that stupid folding. Did you see that folding screen is like a fucking like it was a regular phone but it folded them. Yeah, it would fold up into like an iPad. IPAD, yeah. Yup. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:11       That's just stupid. But that thing kept breaking and you know when it came out everybody was like, Holy Shit, this is the future. The Glass Benz. I think there's like, like you said, there's like the, the, the people who just freak out about whatever's new, right. And then there's like, shit that really moves the, you know what I'm saying? Like, like really changes shit. You know what I mean? Sure. And there's a huge difference between those. Like you've got the people who just want the new shit and then you got motherfuckers who's actually like doing shit that changes things forever. Like streaming changed music forever, you know what I'm saying? So it's like many discs and all of that other stupid shit that people were trying to do to change music. It didn't work. You know what I mean? And it didn't exist. So it's like the one thing that stands out and changes things forever. That's what motherfuckers remember. I don't know if they're holding it or not. It is what it is. But like there's some smart motherfuckers who

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       designed this shit for us, you know what I'm saying? And at the end of the day, like the pit, you got people who just consume it and they're just like, aw man, I'm here for, for whatever, whatever. Like you know what I mean? And then I feel like there's a lot of people who understand it and know how to play off of, you know what I mean? Those people's emotions and that's where you get like, you know what I mean? What we have now and me personally, I love everything. Like I'm not a person who like it stuck with the old shit or has to have all of the new shit either. Like I'm just like obsessed with life in general. Like all of this shit fucks me up. But it's crazy. It's insane. We living in same time, we live in an insane time. What's cool about today too is that we can go and still like appreciating you some of the shit from the past.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       Like a record player. Yeah. User record. Listen to some old records. Right. You know and realize like, wow, this is how people used to get their music sit in front of the record player with headphones on. I remember being a kid doing that would listen to the album. They open up the all album looking at the art. That was a big part of an album. Right. What was the photo layout? What was the, the pictures were, it's crazy how everybody thinks like the new shit ruins the older shit too. Right. It's like people still enjoy everything. Yeah. Like you know, it's just stages of it. I love that. That old should exist. Yeah. Hell yeah. Go back and listen to some of that old stuff. People don't watch tapes anymore though. Like you can't get like a VHS like that. That's not the move. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:18:41       Those are dead and gone be h s c h and when someone would give you a copy of a copy and it was all like every now and then I have a little lines through and shit. You get like second, third generation copies of friends. Yeah. Vhs is are done, bro. Even me, I don't know if you remember this, but you used to be able to buy movies right after they came out, especially in New York because dudes would sit in the back of the movie theater. I like the little bootleg joints. Yeah, Yup. Yeah. And watched the movie from like, it was like a video camera and be like in their video in the movie. Yeah, that was, that was crazy. That was a crazy time. Yeah. They weren't hiding shit back then.

Speaker 3:          01:19:21       They were using all of their technology. That's everything. They had everything they fucking had. The crazy thing is that not that long ago per terms of the human race. That's not that long ago. That's the nineties that's, that's so recent. This is what, 2019 so I 20 years. So you go back 2124 years maybe. And I imagine if you could see what the fuck 24 years from now is just crazy. I've related to like when I was younger in the 90s cause I was like a baby in the 90s I wasn't even a teenager. So 20 years from this was the 70s and shit was totally like, you know what I'm saying? So it's like now from 20 years from to for that to be the same time frame. Like that shit is crazy me. You really

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       want to know how crazy it is man. Get yourself into like a 1970 Plymouth and drive that thing and realize that in 1970 [inaudible] that's how people drove. They drive this thing, they like it barely knows where, where your talents are. Yeah. Hell yeah. I could do this with the steering wheel steering in the 60s and Shit Bro. Like you're ready to turn the thing. A lot of them didn't, a lot of them didn't. But do you use, those cars were terrible and that was just a few years ago. I mean in terms of like human history, right? If you looked at a block of time in history, like if you looked up difference between 1820 and 1840 and our head it's like that's the same shit. 1820 1840 what the fuck was different? There was nothing different. But if you look at our generation 40 years ago to now, it's insane.

Speaker 4:          01:20:57       It's true. That's insane. It doesn't even make sense. It's nuts. It's a bear. We're barely the same thing, bro. It's crazy. It's crazy. Have you driven a Tesla? No, I have it. That good. The preposterous to preposterous car. What's the deal with them? That's so fast. It doesn't make sense really. Every other car you drive afterwards, we'll feel stupid. You could drive mine. You've got Tesla. Yeah. Yeah. You could drive it there. That legit. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever driven in my life. Fuck did. It doesn't make any noise. It doesn't make, it makes zero noise. This makes noise.

Speaker 6:          01:21:42       It's a fucking rap

Speaker 4:          01:21:43       music video. Entourage

Speaker 6:          01:21:45       style.

Speaker 4:          01:21:47       Girls in their underwear house dancing bottle of champagne. Girl in my house so much. Just follow you. The camera just to see who rings your doorbell, right? I don't know. I know who that girl was at the party. What were we just talking about? Teslas. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a spaceship. It's next level. If you think that they're holding back anything in the automotive world, drive that thing and you'll see Nah, that's, that's the thing. I feel like all cars are going to look alike and they're gonna look like Teslas. So you're going to have the super fast one for like the elite motherfuckers, but then they don't have like regular ones and then we're all going to have the same car or we're all going to have the same phone where I'm going to have the same watch and we'll all, because it controls everything.

Speaker 4:          01:22:30       Like they control your house. So it's like everything is integrated. The TV, the Xbox, it's like you all wanted in one. So the only way to do that is for everything to be the same. So like if the Tesla, is that ill, I never drove driven one but if it's that ill, I don't see why people wouldn't be into it. Like it's just a pain in the asses. It takes a long time to charge it. I mean even if you have a Tesla supercharger thing, like I have one on a wall mounted charger that's, it's like more amps type. It's nice, but it still takes a few hours to charge if it's almost dead. Whereas you can get gas like five minutes. Exactly. Portable chargers. No, no, no. They ain't do [inaudible]. No, you need insane amount of power to power that thing. But how long giant batteries in it just takes hours and hours to fill up.

Speaker 4:          01:23:18       That doesn't sound like fun. Well, because it goes 317 miles to see this race they did with the tunnel. Two Teslas at the same spot, like I guess it's in Hawthorne where they have it. The one on the right is using the tunnel. They haven't completed in the one the left is going above ground. No. Is this tunnel like auto drive? It's got fuck things got those tracks on the side so that it can stay in place. Look how fast ads going 127 miles an hour. So not comfortable with that and it slows right down the way that it moves differently. That's how robots are gonna kill us as crazy. It's so fast. You can't believe how fast it is. That guy's not moving at the top. And the guy's moving very fast. Takes him four and a half minutes to go the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:23:57       It takes six guy a minute. That guy's battery's dead as fuck on the right. I'll tell you that. If you stop on that thing for that long, you better be prepared for that shit to drink quick. Especially when it's in ludicrous mode. That's what they call it. Ludicrous mode. Yeah, and now they have ludicrous. Plus I'm, I don't even want to turn that shit on. I don't need that. What kind of assholes? Unhappy with ludicrous mode was gonna ask before. Don't you think there's some car company trying to beat them? Yeah. Has to be right. Tesla has a roadster or have you seen the Tesla roadster? Oh my God. Jamie pulled that up. It's a spaceship. It's this little sports car looking spaceship that goes zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds.

Speaker 4:          01:24:34       It's a spaceship. It's a spaceship. That's the Tesla roadster. I like that. It's a dope look and little car. The roof comes off too. As Real, Huh? Oh my God. That thing's a demon, I think is a dean. How much of that because I think it's $200,000 it's real. Yeah. It's not out yet. I'm working on it. Oh, okay. They're working on releasing it soon. Yeah. 200 grand. Look at that 1.9 seconds. Zero to 60 yeah. I don't need that. They just seem the electric cars, it seemed like the future. But again, that one's going to be interesting because it has 600 miles. It goes 660 miles I think without, uh, without charging, which is long distance minds and like 317 the new ones, the ones that have now like three 17 that's dope, man. That's amazing. It's wild. Like my mind is literally blown by this shit.

Speaker 4:          01:25:31       Yeah. I mine too. Like for real, like that shit blows Madsen. Imagine if you one of those people that makes those things. Yeah. Like that's your job. I feel like it's like really a process like scientific like, you know, cause you don't want nobody to hurt themselves. You know what I mean? So you have to get it just right. Sure. It's like, what's the process of that? Like, what are the fuck are they doing like with technology and and electricity in a car? Yeah, and they have all the, all these safety features. They have auto drive. That's itself saying it's going to be so fast. Guy Have Hell safety. Jesus Christ. I'm just going to let you in. I can't turn this thing off. Oh, there it is. The same girl. I don't know. She's persistent. She's a go getter. I don't know. She need to go get something else, but yeah man. I mean it's when you drive something like that and you realize like, oh, okay, just 30 40 years ago, cars were these stinky, weird things that barely steered, right? And now you have these things that it seemed like it seemed like there from a futuristic movie and you can get them right now. It's crazy. Like it's insane because people like, okay, where are we going to be without transportation? We got to go somewhere. Right? We got to get there somehow. What is this, Jamie?

Speaker 7:          01:26:51       I was looking up. I thought I saw something today about a Lamborghini electric car, but this fell into this hole of the tourism. Millennials, some new, it is an electric car. Buy a Lamborghini that self heals. It has some sort of carbon fiber technology that allows it to fix itself. If it cracks watts dry, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:27:06       Oh yes. We text cracks and damages to go. It's a fucking transformer. The transformer, it's going to heal itself. That I was hoping you had heard of it. No. Self healing. Oh my God. There we go. It's going to fix itself. Sorry to distract from that, but yeah, it's Italian, right? Yeah. Listen to me. That's my people. It ain't gonna work. Those savages. It looks insane though. This they're thinking big. If you'd want to go on a long trip and a Lamborghini, you're out of your fucking mind. That thing. We'll leave you in the middle of the desert. They thinking B. That's it. Yeah. That is a, it's got these weird, crazy, unbelievably good looking car tires. Damn, that looks like the future. That's fine. Look at that thing. Suspicious Shit. But you, if you take one of those, you know that it's made by Italians.

Speaker 4:          01:27:54       Right? You know, like, like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the accident with the car. It makes sense. It's so flamboyant. Look at the wheels on that thing. What the fuck is with those wheels? Wow. That's crazy. And Italian spaceship. Yeah. Yeah. Cars are getting closer and closer to spaceships. Yeah. What do people start flying around? You comfortable with that? I'm not want anybody to landing on my house. Landing on the house. Air Accidents. Yeah, man, those don't seem too good. No. In the regulation of what lane do you stay, because we worked so hard to develop these roads. It's like, well where are we going now? Like what's going on here? You imagine if we had like a floating bubble highway system, right? Like there's balloons held on by row by rope that go all the way to the ground and that marks the past where you're allowed to fly your flying car through.

Speaker 4:          01:28:50       But people don't look and they slamming each other and no man, you're out there in the park with your kids regulation with suck on that. Yeah, man. Sure. How do you stop people from, they would have to be autonomous. Who would have to be like Tesla auto drive, so just takes you up and it just brings you around. We'd have to be something like that. That makes sense. Yeah. You, we couldn't leave it up to people not with flying. Hell No. It's to me different personalities. Yeah. But then there's going to be lazy people that don't charge their fucking flying car and then it gets up there and it's like that did that, did that, that, that like you didn't charge it. You shouldn't be able to take off if it's not at a certain, if it's, if it's, if it's capable of dying. I agree. Grounded then when you're gonna need more regulation, so we have more government [inaudible] air laws have to, that's the only way we need more government. More regulations. Air Cops, Eric. Oh my gosh. They're police. Listen to talk about those gaps. Please. Still be even on more on edge. They ground in the ground police. Yeah. Yeah. Cause they're in the air. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're probably going to be super paranoid up there for sure. For sure.

Speaker 4:          01:30:02       Well, if we ever do eventually get to space travel, if human beings ever do figure out how to like go to other planets and set up a civilization on Mars or something like that, that's probably what the real next level future of humanity's going to be other than artificial life. If we can really figure out how to set up a base somewhere. Do you think you would ever go if there was a base on Mars, it takes six months to go to Mars. If there was a threat on earth, a threat. Yeah. It was like Yo earth is not to be fucked up like an asteroid. Yeah, I would. You know, I would if Mars was all right, I would try to go, I will take my family and go, yeah, totally. Wow. To save my family. That makes sense. To save your family. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:48       What if, yeah. What if Mars was awesome? What if they figured it out? If it was awesome. Yeah. I'd rather just die on hers. Yeah, I'm cool here. I'm good. Yeah. I just wonder once they actually do start going from Earth to other planets, how many people are going to be willing to do that? All the rich folks you think so? I think rich folks want to go into orbit. I don't think they want to go to Mars. I don't think there's a whole lot of live there. Maybe if you can come back. Let's say we're far in the future vacation. Yeah. Take a little vacation to Mars. It takes six months to get there. Everybody think if it takes six months to get there, hold on. That's another one's a long I think. I think a lot of people would do that. I think a lot of people would do it.

Speaker 4:          01:31:30       I think you're right. If they knew they could come back because then they'd be able to brag about it. People would love to brag about going to Mars just like that time travel thing where like take six earth months to get there, but for you it's like two weeks. Ooh. I don't think it works that way, but yeah, I was wondering how does that have to be like at the speed of light for that to happen? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Now we're getting deep. Interesting. You might be able to go save some time if you go do that months lose some time though. I know that's a fact. Like if you go into space at a particularly high rate of speed and then you figured out how to come back, like your brother, your twin brother would be way older than you. Yeah. Damn. Yeah, that makes sense. I went to see this Brian Cox show. Do you know Brian Cox is

Speaker 1:          01:32:14       astrophysicists? He had a show he did in La and in the back they have this gigantic screen and it's this real high resolution screen and it showed all of the galaxies in the universe. It showed all of them that you know, just all jammed in together with like appropriate space in between them and you look at it and you just go, what w what the fuck is that? Like we're in that thing. We're one.in just trillions of dots of all these other galaxies. Dan, through the known universe. I've never seen anybody show it that way. And one of the things he talked about was that the rate of time is not the same for each person. Even on earth. Like depending on where you go and what you do and what speed you travel at. If you and I were born on the exact same day and we both got to watch and that watch was perfectly calibrated and you put your watch on and I put my watch on and we met when we're 80 if our watches are still working, the time would be different because we've lived through different time and it might be only incremental, a tiny increment like a second or a couple seconds, but enough so that in the whole unit and I was high as fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       So while I'm there watching this thing, the whole thing just blew me away. I was like, this is a crazy way to look at the universe. This is it right there. Yeah. If anybody gets a chance, if you, that's just one galaxy that they're showing that was, it's a one Gaussi colliding with another galaxy. It's fucking spectacular. Whoa. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:51       Do you get into space? Documentaries Mountain? You got to, I just don't believe everything that everybody tells me. So what about shit like that? So I would have to get it from a reliable sports source. You would have to tell me like the good, okay. Space Shit. And he, Neil degrasse Tyson ones. Um, uh, Lawrence Krauss has got some good stuff. He's got good audio books too. Um, that Brian Cox guides as good as it guys. He's a genius. He used to be a musician is actually in like a a pop band thinking the eighties and the eighties. Yeah. Like a popular pop band and uh, he's a legit astrophysicist. He just talks about space. Yeah. He gives these very entertained with this Guy Robin Inns and they have this like stage show and you know, he comes out and talks about things and explains things. But explain when he explained that time thing to me that if we live the same life that our watches would be different. Yeah. That's crazy. I love shit like that. I'm writing his name down. Brian Cox. Cox, not like the dicks. Yeah, I don't, I wouldn't put that name in there. Of course

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       that could be a problem. Ah, yeah. If you get a chance to see that show, man, it's, it's a, it's a good thing to see too, because it's so different than anything else you go to see. Like for me, I'm always at comedy clubs. I'm always, you know, either in the audience or on stage. So to be there at this place in the audience of this weird kind of like show slash science seminar, it's amazing. It's tight. Yeah. That shit seems crazy as fuck to learn and laugh. Yeah. I gotta I gotta get you on some science documentaries. Hell yeah. When you're smoking weed and watching science documentaries, that's helped my music that's in the real thoughts come out. Kids, we realize there's no getting away. If you, if you, you know that paranoid feeling that you get sometimes you get too high. If you have that paranoid feeling combined with a science documentary on space, then you realize, yeah, we're moral. Very insignificant. Exactly. And you seem extra high cause you're high watching space. It's like, Yo, this dude is stolen.

Speaker 3:          01:36:01       How have you gotten high your whole life? I started when I was 16 when you were 16 that started smoking every day. Wow. So right around the time where you were becoming successful as a rapper, it was really like high school because I hated school and I was just so done with it and I was selling pot and my mom found out and she was low key. Just super cool with it. It was like, oh like I smoke, you smoke, we smoke. And you know what I mean? Wow. It actually helped me get through school, like to make it made it tolerable, like, you know what I mean? Sure. I was able to deal with like the shit that I did want to deal with it because I'm an intelligent kid. I just really didn't like school. I didn't like the school that I went to was good.

Speaker 3:          01:36:52       I went to a nice school, but it was just, I grew up in a time where it was like, you know what I'm saying? Was we weird so well, every school for every kid, it's not what you want to do every day. It was just not what you want to do every day. And like you got teachers who say certain things to you and it's like, all right, I understand what I'm really here for. You know what I mean? And I see who I am to you and you let it be known. It's kind of hard to like take those people serious and want to do the work, you know, want to follow their lead man. It's like for me that was the bare minimum was like graduated high school. I was like, I could move on with the rest of my fucking life after that. Yeah, we'd helped me get through high school. I would say that for everybody. I ain't gonna say it for everybody that helped me. I believe you. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Cause there's a lot of shit that's not that fun, but when you're high becomes interesting. A lot of shit. Yeah. Yup. That's why air travel, air travel is always better when you're high, way better. Way Better. You can take the pills, you have edibles, you do whatever you want to come. Like appreciative of the experience. Exactly. Yeah. Yup. Let's be

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       up there flying for real. Yeah. There's something to me about music, listening to music too, and a plane while you're high to say that has like extra impact, like headphones on a plane surrounded by all these people. No one's talking flying through the sky, going 500 miles an hour and 30,000 feet above the rocks and then the music kicks in. Yeah. Yep. Something about old music too far for me. Like, like lately I've been getting into a lot of like really old rock and roll, you know, just, just imagining what it would be like to like to be around those people alone. You know. See Keith Richards and Mick Jagger in the 70s, you know, to see little Richard and to see James Brown live. Hell yeah. James Brown performed a live God. Yup. There was nothing, it's hard for us to imagine there was nothing like that before them. You know, like there's, there's levels of like impact that those early musicians have that it's hard to really historically put into place because there wasn't anybody like them before that nope. No rock and roll stars. No rap stars. Think of how recent that is. Yeah. That's super new. Standup comedy is only about maybe like 70 years old or some shit like that. Maybe. Maybe. Really. Maybe you could say a hundred if you want to get crazy. But rappers like 30, 30 years old, 40 maybe, maybe four. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:27       Aa and it keeps evolving. Keeps a Bob and Jim. Yeah, like music in general. Um, my favorite genre is like pop music. Like I love anything that could be considered pop because it changes with the times, but you have these mega stars, you know what I mean? Who just transcend like, like it's, it's, it's like, so there'd be, they're larger than life, like Michael Jackson, you know what I'm saying? Like he's bigger than just music, you know what I mean? Like, and you, you become a legend, like as time goes on, but like to be a living legend, like living in those times and to be around those people and to really hear their music and experienced them and shit like that. I feel like that shit is crazy and it's like a, it's a gift. Like for the fans, it's a gift to be that person. It's a responsibility as well, but just like to be the one like, like Beyonce, you know what I mean? Like that shit is crazy to me

Speaker 4:          01:40:35       to be the one. Yeah. When Michael Jackson was the one, when there was no one before, there was no real one like him. I mean there was all this and that's about it. There was other ones that were big. They were very popular, very famous. But Michael Jackson Trans, he transcended so hard. I was listening to Wbcn in Boston

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       as a rock and roll station and they were like, I know there's a rock roll station, but this song is so fucking good, we're going to play it anyway. And they played Michael Jackson. Yep. And we were like, wow. They had been performance as a kid. So he worked his whole life to get to be what it will look like 30 or something like that. When he [inaudible] up, there was nobody, there was no roadmap for him. Nah, that shit is amazing. Amazing. And he did, you know, funk music and he went through disco and you know what I mean? It's just like, wow. Yeah. Yeah man. I would've loved to have seen him live before the controversy. Right. You know, just to just experience him as an artist without having anything attached to it. Yeah. What he did or didn't do, I don't know what he did. You know, I have no idea. Doesn't look good, but I would have loved to have seen him without the burden of that filming. It must've been insane. And the only just to, just to see like he was like a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       It needs to be a different word for work, you know, because sometimes it's not work. It's a passion. Projects just, it's way better than work. He's a different, you shouldn't have a different word for a star. Yup. Cause he was like a supernova. He was some rare thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That might happen once every hundred years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. There's legends like Elton John, Rod Stewart, and fucking, there's all kinds of legends. But then there was Michael Jackson, he was above all of them. It was a mania. Yeah. Kids would dress like them. Everybody wanted to wear those thriller jackets. Right. There's an art to it. I feel like every musician has a choice. Like if they want to go there with it. Right. Yeah. I feel like Elton Elton John's and like even like prints and shit like that, they stay true to exactly who they were.

Speaker 1:          01:42:43       Not that Michael Jackson didn't stay true to who he was, but he put himself into, he put himself out there for the world. He did everything. He had cartoons, he had sneakers, he had, he did everything, you know, the Beatles music. Yeah. He bought, yeah. Like, you know what I mean? Fucking dude on the other people's music. But like, yeah. Hell yeah. He was doing hell of Shit. Yeah. I just think, um, there was no roadmap for the poor guy. Right. You know, when you're living in that fantasy world that nobody else can understand. Right. And there's no one before you, and then everywhere you go, people are screaming. He never had a break down. There was no breaks. There's nothing. You can do it. He couldn't do anything. No. Hell Nah. Hell Nah. Nothing normal. Nothing. That's crazy. That was up the, I'm wondering if that, what that would be like until like if Michael Jackson came around today and he didn't exist before, he would for sure be a huge star. But I wonder if it would be as crazy because there's so many more stars now than there were back then because of the Internet, because it's just more venues now for musicians,

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       for basically everyone, for Comedians, for everyone, right. There's more outlets. So because there's more outlets is more famous people. Right. I wonder if he would be as it would if it would be as insane because back when he was that famous, it wasn't like anyone that was parallel, not even close. Yeah, man. What do you do? Listen to old stuff. Yeah, I listened to, I like a,

Speaker 8:          01:44:17       yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:44:18       we, I'll do like nineties R and B now. I like a funk music or like, like Bootsy Collins. All right. I love Jimmy Hendricks. He's one of my favorites. I like, uh, Curtis may feel, uh, Marvin Gaye, uh, freaking and cooling again. Fucking, uh, I listen to everything, but I like a lot of the older soul music, like the spinners, uh, Patti Labelle, you know what I'm saying? But I was raised on everything. My Dad listened to Bob Marley. He listened to a freaking, uh, oh, we used to listen to a lot of sting and the police may, I love staying. He's one of my favorites. Um, just all the jams, you know what I'm saying? Like the classic shit, like if you could put on any song, like for real, for real. And I fuck with it because I listened to a lot of different music and yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       Marvin gay man. Yeah. He's one of my favorite. He was phenomenal. Yeah. Marvin Gaye was really good and it's tragic story. That was crazy. His Dad shot him. It's so crazy. I, I dated a girl once. This girl was so nuts and, uh, I, we were talking about shotgun. No, no, no. We're talking about Marvin Gaye. You know what I'm saying? Like the second so insane that his dad shot him and she said, imagine what a piece of shit he had to be for his dad to shoot him. Yeah. Right. And I was like, what? I go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why would you assume he's the Bz chicken? His Dad fuck shot. If he's a piece of shit bothers his dad, just get away from that shooting him. His Dad's a piece of shit like, but it was amazing. She was like instantly thinking he's a piece of shit. I'm like, I don't get your logic really. Someone with a good dad different because she's someone who grew up with a good, she's still loved her dad. She was close with her dad. Yeah. So I was like, Oh God, I'm, no. My Dad said to me, I'm like that that shot him because he was Marvin Gaye. He's probably upset that his son had become Marvin Gaye. Truth.

Speaker 3:          01:46:25       Imagine being Marvin Gaye too weird. All your songs are like the best music to fuck to. Yeah. Yeah. And he didn't have, there was nothing, there was no slide into the DM now. They had to find them physically, but he seemed like kind of like a faithful guy. Like he seemed like he would find like one chick fuck her right album about it. That would be a good narrative. I think it's hard for those dudes if they're singing about fucking all the time. It's coming

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       their way to tsunami. They usually like just want to fuck one girl like that. Right. Those, those love songs. Yeah, exactly. Like when the music's dark, like easy either. You know what I mean? Like he's fucking mad bitches. He wasn't talking about like, like just one like right. Know what I mean? He wasn't on his Marvin Gay Shit. I remember he said sexual healing. You know what I mean? When you get that feeling he needs sexual healing. Like the shit made him feel better. Yeah. When he was with her. That's a big difference in the Nwa first album. I think difference in the message, sexual healing. There's some shit from like the early gangster rap days you listen to today, you're like, whoa man. Yup. This is, this is crazy stuff. I remember it at the time when it was first coming out and no one knew like no one could understand there was no music like this before and then all the sudden you have ice tea.

Speaker 4:          01:47:41       Yeah. That was before they bought up the freaking parental advisory on there. They made that because like it's like your parents make sure y'all check this out before your kids get it. It was Al Gore's wife who was tipper Gore. It was, she was the one who was in charge. She was like, she was leading the charge. Yeah. Against, I think it was her. Make sure I'm right about that. Is that I'm not mad at that. That may rap music better. You think so? Oh yes. Like made it more dangerous. Oh, he put the, the extreme, the shoot. They were trying like a rated r movie. They were trying to ban some stuff though. They were trying to ban some amusing like uh Oh God, that was Florida. Florida's crazy. Don't fuck around in Florida. Catch you in Florida. They arrest people for anything. You can get arrested for absurdity and boring.

Speaker 4:          01:48:31       I'm straight, I'm good. I'm not going to Florida. Florida was a, that's my goal, but I'm not going crazy in Florida. Broward county. Yeah. Yeah. Just don't get arrested for swearing. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's what they got two live crew for explicit lyrics. Yeah. Fuck. I'm good on all that shit about that. Right? Yeah. Those guys would like to Lenny Bruce of wraps, right? Like Lenny Bruce is the guy when he got arrested a bunch of times for stand up comedy because he wouldn't change his words and his, you know, swearing on stage in front of court. That was two I've crew. And as you going to jail for like for rap? Yeah. That's crazy. That's crazy for saying some for saying something. Somebody doesn't like it so they want to put you in a cage. Wow. Cause they don't like how you're saying wow.

Speaker 4:          01:49:13       They don't like what you're saying. They don't like how you're saying it. Could you arrest someone if they just said that somewhere? What if they're in the comfort of their own house and they said the things that are in that cause that illegal. Could you yell it out the window? Yeah. Could I drive down the road yelling out the window. Right. Should be able to. It should be able to see you man. How the fuck are you to tell people that can't do that. But then Florida, they're like nope, obscenity for rap. Florida is like its own world though. Like, that's why when shit goes down, it's like, all right, and then this Florida. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. It's so its own world that it's being overrun with invasive species. [inaudible] a lady got attacked by a car. A alligator just yesterday. Here. What? That Jamie.

Speaker 4:          01:50:00       I feel like that happens all the time down there all the time. More often than not. More often rather than not necessarily in a good way. Set more often now than before because there's a lot of them. Yeah. I could imagine being engaged or not having nowhere to go scan it into Florida money. Eat some stupid lady like clear. This is dumb and slow, bitch. I've been around for a long ass fucking time. I'm hungry as fuck. Yeah, Florida's fucking crazy. Let's eat and you just look at that lady and like, she's so annoying. Yeah. Maybe no one will even notice. I don't even eat ladies, but I'm going to do it today. They dogs. They love the people's dogs. That's what's fucked up. I get snack [inaudible] now. Yeah. I love dogs though. So I don't know. But if I was at gator, a dog would be a good snack for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:50:46       I was a good meal per four. Prefer dog than the lady. Yeah. People have closed on exact adjuster sneakers and shit, man. Yeah. Yeah. Choose. It tastes good. If you didn't live in California, what state would you live in? Hm. If I did live in Cali. What stayed with, I live in not Georgia, not Florida. Not Pennsylvania. Not New York. Not New York, Huh? Nah. Too crazy. That'd be upstate New York. Ah Man. Maybe upstate. That's going to call it though. Kinda worry about tickets to get. Fuck takes fuck text and then everybody gets Lyme disease out there. Yeah. Damn. I don't, I don't know. I never thought about that with the shit hits the fan. I love California tsunami rolls over or maybe I'll go to Australia every time I'm on the highway nowadays and it's jammed up bumper to bumper. I just say imagine if something happened.

Speaker 4:          01:51:45       This is just Thursday, just irregular Thursday and it's bumper to bumper magic or some shit went. That'd be fucked up. People wouldn't know what to do when it rains out here. People don't know what to do. Panic, they slam into each other. This guy to drive. It's like dog is just rain. It's just water coming out the sky. Oh Jesus Christ. It's a strange place to live. Right. Cause people aren't tested out here by climate. Yeah. Yeah. On the east coast. They're tested by climate. Yeah. Yup. That winter comes, that's snowy. Wind comes you gotta gotta fuck pair guide. You got to winterize your car. Yeah. Got To get snow tires. Yeah. That's for fuckers out here. Don't know about that. They don't know. Hell No. They don't know. 350 tornadoes last week where you just heard about the Midwest, wherever. Tornado alley kind of shit. Yeah. They got fucked up, man. Yeah. That was like Ohio. And where else? Kentucky. I think just handing out tornadoes there. He got hit hard. Yeah man. I mean, I don't know if that's

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       really because of climate change. Those are ramping up, but if they ramp up in an unprecedented levels like that and it becomes impossible to live in Ohio or Kentucky or anywhere where there's tornadoes, you imagine how nuts that is. If we find out that the center of the country is just tornado, like a tornado bowling areas, both fill with tornadoes in Florida, you just dodging hurricanes most of the year. They just get lucky if it doesn't happen where you are. Yeah. You get lucky. Yeah. You're a dick sticking out into the ocean and it's right where all the tornadoes get formed or all the hurricanes get formed there. Right. It's like warmer waters. Right. Here we go. We'll get started right here. Yep. Fuck hurricanes. I've been in a little baby hurricane before and I was living in Boston, which is pretty far away from the ocean in terms of where my house was and it still, it was like wow.

Speaker 3:          01:53:39       And that was a little baby one. It was nothing. By the time it got to us, it was nothing. I lived in Japan for two years and they used to have some crazy fucking earthquakes over there. Oh really? Why you were there? Earthquakes and typhoons. You saw both? Fuck yeah. Hell yeah. Like what was the earthquake? Black bad. You never been in one here and the a baby ones. I've been in like a 5.5 bro. Like I'm talking about whole room, just shaking like it's like a ride at universal. Like, cause you see shit and moving. It's like damn, is this really happening? And this shit happens bro. Like the earthquakes over there and an insane wow. Yup. And they get some crazy rain like one of the typhoons come. That shit gets really violent too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The Japanese or you know, they, they, they hold it down.

Speaker 3:          01:54:28       What were you doing living over there? My parents are military. Um, my mom was in there for a little bit, but then she got out and then my dad was in there. He got out but remarried. So that's how I stayed in the military thing was my stepmom. And uh, I would move, we would live on base, you know what I mean? For like two years or whatever. And then I will move back with my mom. Wow. What was it like living in Japan? I said it was crazy. Like it was fun. I lived there in the late nineties, so it was like when technology was first changing, like music was just now going into mp3s and shit like that. So, um, there was that, um, Pokemon was really popular over there. Uh, it was fun. Like just being a kid, like running around fucking it up in Japan.

Speaker 3:          01:55:14       It was cool, man. It was funny as hell. That's, uh, an interesting little extra level to your brain, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I grew up those two years in a completely different kind of culture. Totally have a different understanding of what's possible. Right. 100%. I think that's so big for kids, man. Show them shit. Yeah. Yeah. Helped out a lot for sure. Um, yeah, it was cool. How's do right? Like as far as your perspective, it's been around. I've only been in Tokyo for a few days, only once where I was like, this is one of the trippiest place I've ever been in my life. So interesting. It was crazy. Live in there. It was wild. Like no TV, like regular TV. They don't got any like American TV stations. So for two years I was just like disconnected. Yeah. Like I didn't have shit. Yeah, it was crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:56:03       So this was before Netflix and everything too, right? And more youtube. Wow. Yeah. That's amazing. And then that was probably really good for you. Not Sucked. I couldn't watch wrestling, but it was really good for your brain. No, no. It takes up. I need that. I need my entertainment man. Fuck that. I needed to be a part of the world. I couldn't buy all the CDS and shit that everybody was listening to. It was, it was whack. Did you learn to speak Japanese? This a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, Yup. Wow. Baby Japanese just to get around and shit. But I forgot it though. You forgot it all. Not all of it will. It'll come back if I like, you know what I mean? You run me through it, but I can't sit here and say no Japanese words. How hard was it to learn? It wasn't difficult. No, Nah, Nah. It's not difficult reading it is difficult. Oh yeah. Because they have symbols or characters, so it's like one character means like three of our words. Um, wow. Yeah. Yup.

Speaker 3:          01:57:04       And then they have like three different styles of writing it too. So it's like we have print and cursive. They don't know three different ones. Oh, that sounds so annoying. Yeah, it's weird with the, on one hand you don't want it to go away because it's an ancient language. But the other hand you're like, can you clean this up? Simplify this shift. Honestly think they got it down pat. You know what I'm saying? They only want us to have fucking know that shit. You know what I'm saying? Like at the end of the day, they're like, we'll learn English if we want to, but if you want to learn Japanese, it's going to be difficult, bro. I want to learn some Asian language because I, I'm fascinated by reading like a Twitter messages from, you know, how much many more characters they had. Yeah. They can write books. 140 characters.

Speaker 3:          01:57:50       It's like how many words is that though? Yeah, no, that's a lot of fucking words. If it's two 82 80 of those Asian where there's Chinese or Japanese, those little symbols that it's a lot of talking man. Yeah. It's hard to put like the ingredients on shit. Oh yeah, I'd imagine. Do they have symbols for numbers or just use the numbers? I forgot what the numbers look like. I think it's symbols. Really? Yeah. I don't imagine that. It's like one, two and three. Oh Wow. Right. Yeah. Take something. Yeah. I never even thought of that. Yeah. You're like, what does what? What is, uh, let's go with Japanese. Does Japanese, does the Japanese language have symbols that red out of your numbers? Like you would write the letter, the letters, t, h, r, e, e for three. Like that. Like you would write three or you'd be the number three. Do they have that in Japanese? Not because Japanese is like each, each knee son, she, oh, uh, there's different, different, whole different words for it. So it was like, one is Ichi. So however the symbol, however you spell that in Japanese, I, I'm starting to cut her. Remember what it looks like now. Do you think if you could move back there right now, you just get right back into the swing of things after awhile? Sure. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:59:13       David Lee Roth moved their van Halen, the lead singer of on, he moved down there and uh, took Kendo lessons. He lived there for like more than a year. I would probably appreciate it more now as an adult. Do you think so? Yeah. Yup. Cause as a kid you kind of just want to run wild and do everything that you see on TV, but he must be annoyed. You were stuck there. It was kind of weird. You know what I mean? I was 13 like wanting to like go crazy. It was fun for a little while. But yeah, you want to go back home and shit. Like, you know what I mean? Of course. But as an adult I feel like I would, I would benefit a lot more from it. There you go. So at this stage of your career, when you're, when you're looking at like what you're putting down w w when you're making albums, when you're putting together your music, like what excites you the most about it?

Speaker 3:          02:00:02       Um, I'm a huge fan of music in general, so I get just inspired off of like production and shit like that. Like the newest producers and shit. Like, cause I like to go out, I like to enjoy myself, I like to have fun. So whatever's popping like at that, that time, whatever the sound is, whether it's west coast inspired or if it's down south inspired, I'm just interested in finding my own way of doing what's new and what, what my fans would love from me because I'm like, as a music person, you want something new every time. You don't want the old shit all the time, you could go by that. So I just love creating and just coming up with what's new, you know what I mean? Like I work with the newest producers. I work with the newest artists I work with, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:00:52       I try to, I try to make my shit sound different every time. I always tell my engineer, I'm like, Yo, let's fuck with this shit sonically. So it don't sound the same as the last album. Like come up with new ad libs or just different shit that just kind of keep it fresh. Still do what people know me for, you know what I mean? But it's like just coming up with new ways of doing that. I get excited. That's awesome to hear. I love it when someone loves what they're doing and it comes out great. Thanks. It's beautiful to see. It really is. And that to me is one of the most inspiring things that I get at any artists. It's like hearing them talk about their process. Right. In a why I always get jazzed up. I love this. It's crazy for me because like there's different ways to to do what what I do.

Speaker 3:          02:01:38       Like, I have so many ways I could sit there and just come up with some shit like brand new or I have like this, the oil commercial with my son wears. Like there's a team of people who like come up with what could be the best for me and I just do that shit and then it just goes crazy. You know what I mean? It's like, see you again is one of my biggest songs. And that song had like eight different people on it. But I wrote two verses that the person who made the original song, I wrote two versus for it that they love more than anybody else's song, I mean anybody else's. So they gave me the whole record and it ended up being my host. I mean my, one of my biggest songs, you know what I mean? Wow. So it's like the process of just like putting yourself in the situation and just being like, all right, cool.

Speaker 3:          02:02:23       Let's work. That's beneficial. As, as, as beneficial as being, you know what I mean? A creative just, okay, I'm gonna do what I do. You know what I mean? Sometimes you got to step outside of that and just use your talents. It's like being an actor or, you know what I mean? Like you just fill in that spot that people need you lit. And I'm kind of at that point in my career because I worked so hard and grinded and done so many things that come up with so many, uh, waves and ideas that didn't exist before. Now I could use other people's ideas and just be myself and still and get, you know, really big effect. And everybody is happy. Beautiful. Yep. Dude, you live in the life. Got It nailed. Oh, yeah. Congratulations. Oh yeah. I had a great time talking to you, man. I appreciate you too, Bro. Very nice. Thank you, sir. Thank you all. Yeah. Um, that's it. Everybody. Bye. Yup.

Speaker 9:          02:03:17       Awesome.

Speaker 10:         02:03:18       [inaudible].
