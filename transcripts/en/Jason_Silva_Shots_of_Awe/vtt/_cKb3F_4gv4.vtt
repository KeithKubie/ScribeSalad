00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.910
SPEAKER 1: So I'd like to talk
about the topic of curation,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.280
which has become a huge topic
these days as we try to manage

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.565
the overwhelming
information flows competing

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:21.315
for our attention.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:24.710
We're all suffering from intense
information and bandwidth

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.210
anxiety.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.480
We're like a 56K modem trying
to download 10,000 hours of HD

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.970
video through that pipeline.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.840
We simply lack the
biological hardware

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.140
to actually take in all of the
information that's competing

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.600
for our attention today.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400
So curation has
become the buzzword.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.570
The information diet of every
single person is now the craze.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.290
How are you going to curate
your information diet?

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.160
Are you going to just
create a filter bubble?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.850
Because that's not curation.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.270
Curation cannot just be
filtering out when you

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.310
don't want.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.970
Curation needs to
be about creating

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.350
the conditions in which
you can discover what

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.742
you didn't know you wanted.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:04.200
When you can discover what you
didn't know would be useful.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.700
Curation should be
all about serendipity,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.942
which is look for something,
find something else,

00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.400
and realize that
what you found was

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.150
more conducive to your
needs than what you

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.440
thought you were looking for.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.590
So the question today becomes,
can we design algorithms,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.710
can we design apps
that can leverage

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.470
contextual computing, big
data, finding patterns,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.910
create random patterns,
so on and so forth,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.690
to engineer
technologically-mediated

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.880
information serendipity?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.240
Because that would
really upgrade

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.890
the valuable,
meaningful, data sets

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.310
that we're able to absorb
from those information fields.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.060
So that's how I feel about
the pivotal role of curation

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.670
nowadays.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.650
And we need to figure it out.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.700
