00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:08.640
BRITTANY WILBERT: Rosie is based
on Rosie the Riveter, the very

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.740
famous icon during
World War II era

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.910
to get women involved in a
lot of the mechanical work.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
We used foam for the head as
well as some of the parts.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.580
So even though it was
relatively basic, it was still,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.470
you know, an achievement
because we worked overnight.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.725
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.140
SPRIHA BARUAH: We started off
with a remote control car,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.430
and then we used the
chassis of the car

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.485
to experiment with the
robot on top of that.

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:36.985
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
They split Rosie

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:38.380
into two electrical circuits.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.970
The bottom portion was meant
for the movement of the robot

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.010
controlled by a mobile app.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.470
And the top portion
was meant to capture

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.830
their facial expressions
and, as her response,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.709
offer to shake their hand.

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:54.250
SPRIHA BARUAH: The
app that was meant

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.527
to control the car base
wasn't actually working.

00:00:56.527 --> 00:00:58.110
And we spent a lot
of time on the app,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.560
like looking at
all the settings.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.059
But it turns out
that we just hadn't

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.340
connected the Wi-Fi
antenna to the hardware.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.006
BRITTANY WILBERT: It
was just, you know,

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.240
really cool to not have to
worry so much about having

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.380
to create a whole new library
and whole new set of tools,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.550
and instead use what was
already available to get started

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.390
a lot quicker.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.764
When I heard that
they were going

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:21.760
to have a third party developer
finish sort of the design work

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.435
that I was working on, and
then to see it in person

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:27.580
and see that it was literally
the same height as me,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.620
maybe a little bit
taller with the wheels,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.429
I was beyond ecstatic about it.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.220
It was really cool.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.440

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.340
STEPHEN HAWES: When we first
got the project for Rosie,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.390
there was a prototype.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.157
And our job was
to make it bigger,

00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:42.990
make it so she could
take pictures with you,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.800
drive around an event, and
make her have a large presence

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
in a conference setting.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.320
There are some really big
motors down in that base.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.300
They're actually from
an electric wheelchair.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.479
We have two car batteries
wired together in series

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.770
to make sure she has enough
voltage and enough amperage

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.090
to be able to get around.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.850
The board inside Rosie
is capable of all kinds

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.650
of different ML functions.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.410
It's connecting with
Google API, so by adding

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.090
some external sensors
to her, we were

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.070
able to increase her
functionality and interact

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.840
with people at a
much higher level.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.215
MELISSA DANIELS:
You can actually

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:14.300
do on-device processing and use
all the Google services that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.950
are actually available, and
pick and choose the APIs

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.472
that you really wanted to use.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.430
DENIA DEL CID: The biggest
thing that I learned

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.220
was to use the platform itself.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.690
Now it has inspired me
to start new projects,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.737
and it's become so
easy to work on them.

00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:28.320
BRITTANY WILBERT:
With Android Things,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.850
it's really cool because
it allows you to, you know,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.010
just jump in.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.950
The Android Things team has a
lot of support on their website

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.770
and has a lot of tooling
that's readily available

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.170
so you don't have to
just start from scratch.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.150
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Try
out a few code labs.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.510
Once you try a code lab or two,
you will get the hang of it.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.272
And then you can build
your dream project.

00:02:47.272 --> 00:02:48.480
SPRIHA BARUAH: Give it a try.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.960
Go download Android Studio.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.840
Get a Raspberry Pi.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.410
Get one of our development kits.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.310
And just get started.
