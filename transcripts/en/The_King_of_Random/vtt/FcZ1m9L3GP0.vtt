00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.370
Grilling is a summertime favorite but no one wants to be the guy that can’t get the grill

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.800
started. One of the simplest "mikehacks" you
can use is to light off a handful of potato

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.099
chips. Not only are they delicious, they can
be surprisingly flammable as well. But in

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.850
this project, you get to keep your snacks
intact, because we're hacking a new breed

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
of party roasters, and it all starts, with
your empty drink cans.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.320
We’re all familiar with the term “lifehacks” but this summer, the guys at mike’s hard lemonade asked me

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.390
to help put a refreshing twist on it with
what they’re calling “mikehacks"

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.960
noun: mikehack; plural noun: mikehacks; noun:
mike hack; plural noun: mike hacks

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.399
1. basically a lifehack that makes any social
occasion, more awesome.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.620
Now, I just got a tube of chips to start the
coals on my grill. That's pretty awesome,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.430
but they're expensive, and don't burn for
very long. So in this project, let's make

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.910
something that's guaranteed to get our fires blazing every time. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.739
These miniature fire starters are simple to
light, amazingly wind resistant, and pack

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.250
enough power to get a full sized campfire
blazing, without using any extra tinder. They

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.299
also double as a miniature fire pit, just
incase you get the random urge to roast some

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.920
munchies. To get started, we're gonna need some empty

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.470
aluminum cans, and some corrugated cardboard packaging. Now let's use a pair of scissors to carefully

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.880
cut the bottom inch off the can, keeping the
cut as clean as possible. We'll need to do

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.439
the same thing with a second can, but let's
make this one a few inches taller. Now check

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.930
this out, if we fill the larger can with something
like crayons or old candles, then heat it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.170
up for a few minutes, we should be able to
get the wax to start melting.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.800
That's probably going to take a few minutes,
so in the mean time, let's try cutting our

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.450
cardboard casing into smaller strips. The
strips need to be about an inch high to match

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.439
the height of the can we cut, and the goal
here is to roll the pieces so tightly, that

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.869
they just barely fit inside the can. While
we're here, let's fold another piece of scrap

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.409
cardboard in half, cutting a slit down the
middle, so that when it's pushed into the

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.509
center of the roll the cut pieces fold out
to the sides like little flower petals.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.500
Alright, it's time to check on the candles, and
you can see they're completely melted now,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.159
and the can is really hot, so let's use something
like a pair of pliers to grip it, and to carefully

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.090
pour the hot wax over the cardboard. The cardboard
should soak up the wax, and when the container

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.750
is full, let's just set it to the side for
a few minutes, to cool and harden.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.700
Now, you can see here that different sized
cans will make a nice variety of different

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.440
sized burners, and if you try removing the
casing after they've hardened, you'll be left

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.300
with an amazing mini fire log, that's completely
consumable and won't leave any metal behind

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.690
in the fire pit. Now I choose to leave the
casings on, because it keeps the wax from

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.650
dripping out as it heats up, and as a result,
these little guys will burn at high intensity

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.250
for over an hour. That's more than enough,
to get your camp fires, or stack of coals

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.069
roaring. Now these aren't limited to lighting
coals and logs. I found they can make a nice

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.720
tabletop centerpiece for backyard parties
as well. I placed a few rocks around the can

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.989
for effect, and got an instant micro campfire.
Now that's probably the coolest thing I've

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.790
tried all day.
Well now you know how to convert some of your

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.470
leftover party trash, into an amazingly versatile
micro fire pit, which will help set the mood

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.580
for your romantic evenings, and ensure you
get the blazing fire you need, every time.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.840
The best part is, they're lightweight, dirt
cheap to make, and surprisingly wind resistant

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.800
as well.
Well that's it for now. If you liked this

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.840
