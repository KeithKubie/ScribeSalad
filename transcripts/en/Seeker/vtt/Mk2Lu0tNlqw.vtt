00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.830
As my old buddy Anthony used to say, "Birds
are weird."

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.770
There's nothing worse than sitting in your
house and hearing the smack of a bird hitting

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.770
the window.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.630
Last time it happened to me there was a moment
of fear, then a realization of what really

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.570
happened, then sadness and pity for the poor
little robin…

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.940
There's a lot of feels here.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.300
Now that I've recovered though, I'm angry.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
What's up bird?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.590
Can't you figure this out?

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.780
Real talk: Nah. they can't,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.050
Each year, as many as 340 million birds smash
into cars, and over 10,000 hit airplanes in

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.050
2013.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.239
Building windows claim another 100 million,
every YEAR!

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.920
There's two things afoot here, Cornell's Laboratory
of Ornithology says scientists believe birds

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.120
hit windows because they think it's a hole
in the building.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.600
Birds, like many animals, can't understand
reflections, so when they see trees and sky

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580
reflected in a window on a house, they believe
it to be a tunnel through which they can see

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.590
the sky on the OTHER side.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.140
Birds, especially those attempting to escape
from predators, will fly into the glass attempting

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.500
to get to safety.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.600
In fact, most animals can't recognize themselves
in a mirror.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.380
The only known species to be able to do so
are humans, some great apes, and perhaps dolphins,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.289
elephants and magpies -- it's no coincidence
that these are also some of the most intelligent

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.409
species around.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.130
When an animal like cat sees a reflection
they don't smell another animal, so they know

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.000
something's up, but reflections in general
are pretty confounding for most creatures.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.770
Cars and airplanes are a whole other problem,
I did a video about bird strikes a while back,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.770
so check that out.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.789
But the problem is more than just the wrong
place at the wrong time… birds fly fast,

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.390
but they're pretty slow in the head.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.549
Based on a comprehensive analysis published
last

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.899
year in the Journal of Wildlife Management,
it appears that the speed of our transportation

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.570
network is what claims the lives of millions
of birds every year.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.270
A study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society
B found animal-vehicle collisions occur as

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.530
vehicle speeds increase because of the way
birds look for predators and other threats.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.160
Note that they only used the brown-headed
cowbird, but they found as the bird flew toward

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.130
a video of an oncoming car, it initiated escape
behavior at a specific distance from the threat.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.100
They figured bird brains are calculating the
distance to the threat, not TIME before they

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.860
impact the threat -- thus, when the car speed
increased, they couldn't get out of the way!

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.141
When speeds were low, less than 40 miles per
hour (64kph), birds were mostly fine, but

00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:32.280
once they exceed 74 (120kph) they were pretty
much screwed.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.950
Thinking about it this way, it's incredible
that any bird can dodge an airplane accelerating

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.190
to 160-plus (250kph+) during takeoff, like
a 747 has to.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.420
As I mentioned, most birds aren't able to
recognize window reflections.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.970
In the spring, male birds often swoop in to
attack windows because they believe the bird

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.050
they see in the reflection is encroaching
on their breeding grounds.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.500
Penn State says this is most commonly seen
in mockingbirds, robins, and cardinals; and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.860
it will stop when they find 
a mate…

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:14.730
If you're annoyed, maybe you should be the
birds…

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.370
WINGMAN?
