00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.072
Let's try another
surface integral.

00:00:02.072 --> 00:00:04.030
And the surface that
we're going to care about,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.070
s, is this shape, the outside
of this shape right over here.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.940
And you can see we can
kind of decompose it

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.010
into three separate surfaces.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.760
The first surface is its
base, which is really

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.080
the filled-in unit
circle down here.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.946
The second surface,
which we have in blue,

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:21.820
is you can kind of view
it as the side of it.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.480
You can view it as kind of
like the side of a cylinder,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.550
but the cylinder has been
cut by a plane up here.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.970
And the plane that cuts
it is the plane z is equal

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.350
to 1 minus x.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.820
And obviously, the plane itself
goes well beyond this shape.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.290
But where that plane
cuts the cylinder kind of

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.010
defines this shape.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.250
So the blue surface is above
the boundary of the unit circle

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.870
and below the plane.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.670
And then the third
surface is the subset

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.900
of the plane, of that
purple plane, of z

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.200
equals 1 minus x, that
overlaps, that kind of forms

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.440
the top of this cylinder.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.670
And so we can rewrite
this surface integral

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.250
as the sum of three
surface integrals.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.920
It's the surface
integral of z over s1

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.120
plus the surface
integral of z over s2

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.350
plus the surface
integral of z over s3.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.470
And we can just tackle each
of these independently.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.270
So let's start with surface 1.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.080
And you might immediately want
to start parameterizing things

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.690
and all the rest, but there's
actually a very fast way

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.370
to handle this surface integral,
especially because we're

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.000
taking the surface
integral of z.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.130
What value does z take on
throughout this surface,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.220
throughout this filled-in
unit circle right over here?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.380
Well, that surface
is on the xy plane.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.800
When we're on the xy
plane, z is equal to 0.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.280
So for this entire surface,
z is going to be equal to 0.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.799
You're essentially
integrating 0.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.600
0 times dS is just
going to be 0.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.800
So this whole thing is
going to evaluate to 0.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.000
So that's about as simple as
evaluating a surface integral

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.610
can get.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.693
But it's always important
to least keep a look out

00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:22.590
for things like that.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.400
And it'll keep you from kind
of going down this wild goose

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.700
chase-- that wouldn't
be a wild goose chase.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.550
You would eventually
get the answer anyway.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.280
But you don't have
to waste so much time

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.634
in parameterizing
things and all the rest.

00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:34.300
Now let's tackle the
other two surfaces,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.030
and we'll focus on surface 2.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.110
So the x and y-values,
the valid x and y-values,

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.630
are the x and y-values along
the unit circle right over here.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.610
So we can really
parameterize it the way

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.330
that we would parameterize
a traditional unit circle.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.660
So we could set x is
equal to-- let's set it--

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.380
and our radius is 1,
so x is equal to cosine

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.510
of-- I'll use the parameter u.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.330
x is equal to cosine of u.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.410
And then let's say y
is equal to sine of u.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.240
And then u is the angle
between the positive x-axis

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.810
and wherever we are essentially
on that unit circle.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.570
So that right over there, that
angle right over there is u.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.070
And so this would
give us for u--

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.290
so as long as u is
between 0 and 2 pi,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.880
that we're essentially going
around this unit circle.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.320
So those are all the
possible x and y-values

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.940
that we can take on.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.920
And then the z-value is what
takes us up above that boundary

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.250
and gets it someplace
along the surface.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.300
But this is interesting,
because the z-value,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.590
it can take on obviously a
bunch of different values,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.270
but it always has to be below
this plane right over here.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.560
So for this z-value, I'm going
to introduce a new parameter.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.280
Let's call it z v. That's
the second parameter.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.530
And v is definitely going
to be greater than 0.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.660
z and v, they're the same thing.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.640
They're always going
to be positive,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.110
so they're definitely going to
be greater than or equal to 0.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.550
But it's not less than or
equal to some constant thing.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.884
This has kind of a
variable roof on it.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:13.550
And so it's always
going to be less than

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.959
or equal to this
plane right over here.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.020
And so we could say is less
than or equal to 1 minus x.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.140
We could have said-- so we
know that z is less than

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.270
or equal to 1 minus x, but if we
use the new parameters, v is z,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.746
and 1 minus x is the same
thing as 1 minus cosine u.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.560
And so now we have
our parameterization.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.470
We are ready to actually
evaluate the surface integral.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.320
And to do that, first
let's do the cross product.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.250
We want to figure
out what dS is,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.530
and we have to take the
magnitude of the cross product

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.113
of the partial of
our parameterization

00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:55.490
with respect to u, crossed
with the partial with respect

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.900
to v. Actually, let me just
write all this stuff down

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.800
instead of trying
to do shortcuts.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.150
So dS, and this is all--
let me do it in blue still

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.900
because we're talking
about surface 2.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.530
dS is going to be equal to the
magnitude of the cross product

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.770
of the partial of our
parameterization with respect

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.590
to u, crossed with our partial
of our parameterization

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.517
with respect to v, du dv.

00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:25.600
So let's write the partial
of our parameterization

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.420
with respect to u.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.890
And you might say, wait,
where's our parameterization?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.890
Well, it's right over here.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.080
I just didn't write it in
the traditional ijk form,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.750
but I can.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.310
I could write r is
equal to-- maybe

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.735
I call it r2 because we're
talking about surface 2.

00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:40.110
I shouldn't use
that orange color

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.526
because I used
that for surface 1.

00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:43.360
I'll use that in a
still bluish color.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.660
So r for surface 2
is equal to cosine

00:05:49.660 --> 00:06:00.240
of ui plus the
sine of uj plus vk.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.680
And this is the range that the
u's and the v's can take on.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.095
If I want to take the partial
of r with respect to u,

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:09.120
I would get-- let's
see, the derivative

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.750
of cosine u with respect
to u is negative sine ui.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.600
The derivative of sine of u with
respect to u is plus cosine uj.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.660
And the derivative of v
with respect to u is just 0.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.740
So that's our partial
with respect to u.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.090
Our partial-- let' me do
this in a different color

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.480
just for the sake of it.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.210
Our partial with respect
to v is equal to-- well,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.240
this is going to be 0,
this is going to be 0,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.870
and we're just
going to have one k.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.090
So it's just going
to be equal to k.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.960
And so now we're ready
to at least evaluate

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.740
this cross product.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.270
So we'll evaluate
the cross product,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.050
and then we'll take
the magnitude of that,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.790
so just this part, so
just the cross product,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.810
the inside of that, before
we take the magnitude.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.740
So copy and paste.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:05.940
So just that is going to be
equal to the determinant, the 3

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.770
by 3 determinant.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.290
Let me write my
components, i, j, k.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.190
And then for r sub
u, we have this.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.450
Our i component is
negative sine of u.

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:23.510
Our j component is cosine of u.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.540
And it has no k component,
so we'll put a 0 right there.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.810
And then r sub v, no i
component, no j component,

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.630
and it has 1 for
its k coefficient.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.100
And so we can just
evaluate this.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.790
And so first, we think
about the i component.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.830
Well, we ignore that
column, that row.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.630
It's going to be
cosine of u minus 0.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.190
So it's going to
be cosine of ui.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.830
And then we'll have minus
j times-- ignore column,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.810
ignore row-- negative
sine of u times 1 minus 0.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.590
So it's negative j times
negative sine of u.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.670
So it's just going to
be plus sine of uj.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.711
And then for the k, we have
this times 0 minus this times 0.

00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:09.960
So we're just going to have 0.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.740
So this is the cross product.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.900
And if we want to take
the magnitude of this,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.840
if we just take the
magnitude of this--

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.320
so now we're ready to take
the magnitude of this.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.650
It's going to be equal
to-- the magnitude of this

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.220
is going to be equal to
the square root of cosine

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:32.039
of u squared plus
sine of u squared.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.539
There is no k component.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.200
And from the unit circle,
this is the most basic trig

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.700
identity.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.510
This is just going
to be equal to 1.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.150
And so we have this part right
over here just simplifies to 1,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.460
which is nice.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.570
And dS simplifies to du dv
for at least this surface.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.120
And so now we are
ready to attempt

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.732
to evaluate the integral.

00:08:54.732 --> 00:08:56.190
But I'm almost
running out of time,

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.991
so I will do that
in the next video.
