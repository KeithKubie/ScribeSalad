ADAM KOCH: G'day.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.540
My name is Adam Koch,
and this is Reto Meier.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.530
And welcome to This Week in
Android Development on Monday,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.090
January 20, 2014.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
Coming from beautiful
Sydney, Australia.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.630
Over the past few
weeks, we have been

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.540
hard at work making Android
better, faster, and stronger.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.950
And that means another
iOS lesson from Todd.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.110
Is Todd ever going to run
out of his iOS lessons?

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.610
Dan Lavelle covers
his second PlayByte,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.730

app priced just right.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.650
And Dan and Bruno
hosted Game On!

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.570
Talking about the Google
Play Games plug-in

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.220
for the ever popular
Unity game engine.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.180
Magnus released two DevBytes.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.560
The first introducing the
Google Drive Android API,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.450
and the second
covering how to get

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.790
started developing quickly
using this new Drive API.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.440
Neto covered
density-independent pixels

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.380
in his native tongue
of Portuguese.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.240
Shifting to this coming
week, on Tuesday,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.400
Nazmul has a new episode of
UX Design for Developers.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.150
And Todd answers
my early question

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.340
that no, he will not stop the
constant barrage of Play Games

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.490
on iOS lessons.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.770
Neto covers responsive
design, again in Portuguese.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.980
And Tony covers what's new in
Android 4.4 KitKat in Chinese

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.240
and in Cantonese.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.930
And that's all for this
week in Android Development.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.040
My name is Adam Koch,
this is Reto Meier.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.420
Tie me kangaroo down sport,
tie me kangaroo down.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.710
Happy Australia Day.
