00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
results we basically set various limits
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670 align:start position:0%
results we basically set various limits
because<00:01:14.430><c> we</c><00:01:14.670><c> didn't</c><00:01:14.939><c> see</c><00:01:15.090><c> anything</c><00:01:15.380><c> but</c><00:01:16.380><c> for</c>

because we didn't see anything but for

because we didn't see anything but for

gravitational waves it's a
 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.859 align:start position:0%

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 align:start position:0%

so our strategy basically was to turn

it was this isn't very sensitive look
our<00:06:58.319><c> wounds</c><00:06:58.829><c> look</c><00:06:59.069><c> at</c><00:06:59.219><c> what</c><00:06:59.369><c> we</c><00:06:59.489><c> did</c><00:06:59.669><c> wrong</c>

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 align:start position:0%
our wounds look at what we did wrong

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
realize is that the sensitivity tells
 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
realize is that the sensitivity tells

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.650 align:start position:0%
you how far out you look in the universe

you how far out you look in the universe
so<00:10:41.100><c> if</c><00:10:41.160><c> we</c><00:10:41.310><c> increase</c><00:10:41.880><c> the</c><00:10:42.120><c> sensitivity</c><00:10:42.480><c> a</c>

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.050 align:start position:0%
so if we increase the sensitivity a
 

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
so if we increase the sensitivity a

that's scanned so an improvement of a

that's scanned so an improvement of a

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:58.590 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:10.830 align:start position:0%
so we decided not to go all the way to

so we decided not to go all the way to

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
feel great is that we're the ones that
 

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.140 align:start position:0%
feel great is that we're the ones that
actually<00:30:16.410><c> have</c><00:30:16.650><c> the</c><00:30:16.890><c> better</c><00:30:17.040><c> location</c><00:30:17.670><c> even</c>

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:18.150 align:start position:0%
actually have the better location even
 

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:22.970 align:start position:0%
actually have the better location even
though<00:30:18.620><c> we're</c><00:30:19.620><c> beginners</c><00:30:20.460><c> at</c><00:30:20.700><c> this</c><00:30:20.850><c> game</c><00:30:21.980><c> so</c>

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
though we're beginners at this game so
 

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.770 align:start position:0%
though we're beginners at this game so
and<00:30:23.280><c> that's</c><00:30:23.430><c> very</c><00:30:23.760><c> important</c><00:30:24.210><c> for</c><00:30:24.270><c> the</c><00:30:24.450><c> future</c>

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
and that's very important for the future
 

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
and that's very important for the future
so<00:30:25.080><c> this</c><00:30:25.260><c> picture</c><00:30:25.590><c> is</c><00:30:26.160><c> what</c><00:30:26.940><c> we</c><00:30:27.330><c> think</c><00:30:27.660><c> is</c><00:30:28.050><c> the</c>

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:28.530 align:start position:0%
so this picture is what we think is the
