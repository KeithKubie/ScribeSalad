NOAM WOLF: So welcome
everyone.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.610
Thank you so much for
joining my session.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.240
My name--

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.680
I see a couple people still
walking in, so we'll wait like

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.290
a few more seconds.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.540
Guy on the phone.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.960
All right.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.260
So my name's Noam Wolf, I'm a
tech lead manager on Google's

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.565
Ad Exchange.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:22.690
I've been at Google for about
seven years now exclusively

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.960
working on ads.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.740
And I'm really excited to tell
you about something my team

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.560
and I've been working on
for the past year.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.050
But first, I'd like to take you
through a quick overview

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.000
and the history of display
advertising.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.680
Before I do that, I want
to get an idea of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.410
who my audience is.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.500
So who here knows what display
advertising is?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440
Just a show of hand.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.460
Oh wow.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.320
Maybe I can skip all
of my slides.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.090
All right, I wasn't
expecting that.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.020
So I'll do this pretty
quickly.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.000
Display advertising is generally
considered anything

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.940
that is of image format for
online advertising.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.350
Now image form could mean rich
media, images, video.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.460
We categorize mobile
in there, as well.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.600
But we exclude search
ads, AKA text ads.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.850
Even though Wikipedia doesn't
make that distinction.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.780
But not everything on
Wikipedia is true.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.640
So leading up to 2008, display
advertising was

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.700
a very manual process.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.080
If anybody here had to do
display advertising before

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.650
2008, you know what
I'm talking about.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300
Advertisers, these are the
people that want to sell

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.910
something or have their brand
out there, would reach out to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.670
these websites, what we call
publishers, and say, hey, I'd

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.710
like to advertise on your space,
on your inventory.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.060
And the publisher
would say, cool.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.360
That will cost you x dollars for
every 1,000 impressions.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.870
An impression is--

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.510
as by show of your hands before,
everybody knows--

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.800
is when I load a website, I see
an ad, we count that as

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.190
one impression.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.960
So the prices were fixed.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.390
And the what and the when of
my ads, like when were they

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.520
going to show, who were they
going to show to, were all

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.770
predetermined.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.220
So it's all done offline.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.280
2008 was--

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.850
well, maybe I'm only
that calls this--

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.460
the year of the exchanges.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.070
Right Media had an exchange.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.980
DoubleClick had an exchange.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.070
And AdECN had an exchange,
and maybe there

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.360
were some small ones.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.630
And these were platforms that
enabled bidded buying of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.070
online advertising.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.820
Now the bidded part is the
interesting part, because this

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.820
is where we went from fixed
pricing to dynamic pricing.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.450
We ran second price auctions.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.550
This is a little different
than Google AdWords

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.140
generalized second price
auction, because you really

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.380
only have one winner because
you're going

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.210
for one ad at a time.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.560
And advertisers would
still have to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.450
preload their campaigns.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.860
They would have to basically
tell us what they want to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.530
show, who they want
to show it to.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.480
So all their targeting was done
through a web UI, still

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.400
the same thing.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.010
They'd actually have to upload
their ad, what we call

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.310
creative, into our system.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.940
And at serving time, we would
decide which ad won based on

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.810
the bid that they associated
with that ad.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.480
So a bid from the advertiser's
side would say, here is the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.560
max amount of money that I'd
like to pay for showing this

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.240
ad on your website.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.780
And the publisher, the website
would say, here is the minimum

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.760
amount of money I'm willing
to receive.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.530
So the exchange orchestrated all
that, basically making it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.750
a platform.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.350
Ad networks, which I'm
guessing some of you

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.410
represent, would aggregate
advertisers.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.390
So they would represent multiple
advertisers and bid

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.380
on their behalf.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.870
Ad exchanges really introduced
more transparency, because of

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.870
the fixed pricing, in
their reporting.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.010
Something that ad networks, at
that time, didn't really do.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.770
So fast-forward to 2010, RTB.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.620
RTB was invented, Real-Time
Bidding.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.550
Real-time bidding
was a way to do

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.300
per-impression decision making.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.890
Now I want you to really think
about that for a second.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.850
For every impression, you're
going to make a decision.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.410
You're going to make a decision
of how much you want

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.000
to pay, if you want to pay,
maybe you don't want this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.800
impression, and you're going to
pass the creative, the ad

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.900
that you want to show to
the customer, to the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.950
user, in real time.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.420
So it's not really a
protocol, right?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.870
But every exchange has a very
similar set of details, of

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.010
attributes, of metadata, that
they pass on the server side

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.250
to your bidders.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.380
These bidders, these are the
pieces of software that are

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.210
very, very nontrivial pieces of
code, need to be scalable,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.810
need to be available, because
of two very, very strict

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.330
constraints in RTB.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.230
These constraints are one,
exchanges typically require

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.500
100 milliseconds for you to
respond to this bid request.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.740
So the page will load, the
tag, we'll call the ad

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.800
exchange, ad exchange will make
a server side call to the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.130
partners, to whoever is eligible
to receive that call,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.930
these are the bidders.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.850
And the bidders are required
to respond within 100

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.540
milliseconds.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.960
Now that's very difficult.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.090
So that's one constraint.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.600
Constraint number
two, is scale.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.320
Right?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.790
Exchanges tend to
be a bit chatty.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.950
And they also throttle
without mercy.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.740
So if you don't respond to at
least 85% of these requests,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.180
then you're going
to be throttled.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.160
And you're going to miss on
the impressions that you

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.810
really want to get.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.970
So scale is a big deal here.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.350
And it's very big scale.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.300
This is the key node in every
other session says Google

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.030
scale, well RTB is probably
the biggest

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.410
QPS in all of Google.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.050
So we're talking about hundreds
of thousands of

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.880
queries per second.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.890
And you have to make a decision
per second for each

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.550
one of these impressions.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.920
Did anybody just blink?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.350
Martin did.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.130
Well, that took him
300 milliseconds.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.950
300 milliseconds to blink.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.930
200 milliseconds to recognize
facial expressions.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.750
So just to give you an idea of
what 100 milliseconds is,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.390
there's some cool facts about
Ferraris and stuff up on the

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.550
slide, but I'm not going to
go into too much detail.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.030
But this gives you an idea
of how much you have

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.930
to do in that time.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.600
So why do I want to do RTB?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.790
Well, display is a $40
billion market.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.130
If it wasn't a $40 billion
market, in the context of

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.640
Google I/O, you probably
wouldn't be in this room.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.680
And display is growing
immensely.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.630
59% of that business is going to
be attributed to RTB, which

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.060
is growing faster than your
static buying, which is

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.030
non-RTB, it's non-real-time,
if you will.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.580
And RTB, in 2012 alone,
accounted

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.100
for almost $2 billion.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.870
So we know what display
advertising is.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.480
I think we reached
that conclusion

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.900
very, very early on.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.440
We know what exchanges are.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.090
We know what bidders
are now and how

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.840
difficult they are to build.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.750
And I think I met a couple of
you who said that they want to

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.210
build bidders, but they're
not sure where to start.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.660
And we know why we want
to build them.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.760
It's a very lucrative market.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.790
So what are my options?

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.750
How can I participate in RTB?

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.410
Well, today you have
two options.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.540
Option one, you build
it yourself.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.470
Hire an engineering team.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.890
You build out a data center.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.550
You figure out optimization
algorithms.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.220
And to scale, you throw
money at the problem.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.480
And this gives you a
lot of flexibility.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.450
You could do whatever
you want.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.760
You could really take advantage
of every single

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.920
attribute in that protocol
I just talked about.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.130
You could do whatever
you want with it

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.460
because it's your bidder.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.240
But you have to scale
very, very quickly.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.080
And scaling in regular data
centers is really, really hard

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.370
and costly.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.450
So two resources.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.860
Engineering and machines.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.010
That's not something that
everybody can just afford.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:29.680
Option number two, you hire
somebody to do it for you.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.200
You go to DSP, a demand
site platform,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.360
that has a data center.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.549
They have an engineering team.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:39.400
They have optimization modules
for you to use.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.880
And you still pay
them to do it.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.169
You probably pay less than
building out a data center.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.840
And they help you scale.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.730
But the downside is you don't
get that flexibility.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.460
You kind of get a black
box solution.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.510
Oh, you optimize for me?

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.360
Great.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.020
Can I change?

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.750
No.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.070
But what about-- no.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.610
Right?

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.080
So I'm really, really excited
to tell you about a third

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.960
option today.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.200
And this is the Open Bidder.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.560
Open Bidder is a fully
customizable toolkit that

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.190
enables bidded buying
on the exchange.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.850
It lets you manage your
real-time virtual machines.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.390
And if any of you attended
Navneet and Martin's talk

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.390
yesterday, you got a little
bit of a demo of how fast

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.070
virtual machines start
up in GCE.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:31.120
So GCE, Google Compute Engine,
which have a pretty dominant

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.360
set of talks at I/O, and I urge
you to see the ones that

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.890
are still left to see.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.640
They really talk about how
GCE is really good.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.080
The reason that we even

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.330
integrate with GCE is because--

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.600
and I pull this out of their
deck on the next slide--

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.830
is that during peak
hours, GCE will

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.330
provide 20% lower latency.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.140
Now I can probably repeat all
the stuff that Navneet said,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.610
but one thing that really,
really caught my attention was

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.300
the per-minute pricing, as
opposed to competitors where

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.710
you have to pay per hour.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.070
Now think about 100,000
impressions requests per

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.370
second, right?

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.870
If you're only responding 10
minutes out of the whole hour,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.950
you still get a lot in, and you
don't have to pay for the

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.460
whole hour.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.710
So GCE really provides a huge
value in this context.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.120
The latency for bidders
is a huge deal, as

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.430
we mentioned before.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.940
And we really want to lower
the bar of entry.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.030
So we want to give you back as
much of that 100 milliseconds

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.060
as we possibly can.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.770
So instead of spending 40 to,
worst case, 80 milliseconds

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.190
just in network traffic, we
want to minimize that.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.000
Ideally, sub five milliseconds,
but I can't

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.250
quote numbers just now.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.080
We want you to focus
on cool innovation.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.330
We want you to innovate
in RTB.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.600
Something that I didn't prepare
for in these slides

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.140
and I'm really happy to share
with you is somebody walked up

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.630
to us at the booth today, and
he said, why doesn't Google

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.270
sue all the ad blockers?

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.330
I was like, all right, let's
see what this guy wants.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.490
I said, well, ad blockers,
it's a business.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.080
People don't want to see ads.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.660
Our responsibility as
advertisers is to show the

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.540
right ad to the right user
at the right time.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.090
However, we're kind
of restricted with

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.060
the players out there.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.740
We either use a solution that
exists, or we build something

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.090
from scratch, and we
spend a lot of time

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.840
and money doing it.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.480
So I really believe that this
toolkit, one of you guys, my

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.970
fellow colleague developers,
could go out and build

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:47.010
something that will be better
or fairer than ad blockers.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.960
Because this guy's thing was,
well it's not fair.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.300
It's theft.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.700
You're stealing the money from
the publisher because they're

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.170
not showing ads, so they're
not getting paid.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.570
And I said, that's
a good point.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.820
So you're a publisher?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.506
He's like, no, I write
ad blockers.

00:12:03.506 --> 00:12:07.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.910
NOAM WOLF: That was really
not prepared.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.900
That really happened today.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.970
Anyway, I'd like to walk you
through the life of a bid

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.682
request real quick, in the
context of Open Bidder.

00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:21.580
The red outline is Google
Compute Engine, where our

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.980
virtual machines run Open
Bidder's servers.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.390
We'll use the DoubleClick Ad
Exchange by Google as an

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.090
example of an exchange, sending
an exchange-specific

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.820
bid request into Open Bidder.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.370
Open Bidder receives this
request and translates it into

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.920
a normalized protobuffer
internal to Open Bidder.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.770
This is pretty nice.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.540
It lets you be flexible to
support other exchanges.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.420
We don't want to be only tied
to DoubleClick exchange.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:54.600
This will be an open
source tool kit.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.030
And you get to run through
the stack of what we call

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.290
interceptors, and I'll talk
in detail about those

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.050
interceptors in a few
seconds, where you

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.080
run your custom logic.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.070
So remember before, I said, we
want you to focus on your

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.730
custom logic.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.840
This is the piece
that you write.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.990
This is your secret sauce.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.320
So you run through the
stack with the Open

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.780
Bidder specific proto.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.170
And then you run back up the
pipe with a response.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.630
We have a lifecycle.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.030
You could do pre-processing,
you can do post-processing,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.620
and I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.660
And the bid is then sent back
to the exchange, all within

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.310
100 milliseconds.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.840
So let's go out, let's
take a step back

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.000
and look at the ecosystem.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.230
So the ecosystem's been plugged
for GCE in every

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.210
single session.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.370
And we're actually using
all these things.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.270
And I thought it would be cool
to put everything together to

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.840
kind of a real business
on GCE.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.260
So cloud storage, you get your
persistent disc, you get it

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.360
stickied to your sessions,
to your virtual machines.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.080
We use that in the core of
Open Bidder to store

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.640
metadata, et cetera.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.550
I think the sample app that Joe
wrote, if you were at the

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.320
GCE tech session, they
actually passed

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.360
the go code as metadata.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.740
Which I thought was pretty
cool and smart.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.820
Google BigQuery will let you
analyze the data in your logs,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.780
basically whatever you want.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.210
But in this case, what
you're interested

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.460
in is in logs, right?

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.490
What did I bid?

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.260
How much did bid?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.450
How much did I end up
paying when I won?

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.700
It's a second price auction.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.530
So what you bid isn't
necessarily what

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.110
you're going to pay.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.080
And we have a Prediction API,
which I personally think is

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.020
really, really cool, especially
from a computer

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.730
science point of view.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.430
You get to train your models.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.040
You can do this with train
requests, and you could do

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.150
that asynchronously.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
It shouldn't affect your
100 milliseconds.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:58.540
But you can also request a
prediction in real time.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.990
There's one more thing that
I left out, which is you.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.040
I think this could be a very
nice community for you guys to

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.190
add value to this space.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.410
If you think you can do better
than Prediction API that

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.740
Google provides, then you
should go out and do it.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.100
And you should use our
APIs to plug-in and

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.530
charge for a service.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.480
You're going to be hosted on
the same network inside

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.940
Google, and everybody's going
to benefit from this.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.690
We talked about locating your
virtual machines within

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.100
Google, this lowers
your latency.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.200
And we talked about scale.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.110
You can start instances
up very, very

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.040
quickly as the demo showed.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.570
And you have all these
value-add services.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.360
So one thing I didn't mention
is App Engine.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.690
Currently, we use App Engine to

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.160
configure our virtual machines.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.620
We have a configuration UI.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.710
You can start and stop your
virtual machines, you can see

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.290
your resources, what
your state is.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.410
We have plans to move that to
a more hosted environment.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.160
But we can keep that around, and
we want to hear from you

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.340
if this is something that's
useful to you.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.580
BigQuery, I want to plug it
again because there's a talk

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.210
right after this that has a
demo for BigQuery about

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.900
crunching terabytes of data.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.790
And you get really cool
visualizations, so if you want

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.560
to stick around after this for
the next session, they'll talk

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.560
about BigQuery.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.030
So we know that all of you kind
of raised your hands when

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.860
I asked if you know what display
advertising was.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.910
Who here is a developer?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.830
All right, sweet.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.400
Who wants to see some code?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.140
All right.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.760
But before that, just a few
features of Open Bidder that

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.090
are really important as
part of the stack.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.320
Obviously, we support bidding
because we're a bidder.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.790
And we support click and
impression callbacks.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.090
Right?

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.650
So you want the impression.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.650
Well, how do you know
that you want it?

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.480
So a lot of these exchanges have
macros that allow you to

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.110
set up callbacks and fill those
macros in with a winning

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.290
bid price, for example.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.170
So then you can use that
to log and do your own

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.970
optimizations.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.880
Cookie matching, I'm sure
everybody knows what that is

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.500
for remarketing.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.079
We also support that
out of the box.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.589
So here's some code.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.130
I promised our interceptor
model, which is heavily based

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.020
on the Java Filter API, so if
you know or have used the Java

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.210
Filter API, none of this should
be earth-shattering.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.680
But at the core of Open
Bidder, we have two

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.780
interfaces.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.829
We have an interceptor
chain, which is

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.810
responsible for the lifecycle.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.650
You have access to the bid
request and the bid response

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.230
and you can chain these
interceptors.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.956
And then you have interceptor
API, not surprising, and it

00:17:33.956 --> 00:17:35.780
has an execute method.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.910
So each one of these
interceptors when implemented,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.090
you can get executed
by the workflow.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.080
And you can, like I said before,
do pre-processing and

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.240
post-processing steps.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.850
So here's a sample
interceptor.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.580
It's my secret sauce
interceptor.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.420
And, not surprising, it extends
a bid interceptor, and

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.630
through the execute method you
get access to the chain.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.980
And notice just at the very
bottom, I call chain.proceed,

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.040
so anything before that is
going down the stack.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.980
So I go interceptor by
interceptor by interceptor

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.860
going down.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.590
Any work that I do after
chain.proceed is on

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.150
the way back up.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.910
And this is really cool for
logging, if you want to have

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.400
access to decisions that other
interceptors made.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.320
So this interceptor basically
grabs the requests, asks for

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.250
the pre-targeted ad units--
these are ad units from

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.250
DoubleClick's ad exchange that
you've set for pre-targeting

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.060
through AdWords UI, or the Ad
Exchange UI, and you build

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.700
these new snippets.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.590
What price you should
charge for them?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.030
Well, that's your
secret sauce.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.280
Highlighted in bold.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.560
Favorite quote of mine, or one
of the favorite quotes that I

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.930
have, from one of our beta
testers, and we've actually

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.980
been beta testing for a while
now, is that they really love

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.910
the flexibility of what we've
provided, and they've seen

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.550
some results that they really
want to move their spend over

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.200
to Open Bidder.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.550
I saw some smiles here.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.720
I don't know if you're the
client, but I won't out you.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.050
So I'd like to wrap up
with a little bit

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:16.900
of a product vision.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.520
Where are we going?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.480
Where do we see ourselves
in a year from now?

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.510
And our product vision really
circles around three main

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.210
categories.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.750
The first category is additional
components.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.790
We have a dedicated team.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.950
They're actually sitting up
front here, and I'll introduce

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.110
them in a second.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:37.270
And we are fully dedicated to
this open source toolkit.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.980
So we keep adding more value, we
keep listening to feedback,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.440
and we keep enhancing
our offering.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.270
We gather feedback, either
through a forum, we're

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.130
probably going to be on Stack
Exchange when we open this up,

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.120
and we look to hear for
feedback, as much feedback as

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.870
you can possibly give us.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.200
The beta testers will attest
to the fact that we're very

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.920
responsive.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.930
More GCE.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.210
So you heard about a new load
balancing service from GCE.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.770
We're kind of at the forefront
of the new GCE stuff.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:15.650
GCE stuff comes out, we test
it for them at our scale.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.800
And so you're immediately
going to get that.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.410
And I think that's a really,
really cool feature.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.680
And then the last, but
absolutely not least.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.290
My personal favorite part of
Open Bidder is the community.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.770
So we will open source this
after we're out of beta.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:34.760
We want to see the community
give back and grow because I

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.470
really believe that Open Bidder
is the platform for RTB

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.520
innovation.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.510
And we can get rid of stuff like
ad blockers with a much

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.020
smarter solution, which I'm sure
many of you are thinking

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.470
about right now or already
know the solution for.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.700
And there's no reason why you
can't you monetize that and

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.280
save the web at the same time.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.870
So I want to leave you with one
very last quote from our

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.430
friends at TwelveFold that saw
this when we pitched it to

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.367
them, it was like 14 months ago,
and they said, you know,

00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:07.900
there's a huge gap
in the bidder

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.040
landscape for custom logic.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.470
Open Bidder, which was actually
a different name back

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.280
then, is a brilliant idea.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.530
Where do I sign up?

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.740
Well, today you can sign up
for our beta process.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.850
Our documentation, as you can
see at the bottom, is open

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.350
source now.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.870
So you can go there right now.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.770
See what we have in store for
you, what we can do, our

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.290
capabilities.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.900
And when you sign up, we can
white-list you for our code.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.100
I also have the QR code
in the corner, that's

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.380
actually not the code.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.260
It's actually rating
the session.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.860
So you can either scan this, I'd
be very happy to hear any

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.220
feedback about this
specific session.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.230
What you want to see
more of, et cetera.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.640
And there's also a QR
code in the back.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.660
And I think that's about it.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.140
I'd like to spend the next maybe
10 minutes to answer

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.400
some questions, if you have.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.950
And I'd like to call
up the team.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.320
So we have William Shields, our
tech lead, [? Jiannan ?]

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.210
[? Wang ?], our UI guru,
and [? Risvaldo ?]

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.620
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.840
I can't pronounce
his last name.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.890
The back end lead.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.140
So come on up, and
let's see if we

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.080
can answer some questions.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.238
Or should I ask if you have
any questions first?

00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:25.166
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:26.416
NOAM WOLF: Thank you.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.790
Perfect, thank you.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.640
Sure.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.890
I think this is being
recorded.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.560
AUDIENCE 1: Hi.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.700
So it is the bidder agnostic to
what kind of inventory it's

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.070
going to bid for?

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.790
So if it's mobile apps, or
mobile web, or display web,

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.790
does it make a distinction?

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.145
Or is it completely
agnostic to that?

00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.540
NOAM WOLF: So the bidder
is a platform.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.030
We're worried about
infrastructure.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.610
The logic of what to bid
for and what you're

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.080
eligible for is on you.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.240
You have access to the proto,
to the request.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.640
So you can basically see if it's
mobile, if it's video and

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.930
whatnot, depending on
those attributes.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.900
AUDIENCE 2: Hey guys, what
cookie space do you support?

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.560
Would we have our own pixels
that we would map to?

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.130
Or could we leverage
DoubleClick?

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.780
WILLIAM SHIELDS: Well, we
support out of the box, the

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.760
DoubleClick cookie matching.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.630
So that probably has the most
value from what you're looking

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:45.690
at, which is to match
DoubleClick cookie space.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.940
AUDIENCE 2: And do you
support OpenRTB?

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.510
WILLIAM SHIELDS: I can neither
confirm nor deny our

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.810
particular status
with open RTB.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.230
We've thought a lot about
the problem of

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.920
cross-exchange buying.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.230
This is still actually a work
in progress, so we've got

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.370
nothing concrete to announce on
this particular regard, but

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.140
it's certainly something we've
been thinking about.

00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:10.456
NOAM WOLF: Any other
questions?

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.570
All right, well thank you very
much for coming out, and we

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.270
look to see you innovating
RTB.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.770
[APPLAUSE]
