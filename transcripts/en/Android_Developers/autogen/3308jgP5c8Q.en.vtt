00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.840
just a square then it should fit in the
woods of 96 96 or something smaller size

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:47.850
woods of 96 96 or something smaller size
 

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.640
woods of 96 96 or something smaller size
ya hota it should be with it I think it

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:49.650
ya hota it should be with it I think it
 

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.490
ya hota it should be with it I think it
should we want a border of like what is

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500
should we want a border of like what is
 

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.230
should we want a border of like what is
it 15 or 20 personas they something like

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240
it 15 or 20 personas they something like
 

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.579
it 15 or 20 personas they something like
that but we at least I look at the

00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:55.589
that but we at least I look at the
 

00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:57.140
that but we at least I look at the
guidelines I haven't yeah I don't have

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.150
guidelines I haven't yeah I don't have
 

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.680
guidelines I haven't yeah I don't have
memorized but but there you know

00:14:59.680 --> 00:14:59.690
memorized but but there you know
 

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.290
memorized but but there you know
the point is that we want we want icons

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:02.300
the point is that we want we want icons
 

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.600
the point is that we want we want icons
to have the freedom to pop out of the

to have the freedom to pop out of the
 

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.410
to have the freedom to pop out of the
border but when you make your border the

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.420
border but when you make your border the
 

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.130
border but when you make your border the
absolute max sighs you lose that and you

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:12.140
absolute max sighs you lose that and you
 

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.360
absolute max sighs you lose that and you
make your game look completely

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:13.370
make your game look completely
 

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.920

the game don't confuse letterboxing here

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240
the game don't confuse letterboxing here
 

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.850
the game don't confuse letterboxing here
on this on the wall white screen at the

very clearly visible on the game itself
 

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.810

which says to me in so many ways this

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:49.820
which says to me in so many ways this
 

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.670

all like it was built for a mobile

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:57.380
all like it was built for a mobile
 

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.310

see it's love it's a little less yeah so

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.090
see it's love it's a little less yeah so
 

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.140
see it's love it's a little less yeah so
um it's honestly this is on the edge

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:08.150
um it's honestly this is on the edge
 

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.780
um it's honestly this is on the edge

particular case the hdmi out on the AC

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:27.530
particular case the hdmi out on the AC
 

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.820
particular case the hdmi out on the AC
transformer prime actually adds some

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:30.830
transformer prime actually adds some
 

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.650
transformer prime actually adds some
pixels at the bottom for some reason so

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:32.660
pixels at the bottom for some reason so
 

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.810
pixels at the bottom for some reason so
it changes the aspect ratio to display a

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:34.820
it changes the aspect ratio to display a
 

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.400
it changes the aspect ratio to display a
little bit now what one thing tonight

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.410
little bit now what one thing tonight
 

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.560
little bit now what one thing tonight
it's actually seven so it's the aspect

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:38.570
it's actually seven so it's the aspect
 

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.210
it's actually seven so it's the aspect
ratio of the transformer prime through

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220
ratio of the transformer prime through
 

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.090
ratio of the transformer prime through
this is actually 720p so this when

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.100
this is actually 720p so this when
 

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.260
this is actually 720p so this when
you're seeing here with a letter boxing

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.270
you're seeing here with a letter boxing
 

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.490
you're seeing here with a letter boxing
on the side is actually what it would

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:45.500
on the side is actually what it would
 

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.530
on the side is actually what it would
look like on any of the droids which all

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:47.540
look like on any of the droids which all
 

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.750
look like on any of the droids which all
have the same aspect ratio cool yeah so

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:49.760
have the same aspect ratio cool yeah so
 

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.700
have the same aspect ratio cool yeah so
this is this is so it actually without

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:51.710
this is this is so it actually without
 

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.920
this is this is so it actually without
the hdmi or its actual little narrower

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:53.930
the hdmi or its actual little narrower
 

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.780
the hdmi or its actual little narrower
it's a little closer to a lot of the

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:55.790
it's a little closer to a lot of the
 

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.100
it's a little closer to a lot of the
standard Android devices so it's

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.110
standard Android devices so it's
 

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.870
standard Android devices so it's
somewhere in between so my feeling is I

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880
somewhere in between so my feeling is I
 

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.550
somewhere in between so my feeling is I
still think this is too much but you

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560
still think this is too much but you
 

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.020
still think this is too much but you
really get to see it through the hdmi

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.030
really get to see it through the hdmi
 

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.480
really get to see it through the hdmi
out which is nice another other note on

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:04.490
out which is nice another other note on
 

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.610
out which is nice another other note on
this title screen is that it's kind of

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:06.620
this title screen is that it's kind of
 

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.640
this title screen is that it's kind of
sad because the logo is actually really

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:09.650
sad because the logo is actually really
 

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.880
sad because the logo is actually really
really poorly anti-aliased against the

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:12.890
really poorly anti-aliased against the
 

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.570
really poorly anti-aliased against the
background it's just

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:13.580
background it's just
 

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.830
background it's just
sort of it feels like they didn't like

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:14.840
sort of it feels like they didn't like
 

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.210
sort of it feels like they didn't like
they chop the logo from something else

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.220
they chop the logo from something else
 

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.550
they chop the logo from something else
and then and then there's all of this

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:18.560
and then and then there's all of this
 

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.100
and then and then there's all of this
kind of leftover anti-aliasing junk on

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.110
kind of leftover anti-aliasing junk on
 

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.150
kind of leftover anti-aliasing junk on
it and then they threw it onto this

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160
it and then they threw it onto this
 

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.380
it and then they threw it onto this
background which makes me really sad

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.390
background which makes me really sad
 

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.210
background which makes me really sad
like honestly it's like when you know

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.220
like honestly it's like when you know
 

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.920
like honestly it's like when you know
it's like they've got to disabuse

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:26.930
it's like they've got to disabuse
 

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.230
it's like they've got to disabuse
artwork and then to kind of throw kind

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240
artwork and then to kind of throw kind
 

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.140
artwork and then to kind of throw kind
of a I don't know a poorly done yeah I

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.150
of a I don't know a poorly done yeah I
 

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.420
of a I don't know a poorly done yeah I
got you know I don't know i'm not sure

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:34.430
got you know I don't know i'm not sure
 

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.460
got you know I don't know i'm not sure
if I agree with you I think that the

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:36.470
if I agree with you I think that the
 

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.500
if I agree with you I think that the
intent may have been to try and put some

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.510
intent may have been to try and put some
 

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.050
intent may have been to try and put some
some highlights around the edges and

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.060
some highlights around the edges and
 

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.350
some highlights around the edges and
give it a little bit of a pop but but if

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360
give it a little bit of a pop but but if
 

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.750
give it a little bit of a pop but but if
that were the intent that's sort of Sun

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760
that were the intent that's sort of Sun
 

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.510
that were the intent that's sort of Sun
sabotage by the fact that it's really

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520
sabotage by the fact that it's really
 

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.880
sabotage by the fact that it's really
really really pixelated yeah I don't

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:51.890
really really pixelated yeah I don't
 

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.800
really really pixelated yeah I don't
think that's the intent I just that but

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:53.810
think that's the intent I just that but
 

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:54.790
think that's the intent I just that but
but maybe you know like it certainly

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:54.800
but maybe you know like it certainly
 

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.490
but maybe you know like it certainly
could be but this game is is an example

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:57.500
could be but this game is is an example
 

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.500
could be but this game is is an example
of trying to do things right kind of but

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200
a really low res but I'd love to see is
 

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.750
a really low res but I'd love to see is
the gameplay feels smooth like it

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760
the gameplay feels smooth like it
 

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.340
the gameplay feels smooth like it
actually feels like it's running in an

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:27.350
actually feels like it's running in an
 

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.200
actually feels like it's running in an
emulator like you know it's like you

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.210
emulator like you know it's like you
 

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.310
emulator like you know it's like you
know it's like I mean if you're gonna

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320
know it's like I mean if you're gonna
 

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.750
know it's like I mean if you're gonna
have low res graphic to the style that's

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760
have low res graphic to the style that's
 

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.280
have low res graphic to the style that's
great but it doesn't actually have to

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:33.290
great but it doesn't actually have to
 

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.010
great but it doesn't actually have to
play like it's running on a machine you

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.020
play like it's running on a machine you
 

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.570
play like it's running on a machine you
know from ten years ago and like you can

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:37.580
know from ten years ago and like you can
 

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.520
know from ten years ago and like you can
watch it's getting about you know ten

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.530
watch it's getting about you know ten
 

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.690
watch it's getting about you know ten
frames a second at most

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:40.700
frames a second at most
 

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.010
frames a second at most
maybe five frames a second is doing a

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.020
maybe five frames a second is doing a
 

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.960
maybe five frames a second is doing a
lot of these transactions and it's just

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:43.970
lot of these transactions and it's just
 

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.430
lot of these transactions and it's just
kind of sad like you know this is this

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440
kind of sad like you know this is this
 

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.780
kind of sad like you know this is this
is you know these these these phones are

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:46.790
is you know these these these phones are
 

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.970
is you know these these these phones are
super powerful things the other thing is

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:48.980
super powerful things the other thing is
 

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.590
super powerful things the other thing is
we're now within this menu and you know

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600
we're now within this menu and you know
 

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.760
we're now within this menu and you know
hitting the back he doesn't do anything

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:51.770
hitting the back he doesn't do anything
 

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.070
hitting the back he doesn't do anything
at all right Dan's trying to just punch

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080
at all right Dan's trying to just punch
 

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.260
at all right Dan's trying to just punch
the back key and it's just it just yeah

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.270
the back key and it's just it just yeah
 

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.000
the back key and it's just it just yeah
so so that's that that's another thing

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.010
so so that's that that's another thing
 

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.170
so so that's that that's another thing
is that like you should never beat a

00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.180
is that like you should never beat a
 

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.640
is that like you should never beat a
point even if you're in the middle of

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:00.650
point even if you're in the middle of
 

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.400
point even if you're in the middle of
some sort of scene Justine like this

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.410
some sort of scene Justine like this
 

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.660
some sort of scene Justine like this
hitting the back you should do something

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:04.670
hitting the back you should do something
 

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.850
hitting the back you should do something
and I think we also you know just want

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:06.860
and I think we also you know just want
 

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.270
and I think we also you know just want
to take a look at I don't know if we

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:10.280
to take a look at I don't know if we
 

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.520
to take a look at I don't know if we
could switch to this and oh yes you show

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:12.530
could switch to this and oh yes you show
 

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.860
could switch to this and oh yes you show
off in my Iain yeah that's a camera to

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:14.870
off in my Iain yeah that's a camera to
 

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:20.140
off in my Iain yeah that's a camera to
raita so yeah we have I we have these

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.150
raita so yeah we have I we have these
 

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.150
raita so yeah we have I we have these
menu buttons down here yeah this is a

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:22.160
menu buttons down here yeah this is a
 

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.750
menu buttons down here yeah this is a
menu button that does nothing now Dan

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760
menu button that does nothing now Dan
 

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.750
menu button that does nothing now Dan
had a really good point I it's perfectly

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760
had a really good point I it's perfectly
 

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.460
had a really good point I it's perfectly
legitimate to actually just dim this

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:30.470
legitimate to actually just dim this
 

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.200
legitimate to actually just dim this
entire system bar that's kind of a cool

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.210
entire system bar that's kind of a cool
 

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.930
entire system bar that's kind of a cool
way to handle things on a tablet but if

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:34.940
way to handle things on a tablet but if
 

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.910
way to handle things on a tablet but if
you're not going to dim it at least make

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:36.920
you're not going to dim it at least make
 

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.220
you're not going to dim it at least make
it so this button goes away and the way

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.230
it so this button goes away and the way
 

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.450
it so this button goes away and the way
that you do that of course is by

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:40.460
that you do that of course is by
 

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.040
that you do that of course is by
specifying napi level of 14 or greater

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.050
specifying napi level of 14 or greater
 

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.800
specifying napi level of 14 or greater
so you know watch that and yeah in the

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:47.810
so you know watch that and yeah in the
 

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.940
so you know watch that and yeah in the
back page we say it doesn't do anything

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:48.950
back page we say it doesn't do anything
 

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.410
back page we say it doesn't do anything
in this mode so you can you can you can

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:50.420
in this mode so you can you can you can
 

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.880
in this mode so you can you can you can
tap it all you want it's kind of that we

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:51.890
tap it all you want it's kind of that we
 

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.560
tap it all you want it's kind of that we
can go back to the tablet itself and

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:53.570
can go back to the tablet itself and
 

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.330
can go back to the tablet itself and
kind of continue looking at it so then

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:55.340
kind of continue looking at it so then
 

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.850
kind of continue looking at it so then
again this is this is very obviously um

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:57.860
again this is this is very obviously um
 

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.270
again this is this is very obviously um
yep pixelated by intense so that's sort

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280
yep pixelated by intense so that's sort
 

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.510
yep pixelated by intense so that's sort
of the style a lots of these texts

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520
of the style a lots of these texts
 

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.220
of the style a lots of these texts
things I mean this is definitely like a

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.230
things I mean this is definitely like a
 

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.570
things I mean this is definitely like a
you know it is a in this case k RPG yeah

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.580
you know it is a in this case k RPG yeah
 

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.160
you know it is a in this case k RPG yeah
it's a you know PSP style game so we

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:15.170
it's a you know PSP style game so we
 

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.210
it's a you know PSP style game so we
know what we're getting into you there

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:16.220
know what we're getting into you there
 

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.780
know what we're getting into you there
but again you know even with this type

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:19.790
but again you know even with this type
 

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.700
but again you know even with this type
of game we're expecting a high frame

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:21.710
of game we're expecting a high frame
 

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.580
of game we're expecting a high frame
rate and we're expecting it to be

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:24.590
rate and we're expecting it to be
 

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.830
rate and we're expecting it to be
controllable so that was actually one of

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840
controllable so that was actually one of
 

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.920
controllable so that was actually one of
the problems I had yeah was that the

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:32.930
the problems I had yeah was that the
 

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.910
the problems I had yeah was that the
controls are a little ring here it now

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:36.920
controls are a little ring here it now
 

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.320
controls are a little ring here it now
remember with this ring I you know

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.330
remember with this ring I you know
 

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.140
remember with this ring I you know
you're certainly um you should be

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.150
you're certainly um you should be
 

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.510
you're certainly um you should be
falling into sort of Au Au I paradigm

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520
falling into sort of Au Au I paradigm
 

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.250
falling into sort of Au Au I paradigm
that's become very popular rehab sort of

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:48.260
that's become very popular rehab sort of
 

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.200
that's become very popular rehab sort of
virtual joystick on the left hand side

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.210
virtual joystick on the left hand side
 

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.330
virtual joystick on the left hand side
here but it actually this is more of a

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:52.340
here but it actually this is more of a
 

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.370
here but it actually this is more of a
d-pad there

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:53.380
d-pad there
 

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.440
d-pad there
there is a right there is a left and

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:55.450
there is a right there is a left and
 

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.640
there is a right there is a left and
there is down and you can't you know you

00:23:59.640 --> 00:23:59.650
there is down and you can't you know you
 

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.100
there is down and you can't you know you
can't promise I'll taneously it's sort

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.110
can't promise I'll taneously it's sort
 

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.610
can't promise I'll taneously it's sort
of difficult to go from one to the other

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620
of difficult to go from one to the other
 

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.040
of difficult to go from one to the other
yeah it's one thing if this the so this

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.050
yeah it's one thing if this the so this
 

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.900
yeah it's one thing if this the so this
is a tablet problem here so it's

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:09.910
is a tablet problem here so it's
 

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.340
is a tablet problem here so it's
designed this thing is designed for

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:11.350
designed this thing is designed for
 

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.090
designed this thing is designed for
something that has a much much lower DPI

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:15.100
something that has a much much lower DPI
 

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.090
something that has a much much lower DPI
then we have here so the control just

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.100
then we have here so the control just
 

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.500
then we have here so the control just
being scaled up the way the rest of the

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:19.510
being scaled up the way the rest of the
 

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.230
being scaled up the way the rest of the
game is and so the d-pad is really hard

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240
game is and so the d-pad is really hard
 

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.940
game is and so the d-pad is really hard
to control you're absolutely right i

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:23.950
to control you're absolutely right i
 

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.190
to control you're absolutely right i
think that's a big part of it but you

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200
think that's a big part of it but you
 

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.950
think that's a big part of it but you
know let me make an argument to that

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960
know let me make an argument to that
 

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.320
know let me make an argument to that
this again is sort of design though that

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:31.330
this again is sort of design though that
 

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.530
this again is sort of design though that
worked okay you know last year but in

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:34.540
worked okay you know last year but in
 

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.860
worked okay you know last year but in
yeah in the last year 18 months or so I

we've really moved in the direction of
much more usable controls and what you

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:42.970
much more usable controls and what you
 

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:48.060
much more usable controls and what you
see in most games now is a UH something

these arrows here and I my first thought
was oh cool arrows and you know there's

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:03.370
was oh cool arrows and you know there's
 

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.070
was oh cool arrows and you know there's
no reason when I tap here that my

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080
no reason when I tap here that my
 

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.690
no reason when I tap here that my
character shouldn't go oh that means

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:06.700
character shouldn't go oh that means
 

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.670
character shouldn't go oh that means

that to that position and jump you know
 

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.270
that to that position and jump you know
I'm tapping above am I'm tapping to the

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:12.280
I'm tapping above am I'm tapping to the
 

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.440

because that's the modern control system

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:16.990
because that's the modern control system

of this kind of game i can just

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:17.890
of this kind of game i can just
 

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:18.990
of this kind of game i can just
literally hold the button here in you

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000

would be very very interesting for for
 

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.810
would be very very interesting for for
this game to be more of a touch game and

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:27.820
this game to be more of a touch game and
 

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.240
this game to be more of a touch game and
less of a joystick game yeah I mean it

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.250
less of a joystick game yeah I mean it
 

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.800
less of a joystick game yeah I mean it
really feels like an emulator like if I

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:31.810
really feels like an emulator like if I
 

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.930
really feels like an emulator like if I
had no yeah I I think you can make an

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:33.940
had no yeah I I think you can make an
 

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.040
had no yeah I I think you can make an
argument either way I mean because

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.050
argument either way I mean because
 

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.050
argument either way I mean because

to be a different game well i do think i
 

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.100
to be a different game well i do think i
spent a ton of time just fighting the

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.110
spent a ton of time just fighting the
 

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.580
spent a ton of time just fighting the

yeah they're not very responsive like
 

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.680
yeah they're not very responsive like
the controls you're supposed to fight

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:52.690

low frame rate I just think that the the

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:47.470
low frame rate I just think that the the
 

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.410
low frame rate I just think that the the
idle animation is only two frames long

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:49.420

everything else I would tilt yeah it
 

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.420
everything else I would tilt yeah it
really feels so non-native with the

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:42.430
really feels so non-native with the
 

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.830
really feels so non-native with the
letter box and everything but at least I

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840
letter box and everything but at least I
 

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.150
letter box and everything but at least I
could forgive it but with the

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.160
could forgive it but with the
 

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.190
could forgive it but with the
combination of the controls that are

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200
combination of the controls that are
 

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.040
combination of the controls that are
kind of difficult to play with it really

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.050
kind of difficult to play with it really
 

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.360
kind of difficult to play with it really
it's harped me to actually look at this

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:51.370
it's harped me to actually look at this
 

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.860
it's harped me to actually look at this
and say this is experience that most

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:52.870
and say this is experience that most
 

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.330
and say this is experience that most
Android users are going to want to play

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:54.340
Android users are going to want to play
 

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.760
Android users are going to want to play
now you know knowing this developer

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:56.770
now you know knowing this developer
 

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.740
now you know knowing this developer
would you yeah I think it's safe to say

00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:58.750
would you yeah I think it's safe to say
 

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.230
would you yeah I think it's safe to say
that the game is rich in full cut a

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240
that the game is rich in full cut a
 

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.600
that the game is rich in full cut a
dilute I known very well for that and I

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:03.610
dilute I known very well for that and I
 

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.200
dilute I known very well for that and I
think that I think this game will

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:06.210
think that I think this game will
 

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.370
think that I think this game will
absolutely find a huge audience

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:08.380
absolutely find a huge audience
 

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.060
absolutely find a huge audience
absolutely yeah but we this is a sort of

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.070
absolutely yeah but we this is a sort of
 

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.160
absolutely yeah but we this is a sort of
thing we would call a cult classic a

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.170
thing we would call a cult classic a
 

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.280
thing we would call a cult classic a
cult favorite yeah for the reason that

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:16.290
cult favorite yeah for the reason that
 

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.630
cult favorite yeah for the reason that
you know when you join a cult they give

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640
you know when you join a cult they give
 

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.260
you know when you join a cult they give
you a copy of it

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.270
you a copy of it
 

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.660
you a copy of it
okay no because it is something that

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:23.670
okay no because it is something that
 

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.250
okay no because it is something that
really really appeals to a very small

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260
really really appeals to a very small
 

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.590
really really appeals to a very small
segment of the market um and it's

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600
segment of the market um and it's
 

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.350
segment of the market um and it's
awesome those are good seeing that yeah

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360
awesome those are good seeing that yeah
 

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.060
awesome those are good seeing that yeah
it's just it's difficult for us to

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:32.070
it's just it's difficult for us to
 

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.310
it's just it's difficult for us to
justify trying to get this featured um

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320
justify trying to get this featured um
 

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.190
justify trying to get this featured um
when we know that there's going to be

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200
when we know that there's going to be
 

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.590
when we know that there's going to be
some people that see that in the store

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600
some people that see that in the store
 

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.650
some people that see that in the store
and think well I you know I don't want

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:45.660
and think well I you know I don't want
 

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.960
and think well I you know I don't want
it by that or man i would actually would

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:47.970
it by that or man i would actually would
 

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.060
it by that or man i would actually would
love to see like a set of titles that

you know there are people right never
taking these k RPGs and and they're

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:18.510
taking these k RPGs and and they're
 

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.660
taking these k RPGs and and they're
actually writing them as if as if as if

they were written for a mobile platform

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:21.900
they were written for a mobile platform
 

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.930
they were written for a mobile platform
and you know and we're seeing higher

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940
and you know and we're seeing higher
 

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.820
and you know and we're seeing higher
resolution artwork we're seeing things

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:25.830
resolution artwork we're seeing things
 

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.050
resolution artwork we're seeing things
that are designed for both plastic

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:27.060
that are designed for both plastic
 

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.510
that are designed for both plastic
ratios this is a tile-based game there's

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520
ratios this is a tile-based game there's
 

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.970
ratios this is a tile-based game there's
no reason why this game has to be

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980
no reason why this game has to be
 

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.740
no reason why this game has to be
limited in aspect ratio what's with a

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:33.750
limited in aspect ratio what's with a
 

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.120
limited in aspect ratio what's with a
little bit of thought in design this

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.130
little bit of thought in design this
 

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.800
little bit of thought in design this
game would work fine on this aspect

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:36.810
game would work fine on this aspect
 

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.600
game would work fine on this aspect
ratio it's literally just taking tiles

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:38.610
ratio it's literally just taking tiles
 

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.700

and I want to see another half hilum you

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:40.710
and I want to see another half hilum you
 

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.160
and I want to see another half hilum you
on either side and I want that to be

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:43.170
on either side and I want that to be
 

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.930
on either side and I want that to be
designed into into the architecture of

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940
designed into into the architecture of
 

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.190
designed into into the architecture of
the game so that's not showing me

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200
the game so that's not showing me
 

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.870
the game so that's not showing me
something I'm not supposed to see you

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880
something I'm not supposed to see you
 

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.550
something I'm not supposed to see you
know but but it's not hard to do if you

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:49.560
know but but it's not hard to do if you
 

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.350
know but but it's not hard to do if you
think about it from the beginning now if

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360
think about it from the beginning now if
 

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.330
think about it from the beginning now if
this game was just ported and my

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340
this game was just ported and my
 

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.830
this game was just ported and my
assumption is it is because i really

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840
assumption is it is because i really
 

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.110
assumption is it is because i really
hope no one took to mobile and worked so

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120
hope no one took to mobile and worked so
 

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.820
hope no one took to mobile and worked so
hard to design a game that look nothing

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:58.830
hard to design a game that look nothing
 

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.310
hard to design a game that look nothing
like a mobile game but but if this game

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320
like a mobile game but but if this game
 

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.530
like a mobile game but but if this game
was imported then obviously I would

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:03.540
was imported then obviously I would
 

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.030
was imported then obviously I would
expect them to have thought of those

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.040
expect them to have thought of those
 

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.890
expect them to have thought of those
things right and lastly you know I just

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:06.900
things right and lastly you know I just
 

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.420
things right and lastly you know I just
wanted I want to say this again because

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:08.430
wanted I want to say this again because
 

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.370
wanted I want to say this again because
so many games have this problem if we

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380
so many games have this problem if we
 

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.860
so many games have this problem if we
could switched it the camera there I

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:12.870
could switched it the camera there I
 

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.810
could switched it the camera there I
just want you to see you know and

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820
just want you to see you know and

take to hit this these buttons the

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.050
take to hit this these buttons the
 

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.770
take to hit this these buttons the
directional controls and when I come

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:30.780
directional controls and when I come
 

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.710
directional controls and when I come
over here I mean this these it hurts

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720
over here I mean this these it hurts
 

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.570
over here I mean this these it hurts
to hit the jump button it should work to

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580
to hit the jump button it should work to
 

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.620
to hit the jump button it should work to
hit the jump button that makes no sense

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:36.630
hit the jump button that makes no sense
 

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.810
hit the jump button that makes no sense
yeah I'm going to be hitting that all

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820
yeah I'm going to be hitting that all
 

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.610
yeah I'm going to be hitting that all

game gives me lots of programmability
but doesn't give me reasonable default

yeah that one thing that we've learned

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.230
yeah that one thing that we've learned
 

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.350
yeah that one thing that we've learned
in software design over the past 10 to

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360
in software design over the past 10 to
 

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.120
in software design over the past 10 to
20 years is you can give people all

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:05.130
20 years is you can give people all
 

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.860
20 years is you can give people all
sorts of customizability but what they

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:06.870
sorts of customizability but what they
 

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.870
sorts of customizability but what they
really love is just figuring the damn

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880
really love is just figuring the damn
 

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.180
really love is just figuring the damn
thing out to begin with yeah and making

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:11.190
thing out to begin with yeah and making
 

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.640
thing out to begin with yeah and making
it comfortable and then maybe giving you

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:13.650
it comfortable and then maybe giving you
 

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.910
it comfortable and then maybe giving you
soap so the key is as you're saying yeah

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:16.920
soap so the key is as you're saying yeah
 

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.700
soap so the key is as you're saying yeah
look at the screen size and density you

know android has has made an entire
 

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.890
know android has has made an entire
cottage industry of figuring this stuff

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:24.900
cottage industry of figuring this stuff
 

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.900
cottage industry of figuring this stuff
out and giving you the data that you

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:26.910
out and giving you the data that you
 

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.420
out and giving you the data that you
need to make your screen the right size

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:29.430
need to make your screen the right size
 

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.670
need to make your screen the right size
the right density you know inside your

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:31.680
the right density you know inside your
 

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.000
the right density you know inside your

I mean if if you literally just took

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840
I mean if if you literally just took
 

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.840
I mean if if you literally just took
this control scheme split it in half and

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:38.850
this control scheme split it in half and
 

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.030
this control scheme split it in half and
scaled it based upon density it would

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.040
scaled it based upon density it would
 

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.920
scaled it based upon density it would

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.990
mechanics are fun and the the graphics
are maybe not as polished as the most

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000

get any upgrades in fact I can't upgrade

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000
get any upgrades in fact I can't upgrade
 

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.050
get any upgrades in fact I can't upgrade
I can't even upgrade to get the missiles

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.060
I can't even upgrade to get the missiles

mean it I can't actually upgrade more

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:55.110
mean it I can't actually upgrade more

you see it did actually recover from

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760
you see it did actually recover from
 

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.250
you see it did actually recover from
this I don't you can't see it but if you

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260
this I don't you can't see it but if you
 

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.990
this I don't you can't see it but if you
see actually it did finally kind of

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000
see actually it did finally kind of
 

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.819
see actually it did finally kind of
figure out what was going on so that was

00:50:40.819 --> 00:50:40.829
figure out what was going on so that was
 

00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:42.470
figure out what was going on so that was
good but it definitely got into this

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480
good but it definitely got into this
 

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.420
good but it definitely got into this
kind of funky state so it's definitely

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:44.430
kind of funky state so it's definitely
 

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.280
kind of funky state so it's definitely
to look at it's really important to look

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:46.290
to look at it's really important to look
 

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.559
to look at it's really important to look
at those android lifecycle charts as a

00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:48.569
at those android lifecycle charts as a
 

00:50:48.569 --> 00:50:50.930
at those android lifecycle charts as a
game developer because the expectation

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940
game developer because the expectation
 

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:52.099
game developer because the expectation
is if you're using the framework the

00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:52.109
is if you're using the framework the
 

00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:53.420
is if you're using the framework the
framework actually does a lot of that

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:53.430
framework actually does a lot of that
 

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.400
framework actually does a lot of that
work for you but if you're actually as a

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:55.410
work for you but if you're actually as a
 

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.020
work for you but if you're actually as a
game developer you're probably not using

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.030
game developer you're probably not using

now let's stretch to fill the screen and
 

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.440
now let's stretch to fill the screen and
zoom to fill screen by the way it took

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:45.450
zoom to fill screen by the way it took
 

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:47.030
zoom to fill screen by the way it took
me a long time to figure out what does

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040
me a long time to figure out what does
 

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.450
me a long time to figure out what does
not yeah some stretch means that it's

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460
not yeah some stretch means that it's
 

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.430
not yeah some stretch means that it's
going to tell your game that you are

actually on a larger screen well zoom
 

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.100
actually on a larger screen well zoom
means it doesn't right Julie zoom

00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.110
means it doesn't right Julie zoom
 

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.410

basically says oh yeah sure you're on
 

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.020
basically says oh yeah sure you're on
like a QB ad a screen sure is that what

you want all right and then it blows it
 

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.860
you want all right and then it blows it
up really big I don't want I note that

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:06.870
up really big I don't want I note that
 

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.690
up really big I don't want I note that
basically what you're getting is the

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700
basically what you're getting is the
 

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.150
basically what you're getting is the
that's kind of cool you're getting the g

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160
that's kind of cool you're getting the g
 

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.010
that's kind of cool you're getting the g
one version of the game when you're

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.020
one version of the game when you're
 

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.480
one version of the game when you're
running the zoomed full screen the

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.490
running the zoomed full screen the
 

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.190
running the zoomed full screen the
assumption is that you actually have not

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200
assumption is that you actually have not
 

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.840
assumption is that you actually have not
looked at the android platform since

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:17.850
looked at the android platform since
 

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:20.690
looked at the android platform since
android 10 pretty so if you want to take

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700
android 10 pretty so if you want to take
 

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.390
android 10 pretty so if you want to take
a look at this at this tablet right now

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400
a look at this at this tablet right now
 

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.140
a look at this at this tablet right now
so this is the entire screen of the

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:27.150
so this is the entire screen of the
 

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.030
so this is the entire screen of the
tablet it's a you know we haven't like

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040
tablet it's a you know we haven't like
 

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.890

put it in one corner or not but that
 

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.990
put it in one corner or not but that
that's basically what happened when when

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000
that's basically what happened when when
 

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.990
that's basically what happened when when
I selected zoom to illustrate yeah

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000
I selected zoom to illustrate yeah
 

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.490
I selected zoom to illustrate yeah
understandably this is probably not what

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500
understandably this is probably not what
 

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.220
understandably this is probably not what
the developer intended and really kind

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.230
the developer intended and really kind
 

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:42.050
the developer intended and really kind
of cool though I have to get I make it

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:42.060
of cool though I have to get I make it
 

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.320
of cool though I have to get I make it
really hard to play and a cool oh aight

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:45.330
really hard to play and a cool oh aight
 

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.220
really hard to play and a cool oh aight
it doesn't doesn't know where we are on

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.340
the screen anymore because it's totally
lost right now it just assumes that if

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:49.350
lost right now it just assumes that if
 

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:51.770
lost right now it just assumes that if
