Congratulations, you've finished lesson 2.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.720
In this lesson, you created a Git repository and added commits to it for

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.910
the first time.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.200
You also learned to use the staging area to control exactly what changes go into

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.490
each commit.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.020
Finally, you learned to maintain parallel versions of your code using Git

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.300
branches and how to merge 2 branches together into 1 combined version.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.320
In the next lesson, we'll see how to use GitHub to share your projects and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.410
collaborate with other people.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.730
See you then.
