had a time in which we've sort of taken
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320
had a time in which we've sort of taken
a step back and said let's create a way

a step back and said let's create a way
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200

we have a community hospital where

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
we have a community hospital where
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.359
we have a community hospital where
patients really come off the large

one kind of cancer but there are many
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.790
one kind of cancer but there are many
kinds of cancers and that even within

let's say a pay particular specimen of
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470
let's say a pay particular specimen of
of you let's say just take breast cancer

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480
of you let's say just take breast cancer
 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.670
of you let's say just take breast cancer
or even take her2 positive breast cancer

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
or even take her2 positive breast cancer

one woman's breast cancer in the genetic
 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.910
one woman's breast cancer in the genetic
sense is different from another woman's

breast cancer even though they might

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300
breast cancer even though they might
 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420
breast cancer even though they might
share some common features so one of the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
share some common features so one of the
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.670
share some common features so one of the
large projects that's going on right now

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680
large projects that's going on right now
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.030
large projects that's going on right now
is a project of determining to what

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
is a project of determining to what
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.850
is a project of determining to what
extent do different cancers share common

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860
extent do different cancers share common
 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.560
extent do different cancers share common
features and to what extent are they

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
features and to what extent are they
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.480
features and to what extent are they
really different cancer is not a disease

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490
really different cancer is not a disease
 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.840
really different cancer is not a disease
which is a just a cell in isolation but

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
which is a just a cell in isolation but
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.910
which is a just a cell in isolation but
in fact has a physiological context and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920
in fact has a physiological context and
 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.850
in fact has a physiological context and
to understand cancer you need to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860
to understand cancer you need to
 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.680
to understand cancer you need to
understand its physiological context

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
understand its physiological context
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.330
understand its physiological context
which means collaborating with people

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
which means collaborating with people
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.310
which means collaborating with people
who don't necessarily work on cancer and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320
who don't necessarily work on cancer and
 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.340
who don't necessarily work on cancer and
to treat cancer you need similarly a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350
to treat cancer you need similarly a
 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.050
to treat cancer you need similarly a
collaborative context in which you are

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060
collaborative context in which you are
 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.870
collaborative context in which you are
asking for help from people in kidney

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880
asking for help from people in kidney
 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.060
asking for help from people in kidney
diseases from people who from doctors

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
diseases from people who from doctors
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.190
diseases from people who from doctors
who take care of bone diseases from

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200
who take care of bone diseases from
 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.930
who take care of bone diseases from
doctors who are in the neurological

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940
doctors who are in the neurological
 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.630
doctors who are in the neurological
center so I think this is this kind of

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
center so I think this is this kind of
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.910
center so I think this is this kind of
collaboration is very unique and it

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920
collaboration is very unique and it
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.700
collaboration is very unique and it
really plays to the strengths of the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710
really plays to the strengths of the
 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.010
really plays to the strengths of the
department's you can imagine an end to

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020
department's you can imagine an end to
 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.410
department's you can imagine an end to
cancer and the answer is probably no but

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
cancer and the answer is probably no but
 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.870
cancer and the answer is probably no but
a thoughtful no I think will prevent

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880
a thoughtful no I think will prevent
 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.150
a thoughtful no I think will prevent
some cancers we will treat some cancers

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
some cancers we will treat some cancers
 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.600
some cancers we will treat some cancers
we will cure some other cancers and some

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610
we will cure some other cancers and some
 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.590
we will cure some other cancers and some
will remain challenges and the diversity

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600
will remain challenges and the diversity
 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.810
will remain challenges and the diversity
of our approach to the diversity of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820
of our approach to the diversity of
 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.420
of our approach to the diversity of
cancer will reflect the complex biology

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430
cancer will reflect the complex biology
 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.209
cancer will reflect the complex biology
of this disease
