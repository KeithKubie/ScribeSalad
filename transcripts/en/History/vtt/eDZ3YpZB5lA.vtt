00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.213
NARRATOR: Vedic scholars
suggest that not only were

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:08.800
the ancient Hindus able
to perform brain surgery,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.762
but other advanced
procedures as well.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.723
And much of this
medical knowledge

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:20.019
was set to record in a Sanskrit
text dating back to 800 BC,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.983
known as the Sushruta Samhita.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:31.239
In 2017, at a local library
in Mahabalipurim, India,

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.492
Giorgio Tsoukalos meets with
fellow ancient astronaut

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:39.748
theorist Praveen Mohan to take
a closer look at the text.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.834
Now this is a
vast medical text

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:49.132
that contains information about
more than 11,000 illnesses.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:54.929
It talks about 700 medicinal
plants, 64 preparations

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.309
from mineral resources, 57
preparations from animal

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.853
resources, and it's
considered the foundation

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.522
of Ayurveda, the
traditional Indian medicine.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:08.234
Oh, so this is the basis for
Ayurvedic medicine right here?

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.527
Yes.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.404
I was able to find
a passage I thought

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.948
you might find interesting.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.325
Right here.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.078
You can see it says
that surgical operations

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.372
are of eight types.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:26.628
They are incising,
excising, scraping,

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:31.424
puncturing, probing,
extracting, secreting

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.636
fluids, and even suturing.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:38.640
So imagine we had
suturing 2,600 years ago.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.310
And this book was written
more than 100 years

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.855
before Hippocrates, the
father of modern medicine.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:47.106
That is amazing.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.651
And how was this
information obtained?

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.111
Like, what's the
story behind this?

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.155
Well, the title
Sushruta Samhita

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:59.369
means that the author, Sushruta,
is not really the author.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.871
He did not write this book.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:05.333
He got this information
from a character

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:10.922
called Dhanvantari, who
was an other worldly being.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.049
NARRATOR: Dhanvantari
is believed

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.344
to be the physician to
the gods, and the father

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:18.805
of Ayurvedic medicine.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.891
EXPERT: Dhanvantari
itself has a divine origin

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.310
associated with the
churning of the milky ocean.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.313
The churning of the
milk of sea refers

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.900
to perhaps the Milky Way.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.236
Dhanvantari came out
of that, and then

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:38.074
he was the god of medicine,
and he then gave this knowledge

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:41.077
of medicine to human beings.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.162
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Dhanvantari was said to have

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.832
originated from the Milky Way.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.877
And so all of a sudden,
you have a connection

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:52.297
with this deity arriving
from the Milky Way.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.756
What more do you want?

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.217
The knowledge contained
in this document known

00:02:56.217 --> 00:03:00.847
as the Sushruta Samhita
was brought here

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.183
by an extraterrestrial visitor.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.686
NARRATOR: Ayurvedic
medicine is considered

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:12.025
one of the world's oldest and
most detailed healing sciences.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.569
Is it possible that it
was really handed down

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.156
to mankind by alien sources?

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.159
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.953
and suggest that
other texts clearly

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:28.374
reveal this
extraterrestrial connection.
