00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.770
Ready?

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.139
There are lots of different liquids in
your home. 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.000
Mostly, they look and behave in similar ways. But when it comes to their chemistry

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.130
they can be very different. You can
explore chemical differences between

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.980
liquids by dropping an egg into them and seeing what happens.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.120
Do you think something different will happen to them in each of the jars, or do you the same thing will happen?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.130
Maybe the same thing.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.220
Elodie? Do you think anything different is going to happen in any of the jars?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.780
Which one?

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.280
In the oil you think something different's going to happen?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.480
Okay, cool.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.970
Do you want to put it in the oil?

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.810
It's getting bigger!

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.090
Hang on...

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.350
What's on the outside? It's turning white! Bubbles!

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.079
Yeah, lots of bubbles on the edge of the egg.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.479
It's nearly lunchtime, so we're going to

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.980
go away and leave these and see what happens with the eggs in the vinegar and all of the other liquids.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.020
And we'll come back and check on them later.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.520
The vinegar! It's floating.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.789
Goodnight eggs! Goodnight water! Goodnight things!

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.950
Which ones have had something different happen to them?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.489
These two.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.500
And what were the eggs in here?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.190
A bit yucky! It does look a bit yucky doesn't it?

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.710
What is it in, though? Juice and vinegar.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.769
Investigating how different liquids affect an egg

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.920
is a fun way to introduce children to
the idea that different substances

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.750
have different chemical properties even
know they might be the same

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.420
in other ways. Who is going to be brave and take out this final egg?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.660
Do you feel brave Elodie? No? Viola?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.130
No?! What do you think is going to
happen? I'm gonna get out. I'm interested

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.900
to see what has happened to our eggs.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.180
Look at all of those bubbles!

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.880
I really think you should feel that.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.060
Squidgy!

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.670
The acid in the vinegar reacts with the egg shell

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.880
which is mostly formed of calcium carbonate.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.480
This chemical reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.620
which is what forms the small bubbles on the surface of the egg 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.720
as you put it into the vinegar.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.220
Over time, this chemical reaction completely disintegrates the egg shell,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.780
leaving behind the inside of the egg, which
is now rather squishy,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.240
and a rather nasty smell.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.900
How squidgy do you think it looks? Do you think it looks quidgy like a bouncy ball?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.160
Not that squidgy.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.060
So what do you think would happen when we drop it?

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.460
It'll bounce! Oh, shall we see if it bounces then?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.700
Yes!

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.070
Okay, everyone ready? Let's go!

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.180
OH!

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.359
What happened? It cracked!

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.519
It totally cracked, didn't it!?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.080
