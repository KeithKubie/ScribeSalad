00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.460
A new study out of Harvard says a newly discovered
text that Jesus may have had a wife could

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.180
hold water... that was then subsequently turned
into wine.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:18.429
Welcome to DNews, I'm Ross Everett and we're
going to have some fun with religious texts.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.949
A sentence that's normally a lie, but walk
with me.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:21.949
Across water.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:22.949
See?

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.949
The fun's already starting.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:24.949
You've heard of Jesus, right?

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.449
Carpenter, insightful guy, son of God.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.890
Well, recently, a new text was found where
the unmarried messiah was said to have referenced

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.980
his wife.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.030
Specifically the ancient text reads "Jesus
said to them, my wife"

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.899
Seeing as how this was thousands of years
ago, this probably wasn't a Borat reference,

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.890
unless Jesus was super into inane prophecies
and wanted to appeal to the brothers of Theta

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.890
Beta Kappa.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.320
But more likely it alludes to the idea that
Jesus had a wife, and like other men, would

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840
talk to his friends about her.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.390
This could be troublesome as it's written
that Christ never knew the touch of a woman,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.970
but if you ask any married man that could
still hold true.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.269
Whether or not Jesus had a wife was a hot
button issue especially amongst early Christians

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.690
who debated celibacy versus if it was okay
to have a family.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.490
Now here's where Harvard comes in, because
only something this big, this special, this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.890
groundbreaking, it has a shot of getting into
Harvard.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.119
Even without extra curriculars.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.470
So, Harvard takes a look at this text because
you gotta make sure it's real.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.890
We can't just take a piece of paper's word
for it.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.180
You've got to wine and dine it a little bit.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.200
Romance it before you start dating.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.740
Carbon dating, that is.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.590
Let's take a quick look at the found text
itself: the text was revealed to the public

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.010
back in 2012.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.030
It's written in Coptic and is around the size
of a business card.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.970
And Harvard's test say the papyrus most likely
dates to eighth century Egypt based on the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.850
radiocarbon dating and the ink's chemical
composition.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.050
They go on to say "If it was written in the
eighth or even the ninth century, it's still

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.729
an ancient document" and if real would fall
into the category of gospel.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.960
But, let's not go drawing a wedding ring on
every picture of Christ just yet as a challenger

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.350
has entered the tournament by the name of
Brown University who points out that the text

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.890
conta ins grammatical errors a native Coptic
speaker would not make.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.479
Mind you, Harvard refuted that by saying that
the grammatical errors match an informal style

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.020
that's found in other ancient Coptic texts.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.460
Kind of like a doge version of gospel.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.460
Trademark.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.570
I'm a genius.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.570
What do you guys think?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.540
What's the craziest thing you've ever found
out about someone you thought you knew?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.930

stuff over here to learn yourself something

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.670

I'm Ross Everett, and you all are just lovely.
