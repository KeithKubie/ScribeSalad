00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.040
Well Pretz Tastic is still the same
unit cost, 20 cents per ounce.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.420
Pretzelicious is 2.75 for 15 ounces.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.810
When I do the division,
2.75 divide by 15 is $0.18 per ounce,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.720
which is two cents cheaper,
making Pretzellicious the new best deal.
