Your task is going to be to derive the reflection equation. So you're given the

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:08.102
V vector towards the eye, and the mirror surface is normal N. These 2 vectors

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:12.405
are normalized and the dot product between them is computed and stored as D.

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:16.500
You are now given 2 other vectors, dV which is the V vector multiplied by this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.754
dot product and dN, the normal multiplied by this dark product. You can see how

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.446
this 2 vectors are produced here. For example DV is shown as the projection of

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:32.210
N on to the V vector. And DN is shown as the projection of V onto the N vector.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.717
Here's our normalized reflection vector R, this is our goal. The question to

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:39.375
you is given these 4 vectors, how do we compute this normalized reflection

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:43.480
direction vector? You can use any and all of the four vectors in your answer

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.125
which should consist of 4 integers. These integers can be positive, negative or

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.970
0. For example, if you think the single copy of DN vector negated is the same

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.040
as the R vector, you would put 0, negative 1, 0, 0. Here's a hint. This answer

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.830
is not correct. What values form the right answer?
