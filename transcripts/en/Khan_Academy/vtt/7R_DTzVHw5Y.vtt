00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.870
- [Instructor] We're told to
find the following integrals,

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.620
and we're given the graph
of f right over here.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.390
So this first one is the definite integral

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.460
from negative six to
negative two of f of x dx.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.477
Pause this video and see if
you can figure this one out

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:15.750
from this graph.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.830
All right we're going
from x equals negative six

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.760
to x equals negative two,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.470
and the definite integral
is going to be the area

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.980
below our graph and above the x-axis.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.890
So it's going to be this
area right over here.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.560
And how do we figure that out?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.730
Well this is a semicircle,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.490
and we know how to find
the area of a circle

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.660
if we know its radius.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.160
And this circle has radius two,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.000
has a radius of two.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.410
No matter what direction
we go in from the center,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.660
it has a radius of two.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.370
And so the area of a
circle is pi r squared.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.760
So it would be pi times our
radius which is two squared,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.100
but this is a semicircle,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.510
so I'm gonna divide by two.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.230
It's only 1/2 the area of the full circle.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.200
So this is going to be four pi over two,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.540
which is equal to two pi.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.210
All right let's do another one.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.670
So here we have the definite integral

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.050
from negative two to one of f of x dx.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.920
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.990
All right let's do it together.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.610
So we're going from negative two to one,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.980
and so we have to be a
little bit careful here.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.850
So the definite integral,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.150
you could view it as the area below the,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.590
below the function and above the x-axis.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.800
But here the function is below the x-axis.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440
And so what we can do is,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.640
we can figure out this area,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.520
just knowing what we know about geometry,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.510
and then we have to
realize that this is going

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.840
to be a negative value
for the definite integral

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.830
because our function is below the x-axis.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.880
So what's the area here?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.650
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.050
We could split it up into a few shapes.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.660
So you could just view it as a trapezoid

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.830
or you can just split
it up into a rectangle

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.270
and two triangles.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.200
So if you split it up like this,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920
this triangle right over here has an area

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.433
of one times two times 1/2.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.550
So this has an area of one.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.240
This rectangle right over here has an area

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.280
of two times one,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.960
so it has an area of two.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.530
And then this triangle
right over here is the same

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.050
area as the first one.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.890
It's going to have a base
of one, a height of two,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.030
so it's one times two times 1/2.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.500
Remember the area of a triangle
is 1/2 base times height.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.810
So it's one.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.640
So if you add up those areas,
one plus two plus one is four,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.910
and so you might be tempted
to say oh is this going to be

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.200
equal to four?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.880
But remember our function
is below the x-axis here,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.790
and so this is going
to be a negative four.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.470
All right let's do another one.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.440
So now we're gonna go from
one to four of f of x dx.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.350
So pause the video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.020
So we're gonna go from here to here,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.400
and so it's gonna be this
area right over there.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.640
So how do we figure that out?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.340
Well it's just the formula
for the area of a triangle,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.823
base times height times 1/2.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.200
So or you could say 1/2 times our base,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.730
which is a length of,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.530
see we have a base of
three right over here,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.236
go from one to four,

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.280
so 1/2 times three times our height,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.240
which is one, two, three, four,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.680
times four.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.320
Well this is just going to get us six.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.650
All right last but not least,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.540
if we are going from
four to six of f of x dx.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.450
So that's going to be
this area right over here,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.310
but we have to be careful.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.270
Our function is below the x-axis,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.250
so we'll figure out this
area and then it's going

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.750
to be negative.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.920
So this is a half of a
circle of radius one.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.440
And so the area of a circle
is pi times r squared,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.930
so it's pi times one squared.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.270
That would be the area if
we went all the way around

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.300
like that, but this is
only half of the circle,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.710
so divided by two.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.710
And since this area is
above the function and below

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.550
the x-axis, it's going to be negative.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.898
So this is going to be equal
to negative pi over two.

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:14.983
And we are done.
