00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.530
Yeah.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.630
JAMISON HUNT:
Hello, I'm Jamison.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:25.935
I play mandolin, banjo, guitar,
ukulele, also play drums.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.096
Started on violin,
but about that--

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:35.430
that's about it.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.870
JOSH HUNT: I'm Josh.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.440
I play guitar, and I sing.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.040
And I do play the bass,
and I started on violin.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.400
And I can play a couple
others, but not well.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400
So we won't count those.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:52.410
JENNI HUNT: I'm Jenni.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:57.240
And I mostly sing for the group,
and I also play the violin.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.240
We didn't bust it out
today because of the songs,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.710
but that's my
passion, is violin.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.430
And actually, Josh
and I write a lot

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.670
of the lyrics for the group, and
so that's another passion too.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.750
JOHN HUNT: All right.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.820
I'm John, and I play keys,
and accordion, and basically

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.420
anything that looks like
piano, a little bit.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.320
And a little bit of guitar.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.170
And-- yeah.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.270
JUSTIN HUNT: I'm Justin,
and I play the bass.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:33.896
And I play, like, 14
different instruments, so--

00:16:33.896 --> 00:16:38.690
and yes, they're all
stringed instruments.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.230
SPEAKER 1: OK, so
that was 17 plus 14.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.090
We're missing Jessi.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.480
What does Jessi play?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.800
JOSH HUNT: Jessi plays
banjo, mandolin, violin,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.770
viola, guitar.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.167
Yeah, I think that's
about it, maybe.

00:16:56.167 --> 00:16:57.250
I'm probably missing some.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.640
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.150
JOSH HUNT: It's always hard.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.442
We always get that question,
like, how many instruments

00:17:00.442 --> 00:17:01.450
do you guys play?

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.530
And it's like we've never really
come up with a specific number.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.230
It's just like we all
kind of play instruments

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.109
that we don't know if we
can count or not, so yeah.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.880
In the show, though,
I think we came up

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.579
with a number of
around 12 or 13.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.349
I can't remember though.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.599
SPEAKER 1: So obviously a very
musically talented family.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.530
For reference, I
play the clarinet,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.990
so that's all so much cooler.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.670
JOSH HUNT: Yeah, none
of us can do that.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.530
SPEAKER 1: So how did
the band get started?

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.322
Who was the first to
pick up an instrument?

00:17:33.322 --> 00:17:34.890
What's kind of the origin story?

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.800
JENNI HUNT: Yeah, so our
story, like most of us

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.040
said, we started on
classical violin, actually.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.220
Our mother was a music
major in college,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.140
and so she started a
violin school in Virginia,

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.360
where we grew up.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.270
And so we were just
always playing,

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.360
you know, Bach and Mozart
and Beethoven and Vivaldi.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.910
And at a certain
point-- well actually,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.530
all the while, our dad was just
this electric guitar shredder.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.610
And he was, like, listen to Led
Zeppelin, and here's Boston.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.050
And learn this solo.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.540
And so we definitely
had these two worlds

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.310
of music influencing us,
two very different worlds.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.590
And our mom would take
us to the library,

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.440
and she'd say, pick
out any CD you want.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.490
And we'd all come back
with Motown CDs from--

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.790
I remember NSYNC was
a favorite one too.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:32.310
And from just every genre we
could listen to, we would.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.220
And then, probably
around teen years,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.760
we started writing our own
music and branching off.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.650
And we need-- if we want a
band, if we want to write music,

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.170
we need that full sound.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.710
So people gravitated
to what they

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.840
were interested to-- the drums,
and the keys, and guitars,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.470
and the bass.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.420
And we definitely use the
whole team, kind of rely

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.530
on each other's strengths,
so as far as lyrics go.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.980
And John really composes
a lot of the melodic side

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.420
of the songs.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.130
And Justin's the gear
tech guy, the engineer

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.830
for recording and demos
and that sort of thing.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.620
And Jord brings the songs
to life with the pulse,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.070
and the beat, and the rhythm.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.707
So yeah, it's a big team effort.

00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:19.290
SPEAKER 1: So it's
very collaborative.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.760
No one just goes off into a room
and then comes back and says,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.385
hey, here's a song
we're going to play?

00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:25.270
JENNI HUNT: Well,
sometimes that happens,

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.760
and we're open for
any creative flow.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.490
Sometimes it's a big jam
session with everyone,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.330
and sometimes it's those
personal times of writing

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.560
and personal experience.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.630
And then you bring it
and show it to everyone,

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.700
and they take it to a new place.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.533
JOSH HUNT: Yeah, it's never been
the same for us in songwriting.

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:46.200
I don't think we have
any two songs that

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.580
were written the same way.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.000
But with one of the songs we
played today, the first one,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.730
"Heaven Knows," I
remember we were

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.050
trying to write lyrics to it.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.550
And we were just
like, OK, we really

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.290
need a chorus to this song.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.620
Everybody break for an hour,
and you can write by yourself

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.120
if you want.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.340
You can pair up with
somebody if you want.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.600
And just come back, and
we're going to show and tell.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.170
And so from that, I mean,
it was kind of tough,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.920
because you're like,
I don't want to show.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.045
I'm not that proud of this.

00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:17.910
But we would pick and
choose from each person what

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.580
was really good and kind
of mash it all together.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.410
So that one's one of
my favorite examples,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.580
because I can listen
to the chorus in that

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.920
and hear three or four different
people's influence in it.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.878
SPEAKER 1: Very cool.

00:20:31.878 --> 00:20:34.170
What does the recording
process look like for you guys?

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.080
Is it just everyone get a room,
and we're going to bang it out,

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.630
or--

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.490
JENNI HUNT: You want
to talk, recording guy?

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.520
JOSH HUNT: Yeah, recording has
also looked different for us

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.270
through the years.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.980
We've gone to
different studios--

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.330
one in Virginia, one in
Nashville, one in Connecticut,

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.190
the most recent.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.260
And we definitely
are trying to--

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.750
the recording process
for us, we feel

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.515
like would be best if we
could just relax and sit

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.180
in our own home
or studio, and you

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.410
don't feel like you're
on the clock every minute

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.310
of every day.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.970
JUSTIN HUNT: Yeah,
so the next album

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.350
is going to be released
in eight years, probably.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.808
That's when it's
going to be ready.

00:21:18.808 --> 00:21:20.558
JOSH HUNT: So we got
a bunch of equipment,

00:21:20.558 --> 00:21:23.410
and we're going to try and
record our own stuff from here

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.462
on out.

00:21:24.462 --> 00:21:25.420
JUSTIN HUNT: Heck yeah.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.712
JOSH HUNT: More to add to that?

00:21:26.712 --> 00:21:29.920
Justin interned at the studio
in Connecticut for a month

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.730
and learned a bunch of stuff.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.850
And so we're kind
of, yeah, hoping

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.990
to put the Hunts'
future in his hands.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.320
SPEAKER 1: Where do you guys
draw most of your inspiration

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.270
and your influence
for your music?

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.390
JOHN HUNT: Usually I like
just finding a quiet room.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.100
A lot of times,
it's during a party,

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.830
for some reason, when
I write the best.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.590
But it's like I can always
hear on my voice memos

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.800
that there's a party.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.410
I was like, oh, that's
when they were over,

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.130
and I went back in a quiet
room and just kind of started

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.850
messing around.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.870
So that's usually when
I feel most inspired.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.330
JOSH HUNT: Yeah,
a lot of our music

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.540
has been inspired
by our childhood,

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.770
and also the idea of traveling.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.030
And then more recently, the
latest album was inspired

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.980
by our commitment, I guess.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.150
Our grandparents were
a really good example

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.400
to us of commitment, and
they're committed to each other.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.220
And so if you see
the album there,

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.740
it's our grandparents on
the front of the album.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.130
And so it's just kind of
whatever you're feeling

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.030
is what you really
want to write about.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.910
It's a lot of times
really hard for us

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.280
to write when it's
like, we have this song,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.720
and it really needs lyrics.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.190
And it's super happy.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.170
But you're not feeling
that at the moment,

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.470
so you kind of want
to sit back and maybe

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.180
work on something else.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.080
We're always trying to figure
out how to write where we are

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.750
and something that
relates to all of us,

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.563
and not just one or two people.

00:23:04.563 --> 00:23:05.980
JORDAN HUNT: I
typically write off

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.720
of emotions, where when I
experience something that

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.890
invokes an emotion that
I, then, am inspired

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.790
to write a song about, like
the most recent one today

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.430
that you got to hear.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.930
SPEAKER 1: Do you want to tell
us about the most recent one?

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.000
JORDAN HUNT: Sure.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.728
Yeah, we're trying to
release a new song,

00:23:29.728 --> 00:23:31.270
and it kind of
features me coming out

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.660
from behind the drums and
playing guitar and leading it.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.010
And just a few months
ago back in Virginia,

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:43.540
I went into a Chick-fil-A, and
there was a pretty girl there

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.950
working the cash register.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:50.680
And so I left there, and
I just had those feelings,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.670
and so I wrote this song.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.240
Just kind of that nervous,
I want to get to know you,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.710
but how do I even do
this, kind of thing.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:06.550
And so I wrote a song about
that, and it's a fun jam.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.760
And so we're trying to release
that this summer in June.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.565
And so be on the
lookout for that.

00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:12.940
SPEAKER 1: And
you will know when

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.920
you hear the song that
it was about the cashier

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.530
at Chick-fil-A.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.280
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.980
SPEAKER 1: Have you
spoken to her since?

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.813
JORDAN HUNT: No, no.

00:24:19.813 --> 00:24:21.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.100
SPEAKER 1: Chalk that one
up to unrequited love.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.272
So, Josh, you mentioned travel
being a big inspiration,

00:24:27.272 --> 00:24:28.730
and you guys are
on tour right now.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.075
How has that been going?

00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:31.450
JOSH HUNT: It's
been going great.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.000
This tour we've
been really focusing

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.600
on lyrics, because that,
for us, really holds us up.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.400
We have a lot of
instrumentalists

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.200
that just compose and
write beautiful melodies.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.640
Jamison and Jonathan have
been putting together

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.890
a lot recently.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.000
And they're like, we
have this whole album,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.430
but right now it's instrumental,
and it needs lyrics.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.780
So this tour was
focus on lyrics tour,

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.490
and we've been doing that.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.750
And definitely
incredible inspiration

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.700
comes from incredible sights.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.830
You know, we're driving
through the Rockies,

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.020
and we're getting
out to the coast.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.180
And up in Washington,
snowy mountains

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.820
and just beautiful scenery
has really inspired us.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.100
And I think that you may be
able to decipher or pick out

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.430
some of that in our
future work, hopefully.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.390
I mean--

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.610
JENNI HUNT: So that's
been on the road

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.515
to pass the time,
kind of a challenge

00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:34.390
that we've been tasked
with, to write lyrics.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.000
But what's also been
cool for me this tour

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.870
is just a group of seven
siblings from Virginia,

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.970
all the way on the edge
of that east coast,

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.310
to come all the way
out to Washington,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.110
and Oregon, and Utah.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.060
And that there are
people who actually

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:54.080
show up and know our songs
has been mind-blowing to me.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.790
And super cool, as
a band, to see that

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.210
actually through the digital
age that your music can really

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.780
spread across the country.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.700
Even though having never been
there or met these people,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.470
they feel like they know
us and know our music.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.878
So that's been a really
cool experience this tour.

00:26:16.878 --> 00:26:17.670
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.587
So you guys were in
Denver a couple weeks ago,

00:26:19.587 --> 00:26:21.460
and you're no
strangers to Colorado.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.890
We get the shout-out
in the song.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:24.682
JOSH HUNT: Ah, yes.

00:26:24.682 --> 00:26:26.182
SPEAKER 1: You guys
have also played

00:26:26.182 --> 00:26:29.100
Red Rocks, which is the ultimate
mecca for concert goers.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.060
What was that experience like?

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.350
JENNI HUNT: So Red Rocks
we were touring with OAR.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.920
We got to open for them
for their summer tour.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.810
And we saw that Red
Rocks was on the tour,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.210
and we were looking
at that, like,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.880
but we're probably not going
to get to open for them

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.870
that night, right?

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.710
And when they told us, no, heck
yeah, you guys are opening.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.970
You're our opener for this.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.540
We were like, are you serious?

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.170
We get to do that?

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:03.360
So it just felt like a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.200
And you can walk down
the halls backstage,

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.840
and there are these posters
of every band that's

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.100
played the stage.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.710
And it just felt
like a huge honor.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.530
Jord had a crazy
experience at Red Rocks--

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.280
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.640
JENNI HUNT: --with the--

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.620
no pretty girls this time,
but the elevation really

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.120
got to him.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.910
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah, so had driven
in that night for soundcheck,

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.470
loaded the stage.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.080
And everybody was running
up and down the stairs,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.040
and I was like,
oh, I can do that.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.790
So I ran up, and I
sprinted to the top.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.240
And I came back down, and
when I was coming down,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.367
I was like, oh, I didn't
even look at the view

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:49.200
when I was up there.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.160
So like I just
continued, went up again.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.450
And these guys
were watching, so I

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.260
was like, I gotta be fast
when they're watching.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.020
So I just was going at it.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.800
And when I got up to the top,
I was like, oh my goodness,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.470
what is this feeling?

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.370
And I passed out.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:10.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.410
I passed out at the top.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.780
Didn't get a good
look at the view up

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.450
there, but it was
an hour before show.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:25.000
And so they had a medical
room right next to the stage,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.460
because apparently this
happens a lot to the artists.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.640
So they strap me to
this chair, and it

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.050
was going down the stairs.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.660
I'm throwing up,
and it was great.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.950
It was a great story, right?

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:38.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.110
And so five minutes
before the show,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.670
these guys were
trying to figure out

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.970
how to do the show
without the drums.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.070
And so I was laying there
with an IV in my arm.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:54.210
I was like, I have
to do the show.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.730
My hands were cramping, but
five minutes before the show,

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.700
I stood up and saw how,
like, I felt standing up.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.110
I felt like a zombie.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.560
Walked out on stage, and
adrenaline kicked in,

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.270
and I was able to
like do the show.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.953
But that was my Red
Rocks experience.

00:29:12.953 --> 00:29:15.620
SPEAKER 1: Jordan, why do I feel
like you have the best stories?

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:16.835 --> 00:29:18.840
Do you want to tell
the crowd surfing one?

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.520
JORDAN HUNT: Oh.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.560
No.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.530
JOSH HUNT: Yeah.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.330
I'll tell it.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.500
JENNI HUNT: Every drummer is
the one with the best stories,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.680
I feel like.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.190
JOSH HUNT: We've crowd
surfed twice in our lives.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.280
Actually, Jamison crowd surfed.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.150
We played a--

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.590
JAMISON HUNT: Mine
was successful.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.257
JOSH HUNT: Yeah.

00:29:38.257 --> 00:29:39.045
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.045 --> 00:29:41.880
We played at college, and
there was this other big band

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.960
that dropped out.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.810
And we filled in, so
it was this huge crowd

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.600
that I wasn't expecting us.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.530
And they were great.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.040
And just Jamison went
out, and because it

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.050
was such a huge crowd,
he just crowd surfed.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.140
And it was a first for
the band, really cool.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.675
The next year, we went
back to the college.

00:30:01.675 --> 00:30:04.050
And so we're like, we've got
to keep the tradition alive.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.220
And Jordan went out.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.260
And it was in the
auditorium, so there

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.820
were these rows of chairs.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.480
And so people are
kind of spaced out.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.128
Yep.

00:30:13.128 --> 00:30:14.670
JORDAN HUNT: And so
what they did was

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:20.110
they kept pushing me back until
there wasn't anybody anymore.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.260
And then I was
just on the chairs.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.100
Yeah.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.830
So my ribs felt pretty
good after that.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.164
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.070
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for sharing.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.050
When you guys aren't crowd
surfing or passing out

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.660
at Red Rocks or
anything, what do you

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.090
like to do on your
off days on tour?

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.280
JOSH HUNT: Yeah,
that always changes.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.970
We definitely sightsee
wherever we are.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.340
We went through a
disk golf phase,

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.070
where we would get out of
the RV and find a course

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.930
and go disk golfing.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:57.140
But most recently it's been
rock climbing, bouldering.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.720
A few of us are
really into that,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.560
and just started a
little over a year ago

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.530
and are going twice a week now.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.680
So whenever we can get out
and find a new rock gym,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.150
it's the coolest thing.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.820
JENNI HUNT: We love
hikes and waterfalls.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.220
And so we were just in
Oregon, so we probably

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.120
saw seven waterfalls.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.190
And then we went
to Cannon Beach.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.840
Everybody said we
had to get out there.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.020
And there's actually a
waterfall at Hug Point going out

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.930
onto the beach.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.920
I have a little two-year-old,
and he was just loving it.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.033
And I just have a feeling when
we get back to Virginia Beach,

00:31:30.033 --> 00:31:31.450
he's going to ask
me, mom, where's

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.500
the waterfall on our beach?

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.600
And it was just
really beautiful,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.880
and we love that kind of thing.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.110
JORDAN HUNT: Also love looking
for ski slopes and stuff

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.620
when we're out in
Colorado or wherever

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.843
that have mountains
like this where

00:31:49.843 --> 00:31:51.010
we can find some ski slopes.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.320
But my dad is always
like, no, we're on tour,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.320
and you're going to get hurt.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.920
But--

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.212
SPEAKER 1: He has a good point.

00:31:58.212 --> 00:31:59.257
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:59.257 --> 00:32:00.840
JENNI HUNT: Knowing
your track record.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.600
JOSH HUNT: Yeah.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.610
JORDAN HUNT: Hey, yeah.

00:32:05.813 --> 00:32:06.480
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.560
So, Jenni, you mentioned
that you have a son,

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.640
and obviously Jessi is out
because she has two sons now.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.122
Do we see a musical
future for them?

00:32:15.122 --> 00:32:16.330
JENNI HUNT: Yeah, I think so.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.160
Right now, my son
is loving the drums.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.820
He just likes to beat the
heck out of Jordan's drums,

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.680
and he likes the songs.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.400
Actually, his new favorite
song is the new one coming out,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.760
Jord's "Life is Good" song.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.260
And--

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.910
SPEAKER 1: Chick-fil-A girl.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:33.750
JORDAN HUNT: Yes.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.542
JENNI HUNT: But right
now, I can definitely

00:32:35.542 --> 00:32:37.240
see he's obsessed
with anything sport.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.630
So I feel like he's
naturally drawn to that too,

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:46.313
but I definitely want
him to learn music.

00:32:46.313 --> 00:32:46.980
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.380
So we're going to
open it up to Q&amp;A.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.810
If anyone wants to come
up and ask a question,

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.530
come steal the mic from me.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:58.530
But before that, what is the
last thing that you Googled?

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.570
JORDAN HUNT: Probably for me,
it would probably be the Hunts.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:02.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.170
JOSH HUNT: You Googled us?

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:09.180
JORDAN HUNT: I like to see
how our page looks sometimes.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.540
I don't have social
media or anything,

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.810
and so I always check in on
the Hunts through Google.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.830
So thank you guys.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.800
JAMISON HUNT: I looked up
adjustable phone holders.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.228
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:32.880
JOSH HUNT: My most recent was
a bouldering gym in Boise.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.340
Yeah, we found a cool one there.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.240
JENNI HUNT: Well, I use the
Google search on the hourly.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.180
And it's usually like health
benefits of chia seeds

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.930
or something like that.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.180
But then, similar to
Jordan's, I posted--

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.020
it was my fifth year anniversary
with my husband on March 30.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.250
So I posted some of our lyrics
with the post on Instagram.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.960
And so I was like, I
wonder, if somebody

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.650
were to type in these lyrics
into the search engine,

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.000
if they'd actually show up.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.340
And that was super
cool that it brought up

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.920
our website and the lyrics.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.780
And that was super
cool to see, kind

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.290
of that personal connection.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.820
Yeah.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.060
JOHN HUNT: I think I
looked up-- what was it--

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.380
how to make money on YouTube.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.670
Because we just
released a video.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.310
We've been releasing videos
at the start of this year

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.239
and have no idea
how money-making

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.239
really works on that.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.199
So just kind of looked that up.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.449
So yeah, you should check
out some of our new videos--

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.023
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:37.023 --> 00:34:38.190
--so we can make some money.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.730
JUSTIN HUNT: Let's see.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:50.325
It was how to get a Hunts
song on a Google commercial.

00:34:50.325 --> 00:34:51.727
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:51.727 --> 00:34:53.310
SPEAKER 1: Speaking
of which, you guys

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.005
were featured on MTV
recently, correct?

00:34:55.005 --> 00:34:55.755
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah.

00:34:55.755 --> 00:34:56.505
JOSH HUNT: Mm-hmm.

00:34:56.505 --> 00:34:59.310
JENNI HUNT: Yeah, I
think they've featured

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.140
two of our songs on MTV.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.370
And we actually got a Milk-Bone
dog biscuits commercial

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:10.380
a couple years ago and, I think,
a couple online commercials.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.565
And Starbucks has got
us on their playlist,

00:35:12.565 --> 00:35:16.590
so that's always really
exciting as a band

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.220
to see your music being
synced with these companies

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.840
and commercials.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.672
SPEAKER 1: So if anyone's
watching that has the hook up--

00:35:24.672 --> 00:35:26.130
JOSH HUNT: We've
got songs for you.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.603
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:28.270
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.312
Does anyone from the
audience have any questions?

00:35:30.312 --> 00:35:31.850
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.330
SPEAKER 1: Oh, we
got one up here.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.370
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about the sibling dynamic.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.005
Are there other siblings, or
are all of you in the band?

00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:39.630
And then as you were
growing up, was it

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.100
just natural that
you felt like, yeah,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.120
this is what I want to do?

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.510
Are there some of you who
are kind of like, yeah,

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.968
this is the second
thing that I do,

00:35:44.968 --> 00:35:47.368
but I have other things
that are more primary.

00:35:47.368 --> 00:35:49.410
And did you feel like you
have to be in the band?

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.053
And then also, in terms
of just getting along,

00:35:52.053 --> 00:35:54.470
I have a lot of children, and
they don't always get along.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.187
What are some, I guess, just
interesting stories, or just

00:35:59.187 --> 00:36:01.020
the relationship dynamic
that you have there

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.240
as you're working
together as a band,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.170
but then also you've had this
whole experience growing up

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.090
together?

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:05.840
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.530
Well, as far as the siblings
wanting to do music,

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.170
we grew up-- our parents
were music lovers.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:17.880
And so we grew up under that
household of loving music,

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.620
and so it was our passion as
kids to learn an instrument.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.560
And our parents would play
around at little events,

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.610
like weddings and
things like that.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:30.720
And so when-- the
girls are the oldest.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.990
When they were like six, they
were twins playing violin.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.990
They added them into
their act, and everybody

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.880
loved seeing the little
kids play violin.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.690
And so when Josh was old
enough, he got into the band,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.700
and then everybody
thought, well,

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.440
when am I getting into the band?

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.150
So it's was our passion.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.010
We weren't forced
to do anything.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.270
We loved doing it.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.760
And even now, nobody is forced
to be a part of the band.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.080
We all love doing this.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.310
This is what we love to do.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.310
And the door is open for--

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.580
we've had this conversation
multiple times.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.750
If anybody has something else,
like the girls, if they're

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.980
like, I just want to
be a stay-at-home mom

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.260
and raise my children,
we're not like,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.180
no, you're chained to the band.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.440
So everybody's in because
they want to be in,

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.710
and they love to be here.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.210
Yeah.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.950
JENNI HUNT: I remember
at a certain point

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.180
when the older siblings felt
like, we're the cool ones,

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.760
and the younger ones
are the baby ones.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.490
We're going to go away
and do this music retreat.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.380
The younger two
siblings said, what?

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.240
You're not leaving
us out of this.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.310
And we kind of had a talk
with them like, well,

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:43.920
we're trying to be serious here.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.420
We're trying to
be a serious band.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.420
We're trying to be cool.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.750
And if you're going
to do this, you

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.120
need to show that
you're ready for that.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.820
And they really did step it up.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.280
And I can't imagine the
band without them now

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.180
and their influence and all the
work that they've put into it.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:06.720
So I think the sibling rivalry
thing, that's always something

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.340
families will have to work out.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.610
And we have to recommit
to each other every day

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.240
about forgiving
each other and grace

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.990
and being committed to each
other first and then the band.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.190
But, yeah, everyone
has other passions

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.690
too that we like to fill in our
time when we're not traveling.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.480
But it's been really cool
to work hard at this.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.640
And I'm really proud
of everyone for pushing

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.923
through the ups and the
downs and making it happen.

00:38:35.923 --> 00:38:37.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for being here.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.420
This has been so awesome.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.090
Kind of going off
the sibling dynamics,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.700
you mentioned you
travel in an RV.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.637
Do you guys all fit in one,
or is it like a caravan?

00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:47.970
JENNI HUNT: Yeah, good question.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.790
So we barely fit in one.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.560
We're maxed out right now.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.350
It technically sleeps 10,
but that's uncomfortably 10,

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.590
and if you're really short.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.090
Yeah.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.970
So I'm fine, but some of
the taller guys are like,

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.840
this isn't working.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.580
JOSH HUNT: We're sleeping
at an angle on a two-seater.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.320
JENNI HUNT: And we have a
trailer with all the gear

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.160
because we typically travel
with our own sound, and merch,

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.420
and all of that.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.550
So right now that
works, but we actually

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:21.960
did just have a talk about
maybe investing in another RV,

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.880
because the entertainment
coaches are a little bit out

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.830
of the budget--

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:28.890
or way out of the budget.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.400
But trying to make
it work with kids

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.220
coming into the family, and
girlfriends, and husbands,

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.060
and all of that.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.690
So, yeah, trying
to make it work.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.830
JOSH HUNT: And as far
as the dynamic goes,

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.720
I think we were kind
of groomed for it.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.460
We grew up in a
three-bedroom house--

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.930
all five guys in one room, two
bunk beds and a roll-out bed,

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:53.700
and then my sisters
in another room.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.573
And we all shared one bathroom.

00:39:56.573 --> 00:39:58.490
JENNI HUNT: Which is the
same story on the RV.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:01.030
There's a little
bathroom in there.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.660
JOSH HUNT: Yeah, so we would get
home from tour to that house,

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.850
and that would feel
really big to us.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:10.290
We've upgraded
since we were kids.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:15.060
But also, just depending on
how long we're on the road,

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.185
we just have to be really--

00:40:20.135 --> 00:40:20.760
what's a good--

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:20.860
JENNI HUNT: What, patient?

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.985
JOSH HUNT: --word for that?

00:40:21.985 --> 00:40:25.327
Yeah, patient with each
other, because, I mean,

00:40:25.327 --> 00:40:27.160
you're with somebody
for a really long time,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.990
and you do get
kind of irritable.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.860
My mom always would
bring up this example.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.960
She's like, even if
you put rats together

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.300
for a really long time,
they start fighting.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.560
And we're like, thanks, Mom.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:47.740
But we always have to find
that redemption and resolve.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.590
AUDIENCE: How do you
decide which instruments

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.300
you're playing for which songs?

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.590
And when you are trying
to figure out, OK, well,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.965
how do we play without the
drums, or something like that,

00:40:56.965 --> 00:40:59.530
do you have people that would
rotate in different roles?

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.773
How would that work?

00:41:00.773 --> 00:41:01.440
JOHN HUNT: Yeah.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:06.520
So usually the person who
started the song a lot of times

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.450
will be playing it on
guitar, or piano, or whatever

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.230
they started on.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.355
And they're like, I kind
of want to play this part.

00:41:13.355 --> 00:41:14.710
This is my part that I made up.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.990
It's kind of first-come,
first-served sometimes.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:28.230
So like whoever makes up a
part on whatever instrument

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.490
gets that instrument
for that song,

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.050
unless it's like completely--

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.760
I mean, what would
you call that?

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.560
We have to be able to change
between songs relatively quick.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.560
So if it's ridiculous,
then we'll--

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.830
JOSH HUNT: We all have
our individual instruments

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.750
that we kind of gravitated to.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.770
And I pretty much just
stay on the guitar,

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.380
and I'll switch over to
bass for a song or two.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.790
But now, some of
these other guys

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.380
are writing songs
and coming forward

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.820
and playing and singing.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.740
And I look to the
bass, and Justin's

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.240
over there on the
bass, like, uh-uh,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.890
I already have a
really cool part.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.900
And now I'm like, OK, so do I
just stand over on the corner

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.010
and sing harmony?

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.142
And so I've been picking
up other instruments too.

00:42:17.142 --> 00:42:18.600
And that's kind
of, I think, how it

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.903
worked when we were younger
for the younger guys.

00:42:20.903 --> 00:42:22.320
It was like, OK,
what's left over,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.820
and what would sound good?

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.540
JUSTIN HUNT: Yeah, I think
that's how we used to do it.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.150
I think more
recently, we're trying

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.340
to look at the vision
of the song and be like,

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.710
does electric guitar
belong on this song?

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.940
Yeah, maybe it does.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.440
Or we'll be like, no
banjo on the song.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.860
So we all have a vision of--

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.220
I don't know-- what the
song needs, I would say.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:47.970
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:51.330
And I feel like my job is
the easiest out of them,

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.470
because I stick to the
drums most of the time.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.600
Pretty much the whole
show I'm on the drums,

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.200
and then I have one song
that I'm just now coming

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.480
out and playing guitar.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:09.050
And so then, that's when JJ
comes back and plays drums.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.920
And that's when
other people have

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.170
to switch what they
usually do, because I'm

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.020
taking their instrument.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.910
But for me, it's pretty easy.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:24.040
But as far as how you
choose what part to play,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.550
you just pick up your
instrument, whatever you're on,

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:30.600
and you go off of what
you feel like it needs.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.750
And then everybody gives input
to everybody's instrument,

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:37.410
like, what do you think
of playing this fill here?

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.240
JOSH HUNT: Or not playing that.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.450
JORDAN HUNT: Or not
playing that fill there.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:43.950
Yeah.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.830
Just everybody gives input
to what everybody plays.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.810
And so we're all
like seven filters

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:52.410
that every part has to go
through before it makes it

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.930
on the album.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.540
AUDIENCE: So
following on that too,

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.060
do you do everyone
on every song,

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.130
or are there some songs
where somebody's like,

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.900
I'm going to sit this one out?

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.030
JENNI HUNT: Since
all seven siblings

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.270
are going to be on
stage for every song,

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.920
we try to find a part.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.100
And sometimes it is
just harmonizing vocally

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.220
or getting on the tambourine.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.860
Because I play
violin, and if a song

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.670
isn't conducive to the
strings, then I'll just sing.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.650
And it's a good challenge,
though, to force yourself

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.170
to learn something
new, or even to feel

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.870
comfortable without hiding
behind an instrument,

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.480
to just be able to
stand up there and sing

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.220
and be confident in that.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.458
It's always a
challenge, and I feel

00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:42.000
like we're always
growing and pushing

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.500
each other to the next level.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.910
And like Justin said,
that vision for the song,

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.810
too, that's what's worth
it, and to challenge

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.080
ourselves to get there.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
curious about just how you

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.072
settled on a sound.

00:44:56.072 --> 00:44:58.280
You know, you talk about
your background of classical

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.080
and more classic rock,
and then how you all

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.580
come together to
say, yeah, we like

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.395
this feel, this sound together.

00:45:04.395 --> 00:45:06.437
I've only heard the three
songs you played today,

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.920
so I don't if you have a broader
range that you do as well.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.180
JENNI HUNT: So the sound
of the band, the genre.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.780
It's always hard to put a
finger on naming the genre,

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.080
but I think when, before we
wrote our original music,

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.020
we were a cover band,
we'd just play anything.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:27.810
And we really wanted to zero in
on who are the Hunts, and what

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.220
is our sound.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.850
And it took a couple of
years to really get there.

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:36.150
But I think through
that journey we

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.050
realized we like to tell
stories with our lyrics.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.750
It's very personal,
and we're drawn

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.580
to the acoustic instruments--
mando, banjo, guitar, strings.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:53.160
And so we felt like that kind
of a folk sound really blended

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.280
with the storytelling.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.785
And now, in our big sets,
Jamison's got the mando

00:46:01.785 --> 00:46:04.260
going through pedals
and amps, and we've

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.380
got some amplification
and some effects,

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:12.120
which really causes this
fusion of alternative folk

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.320
and ambience.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.600
And we're really liking that.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.390
But yeah, it was
definitely a couple years

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.770
of journey
discovering our sound.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.440
JUSTIN HUNT: Yeah, I
think we're all really--

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.750
we like different music.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:32.020
Jordan likes-- he likes
different music than I like.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:32.520
And--

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.090
Different.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.600
And so we're all very--

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.580
I like more electronic
stuff, and then

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.860
some people like acoustic stuff.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.840
So we all kind of know
what the Hunts sounds like,

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.370
and we kind of go for
that sort of vision.

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.770
JOSH HUNT: I think a big part
of our sound that we're just

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:59.460
now realizing is
siblings harmonizing.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.990
I've heard there's
something there,

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.780
like versus strangers
harmonizing.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.410
So I think that plays a
big role in our sound.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.210
It's just vocals and harmony.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.970
AUDIENCE: With all of your
different music tastes,

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.990
I'm curious to see what your
favorite band or artist has

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.770
been recently.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.160
JOSH HUNT: OK, cool.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.825
One of my favorites--

00:47:21.825 --> 00:47:24.840
well, I have so many
it's hard to pick one.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.200
I typically like a lot
of singer-songwriters.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.310
Or just not so
much, maybe, vocally

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.340
great, but lyrically rich.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:40.170
So like Bob Dylan, or Leonard
Cohen, or Damien Rice,

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:44.220
Keaton Henson are some
of my real favorites.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:47.070
And then bands,
there's a band called

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:52.390
Dry the River that has been
my favorite for a while now.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.400
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah, for me,
I feel like the latest band

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.960
that I got into a lot
was Cage the Elephant.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.270
But my favorite
band is Sigur Rós,

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:07.050
because, just how like I was
saying I write out of emotion,

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.630
I feel like their band
does the same thing.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.600
They just write out
of deep emotions,

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.920
and I connect to that.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.640
Like, I don't know what he's
saying because he's singing

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.690
in a different language.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.960
But I really--

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.130
I connect to the
emotions that the songs

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:27.030
are giving and everything,
so that's my favorite band.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.010
JUSTIN HUNT: Yeah,
I like music that's

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:33.000
really had some serious
production go into it, so

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.870
like MGMT or The Flaming Lips.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.730
That music isn't natural.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:44.650
It's just made from all
this crazy recording stuff.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.597
JORDAN HUNT: Yeah.

00:48:46.597 --> 00:48:48.180
JOHN HUNT: Yeah, I'm
kind of like Josh

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:51.480
in I don't really
have favorites.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.958
I like parts of a lot of bands.

00:48:53.958 --> 00:48:56.500
A lot of times, I'm like, oh,
I don't like that side of them,

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.500
but I like this song.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.430
So I guess some
older Arcade Fire.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.810
I really like their older stuff.

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.210
And-- oh, what was it--

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.590
I like a lot of alt-J, in
that their beats and stuff are

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:11.230
really cool.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.990
So yeah.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.470
JAMISON HUNT: Yeah, I've been
currently listening to Dr. Dog.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.470
That's a cool band there.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.140
JENNI HUNT: I think if you
were to ask me and my sister,

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.840
we're oldies fans.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.530
And Carole King and Mamas
and the Papas, I think,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.910
did have a big influence
on us as younger people,

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.200
the layered vocals and stuff.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.550
And so I'll never
get away from them.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:42.570
But listening a lot right
now to two Swedish sisters,

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.250
First Aid Kit.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.795
Love their sound
and their harmonies.

00:49:45.795 --> 00:49:47.670
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank
you guys so much again

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.520
for coming and joining us,
for a wonderful performance
