00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
&gt;&gt;Roni Zeiger: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.170
Thanks for being here.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.940
Itís a pleasure to be back at Google.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.940
My name is Roni Zeiger.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.690
I was here for about six years until just
a couple weeks ago.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.930
And, uh, itís especially sweet to get to
present, uh, to introduce a friend, Eric Topol,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.039
who, um, is actually a little bit of a hero
to me.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.859
I wonít get to weepy donít worry.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.900
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roni Zeiger: But heís um, heís a professor

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.159
of translational genomics at the Scripps institute,
south of here, also director of that institute.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:41.219
Heís also the co-founder, um, of the West
Wireless Institute down in San Diego.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.389
Heís also a cardiologist.

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:48.359
And, if youíre starting to get a sense that
this guy is, um, sort of a rocket scientist

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.249
and a brain surgeon, heís almost all of those
things.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:01:00.029
Um, he, uh, heís been central in developing
a lot of medications, um, and other technologies

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:05.000
that many of us in the field of medicine take
for granted and use every day.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.440
And, perhaps most importantly, if someone
asks for a doctor on an airplane, Eric will

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.340
not only volunteer, but heíll bring his iPhone,
put it on their chest and get a cardiogram.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.530
So, so this is a guy that you really want
to travel with.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.810
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roni Zeiger: So, letís go on a, on a journey

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.000
with him now.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Applause]

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.479
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Great!

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.670
Thanks, thanks a lot.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.670
Okay.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.350
Itís great to be here with you.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.859
Great to be at Google, Iíve never been here
before.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.500
And, uh, well it should be fun.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.579
I know maybe because so many people are young
here, theyíre not so into their health or

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.659
the health world.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.079
But, those of you that are here, I hope will
have an interesting, uh, informative experience.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.409
Iíll certainly enjoy it.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.299
So first, I put this quote up because I thought
that would set the tone for what weíre gonna

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.009
talk about during this hour.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.799
And this is a Voltaire 250 years ago, and
Iím afraid itís not much different today.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.569
And, uh, the whole notion that doctors are
doing things with good intentions but they

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.569
donít have the information.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.500
And, thatís going to change very quickly.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.459
So, thereís a very noted, uh, very famous
Austrian economist whose name was Joseph Schumpeter

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:32.640
and he, uh , was responsible for the idea
that great innovation in an economy with entrepreneurship

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.379
could change an economy and that graph of
old economy going to new economy shown here.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.110
And this term of creative destruction is really
credited for having pushed forward, and thatís

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.790
what I think applies to the opportunities
in medicine and health care and thatís really

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.030
an exciting thing that we can do.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.269
So, since Schumpeter is one of my heroes,
I was really surprised when I was reading

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.720
the Economist, my favorite weekly read, reading
the Schumpeter column, this is just a week

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720
ago.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.430
And Iím looking at this column saying, ìOh,
now for some good news.î I have no idea what

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.640
it was gonna be about.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.189
Then I found out it was a book review.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.880
This book, uh, and it was very positive about
a godsend for those that suffer from Armageddon

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880
fatigue.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.799
So hopefully you will find this to be a very
upbeat experience as the viewer did there.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.890
And, of course, the Economist is interesting
'cause they donít, theyíre unsigned.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.460
So I donít even know who Schumpeter is on
the Economist.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.790
But, um, what were gonna talk about is, how
digitizing human beings, which is what generates

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.969
this remarkable information, is going to reboot
the future of medicine.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.400
And, before I get into that topic, 'cause
thatís really how we can do this, I wanted

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.110
to get a sense of how many of you are on Twitter
here.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.830
Everybody?

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.220
Not everybody, but the majority.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.750
See, most times when I talk, the people who
are really worried about their health, happen

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.439
to be at least 50, 60, 70, and they donít
even know Twitter exists, for the most part.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.760
This is a different group, and itís fun to
talk to folks who are more plugged in.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.390
I get most of my valuable information from
Twitter.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.480
Iíll show you a couple of slides that I made
this morning, through Twitter.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.070
So thatís, kinda for me, a, a, great reservoir,
if everybody shares their, their information

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.960
that they get to, with everyone else interested
in a particular space, itís great.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.010
So, I wanna convince you of three things.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.800
The first one hopefully will be the easiest,
because weíre here at a, a, major force thatís

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.910
done this.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.570
Our world has been Schumpetered.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.690
The second is that medicine is going to go
there, and itís just started now.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.180
The third is that we need consumers to drive
this whole thing forward, because otherwise,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.700
uh, at least some of us will not be around
to see it.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.250
And, I certainly want to see this thing take
hold, and improve the whole way we render,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.600
uh, prevention and healthcare in the future.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.060
So, I wanna start off on the digital side
of thisÖ and thatís your kind of comfort

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.041
zone I knowÖon zero-one and just to point
out, and I think youíre very well aware of

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:15.660
this, in the last decade there was just a
remarkable jump forward, the likes of which

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.660
weíve never seen.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.460
And, of course, in the, uh, in context for
example, there are now more cell phones on

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.930
the planet than there are toilets or toothbrushes.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.560
Thatís a pretty big, uh, thing that who would
ever had th--, when Marty Cooper invented

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.080
the cell phone in 1973, who would ever of
thought that would actually happen, and so

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.880
quickly, particularly in the last decade.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.370
And then these devices have been remarkably
transformative.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.930
And, the span of time from the iPod in 01í,
all the way through, uh, the Blackberry then

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.370
was renamed crack berry, now more recently
slack berry.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.170
Then thereís iPhones, prototype phone.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.380
And, of course, I guess here I should have
put a Droid phone up there, but, sorry about

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.380
that.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.150
Then thereís the EBooks and, uh, the Tablets.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.090
And this is nine years.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.100
And these devices and Iím looking around
thinking, ìWell how come youíre not looking

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.691
at your device right now, because youíre
basically surgically attached to them?î And

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:20.340
youíre giving me the great privilege of a
few minutes of attention, before you delve

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.360
right into your mobile devices.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.300
So theyíve been very remarkably transformative.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.150
And, in fact, everything that we do, well
beyond how we communicate, uh, how we think

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.750
and behave has been very much influenced by
these wireless devices.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.800
In fact, when you think about that, if life
could have changed so quickly in this span

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.550
of nine years, how come it couldnít do that
in the medical sphere?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.060
And that really got me thinking.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.790
So, in fact, this current issue of the Economist,
um, uh, is this article, this Schumpeter column,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.810
ìSlave to the smartphone.î I donít know
if you think youíre a slave, I certainly

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.620
feel Iím an eSlave to the smartphone or tablet.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.570
Because thereís so much information coming
in and you certainly want to try to communicate

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.630
with your, with your network.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.920
So, whatís going on now is that itís not;
it isnít even just one screen that we are

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.430
attached to; itís now become multiple screens.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:24.190
And, now itís a tablet, itís a PC, a computer,
itís a smartphone.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.140
And now we have a new species of man, a Homo
Distractus.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.130
As demonstrated here, a Homo Distractus has
a new add on feature, cause later this year

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.240
I understand thereís gonna be these Google
glasses.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.180
And I havenít seen exactly what they are
and this is one speculate of design of them,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.450
but if you really have augmented reality,
uh, as well as being able to potentially read

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.840
things, uh, from the web or your e-mail from
your glasses, thatís gonna be yet another

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.470
screen to, uh, to add to the Homo Distractus.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.780
It starts at a very young age, uh, this whole
process.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.280
So, youíre not so far removed from that.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.330
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: And, I uh thought that was pretty

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.970
young, when I looked at that, and then I didnítí
realize itís actually starting at an even

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.500
younger age as shown here.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.610
And so, this is a, I think, a phenomena thatís
very, very interesting.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:19.610
And I know that so many of you are digital
neighbors here, the vast majority, so you

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:26.890
can appreciate that for those of us whoíve
had to learn this whole world in the mid-stream

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.270
of our lives, has been much more challenging.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.000
So thereís some questions Iím going to ask
you, and theyíre obvious, but Iíll ask them

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
anyway.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.330
Uh, but, I wanted to give you a sense of time
compression.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:45.600
So what was zero in 2004, and then was 800
million in 2010, was?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:53.279
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: I know you know the answer to
this.

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.279
&gt;&gt;male #1: I think it was the number of users.

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:55.279
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Yeah.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.279
There you go.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.279
OK, I like that answer.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.440
So, that of course, represents a competitor.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.000
But, youíre well aware that thatís gonna
be about a billion, unless thereís an awful

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.589
lot of defriending that occurs between now
and then.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.210
To go to Google plus, or I donít know what.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.180
Uh, or just abandon social networking, which
I think is most unlikely.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.170
Of course, the evaluation of this company
is predicated on the like button and this

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.640
is a beginning of a social network dedicated
company of digitizing people.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.649
Weíve been doing that for a long time, at
Google, much longer.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:29.279
What year was Google founded?

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:32.980
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: NinetyÖninety eight?

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.750
Anybody know here?

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.750
ë98.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:43.050
Ok, so youíve been in this world of digitizing
people, in some respect, for a long time.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.139
And of course, the worst thing that could
happen is you wake up and you donít have

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:47.139
any friends.

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:51.649
Thatíd probably be good if you were trying
to, uh, promote your social network.

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:56.490
But these companies, your company, Facebook,
Amazon, Apple, have done an extraordinary

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:02.140
job of digitizing people at a very superficial
level, not medical, of course.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.139
Weíll get into some exceptions of that.

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:08.350
But, what it shows is that you can collect
some data.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:13.870
And this, of course, can be very important
for, uh, individuals likes and affinities

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:20.610
and important for, uh, consumer engagement
and purchasing and that sort of thing.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.790
But, the way to this goes is medical, and
thatís where this can go over time.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.269
So I thought you might have seen this article,
perhaps, in the Atlantic, uh, just a couple

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:31.269
weeks ago.

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:36.060
About, uh, Iím being followed, how Google
and 104 other companies are tracking me on

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.060
the web.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.610
Have you seen, or read that article?

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.610
Yeah?

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.610
No?

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.819
You donít, anyways itís a very interesting
article.

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:46.529
It talks about how no matter what youíre
going to get digitized, essentially.

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:48.149
Not using those terms.

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:54.290
And then this other feature article in the
New York Times magazine, was about, uh, the

00:10:54.290 --> 00:11:00.329
idea that the retail, itís not just Google
and 104 other companies that are, that are

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:05.490
set up to do this, but in fact thereís Target
and all the retail companies that are doing

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.490
this.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.660
And so they know, for example, a woman is
pregnant before her family even knows that

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:15.310
sheís pregnant because of the data that can
be, uh, acquired.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.830
So I thought you might enjoy this if you hadnít
already seen it.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.430
This is how to protect yourself from getting
digitized by Google.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.900
Um, have you all seen this already?

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.890
I saw this and I broke out in hysterical laughter.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:32.490
Because something I said, ìoh my gosh, play
the music loud so they canít hear what youíre

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:37.740
typing, unplug computer from power source,
medical gloves to obscure fingerprints and

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.810
finger scans on keys.î You know, but obviously
this isnít just applying to Google, this

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.180
is applying to the fact that you may be getting
digitized to some extent.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.220
And you donít really have a way, all these
things are not gonna work, of course.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.830
So, thatís the way life is today.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.860
Then thereís this social network.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.339
This is uh, of course, zero in 2006, zero.

00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:05.649
Now two years later after the beginning of
Facebook, and now well over 300 million per

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:06.649
day.

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:08.059
And you know what that is?

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.699
Thatís the number of?

00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:11.060
&gt;&gt;Audience member: [inaudible]

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.379
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Somebody said it.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:14.379
Yeah.

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.149
So, that is of course part.

00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:21.240
Now the big three, perhaps in the US, um,
but thereís all these other social networks

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.610
around the world and are, of course, many
of them are country, continent specific.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:32.019
You know, thereís Brazil with Orkut, then
thereís QQ in China, and that sort of thing.

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:37.639
Well this together, has created a force that
no one couldíve predicted.

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:43.860
And, you know, I think when Eric Schmidt said,
we missed the friend thing, we all missed

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.249
the friend thing, it wasnít just at Google.

00:12:47.249 --> 00:12:53.920
But now this friend thing with sharing pictures,
and emotions, and thoughts, and videos, has

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.269
had, of course, monstrous, uh, phenomenal
impact.

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:03.670
And thatís why revolutions have occurred,
the Arab Spring, the Occupy Wall Street movement

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.330
and so many other things are power to the
people by crowd cheering, crowd activating,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:14.370
and crowd sourcing, really a remarkable time
in our history and in our civilization because

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.160
of this electronic bounty of people.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:26.100
So, this is an example of a rudimentary social
network that has had a medical impact.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:32.340
And this is, uh, as far as we know, the first
person on Facebook, whoís punitively, his

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.800
life was saved, a young boy who was very sick
and, uh, he couldnít get a diagnosis.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.800
He went to two pediatricians and then, uh,
his mother posted his picture on Facebook,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.970
and one of her Facebook friends made the diagnosis
of Kawasakiís disease.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.249
And thatís what led to, uh, the right treatment
and of course heís doing very well.

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:57.839
And now, there are, uh, an explosion of these
online health communities.

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:03.490
And this is a good thing, but itís also been
an awakening because now so many people with

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:09.639
a chronic condition, whether it be diabetes
or, or a type of cancer or things like multiple

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:14.959
sclerosis, they go on these patientís like
me and other communities, uh, together, they

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:20.119
find people with the same condition, and now
these virtual peers become the people who

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:21.199
they trust the most.

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:25.690
Theyíve never met them, but they trust them
much more than their doctors.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:31.439
Which is really a uh, in many ways, a seismic
shake up of the relationship between doctors

00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:32.879
and patients.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:38.639
And so much so, that this to me is shocking,
this is nearly 4,000 doctors who were polled,

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:43.559
as to, ìdo you know that thereís these things,
like patients like me?î And only 11% and

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.889
this is recent just a few months ago.

00:14:44.889 --> 00:14:48.290
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Only 11% even knew they existed.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.490
But if they talked to their patients, they
would find that thatís who their patients

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.559
are spending their time with and getting guidance.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:58.589
So that shows you the chasm that exists today
between the medical profession and what the

00:14:58.589 --> 00:15:06.050
needs are and the access, the capabilities,
of empowered consumers who want to get this

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.050
information.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.540
Now, I know youíre gonna get this one right.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.540
Right?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.889
This is the one group that could get this
one right.

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:15.290
What does this represent?

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.820
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Nobody knows?

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.899
Really?

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:25.459
Okay, itís at the San Diego Zoo, does that
help you?

00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:27.699
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: No?

00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:31.059
Okay, Iím really surprised.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:34.300
This is historically very significant.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.819
This is the first YouTube ever video.

00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:38.920
Ok when was that?

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.160
April 2005.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.240
Well over 6 million hits.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.720
Now, why is this important?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.880
Itís a stupid video, it just says, ìHere
I am at the San Diego Zoo!î Alright?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.910
But, the point is that this is just not even
seven years ago and look at the data for YouTube.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.910
Okay?

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.709
This is an amazing thing.

00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:04.410
800 million unique users per month, 3 billion
views per day, 3 trillion hours of video per

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.410
month.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.720
I mean this is staggering, 60 hours of video
are uploaded every minute.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.290
What are we doing sitting here?

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.399
We should be watching a video or uploading
or both.

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:20.720
So this is an amazing amount of data in this
video and graphic world that we live in.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:27.230
And so much so, that we are generating data
at a clip which no one could ever have forecasted.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:33.560
That is from the beginning of civilization
to 2003, there were only a billion gigabytes,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.389
which is kind of amazing because we walk around
with lots of gigabytes in our pocket.

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:44.050
And now we are generating a trillion gigabytes,
a zettabyte, at least one, every year that

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.750
plot of course, is markedly increasing.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.910
And thatís why it looks like weíll have
well over 35 zettabytes by the end of just

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.149
this decade.

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:57.749
So that creates a big problem with data, especially
when you wanna extract out of that data, the

00:16:57.749 --> 00:17:03.860
useful information that has heretofore often
been only scratching the surface.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:11.980
And this big data term, is terribly underplaying
the ginormity of this data issue.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.620
But, just like Moneyball, um, we can have
this in medicine; we can learn a lot more

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:22.060
about a particular pitcher or batter by doing
a lot more work on that data.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.200
And weíd like to learn a lot more about each
individual.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.240
Prevent them from becoming a patient, by doing
this sort of thing.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.050
How are we going to do that in this world
of just, ginormous data flooding?

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:41.830
Well, the super computer of Watson has been,
uh, and other super computers, has been suggested

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.290
to be able to save a life.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:50.070
And, of course the reason for that is that
because a super computer, Watson, can process

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.250
two million pages of content in 3 seconds.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.530
Now, there are a lot of really good doctors
out there, but I donít think they can get

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.060
to two million pages of content in 3 seconds.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.960
And if you have a really complex patient,
that you donít know whatís going on, like

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:11.080
what happened with WellPoint, one of the largest
insurers, they decided to contract Watson,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.050
because then they could feed all the, get
all the information about a new individual

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.180
patient to help sort out in a complex diagnosis.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180
Thatís a good thing.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.650
Why donít all doctors, and all patients,
have access to a super computer in times of

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.650
need.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.130
Thatís where things will go, eventually.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.680
Then thereís the cloud, of course.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.610
The cloud story, which is amazing, itís important
that this of course emerged these massive

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:39.850
server farms because otherwise we wouldnít
be able to store, or even, um, handle, manipulate

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.060
some of this data.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.840
So whatís great about the cloud is now itís
even making its way to places like United

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840
Health.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.790
And recently they have, uh, just last month,
uh, declared theyíre gonna make their cloud

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:56.420
data, which is their largest private insurer
of health in the United States, available

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.030
to all their doctors and soon to all their
patients who are covered by United Health.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.820
Thatís a step in the right direction.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.560
But this cloud thing is so overcooked, that
I thought these cartoons might help put it

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.710
in perspective.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.940
This one is the check is in the cloud, and
the other one, it was much nicer before people

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.910
started storing all their personal information
in the cloud.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:24.940
Ok, so now we have this kind of rapid fire,
it started in the 70ís, it wasnít so rapid

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.890
then, the cell phone I mentioned, the personal
computer, the internet.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.020
And then things really started taking off.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.770
And you see this, uh, clustering.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.950
In a short period of time of wireless digital
devices, sequencing social networks, cloud

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:43.410
and super- computing, all setting up the potential
for this, uh, era of a great inflection in

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.410
medicine.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.440
And thatís where Iím gonna be, of course,
trying to convince you, that weíre on the

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.580
cusp of that right now.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.110
Of really, uh, actualizing that opportunity.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:58.940
So, book stores and books, thereís a really
interesting story there.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.910
How many of you only read books as an E-book?

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.950
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: No.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:04.950
One?

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.950
Two?

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.340
I guess, three.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.340
Alright.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.730
And how many will read only hard copy books?

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.570
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Ok, four.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:19.901
Ok, so should I assume that the rest donít
read any books or read a combination of the

00:20:19.901 --> 00:20:20.901
two?

00:20:20.901 --> 00:20:21.901
Help me on that.

00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:22.901
&gt;&gt;Audience: Combination.

00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:23.901
[Laughs]

00:20:23.901 --> 00:20:24.901
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: CombinaóOkay.

00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:25.901
Okay.

00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:26.901
Anyway, thatís alright, if you donít read
any books, you have a lot of other things

00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:27.901
to do I understand.

00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:31.860
Um, so, the reason I show this, of course,
that thereís a prediction that hard copy

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.910
books are gonna be no longer with us.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:39.340
And, of course, weíve seen the likes of things
like Borders Book Store chain of book stores

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.340
closing.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.050
Well, today is a big day.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.790
Today is the day on the front page of The
New York Times, The Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:53.980
after 244 years, thatís the same time when
Voltaire were saying that we didnít know

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.970
anything about medicine.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:01.400
244 years later, The Encyclopedia Britannica,
is mea culpa, weíre not going to print this

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.340
thing anymore, ever again.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.140
Thatís pretty striking.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.210
Thatís today.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:13.760
And, to me, the final thing about this book,
Iím using the book thing as to, uh, emblematic

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.140
of the world changing.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.500
I could go into all sorts of other things,
but this is the one, I think, that really

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.530
hits home for me.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.510
I did some of my training, my cardiology training,
at Johnís Hopkins.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.960
And Johnís Hopkins has this library that
I lived at a lot, called the Welch Medical

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.530
Library.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.870
And this library was closed on January 1st,
the second largest medical library in this

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.850
country, no longer functional.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.400
Does that tell you a story about where we
are in a changing world?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.320
In a world thatís been Schumpetered.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.880
So I hope Iíve convinced you of that fact
in this opening segment.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.730
And if I havenít, then this probably would
be a good time to move on because itís the

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.790
best I can do, in this time span.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.030
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Okay.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:22:00.210
Now weíre gonna talk about medicine and how
it will, inevitably, be Schumpetered.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:06.840
Because up until now, the digital macrocosm
ginormous infrastructure, thatís been developed,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.720
which Iíve very briefly reviewed with you,
that youíre very much, uh, in touch with.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.260
Then thereís this medical microcosm cocoon
thatís done everything possible to not let

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.570
there be any conversions, or any penetration
of the digital world.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:29.160
The only foray into that has been this very
weak lack of, uh, real legs, use of electronic

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:34.610
health records, and, of course, accounting
for the difficulties that you experience with

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:39.610
Google health records, and that sort of thing,
because itís so resistant to the digital

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.610
world.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.030
Well, thatís gonna change.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.490
And this is all gonna come together.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.920
There will be a conversion itís just a matter
of when.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.330
And when that happens, thereís a big, big
thing, that weíve never had before, and thatís

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.750
the ability to digitize man, digitize human
beings.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.670
Not to find out what theyíve purchased now,
or what they will purchase.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.360
But rather, what makes them tick.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.000
And thatís really an exciting thing.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.760
That takes us away from where we are in medicine
today, which is at the population level.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.670
Everything we do is population based.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:17.690
So, for example, when we say all women after
age 40 should have a mammogram every year,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.090
thatís treating all people the same.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:26.610
When in fact, many woman, a significant portion,
have zero risk of ever developing breast cancer.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.030
Another example, we give a medicine for a
particular condition, letís say diabetes,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.590
we use Metformin.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.820
Thereís 400 million diabetics on the planet,
they get the same drug, the same dose, even

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.450
though 25% of them are unable to respond to
that drug.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.030
But thatís how medicine is practiced today.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.310
We do large clinical trials of thousands of
patients, we find a few per hundred benefit,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.410
and then everyone gets the drug.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.909
Thatís wrong, totally dead wrong.

00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:59.940
And now, for the first time, we have the tools
to understand things at the individual level.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.540
And thatís extraordinary.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.910
And thatís what weíre gonna get into.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:11.250
So, uh, Thomas Goetz, the editor of Wired
magazine, wrote this really brilliant feature

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.350
article in that magazine about the feedback
loop, and the whole point here is, itís a

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:20.721
feedback loop of data where thereís genomic
data or physiologic metric data, Iíll show

00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:22.440
you a couple of examples.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.610
And that changes things.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.720
Thatís like a real reset of how we understand
any given individual.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.790
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: So, this started in the healthcare
world.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.830
Uh, fitness world I should say.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:40.340
Whereby, uh, Nike shoes, I donít know how
many of you have these Nike plus shoes that

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:45.151
have sensors in the sole of the foot and they
can track the distance and the velocity and

00:24:45.151 --> 00:24:46.890
other metrics of exercise.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:52.990
And then these wireless accelerometers, have
any of you tried things like the FIT Big BodyMedia?

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.990
You have?

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.990
Okay, great.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:58.210
So those are, I recommend them to my patients
because they encourage you to be more active.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.780
And, uh, um, I think that, thatís a great
thing.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.410
Theyíre relatively inexpensive.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:09.410
The most recent one, was just um, uh, announced
a little over a week ago, the Nike FuelBand.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.580
And so they encourage people to be more active,
thatís good.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:17.980
And then thereís the use of sensors for detecting
your quality of sleep, because we live in

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.990
this wired world of wireless devices.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.730
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: And we donít get enough sleep.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:28.230
In fact, the overall sleep of the population
has been declining in a very, uh, worrisome

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.540
pattern.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.750
So thereís a device that Iíve used, there
are many devices that monitor sleep this is

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:37.050
the only one that monitors brain waves.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.900
And this is a new device, have any of you
ever used it here?

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.360
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: So we got the same 3 people
that have used all these sensors, okay.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Thatís alright.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.670
Someday your, your experience will wear off
on the others here.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:53.210
Anyway, this is a great, uh, home electroencephalogram.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.940
Who would have ever thought you could have
your brain waves at home, for $99, going directly

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.990
to your phone, pretty neat.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.820
And, uh, thereís also a clock version, which
is what they came out with originally, and

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.890
it shows right on the clock every minute of
sleep.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.270
This is a night of my sleep.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:13.100
You see the orange bars are the awake time,
the grey bars are light sleep which isnít

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.710
worth much, the light green bars are the dream
rapid eye movement sleep which is a good thing.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.940
And then the best of all is deep restorative
sleep, the dark green .So Iím using this

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:28.290
and, uh, Iím trying to get to be a better
sleeper and very shortly after I started using

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.670
this, my wife who is a night owl, comes in
the room and she looks at the clock and she

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.660
says, ìEric, I know youíre awake, and I
wanna talk.î

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Ok.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.770
And thatís good that people at this age can
appreciate that, because thatís, of course,

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.980
one of those kinds of things that, uh, you
would particularly appreciate getting older.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.860
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Anyway, whatís interesting

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.980
is, uh, you also know, of course when anybodyís,
their brain is awake.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.560
And besides, this was discovered by three,
Brown university college students.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.660
They didnít wanna do this.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.000
What they wanted to do was not to have to
be woken up out of a deep sleep.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.230
So they invented this sensor, just so they
wouldnít have to wake up, they wanted only

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.340
to be woken up when they were in a light sleep.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.670
And thatís what led to this interesting device.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.930
Well, of course, when the Wall Street Journal
reviewed this book, the Creative Destruction

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.280
book, but what was really interesting they
picked this as the call out for the article

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.190
which was kind of I didnít think that was
the most significant statement in the book.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.860
But it was kind of interesting that they did
that.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.940
Now, what was also, uh, interesting is that
itís representative of where medicine is

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:38.670
going, because now you have data for your
sleep, compared to ten thousand people of

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.780
your age group, your peer group, because as
you likely know, as we get older, our sleep

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.530
deteriorates, and so you want to have a group
that you compare with.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:53.570
And just think about glucose, thatís blood
pressure or any metric thatís relevant in

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.780
medicine so you can compare.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:01.690
And now whatís really interesting is that
this has become a big fad in, among athletes.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:07.630
And so knowing your DQ score of your sleep,
now thereís triathletes that are using this,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:13.610
thereís three NBA teams that are currently
using Zeo every night to maximize their athletic

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:14.750
performance.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.900
And so this is now a very safe way, as opposed
to other historic ways, that athletes would

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.420
try to improve their performance.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.240
Well whatís also interesting is that now
among pro athletes thereís a compilation

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.360
of all the data of pro athletes.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.840
And this is a, uh, bar graph that, uh, summarizes
it.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:36.290
The King of sleep among all the pro athletes
is LeBron James averaging 12 hours of sleep

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.620
a night.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.610
And whatís interesting is, no wonder theyíve
never won the playoffs.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.140
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: And then, the other interesting

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.520
facet of this is the person with the very
least sleep is Tiger Woods.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.450
And Iím not gonna comment further on that.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:55.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Now, there are, um, very, uh,

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:00.880
kind of early staged devices now that you
can get your blood pressure that are fun.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.290
It doesnít quite gamify things, but it does
make it a lot more fun.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.830
So now my patients, instead of recommending
the traditional blood pressure cuff, called

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:15.410
an Omron device, that go to Cosco, I now send
them to iHealth or Withings to order it online,

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.570
again, $99.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:21.570
These things are fun, you just press the button,
gets the blood pressure, it charts it, it

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:26.200
sends it to your doctor or your Facebook friends
or your Google plus circles, whatever.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.310
And then you have it all stored.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.310
And then you, uh, have it all stored.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.990
And the same thing for glucose, thatís a
good thing.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.820
Thatís not where we want it to be, we want
it to be seamless, but thatís at least a

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.510
step in the right direction.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.160
Well, this is also the case for diabetes.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.560
For, uh, Type1, also called insulin- dependent
juvenile diabetes, we can measure glucose

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560
every 5 minutes.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.300
But currently, thereís separate receiver,
itís bulky.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.880
If youíre a diabetic, you donít want to
have this big device to be pulling out all

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.291
the time because then people would say, ìWhatís
the matter with you?î You gotta tell them,

00:29:56.291 --> 00:30:00.900
ìWell, I have diabetes Iím looking at my
glucose.î What I have is a prototype that

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.960
Iím wearing a sensor just like pictured on
this, on this slide.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.160
Uh, you can wear it on your abdomen, or your
arm or wherever.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:18.270
And I can just turn on my phone and, uh, I
can see it when I turn it on 137 and I can

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:23.500
just say my glucose at this very moment in
time is 10.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.840
And thatís good since we just ate lunch at
your cafeteria with the unlimited buffet.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.320
Iím glad itís not a lot higher than that.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:38.030
But whatís also nice is I can just, um, get
the data for the trend for, you know, hereís

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:43.150
the three hour trend for glucose, six hours,
twelve hours, 24, whatever I want.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.960
And I can send it, if Iím concerned, to whoever
I wanted to send it to.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:53.350
Thatís the beginning of an exciting time
for example, lifestyle improvement, if youíre

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.340
looking at something, should you eat it or
not, and youíre looking at your phone and

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.790
itís gonna tell you what your glucose is
gonna do when you eat this big cookie.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.720
Well, you might not eat the cookie because
you donít want to stress out your pancreas.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.020
Particularly if you know that youíre pre-diabetic,
or youíre genomicaly vulnerable to get diabetes.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:17.700
Now, Roni mentioned this in the intro is that
this is a device, that, uh, I can get, uh,

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.180
I gotta pull up my iPhone.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.110
But this is the device where I can get a cardiogram,
right on the device.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:28.810
And so, itís, you see these two sensors on
the back; you make a circuit with your heart

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:29.950
like that.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.470
And so, um, you know, this pops into the case.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:40.520
I can then just turn this thing on and get
a cardiogram, just gotta um, um, put in, uh,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.110
my password and the app.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:49.490
Get that ready and then Iíll just show you,
that hereís my, put my fingers on the back

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.580
and then weíll pop up my cardiogram.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:57.620
Now, itís really a cool device, because,
you say, ìMy gosh, why wasnít this invented

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:04.580
tens of years ago?î And whatís also pretty
cool is that I have this credit card version,

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.600
where you can put it in your wallet or you
can put it in your purse has the same two

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.700
sensors.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.420
And then you can hear the chest leads, I donít
know if youíve ever had a cardiogram but

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.450
you can get the different leads, like this.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:18.450
And thatís what you heard about being on
a plane, it actually happened, where someone

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.590
in the last row was having chest pain, they
called for a doctor on the plane; there were

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.240
three other doctors who were surgeons that
donít really know how to evaluate chest pain.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.510
And I donít know if Iíd know how to evaluate
it fully unless I had a cardiogram.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.000
And, uh, this is, you know, at 30,000 feet.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.490
You donít have a cardiogram to do.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.970
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: But, now I have it and I can

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:39.210
say this person was having a bona fide large
heart attack.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.170
And that led to an emergency landing of the
plane.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:47.750
And also, when we landed, and the, the passenger
was whisked off to get the artery, the heart

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.150
attack artery opened up.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.570
Then the pilots and the flight attendants
all wanted to have their cardiogram done.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.040
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Which was really interesting.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.340
Okay.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.870
So, those are just a couple of devices to
show you, to give you a sense of how this

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.020
field is moving fast.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:06.340
And, you know, theyíre actually getting old
now, there are a lot of other devices I couldnít

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.300
bring with me today to give you a sense.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.570
This one is really interesting, the Holter
monitor.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:16.790
You probably donít know what that Is, but
this was invented in 1949 with a frozen design.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:21.150
And you have to wear all these wires to find
out your heart rhythm over the course of 24

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.150
hours.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.180
You have to go in and get it connected, then
you have to go to a clinic, then you have

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.910
to go back to get it disconnected.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.560
You canít shower, you canít exercise.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.680
Now you have band aid, you send it in the
mail, you send it back.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.660
Itís a Netflix model of heart rhythm monitoring.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.460
Okay and itís great.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.640
But, you know, itís only happened in recent
months that this was available.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.760
And then, just to, uh, give you a little bit
of more sense about what you can monitor on

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.340
a phone this is all the vital signs.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:55.930
Not just blood pressure, but also your oxygen
in your blood, concentration, your blood pressure,

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.010
heart rhythm, temperature.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.820
And, you know, this is an amazing ability
to basically have all vital signs on your

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.200
phone continuously.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.030
So your phone in the future will look like
this.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.530
This is technically feasible today.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.299
And it will get your constant read out of
all your vital signs.

00:34:12.299 --> 00:34:14.649
As if you were in an intensive care unit.

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:18.460
Now you may not want to look at that data
or have that, but it certainly will be interesting

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.619
to see how that plays out and how it can help
prevent people from having to be in the hospital.

00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:28.929
In fact, I think there wonít be hospitals
in the future, except for intensive care units.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.210
Why would there be a hospital when you can
do all this stuff at a patientís home?

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.809
And itís much less expensive, much more comfortable.

00:34:34.809 --> 00:34:39.769
So why, eventually, are we gonna need hospitals
except for very limited reasons.

00:34:39.769 --> 00:34:43.649
Now, just some other apps to mention that
are useful.

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:47.521
If youíre, um, for someone who has a skin
lesion that youíre worried about, you donít

00:34:47.521 --> 00:34:49.440
have to go to the dermatologist anymore.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.720
You just get a picture done, text within minutes
saying not to worry, or you should indeed

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.829
get this looked into.

00:34:56.829 --> 00:35:01.890
And then, this one is amazing, if youíre
an optometrist, you better watch out because

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:07.540
now thereís a $2 add on to the phone, it
was invented at MIT, that gets refraction

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:14.730
of your eyes and then sends that data to your,
uh, to get your glasses made, for $2, pretty

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:15.730
remarkable.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.450
And then you can pass it around for all your
friends, and your social network.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.779
And itís not, of course, being used that
much in the US but its sure getting likes

00:35:22.779 --> 00:35:24.579
around the world.

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:28.339
And this, just speaking of eyes, thereís
ways to monitor the pressure in the eye, to

00:35:28.339 --> 00:35:29.609
prevent glaucoma.

00:35:29.609 --> 00:35:34.339
This is available in Europe, constant monitoring
going to your phone.

00:35:34.339 --> 00:35:39.300
And then thereís these things like a Wheeze-o-meter
that analyzes your breathing to prevent an

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.900
asthma attack.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.180
And then this morning, I, I encountered that
there is another, uh, interesting facet to

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.180
asthma.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.519
This was reported that thereís this smart
inhaler, most people, when they use an inhaler

00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:52.519
they use it wrong.

00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:55.420
And now thereís a video game to make you
use it right.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.359
And thatís really part of this gamification
of medical devices.

00:35:58.359 --> 00:36:01.710
Itís all part of this new era of medicine.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.410
Thereís also the ability to digitize breath,
to say whether or not someone might have lung

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:11.750
cancer, at a pretty high specificity and accuracy.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:19.380
So, youíre competitor, Apple, has certainly
been seen, like Google, as a big innovator.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:25.280
And so, in fact, at the time of Steve Jobsí
death, it was thought well may the logo should

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:32.410
be changed, and of course, like you, this
company has had a big worldwide impact.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.819
And I thought you particularly might enjoy
this one if you havenít seen it.

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:36.819
This is the cover of The New Yorker.

00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:39.320
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: And then another company cartoon.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:46.140
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Well, in this biography, which
I donít know if any of you have read here.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.289
Some of you may have read, I think itís a
very good book.

00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:54.609
But Iím particularly, because it traces a
digital revolution over the course of really

00:36:54.609 --> 00:36:55.740
three decades.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.609
Took a while for it to be where it is today,
but itís now, of course, going in exponential

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:01.839
fashion.

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:05.650
And then what was striking to me is this quote,
because it was occurring near the end of the

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.650
book.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:11.170
And it said, from Steve Jobs, ìI think the
biggest innovations of the 21st century will

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:18.309
be the intersection of biology and technology.î
Thatís where you sit today in a digital frontier,

00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:22.160
and this is the big uncharted opportunity,
and I certainly couldnít agree more that

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.910
this is the real story going forward.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.779
So now we just touch on the one aspect that
is really biology.

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:32.079
We were talking about physiology, but letís
get into a little bit of biology and that

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:34.069
is genome sequencing.

00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:39.630
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Up until now, in the recent
years, weíve been relying on these next generation

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.670
sequencers that cost æ of a million dollars.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:48.130
And then a whole lot more expense for the
re agents that are proprietary to run the

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.130
sequence.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:53.250
The six billion letters that comprise a human
genome that has to be sequenced 40 times,

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.109
at least, to be accurate.

00:37:55.109 --> 00:38:01.440
Well, in January, this device, the ion and
proton, was released and it said that it could

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.380
sequence the human genome in two hours, prior
to this and still today it takes us about

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.609
ten days.

00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:10.369
Dropping down from ten days to two hours?

00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:11.539
Thatís pretty good.

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:14.039
Well then this device last month was released.

00:38:14.039 --> 00:38:17.539
This is a USB size device.

00:38:17.539 --> 00:38:23.081
This is now to get a sequence of a human genome
in 15 minutes, for less than $1000.

00:38:23.081 --> 00:38:26.579
In fact, itís quoted as $900.

00:38:26.579 --> 00:38:32.980
This is, uh, exceeded Mooreís law at a level
that is unprecedented, uh, you know, in our

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:33.980
history.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.320
And so whatís exciting about this is how
you can apply it.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:42.660
And youíve been hearing about the human genome
since 2000, if youíve been at least looking

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:47.450
into this impact on the future of our world.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.730
But, you know, this is a sequence you can
get right to your laptop.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:56.049
Then you can take a boy like this, whose life
was saved by sequencing.

00:38:56.049 --> 00:38:57.609
Nicholas Volker.

00:38:57.609 --> 00:39:02.140
At this point he was nearly going to die.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.779
He had 100 operations.

00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:08.480
I donít know any human being thatís had
100 operations, no less a 5-year-old.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.589
And he was very sick in the hospital intensive
care, in a hyperbaric chamber.

00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:18.319
His pediatrician said, ìLetís sequence him
and see what is potentially this disease weíve

00:39:18.319 --> 00:39:23.440
never seen in a human being before.î And
that led to a finding the mutation that was

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.490
the root cause, and that let to successful
treatment.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:32.999
And now Nicholas Volker is healthy as could
be, cured 6-year-old.

00:39:32.999 --> 00:39:36.829
And thatís a great story because it tells
you the power of sequencing.

00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:41.519
Telling you, digitizing a human being who
is so sick that no one knows what it is, and

00:39:41.519 --> 00:39:48.349
be able to turn that around into having, hopefully,
with this young boy, a normal life.

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:51.320
This is a family from San Diego, the Beery
family.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.829
Uh, and so, these twins, Alexis and Noah,
were very sick.

00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:59.920
They had a movement disorder, they couldnít
really function.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.980
In fact, Alexis was in the emergency room,
she couldnít even breath many times, she

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.119
had a respiratory arrest.

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:07.400
And so they got sequenced.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.039
They determined the cause.

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:10.700
They determined the right therapy.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:17.380
And now Noah is a soccer star and his sister
is a track star, just by sequencing.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.809
This is a protocol that we have at Scripps,
called IDIOM.

00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:23.460
IDIOM, it stands for idiopathic diseases of
man.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.499
Thatís a terrible term, idiopathic.

00:40:25.499 --> 00:40:28.910
Itís a fancy medical term for we donít know,
idiopathic.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.390
Why donít we just say, ìWe donít know?î
[Laughter]

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:37.029
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Anyway, this is a 15-year-old
girl, who is wheelchair bound, whoís brilliant.

00:40:37.029 --> 00:40:38.930
Blogs and is cheerful.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:43.640
But, she has an unknown condition, and weíre
sequencing her along with other individuals

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.809
right now, trying to digitize their biology
so we can get the root cause and hopefully

00:40:48.809 --> 00:40:50.630
it will prove to be actionable.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:55.309
So we wanna get rid of this term idiopathic,
itís a bad term anyway, but itís also one

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:59.720
that we can get rid of because we can sequence
people and understand what is really going

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.720
on.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.970
Then thereís of course the cancer war that
was declared decades ago.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.230
But now, itís the real deal.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.369
We can actually do something in cancer.

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:14.339
This is an example of a tumor called malignant
melanoma metastatic.

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:19.020
Skin cancer all over the body and this is
a PET scan that shows the extent of the burden

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:24.349
of cancer, and then two weeks later, after
an oral pill directed to the mutation, that

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:29.690
was causing this cancer, a BRAF gene which
is present in about 2/3 of people with this

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.599
type of cancer, there was no evidence of any
cancer.

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:40.589
And this occurs in 85% of people, who have
this type of mutation, in this particular

00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:41.589
cancer.

00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:45.550
So itís a great step forward and it shows
you the power of knowing what is the root

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.069
cause of a cancer.

00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:49.650
And then having a therapy directed towards
it.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.470
Hereís another example of a different drug
that just got approved.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.890
But this is another basal cell carcinoma or
brain cancer.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:02.980
Medulla blastoma, two weeks later specific
against this hedgehog gene pathway and then

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:08.680
you have no evidence of cancer in over 85%
of people just to prove.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.050
The problem we have in cancer today, is to
do this, we like to have, uh, the tissue to

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.569
be able to sequence.

00:42:15.569 --> 00:42:17.049
In fact, get a whole genome sequence.

00:42:17.049 --> 00:42:23.980
But today, the tumor specimen from a biopsy
or a surgery is deposited into formaldehyde

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.420
and itís ruined.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:30.930
So weíd like that on track to just being
FF, which is flash frozen.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.690
So that needs some work.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:39.680
But this cancer improvement, in getting people
to get the right therapy, is on the way.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.089
And then beyond the whole area of cancer there
is many conditions like cystic fibrosis, weíve

00:42:45.089 --> 00:42:48.880
known the gene for many years, but finally
have a breakthrough.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.130
This is a drug called Kalydeco which is just
approved, itís directed against a specific

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:59.930
mutation that causes cystic fibrosis and only
is accounting for, letís say, 3 or 4% of

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.930
cystic fibrosis.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.730
But itís very potent and works exceptionally
well.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:09.430
And then this young girl, who couldnít breathe
hardly at all, she now is, as you see, uh,

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:13.059
very mobile and living a normal life.

00:43:13.059 --> 00:43:17.309
And this drug, as I mentioned, not only did
it just get approved, but it had eureka effect.

00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:21.809
In terms of normalizing things like so called
sweat chloride and beyond that, even more

00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:27.410
importantly, that you could see the impact,
the breathing, the placebo sugar pill versus

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.410
the drug.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:33.770
And here you just see a weight gain of kids,
just dramatic, uh, eureka type effect, which

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:37.040
is great to see in a small number of people.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.780
This is a pretty gory slide, but what is showing
is the drug reaction that can be lethal.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.619
The reactions called the Stevens- Johnson
syndrome and it can be particularly induced

00:43:48.619 --> 00:43:51.980
by a drug Tegretol, which is used commonly.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.559
But now we know the gene that predicts this
and we can prevent someone from dying or having

00:43:55.559 --> 00:43:57.819
to be so sick from this.

00:43:57.819 --> 00:44:02.519
Because one genotype, one basic analysis can
solve that problem.

00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:08.039
And then just last week, I had a op-ed in
the New York Times about statins.

00:44:08.039 --> 00:44:11.019
I donít know if youíre familiar with statins,
itís the most commonly used prescription

00:44:11.019 --> 00:44:12.019
drug.

00:44:12.019 --> 00:44:18.849
But unfortunately, itís overdosing the country
and the side effect of diabetes has been underplayed.

00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:26.010
And this graph just shows that 1 in 255 people,
in respect of any statin thatís been looked

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:31.720
at, get diabetes from these drugs, in the
91,000 patients in all these different trials.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:36.359
But whatís most particularly concerning are
the potent because these are the statins that

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:38.480
have the particular liability.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.819
And these are like Crestor, Lipitor, high
doses of Simvastatin and those are the ones

00:44:42.819 --> 00:44:44.099
to be on the look- out.

00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:49.259
But yet, we donít know the genes, the variation
of the genes that are accounting for this

00:44:49.259 --> 00:44:50.339
problem.

00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:54.869
Now one other area, just to touch on, about
digitizing people, and thatís imaging.

00:44:54.869 --> 00:45:02.249
Now, the stethoscope was invented in 1816,
this is that cartoon of Rene Laennec and that

00:45:02.249 --> 00:45:04.730
stethoscope doesnít look like that anymore,
thank goodness.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.109
It looks like this.

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:13.770
But we donít need a stethoscope, for example,
to listen to the heart because we have a portable,

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:19.039
high resolution ultra sound device that fits
right in the pocket better than a stethoscope.

00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:24.990
And this device, and in just a minute, you
can capture exactly what the heart looks like.

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:31.380
And this is, uh, you know, an amazing tool
because we can basically digitize the personís

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:36.109
heart in a minute or two, and no longer are
we listening to ìlub dubî which isnít really

00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:39.049
that informative when you can see everything.

00:45:39.049 --> 00:45:43.569
This is a normal heart, and hereís an example
of a very sick heart, where you see much less

00:45:43.569 --> 00:45:47.359
ability of the heart muscle to contract, all
the chambers of the heart are very dilated,

00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:49.539
thereís a lot less blood flow moving.

00:45:49.539 --> 00:45:53.470
Just to give you a sense, these are images
that are acquired in a minute and they can

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:58.650
be not just of the heart, the abdomen, they
can be of the fetus, for a pregnant woman.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:02.849
All sorts of things that we can do, we couldnít
do just a year or two ago.

00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:07.920
The thing that perhaps you might find the
most interesting, perhaps scary, is the ability

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.330
to read your mind.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.819
And the idea that we can read, see the movies
in your brain.

00:46:13.819 --> 00:46:20.759
You say, ìWell, that canít possibly be.î
And about imagining, this is not just mind

00:46:20.759 --> 00:46:22.750
boggling, this is mind blowing.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:28.089
This is now the ability to construct brain
activation maps from functional magnetic residents

00:46:28.089 --> 00:46:30.160
imagining of the brain.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:36.049
And we can digitize brains, and best exemplified
by this UC Berkley study published last fall,

00:46:36.049 --> 00:46:42.930
where they took people, young people like
you, put them in a magnetic residence imagining,

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:48.140
showed them a U2 video, and then they without
any knowledge of the video they tried to construct

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.390
what the individual was seeing in their brain.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:51.920
This is what it looked like.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.780
You say, ìWell, that doesnít really like
Steve Martin.î Or, ìIt doesnít look like

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.930
that.î But you know what, thatís pretty
good not knowing anything about the video.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.460
And this is, you know, vintage 2011.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:07.640
Whatís that gonna look like in 2013 or 2015?

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.130
And they just recently published the same
sort of thing with auditory signals they can

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:16.630
reconstruct the music or whatever the sound
was through the same type of technique.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:21.220
So, I just wanna, last couple minutes, put
this together.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.970
This is the, uh, crack to try to get in your
mind.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:28.119
This is why people die; they have a crack
in their artery.

00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:32.220
Whether itís a crack in their artery of their
heart or to their brain that causes a stroke.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.160
And a crack is something we havenít been
able to diagnose.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.430
This is, has been elusive.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.640
We havenít been able to digitize the people
who are gonna have a crack.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:48.400
Uh, Tim Russert was in the NBC studio and
he collapsed, had a massive heart attack.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:55.359
But two weeks before that he had a normal
treadmill test, common scenario.

00:47:55.359 --> 00:47:58.089
Now why did that happen and why is it so common?

00:47:58.089 --> 00:48:01.849
Because we do these treadmill tests all the
time, but they only tell us if thereís a

00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:04.720
tight narrowing thatís blocking the blood
supply.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.279
Most cracks occur where there isnít a tight
narrowing, and we havenít had any way to

00:48:09.279 --> 00:48:10.279
diagnose that.

00:48:10.279 --> 00:48:14.430
Well now, we have done a study where, in the
San Diego area, weíve had all of the heart

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:18.770
attack people, we got blood samples in the
early minutes to find the cells that were

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.569
sloughing off from their artery.

00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:25.529
We found them, identified them, sequenced
them and have all kinds of genomics that weíve

00:48:25.529 --> 00:48:30.140
done and weíve shown that that is a unique
signature that we can detect.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.279
And, in fact, weíre publishing on that in
just a couple weeks in a leading journal.

00:48:34.279 --> 00:48:39.729
So, this is important because then we can
combine this and develop within embedded sensor.

00:48:39.729 --> 00:48:44.089
We have all these embedded sensors in our
car, well, I think our bodies are more important

00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:45.369
than our car.

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:48.460
And you probably take all that stuff for granted
because youíve never been sick.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:52.460
But, those of us that have been sick would
like to have an embedded sensor to prevent

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.420
significant illness.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:49:00.519
And this is a chip that was just published
on at Stanford, not far away of course.

00:49:00.519 --> 00:49:04.980
A microchip that you can put in the blood
to detect whatever you want, we have also

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:09.630
been working on a nanochip the size of a gran--,
grain of sand just like this.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:14.339
You take the grain of sand nano sensor and
you put it in the blood, like in the wrist,

00:49:14.339 --> 00:49:18.380
and then you have this molecular signature
of a heart attack, and guess what you have?

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.970
You have the new app for heart attack.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:26.579
Or, alternatively, an app for detecting the
first cancer cell in the blood, since most

00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:28.570
cancers have a vascular supply.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:35.549
And, of course, for diabetes it takes five
years to become a diabetic that is, uh, immune-mediated

00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:40.650
diabetes you could detect in that five year
stretch to prevent diabetes, or prevent things

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.950
like a transplant rejection.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:47.549
Here is a cell phone, becoming center stage
for the future of health because of this embedded

00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:48.549
sensor capability.

00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:53.869
So, the last thing that I just want to mention
is consumers needing to drive this.

00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:56.920
Thatís actually why I put this book together.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:03.640
Because this is a real opportunity that would
be left in a stasis mode unless we get moving.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.829
And, uh, to me itís just remarkable.

00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:12.489
This is in January in the Wall Street Journal
and it was a survey report of physicians using

00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:13.489
e-mail.

00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:16.109
E-mailís been around a long time, even before
Google.

00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:19.200
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: And Iíve been using e-mail

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.279
with patients since ninety, I donít know,
ë93,í94.

00:50:22.279 --> 00:50:24.229
I donít what, you know.

00:50:24.229 --> 00:50:28.759
This is amazing, we had had 62% of physicians
refuse to use e-mail with their patients,

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:30.970
today, itís 2012.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.019
This is an amazing article from JAMA, the
leading journal in medicine.

00:50:35.019 --> 00:50:39.380
It says, ìShould patients have access to
their laboratory tests?î Well, sorry to say

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.390
itís their laboratory tests, how can they
ask this question?

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.400
How about this one?

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.210
This is, ìShould patients have access to
their office notes, from the doctor?î How

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:50.890
could you ask that question?

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:55.029
Just because it might say in the note, that
the patient, that, uh, had something about

00:50:55.029 --> 00:50:58.920
SOB and it means shortness of breath, you
know, eventually the person should figure

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.769
that out, of course, maybe need a little bit
of guidance.

00:51:01.769 --> 00:51:07.069
Thereís this fellow, who is in the Bay area,
Hugo Campos, who has a defibrillator, he just

00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:10.339
wants to get his data of his heart rhythm
from the company and they wonít let him have

00:51:10.339 --> 00:51:11.339
it.

00:51:11.339 --> 00:51:14.930
And, heís on a tear, appropriately, he should
get his data.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.249
And then the worst of all is the American
Medical Association.

00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:23.460
They are lobbying the government to prevent
people from getting there DNA data.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:28.460
They only want doctors to be the ones to privy
to that data to mediate giving that to patients.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:33.420
Which, of course, thatís not, thatís I think,
violating the rights of the individuals.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.400
So thatís the right to the emergence of citizen
scientists.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.809
And thatís, I think, a great thing.

00:51:37.809 --> 00:51:39.079
And this just came out.

00:51:39.079 --> 00:51:41.680
I just saw this this morning.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:48.049
This is a group at McGill in Canada, and they
have gamified, uh, the use of sequencing.

00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:52.910
Itís very difficult to align sequences, and
they made it into a game, a video game, and

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:56.300
they have found that people with no scientific
background could actually figure out how to

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:00.740
align sequences and make it into a fun puzzle,
and thatís amazing.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:06.579
Just to me, that you could take these sequences
and make it into a game to assemble genomes.

00:52:06.579 --> 00:52:09.230
And that kind of gives you a sense of where
the world could go.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:15.109
So, I leave you with this last, uh, thought,
which is that, itís your charts, office notes,

00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:20.539
your laboratory tests, your scan results,
your bio sensor data, your DNA, your tissue,

00:52:20.539 --> 00:52:23.769
your social network, thatís the way medicine
should be.

00:52:23.769 --> 00:52:29.010
And since all this data is gonna be now going
into high gear, your ability to access it,

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:33.740
this is, uh, the time for the, the individual
to rise.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.369
And thatís whatís gonna be necessary to
really execute the future of medicine.

00:52:37.369 --> 00:52:43.200
So, I just, the whole thing putting it together,
we have this old Voltaire medicine today.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.359
And we can change that by really bringing
together the new tools that Iíve reviewed

00:52:46.359 --> 00:52:49.529
in digital medicine with the digital infrastructure.

00:52:49.529 --> 00:52:54.229
And that could lead to super conversions,
the biggest in our history, and then of course,

00:52:54.229 --> 00:52:58.040
to this new participatory precise medicine
of the future.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.839
So I hope I can leave here with this concept
that was the whole goal, that the future is

00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:03.369
indeed bright.

00:53:03.369 --> 00:53:05.900
Thanks a lot for your attention.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.640
[Applause]

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:16.430
&gt;&gt;male presenter: So what should ordinary
people, um, like non, non, uh, medical people

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.569
do?

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:24.499
Is it now up to us to somehow figure out that
we need to not sign the consent forms before

00:53:24.499 --> 00:53:28.990
having our brain surgery until they change
it to say, ìWe will not put your tumor in

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.990
formaldehyde.î

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.990
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Yeah.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:37.640
I think that, well if you, if you today demand
to your doctor that I want some of my specimen,

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:43.809
I want my motherís specimen to be put in
freezer, they have to do that, so, but only

00:53:43.809 --> 00:53:44.809
if you know about it.

00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:48.440
So, thatís really part of the problem is
it isnít even on the consent form, itís

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.670
just a matter of knowledge.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:55.700
And that is what we have a big problem, is
people just not aware of the opportunity that

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.700
exists today.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:03.900
&gt;&gt;male #1: Are there, um, any sensors to do
with things coming into the body or what youíre

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.309
coming in contact with.

00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:09.690
So, I would think, something that monitored
air quality, that monitored, monitored what

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:13.560
was in the food you ate, that monitored what
chemicals that came in contact with your skin,

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.299
and that way you could see correlations between
what people came in contact with and the actual

00:54:18.299 --> 00:54:20.479
symptoms they had or the diseases they had.

00:54:20.479 --> 00:54:21.640
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Yes, great point.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.660
Um, so for asthma, a sensor of the future
that some people are working on, is one that

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:32.079
will pick up air quality as well as these
other things that you, put, um, youíd be

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:36.470
able to prevent an asthma attack, which, of
course, can be lethal particularly in children.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:37.470
So thatís one example.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:42.950
But youíre absolutely right, because, you
know what we take in our food stuff effects

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.150
our micro biome.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:50.130
And so, for example, over lunch we were talking
about, ìIs it all about a story of calories

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:51.430
in calories out?

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:57.469
Absolutely not because thereís a micro biome,
you know we have this, um, millions of different,

00:54:57.469 --> 00:55:02.569
uh, bacterial flora organisms in our gut,
which are changed by our diet.

00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:07.430
And also by taking antibiotics for example,
and that has an reaction of, in some people,

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:12.440
uh, pushing them towards obesity or changing
their metabolism, or making them at risk for

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.200
diabetes or other named diseases.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.180
So youíre absolutely right, we need to get
that data, itís not just what you excrete

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.819
or what makes you tick.

00:55:20.819 --> 00:55:23.339
Itís also your exposome, your environment.

00:55:23.339 --> 00:55:28.980
And that includes food, you know, um, air
and your water, all those sorts of things.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.640
So itís a great point.

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.640
Thank you.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.640
Yeah.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.489
&gt;&gt;male #2: Uh, in the uh, early 2000ís, I
asked a family friend whoís also a doctor,

00:55:37.489 --> 00:55:41.719
about the fad that came out at that time about
doing whole body MRI scans.

00:55:41.719 --> 00:55:46.150
And, uh, and he basically said, ìDonít do
it.î Heís like, ìThe problem is that youíll

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:50.039
find all sorts of things that are wrong with
you, that probably would do more harm than

00:55:50.039 --> 00:55:51.039
good to treat.î
[Laughter]

00:55:51.039 --> 00:55:52.039
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Yeah.

00:55:52.039 --> 00:55:54.650
&gt;&gt;male #2: And I think we see the same thing
with like mammography, the recent debate thatís

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:56.480
been going on with that.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:01.490
So, I guess this isnít really a good argument
for not collecting the data, but it is, I

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:04.580
think, a need for how do you analyze it?

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.430
Or do you have any insights into where the
thresholds are for when you actually should

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:09.430
take action?

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.359
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Right, see youíre bringing
up some central concepts here.

00:56:12.359 --> 00:56:18.819
The ability to, uh, engender the incidentalome,
where you basically back into findings just

00:56:18.819 --> 00:56:21.990
because you shouldnít have done the test
in the first place, thatís one thing.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:26.739
So more judicious use of the right tests for
the right person, uh, you know, a lot of people

00:56:26.739 --> 00:56:30.569
just sign up for the total body CAT scan and
their just asking for trouble.

00:56:30.569 --> 00:56:36.230
And, like you also brought up with the mammography,
thereís a much higher rate of false biopsies,

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:41.130
positive biopsies and getting women and their
families, you know, horrified than there is

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:42.680
of preventing cancer.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:49.900
So the odds of getting a true abnormal biopsy
is much lower than getting a false positive.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.259
So these are, we need much more precise tools.

00:56:53.259 --> 00:56:55.460
Who should get the studies or procedures?

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.160
And how to interpret them.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:03.039
And part of it is this whole Bayesian thing
that the test or procedure is only good if

00:57:03.039 --> 00:57:05.789
itís being done on the right person.

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:09.380
Hopefully in the future weíre gonna pick
the right people and not have all these incidental

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.019
findings which wind up causing all kinds of
trouble.

00:57:12.019 --> 00:57:15.969
&gt;&gt;male #2: So do you think, though, that it
is a matter of not having precise enough tools,

00:57:15.969 --> 00:57:20.420
or could it be that even if you have all the
information you still are in a situation where

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.970
youíre not sure if itís a problem or not?

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:25.259
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Well, thatís a great point.

00:57:25.259 --> 00:57:31.989
Uh, I think it, a lot of it is the imprecision
of people having things done that just doesnít

00:57:31.989 --> 00:57:37.250
have any, itís just, uh, this mass medicine
problem that we have today.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:41.739
But there still is an issue, so for example,
when you have a whole genome sequence, youíre

00:57:41.739 --> 00:57:45.560
doing it for, letís say weíre trying to
unravel that 15-year-old girlís story and

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.630
we find these other things in there that we
didnít anticipate, what do we do with that?

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:55.979
See, whenever you have a lot of data, the
chance of you coming into things, uh, in unintended

00:57:55.979 --> 00:57:57.630
way is gonna be there.

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.130
So this is an issue that has to be grappled
with.

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:02.339
Youíre bringing up a very important, um,
concern.

00:58:02.339 --> 00:58:03.339
Yeah.

00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:06.719
&gt;&gt;female #1: Well on that note, thanks so
much for coming.

00:58:06.719 --> 00:58:08.190
You left us with a lot to think about.

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:09.190
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Sure, Yeah.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.190
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thanks.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:11.190
&gt;&gt;Eric Topol: Thank you, thanks a lot.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.191
[Applause]
