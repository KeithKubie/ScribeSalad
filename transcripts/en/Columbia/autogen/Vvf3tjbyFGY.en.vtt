00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.420
who thought of this I guess it was our
style of in fact someone like that but

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430
style of in fact someone like that but
 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.610
style of in fact someone like that but
but that was the idea you know and I

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
but that was the idea you know and I
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.140
but that was the idea you know and I
thought well that this is really great I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
thought well that this is really great I
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.970
thought well that this is really great I
and I enjoyed the class and I got to be

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980
and I enjoyed the class and I got to be
 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.430
and I enjoyed the class and I got to be
sort of friendly with with how it was

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440
sort of friendly with with how it was
 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.290
sort of friendly with with how it was
only like 10 years older than me in fact

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300
only like 10 years older than me in fact
 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.690
only like 10 years older than me in fact
maybe 15 and then he convinced me to

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700
maybe 15 and then he convinced me to
 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.190
maybe 15 and then he convinced me to
take another class that he was teaching

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200
take another class that he was teaching
 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.410
take another class that he was teaching
also an animal

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420
also an animal
 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.240
also an animal
behavior which I did and I enjoyed and

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
behavior which I did and I enjoyed and
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.250
behavior which I did and I enjoyed and
then he somehow or another I can't

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260
then he somehow or another I can't
 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.839
then he somehow or another I can't
actually recollect to this day how he

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849
actually recollect to this day how he
 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.390
actually recollect to this day how he
did it kind of buttered me up and said

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
did it kind of buttered me up and said
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.040
did it kind of buttered me up and said
well you know you're good at this you

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050
well you know you're good at this you
 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.199
well you know you're good at this you
should take a classes you take a degree

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
should take a classes you take a degree
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.819
should take a classes you take a degree
in biology and you could do research

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829
in biology and you could do research
 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.159
in biology and you could do research
with me I think that was his idea that I

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
with me I think that was his idea that I
 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.039
with me I think that was his idea that I
would do research with him so I did and

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
would do research with him so I did and
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.700
would do research with him so I did and
I somehow or another sort of taking

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
I somehow or another sort of taking
 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.740
I somehow or another sort of taking
classes in biology and that's what I did

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
classes in biology and that's what I did
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.490
classes in biology and that's what I did
for the next three or four years and I

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
for the next three or four years and I
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.960
for the next three or four years and I
wound up with an undergraduate degree in

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970
wound up with an undergraduate degree in
 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.909
wound up with an undergraduate degree in
biology which is we all now know is

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919
biology which is we all now know is
 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.320
biology which is we all now know is
completely worthless really so terrible

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330
completely worthless really so terrible
 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.390
completely worthless really so terrible
thing maybe that should be okay okay

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400
thing maybe that should be okay okay
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.700
thing maybe that should be okay okay
well it's worthless in the sense that I

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710
well it's worthless in the sense that I
 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.920
well it's worthless in the sense that I
think what it really sets you up it's

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
think what it really sets you up it's
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.150
think what it really sets you up it's
one of those degrees one of those

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160
one of those degrees one of those
 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.980
one of those degrees one of those
undergraduate degrees like most science

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
undergraduate degrees like most science
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.140
undergraduate degrees like most science
degrees are that really sets you up to

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150
degrees are that really sets you up to
 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.020
degrees are that really sets you up to
go on to do postgraduate work so a

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030
go on to do postgraduate work so a
 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.790
go on to do postgraduate work so a
little old for medical school and really

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800
little old for medical school and really
 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.110
little old for medical school and really
wasn't all that interested in medicine

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120
wasn't all that interested in medicine
 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.180
wasn't all that interested in medicine
or sick people or any of that kind of

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190
or sick people or any of that kind of
 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.640
or sick people or any of that kind of
stuff but I did like research and so I

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650
stuff but I did like research and so I
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.640
stuff but I did like research and so I
thought well graduate school I guess so

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650
thought well graduate school I guess so
 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.010
thought well graduate school I guess so
so this really was a choice point for me

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020
so this really was a choice point for me
 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.490
so this really was a choice point for me
I suppose I i thought well i can either

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500
I suppose I i thought well i can either

of odd I was a full-time day student

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110
of odd I was a full-time day student
 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.690

an odd reversal but but I don't know a

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669
an odd reversal but but I don't know a

pretty regularly so I finished a
 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.740
pretty regularly so I finished a

get through this career in time that
 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.530
get through this career in time that
there could be a couple of years between

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540
there could be a couple of years between
 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.170
there could be a couple of years between
10 urine and emeritus you know to try to

10 urine and emeritus you know to try to
 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.570
10 urine and emeritus you know to try to
enjoy this a bit so so I did that and

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580
enjoy this a bit so so I did that and
 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.520
enjoy this a bit so so I did that and
then I wound up getting a very nice

then I wound up getting a very nice
 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.950
then I wound up getting a very nice

faculty have been at Columbia for many
years and who knew precisely what the

years and who knew precisely what the
 

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:19.170
years and who knew precisely what the
shortcomings were and what the what the

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.180
shortcomings were and what the what the
 

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.960

what the real love what the greatness of
the university was built on and the fact

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:24.949
the university was built on and the fact
 

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:27.280
the university was built on and the fact
that science wasn't fully participating

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:27.290
that science wasn't fully participating
 

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.759
that science wasn't fully participating
in that and so that so they had this was

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:30.769
in that and so that so they had this was
 

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:33.100
in that and so that so they had this was
real motivation to do that and I a

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.110
real motivation to do that and I a
 

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.079
real motivation to do that and I a
tremendous amount of credit goes to them

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:35.089
tremendous amount of credit goes to them
 

00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:37.030
tremendous amount of credit goes to them
for that because they pulled this course

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040
for that because they pulled this course
 

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.369
for that because they pulled this course

but whatever what the form should take
 

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:52.900
but whatever what the form should take
and what it shouldn't take and now i've

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:52.910
and what it shouldn't take and now i've
 

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.329
and what it shouldn't take and now i've
taught in it for a few years and now

taught in it for a few years and now
 

00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:56.679

it's sort of our view and i'm actually

00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:56.689
it's sort of our view and i'm actually
 

00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:59.740
it's sort of our view and i'm actually
on the committee on instruction so one

of these will do is review it and it's

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:06.500
of these will do is review it and it's
 

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.769

it's not a trivial issue exactly how to

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:08.779
it's not a trivial issue exactly how to
 

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.150
it's not a trivial issue exactly how to
work it i mean i think there are parts

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160
work it i mean i think there are parts
 

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.889
work it i mean i think there are parts
of it that work and there are parts of

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:11.899
of it that work and there are parts of
 

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:13.240
of it that work and there are parts of
it that don't work the parts of it the

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.250
it that don't work the parts of it the
 

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.920
it that don't work the parts of it the
work seem to be the big lecture things

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:14.930
work seem to be the big lecture things
 

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.069

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759
and put together these three or four two
 

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:26.350
and put together these three or four two
three four lectures in their field but

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360
three four lectures in their field but
 

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.509
three four lectures in their field but
making their field accessible and I

making their field accessible and I
 

00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:30.220
making their field accessible and I

think that alone aside from what it may
 

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.749
think that alone aside from what it may
do for the students which of course is

do for the students which of course is
 

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.850
do for the students which of course is
still the primary thing but that alone

still the primary thing but that alone
 

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.470
still the primary thing but that alone
is I think an important thing because

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480
is I think an important thing because
 

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.960
is I think an important thing because
you actually enlist faculty who usually

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:37.970
you actually enlist faculty who usually
 

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.970
you actually enlist faculty who usually
spend all their time varying in the lab

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:39.980
spend all their time varying in the lab
 

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.679

and buried in their field and worried
 

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:43.929

about the next paper of the next grant

about the next paper of the next grant

and all the rest of this and the
 

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.650

competition you get them to take a pause

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:47.660
competition you get them to take a pause
 

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.900
competition you get them to take a pause
and think about how to put their work

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:49.910
and think about how to put their work
 

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.910
and think about how to put their work
out there for mostly lay audience a

in any way prepared and just the
 

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.040
in any way prepared and just the
exercise of doing that I think is for

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.050
exercise of doing that I think is for
 

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.220
exercise of doing that I think is for
many of us and very important and will

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:06.230
many of us and very important and will
 

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.610
many of us and very important and will
make people who have done it very useful

I who's the expert at Columbia and we'll
have an expert as we build this group up

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519
have an expert as we build this group up
 

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.920

we'll have experts who know how to talk

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:29.930
we'll have experts who know how to talk

to the to the public about what's going
 

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:33.819
to the to the public about what's going
on what they're doing i which i think is

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:33.829
on what they're doing i which i think is
 

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:36.100
on what they're doing i which i think is
a critical issue so in that sense I

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.110
a critical issue so in that sense I
 

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.150
a critical issue so in that sense I
think the course has been very

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160
think the course has been very
 

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.009
think the course has been very
successful I think it's been good for

00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:39.019
successful I think it's been good for
 

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:41.740
successful I think it's been good for
the students to see the kind of depth it

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:41.750
the students to see the kind of depth it
 

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.240
the students to see the kind of depth it
that researching goes on in Columbia you

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.250
that researching goes on in Columbia you
 

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.660
that researching goes on in Columbia you
know the way at them the way it happens

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:49.670
know the way at them the way it happens
 

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.280
know the way at them the way it happens
here and then the depth of it and the

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.290
here and then the depth of it and the
 

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.079
here and then the depth of it and the
breadth of it and the people that are

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:53.089
breadth of it and the people that are
 

00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:56.259
breadth of it and the people that are
involved a little less successful as I

00:16:56.259 --> 00:16:56.269
involved a little less successful as I
 

00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:58.150
involved a little less successful as I
understand that from the student reports

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160
understand that from the student reports
 

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.579
understand that from the student reports
are the sort of individual meetings the

00:17:00.579 --> 00:17:00.589
are the sort of individual meetings the
 

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:03.250
are the sort of individual meetings the
classes that meet once a week for two

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:03.260
classes that meet once a week for two
 

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.559
classes that meet once a week for two
hours and smaller group so the lectures

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:05.569
hours and smaller group so the lectures
 

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:06.850
hours and smaller group so the lectures
are given the groups of five hundred

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:06.860
are given the groups of five hundred
 

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.590
are given the groups of five hundred
students so what you can do with that

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600
students so what you can do with that
 

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.230
students so what you can do with that
and then the ideas that they meet and do

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240
and then the ideas that they meet and do
 

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.210
and then the ideas that they meet and do
activities or discussions or this or

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:13.220
activities or discussions or this or
 

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.189
activities or discussions or this or
that based on the lectures themselves

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199
that based on the lectures themselves
 

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:17.140
that based on the lectures themselves
and that seems to at the moment be the

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.150
and that seems to at the moment be the
 

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.329
and that seems to at the moment be the
weak part of the course its weak on

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:19.339
weak part of the course its weak on
 

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.100
weak part of the course its weak on
several accounts i think it's also the

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.110
several accounts i think it's also the
 

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.880
several accounts i think it's also the
most labor-intensive it's the most

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:24.890
most labor-intensive it's the most
 

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.760
most labor-intensive it's the most
difficult for the course organizers to

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:27.770
difficult for the course organizers to
 

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.890
difficult for the course organizers to
get organized to enlist all the people

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:29.900
get organized to enlist all the people
 

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.980
get organized to enlist all the people
to do it uses up a lot of faculty and so

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:32.990
to do it uses up a lot of faculty and so
 

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.990
to do it uses up a lot of faculty and so
it's the part of the course that uses

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000
it's the part of the course that uses
 

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.960
it's the part of the course that uses
the most resources but as may be and

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:37.970
the most resources but as may be and
 

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.000
the most resources but as may be and
therefore has to give out impact the

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.010
therefore has to give out impact the
 

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.190
therefore has to give out impact the
most i think but is probably not doing

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200
most i think but is probably not doing
 

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.789
most i think but is probably not doing
that at the moment so i think i will

00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799
that at the moment so i think i will
 

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:47.560
that at the moment so i think i will
figure out how to fix that eventually i

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:47.570
figure out how to fix that eventually i
 

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.500
figure out how to fix that eventually i
don't know how i don't know how okay to

don't know how i don't know how okay to
 

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.880
don't know how i don't know how okay to
tell you the truth i mean there are a

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:51.890
tell you the truth i mean there are a
 

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.799
tell you the truth i mean there are a
lot of ideas around i have some ideas

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:53.809
lot of ideas around i have some ideas
 

00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:57.010

Donovan a little bit too is that they're

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080
Donovan a little bit too is that they're
 

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.780
Donovan a little bit too is that they're
very open to this I mean it's their baby

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:04.790
very open to this I mean it's their baby
 

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.299

this is the best of the list of paper
weight and this is actually a model that

was made for sculpting students it's a

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:02.510
was made for sculpting students it's a
 

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.710

it's considered the most perfect version
 

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.530
it's considered the most perfect version
of it and so art students are supposed

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:11.540
of it and so art students are supposed

to copy it was a paperweight but that's

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.210
to copy it was a paperweight but that's
 

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:20.350
to copy it was a paperweight but that's
our anyway so we use the nose as most

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360
our anyway so we use the nose as most
 

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.110
our anyway so we use the nose as most
scientists do as what we call a model

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120
scientists do as what we call a model
 

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.500

sit there and look at it and try to
 

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.310
sit there and look at it and try to
figure out how it works this is really

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320
figure out how it works this is really
 

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.610
figure out how it works this is really
difficult so one looks for simpler

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:51.620
difficult so one looks for simpler
 

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.400

for now just 100 years ago and that was

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.390
for now just 100 years ago and that was
 

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.880
for now just 100 years ago and that was
the beginning of genetics I mean in

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:16.890
the beginning of genetics I mean in
 

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.799
the beginning of genetics I mean in
genetics is still a pretty big field and

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:18.809
genetics is still a pretty big field and
 

00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:20.210
genetics is still a pretty big field and
it all sort of with fruit flies and

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220
it all sort of with fruit flies and
 

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.029
it all sort of with fruit flies and
indeed there's still thousands of people

00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039
indeed there's still thousands of people
 

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:25.430
indeed there's still thousands of people
to work on fruit fly genetics which we

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440
to work on fruit fly genetics which we
 

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.340
to work on fruit fly genetics which we
continue to learn a great deal because

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:28.350
continue to learn a great deal because
 

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.560
continue to learn a great deal because
it turns out that a lot of fruit fly

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:30.570
it turns out that a lot of fruit fly
 

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.960
it turns out that a lot of fruit fly
jeans we actually have them to you know

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:32.970
jeans we actually have them to you know
 

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.330
jeans we actually have them to you know
I mean they have legs they have heads

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.340
I mean they have legs they have heads
 

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.909
I mean they have legs they have heads
you know I understand that wings and we

00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919
you know I understand that wings and we
 

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:40.070
you know I understand that wings and we
don't but birds have wings you know and

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080
don't but birds have wings you know and
 

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.779
don't but birds have wings you know and
it takes genes to make all those things

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:41.789
it takes genes to make all those things
 

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:43.279
it takes genes to make all those things
and oddly enough it takes many of the

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:43.289
and oddly enough it takes many of the
 

00:20:43.289 --> 00:20:47.210
and oddly enough it takes many of the
same genes so anyway so it's true when

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220
same genes so anyway so it's true when
 

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.430
same genes so anyway so it's true when
you work on simpler organisms to more

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440
you work on simpler organisms to more
 

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.010
you work on simpler organisms to more
complicated ones and that we all believe

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020
complicated ones and that we all believe
 

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.710
complicated ones and that we all believe
because we all believe in evolution and

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720
because we all believe in evolution and
 

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.680
because we all believe in evolution and
so there's a continuity in life and

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:57.690
so there's a continuity in life and
 

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.529
so there's a continuity in life and
therefore even though we have a bigger

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539
therefore even though we have a bigger
 

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:02.600
therefore even though we have a bigger
brain we have a hundred billion brain

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:02.610
brain we have a hundred billion brain
 

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.570
brain we have a hundred billion brain
cells each one of those brain cells is

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580
cells each one of those brain cells is
 

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.169
cells each one of those brain cells is
not so very different from the 302 brain

00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179
not so very different from the 302 brain
 

00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:12.250
not so very different from the 302 brain
cells that you find in a little tiny

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:12.260

nematode worm that many people work on

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760
nematode worm that many people work on
 

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.180
nematode worm that many people work on

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.070
studying is one of those we work on my
laboratory so there are two important

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080
laboratory so there are two important
 

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.350
laboratory so there are two important
questions there one is how do you make

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360
questions there one is how do you make
 

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.540
questions there one is how do you make
new neurons so there are stem cells stem

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:47.550
new neurons so there are stem cells stem
 

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.240
new neurons so there are stem cells stem
cells a big word now there's usual

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:50.250
cells a big word now there's usual
 

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.890
cells a big word now there's usual
operas in this case there are these are

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900
operas in this case there are these are
 

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.110
operas in this case there are these are
not the stem cells of embryonic stem

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120
not the stem cells of embryonic stem
 

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.250
not the stem cells of embryonic stem
cells which could turn into anything

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260
cells which could turn into anything
 

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.170
cells which could turn into anything
these are neural stem cells the only

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:57.180
these are neural stem cells the only
 

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.210
these are neural stem cells the only
thing they can become as neurons and at

00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220
thing they can become as neurons and at
 

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.410
thing they can become as neurons and at
the moment the only link it becomes

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:00.420
the moment the only link it becomes
 

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.270
the moment the only link it becomes
olfactory neurons but nonetheless they

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280
olfactory neurons but nonetheless they
 

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.460
olfactory neurons but nonetheless they
sit there in the brain and continue to

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:04.470
sit there in the brain and continue to
 

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.820
sit there in the brain and continue to
divide and make noon olfactory neurons

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:06.830
divide and make noon olfactory neurons
 

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.990
divide and make noon olfactory neurons
so one thing we could know is how do

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000
so one thing we could know is how do
 

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.930
so one thing we could know is how do
they do that and could we reprogram them

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940
they do that and could we reprogram them
 

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.250
they do that and could we reprogram them
to make a different kind of neurons

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260
to make a different kind of neurons
 

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.410
to make a different kind of neurons
saying neuron that that squirted out

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:15.420
saying neuron that that squirted out
 

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.630
saying neuron that that squirted out
dopamine and could be used to replace

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640
dopamine and could be used to replace
 

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.430
dopamine and could be used to replace
the neurons we lose in Parkinson's

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440
the neurons we lose in Parkinson's
 

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.110
the neurons we lose in Parkinson's
disease and that would perhaps cure

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120
disease and that would perhaps cure
 

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.460
disease and that would perhaps cure
Parkinson's so how do they proliferate

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:24.470
Parkinson's so how do they proliferate
 

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.320
Parkinson's so how do they proliferate
how do they proliferate and most

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:27.330
how do they proliferate and most
 

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.450
how do they proliferate and most
importantly is how do they integrate

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460
importantly is how do they integrate
 

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.340
importantly is how do they integrate
into an already mature brain so that

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:33.350
into an already mature brain so that
 

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.860
into an already mature brain so that
what smells to you like a rose today

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:35.870
what smells to you like a rose today
 

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.390

how to do this and that's critical
 

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.220
how to do this and that's critical
because it doesn't do any good to just

because it doesn't do any good to just
 

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.410
because it doesn't do any good to just
figure out how to make neuro because you

they have to get into the right place

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260
they have to get into the right place
 

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.780
they have to get into the right place
you can't just take a Cell Stem Cell

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:14.790
you can't just take a Cell Stem Cell
 

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.880
you can't just take a Cell Stem Cell
that wants to divide and become neuron

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:16.890
that wants to divide and become neuron

just stick in someone's brain you're

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:18.210
just stick in someone's brain you're

just going to tumor you know that won't
do you any good so you have to figure

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:21.990
do you any good so you have to figure
 

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.900
do you any good so you have to figure
out how to make new cells and how

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:23.910
out how to make new cells and how
 

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.850
out how to make new cells and how
integrate them into an existing mature

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860
integrate them into an existing mature
 

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.250
integrate them into an existing mature
brain and I think the olfactory system

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260
brain and I think the olfactory system
 

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.350

at least is one place to bring where

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360
at least is one place to bring where
 

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.020
at least is one place to bring where
that goes on every day of our lives so

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.030
that goes on every day of our lives so
 

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.460
that goes on every day of our lives so
it's great system for trying to figure

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:34.470
it's great system for trying to figure
 

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.170
it's great system for trying to figure
them so there's just two of about half a

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:36.180
them so there's just two of about half a
 

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.360
them so there's just two of about half a
dozen or more questions and I think we

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:38.370
dozen or more questions and I think we
 

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.220
dozen or more questions and I think we
can get to withhold faction fascinating

science especially undergraduates is
that we just teach them a lot of facts

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.110
that we just teach them a lot of facts
 

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.560
that we just teach them a lot of facts
fill them up with facts and and that's

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:12.570
fill them up with facts and and that's
 

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.030
fill them up with facts and and that's
not trivial it's not the facts are

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.040
not trivial it's not the facts are
 

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.890
not trivial it's not the facts are
important they are and at some staging

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900
important they are and at some staging
 

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.830
important they are and at some staging
to develop as a scientist it's important

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840
to develop as a scientist it's important
 

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.170
to develop as a scientist it's important
to get all these facts down I mean or

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:21.180
to get all these facts down I mean or
 

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.260
to get all these facts down I mean or
some bunch of them and so that's

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.270
some bunch of them and so that's
 

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.510
some bunch of them and so that's
unavoidable but it's not what science is

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520
unavoidable but it's not what science is
 

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.580
unavoidable but it's not what science is
about when I go to a meeting or

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:29.590
about when I go to a meeting or
 

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.860
about when I go to a meeting or
hang out in the lab or you know beat up

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:31.870
hang out in the lab or you know beat up
 

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.360
hang out in the lab or you know beat up
with a scientist pal at a bar or

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.370
with a scientist pal at a bar or
 

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.760
with a scientist pal at a bar or
whatever we never talked about what we

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:35.770
whatever we never talked about what we
 

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.799
whatever we never talked about what we
know we only talk about what we don't

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:37.809
know we only talk about what we don't
 

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:38.940
know we only talk about what we don't
know it's the only thing that's of any

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:38.950
know it's the only thing that's of any
 

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.590
know it's the only thing that's of any
interest to a scientist is what they

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600
interest to a scientist is what they
 

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.560
interest to a scientist is what they
don't know but I was worried that we

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:43.570
don't know but I was worried that we
 

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.350
don't know but I was worried that we
weren't giving our students any sense of

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360
weren't giving our students any sense of
 

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.519
weren't giving our students any sense of
that at all that they just thought

00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:47.529
that at all that they just thought
 

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:49.710
that at all that they just thought
science was some big old fact book and

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720
science was some big old fact book and
 

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.870
science was some big old fact book and
if you just could memorize it that would

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880
if you just could memorize it that would
 

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.710
if you just could memorize it that would
be fine just one sec hi can I call you

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720
be fine just one sec hi can I call you
 

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.500
be fine just one sec hi can I call you
back in just about five or ten minutes

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:57.510
back in just about five or ten minutes
 

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:04.560
back in just about five or ten minutes
okay bye so I thought well maybe to be

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:04.570
okay bye so I thought well maybe to be
 

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.149
okay bye so I thought well maybe to be
interesting to try and I sort of worked

00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159
interesting to try and I sort of worked
 

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:07.320
interesting to try and I sort of worked
it into my home course a little but I

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:07.330
it into my home course a little but I
 

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.240
it into my home course a little but I
would my last lecture I would talk about

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.250
would my last lecture I would talk about
 

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.340
would my last lecture I would talk about
okay now fill you up with all these

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.350
okay now fill you up with all these
 

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.659
okay now fill you up with all these
facts about cell and molecular

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:12.669
facts about cell and molecular
 

00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:14.730
facts about cell and molecular
neuroscience may seem like we know

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:14.740
neuroscience may seem like we know
 

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.350
neuroscience may seem like we know
everything is big thick textbook but

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360
everything is big thick textbook but
 

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.659
everything is big thick textbook but
look really i'm just going to throw out

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:18.669
look really i'm just going to throw out
 

00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:20.610
look really i'm just going to throw out
dozens of questions and tell you we

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:20.620
dozens of questions and tell you we
 

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.630
dozens of questions and tell you we
don't any of these things you know

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640
don't any of these things you know
 

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.279
don't any of these things you know
here's all the stuff we have no idea

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:23.289
here's all the stuff we have no idea
 

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.500
here's all the stuff we have no idea
about and it's a lot more than what we

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:25.510
about and it's a lot more than what we
 

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.510
about and it's a lot more than what we
know that's important because I mean

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520
know that's important because I mean
 

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.810
know that's important because I mean
there's work for you there's a future in

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:30.820
there's work for you there's a future in
 

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.600
there's work for you there's a future in
this you know so then I started thought

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:33.610
this you know so then I started thought
 

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.159
this you know so then I started thought
I thought about maybe we could expand in

00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:35.169
I thought about maybe we could expand in
 

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:36.600
I thought about maybe we could expand in
this course even made expand descent

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:36.610
this course even made expand descent
 

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.860
this course even made expand descent
into a course and so the course

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:37.870
into a course and so the course
 

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.049
into a course and so the course
basically is I only teach it in the

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:40.059
basically is I only teach it in the
 

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:42.659
basically is I only teach it in the
spring and it's only limitation as it's

00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:42.669
spring and it's only limitation as it's
 

00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:49.139
spring and it's only limitation as it's
only excuse me solely for seniors I do

00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:49.149
only excuse me solely for seniors I do
 

00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:50.880
only excuse me solely for seniors I do
that for two reasons why is it's a sort

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:50.890
that for two reasons why is it's a sort
 

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.220
that for two reasons why is it's a sort
of a capstone kind of equality and the

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.230
of a capstone kind of equality and the
 

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.720
of a capstone kind of equality and the
other major reason is that I don't

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:54.730
other major reason is that I don't
 

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.299
other major reason is that I don't
really want to deal with grades and for

00:29:57.299 --> 00:29:57.309
really want to deal with grades and for
 

00:29:57.309 --> 00:30:00.360
really want to deal with grades and for
the most part seniors you know you can't

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:00.370
the most part seniors you know you can't
 

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.460
the most part seniors you know you can't
affect your GPA by very much one way or

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:02.470
affect your GPA by very much one way or
 

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.049
affect your GPA by very much one way or
the other with one course of this matter

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:04.059
the other with one course of this matter
 

00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:05.850
the other with one course of this matter
of a grade they really get and by their

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:05.860
of a grade they really get and by their
 

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.190
of a grade they really get and by their
last semester most of them are already

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200
last semester most of them are already
 

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.460
last semester most of them are already
in graduate school or medical school or

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:11.470
in graduate school or medical school or
 

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.870
in graduate school or medical school or
law school because whatever it is

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880
law school because whatever it is
 

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.029
law school because whatever it is
they're going you know from here they're

00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039
they're going you know from here they're
 

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:17.970
they're going you know from here they're
already got that sort of setup and so

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:17.980
already got that sort of setup and so
 

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.769
already got that sort of setup and so
the grades just don't matter as much and

00:30:19.769 --> 00:30:19.779
the grades just don't matter as much and
 

00:30:19.779 --> 00:30:21.000
the grades just don't matter as much and
so I don't have to worry about the great

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.010
so I don't have to worry about the great
 

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.840
so I don't have to worry about the great
things it's just done up for me so it's

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:24.850
things it's just done up for me so it's
 

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.700
things it's just done up for me so it's
typically a small course a little over

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:26.710
typically a small course a little over
 

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.500
typically a small course a little over
limited but somewhere between 30 and 50

we meet once a week since about 13 or 14
meetings per semester and for about

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:42.520
meetings per semester and for about
 

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.610

invite members of the faculty the

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720
invite members of the faculty the
 

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.960
invite members of the faculty the
science faculty from various departments

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:48.970
science faculty from various departments

science faculty from various departments
to come in one at a time and spend two

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520
to come in one at a time and spend two
 

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.340
to come in one at a time and spend two
hours with the students and tell them

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:53.350
hours with the students and tell them
 

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.520
hours with the students and tell them
all about what they don't know and just

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:56.530
all about what they don't know and just
 

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.169
all about what they don't know and just
talk to them about what it is they don't

00:30:58.169 --> 00:30:58.179
talk to them about what it is they don't
 

00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:00.270
talk to them about what it is they don't
know what they want to know why they're

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:00.280
know what they want to know why they're
 

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.799
know what they want to know why they're
working on this and not that how they

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:01.809
working on this and not that how they
 

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:03.930
working on this and not that how they
came to this question why this is a

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:03.940
came to this question why this is a
 

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.399
came to this question why this is a
critical question when it's more

00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:05.409
critical question when it's more
 

00:31:05.409 --> 00:31:07.080
critical question when it's more
important than that one what will happen

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.090
important than that one what will happen
 

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.549
important than that one what will happen
if you don't know this what will happen

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559
if you don't know this what will happen
 

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:10.980
if you don't know this what will happen
if we do know it etc at center all those

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:10.990
if we do know it etc at center all those
 

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.020
if we do know it etc at center all those
sorts of things and so it's great it's

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.030
sorts of things and so it's great it's
 

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.610
sorts of things and so it's great it's
always a little bit funny and I call

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:14.620
always a little bit funny and I call
 

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.710
always a little bit funny and I call
people up on the phone I say hi so and

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720
people up on the phone I say hi so and
 

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.810
people up on the phone I say hi so and
so listen up teaching this course of

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:18.820
so listen up teaching this course of
 

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.399
so listen up teaching this course of
ignorance and I think you'd be great you

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:20.409
ignorance and I think you'd be great you
 

00:31:20.409 --> 00:31:23.880
ignorance and I think you'd be great you
know so it's always a tricky sort of an

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:23.890
know so it's always a tricky sort of an
 

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.919
know so it's always a tricky sort of an
invitation but but the great thing is

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:25.929
invitation but but the great thing is
 

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:27.299
invitation but but the great thing is
the faculty you're all realized

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:27.309
the faculty you're all realized
 

00:31:27.309 --> 00:31:29.220
the faculty you're all realized
immediately that that's absolutely right

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.230
