00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.560
Not every trait fits neatly into one category

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.670
or another. For example, height is something that

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.800
we can pretty easily identify as being physical,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.580
but something like intelligence is something that's a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.800
little more harder to categorize. Intelligence might be

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.990
something that you describe as behavioral and not

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.560
physical, unless you define it by the number

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.640
or pattern of neuroconnections in the brain In

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.630
which case that might seem more physical. It could also

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.650
be visible or hidden, depending on whether you look at

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.380
the product of intelligence or the abstract nature of it.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.070
It is also still debated how much intelligence may be learned,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.720
or how much of it may be innate. Can you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.600
think of another trait that is hard to define in these

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.090
categories? Try to use a one word answer and remember,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.680
there's no right or wrong response here. Just want to get

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.230
you to think about which traits could be hard to catagorize.
