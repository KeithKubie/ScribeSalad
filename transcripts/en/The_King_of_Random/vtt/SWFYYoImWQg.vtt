00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.730
When it starts to heat up outside and you
need a quick way to cool off, you can hack

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.819
yourself a mini air conditioner by filling
a container with ice-cubes, and simply blowing

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.240
on them. The air blasting back at your face
will be cool and refreshing. But in this project

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.680
we're gonna take the idea one step further, by turning 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.840
a few household items, into an icy air blaster.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.200
To start this project, I picked up one of these necklace fans from a local super center.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.680
These are the kind that just hang around your

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.720
neck and blow air up into your face. But on
a hot day, the air's usually pretty warm. So make an

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.570
"Icy" air blaster let's start by cutting the
lanyard on both sides where it meets the casing.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.720
These won't be of any use to us, and while
we're at it, let's hit it with a few shots

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.200
of spray paint to turn the whole thing black.
That's just going to make it look a whole

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.930
lot cooler. Now we'll need to remove the tops
from a couple of drink cans, and an old school

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.940
can opener is my tool of choice. You can see
that with some gentle pressure, and a bit

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.509
of patience, the top will come right off,
leaving us a nice clean edge to work with.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.880
I cut 2 inches off one of the cans using a
pair of scissors, and got this straight edge

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.520
by making the cut counter-clockwise. At this
point we're ready to add a bit of epoxy or

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.759
hot glue, around the circumference of the
intake hole on the fan. Now, before any glue

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.420
drips down inside, let's go ahead and press
the top of the can into place, holding it

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.420
there until the glue hardens. The mouth of
the can is just big enough that it doesn't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.999
block the fan, but still mounts with an air-tight
seal to the casing.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.729
Now the next thing we're gonna need is a template for punching

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.740
holes in the other can. I made this one, and
you can have it for free by following the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.680
link in the description. It's made especially
for 16oz cans, and after you've cut out the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.640
rectangle, simply wrap it around the can,
and fasten the two end tabs together with

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.420
some tape or a stick of glue. Stand the can
upright, pushing the template to the bottom,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.960
then find something that will poke holes through
aluminum, like a pair of scissors or a metal

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.539
file. When all the holes are punched, simply
remove the template, and your perforated can

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.530
should look something like this. Now when
you're ready for some cool air, just fill

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.619
the can with ice cubes, and gently press the
other piece overtop, until it fits on nice

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.190
and snug. All it takes now is a flick of a
switch, and you're blasting out a steady stream

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.910
of ice cube conditioned air, which will hopefully
buy you a little relief on a hot summers day.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.020
The chilling happens when the fan sucks air
in through the intake ports, up around the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.570
ice cubes, and directs it back at your face.
Now if you wanna go one step further, try

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.080
pushing a straw through one of the holes at
the bottom, then glue it along one side of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.140
the can. This way, when your ice cubes begin
to melt, you'll have a refreshing drink of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.830
ice water to cool you down as well. Well now
you know how to turn left over drink cans

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.350
into mini air conditioners. And while they're
more for a laugh than for anything practical,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.650
the air they blast out really is, nice and
icy. Well that's it for now. If you liked
