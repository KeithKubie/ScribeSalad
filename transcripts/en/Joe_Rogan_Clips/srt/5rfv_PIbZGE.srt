1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,820
The Joe Rogan experience. Um, there,

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,810
there's a real thought,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,080
and this is something that turns
Mckenna described way back in the late

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,710
nineties,
early two thousands.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,780
He believed that you're going to be able
to recreate a lot of psychedelic states

6
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:23,781
through virtual reality so that people
that don't want to actually do a drug

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,740
will be an ideal experience. What it's
like to be on that drug and that, I mean,

8
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,930
that's, it's very theoretical
and hypothetical and yes,

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,060
you know, who knows whether or
not that's possible, but that,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,650
that could be one other way that human
beings interface with technology.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,070
So humans,
in my view,

12
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:46,700
are far more hackable than we think that,

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,080
that there are so many that we just
imagine our biology is being fixed,

14
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:55,550
but our biology is really variable.
Like I have a, a friend, um,

15
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:59,810
who is an anesthesiologist at Stanford
and she's done this experimentation of

16
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:03,560
just running just like very mild electric
currents through people's brains.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,830
And people have these very real
experiences and whether it's arousal or

18
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:10,760
something that it's,
that you're,

19
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:14,750
you're entering people's minds through
different ways. So you talk about, uh,

20
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,220
that virtual reality when we are
entering a world where the pixelation of

21
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:21,740
virtual reality will be equal to life.

22
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,660
And so you're going to be in this
VR space and it just, it will look,

23
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,940
it may smell,
it could even with haptic suits,

24
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:33,230
it may feel just like life and our brains,

25
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,850
I don't know if you've done these things
with the, these um, uh, these, uh,

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,450
VR glasses where you go
and you can see people,

27
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:42,230
you're just like in a,

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,800
in a hall and the put on the glasses and
now you're in an elevator going to the,

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,470
the top on the outside, like a window
cleaners elevator to the top of this,

30
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,740
um, highrise and there's
a little rickety board.

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,880
And then there's this cat at the end
of the board and they're saying, yeah,

32
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:02,780
you have to go, go save the cat.
And you've already seen that.

33
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:07,250
You're just in a hall. You know it
in your brain. Um, there's this cat.

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,730
Everybody's looking at you and you've
seen all these other people panic.

35
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,000
And when I'm there I'm going to be,
so I'm just going to go grab that cat.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,560
And you're terrified.

37
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,870
Like you're trying to override your
lizard brain and your lizard brain saying

38
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:23,650
like, no, don't step on this. Love
that for HTC vive. Yeah, yeah, we have,

39
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,770
we need to set that up Jim. And we need
a two by four we put on the ground floor.

40
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:28,461
It's incredible.

41
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:33,461
And so I think that this whole concept
of reality is like that our technology is

42
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:36,770
going to be changing our sense of reality.

43
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:41,390
And then what's real like if you feel
arousal in your brain because of an

44
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:46,391
electric currents or you feel it because
you're with your girlfriend or wife or

45
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:49,100
reading a magazine or whatever.
Is that different?

46
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,840
Is One real and one not real?
And I think that this,

47
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,910
there's real big issues here. I mean
that is the Matrix, right? Yeah.

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,960
I mean the idea that,

49
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,420
and if it feels better and it's
more enjoyable than real life,

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,550
what is going to stop people from doing
the Ray Kurzweil deal and downloading

51
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:10,150
yourself into this, this
dimension? Well, and not much.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,500
Whether it's possible to do a
full download or not. Right?

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
I think that's an open question,

54
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,320
but whether people are going to be more
comfortable living in these alternative

55
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:23,350
worlds and whether we're booked,
we're going to be able to say, oh no,

56
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,420
that is the fake world. Like if
you're in this virtual world, right,

57
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,270
but your do you have friends in that
world, you're interacting in that world.

58
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:36,271
You have experiences that feel every bit
as real in that world as in our world

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,930
and people say, oh no, that's not
real. Those, those aren't your friends.

60
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:44,140
Like even now, like you know,
we all people with global lives,

61
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,230
you kind of have these friends,
like I have a good friend in Mongolia,

62
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,980
we talk all the time. Do you ever
see them in person once in a while,

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,110
like once every year or two? It's great
to see him. That's a real person though.

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,080
Real.
That's someone you actually know.

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,720
It was a control plane that
you actually do know him.

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,830
But if it was someone that you only talk
to online and they lived in Mongolia,

67
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,600
that's where things get weird.
It's true.

68
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,720
But let's just say hypothetically that
hypothetical, you have that person,

69
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:11,650
they're part of your whole
life and you're there with you.

70
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,850
They're with you through
your life experiences. You
call them up when you're sad.

71
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Like is it so essential that
you've met that person physically?

72
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,600
Like is that the core of what it means
to be someone's friend that you is not

73
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:28,070
essential, but it means a
lot. It does. And I, and so I,

74
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,130
I mean because we are not like we are
these physical beings and we are these

75
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:39,490
virtual beings, but figuring out what's
the balance is going to be really tricky.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,061
Yeah.

77
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:45,061
What is the balance like what I'm
worried about augmented reality too.

78
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,091
Cause I,
you know,

79
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,290
when you see people that you snapchat
filters and give themselves dog ears and

80
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,400
stuff like that,
like yeah.

81
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,840
Well how long before that is just
something that people choose to turn on or

82
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,330
turn off about life itself.
Yeah.

83
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,940
Like you'll be able to see the
world through different lenses.

84
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,060
The Sky could be a different color than
plants. Could be a different color.

85
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,450
May write about this in one of
my novels, Eternal Sonata, um,

86
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,500
where I think we're just going to
have these contact lenses and I'm,

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,070
and it'll be different kinds
of information based on
what people want. I mean,

88
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,350
like I'll meet with you and it'll
say, all right, this is Joe,

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,140
here's a little bit of background,
whatever,

90
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,770
and we'll have useful information.

91
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:26,710
Or you're walking around
a city and he'll be,

92
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:29,650
get little alerts of things that
you might do or, or history.

93
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:32,200
And so I think that that's what they
were thinking about with Google glasses,

94
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,011
right? Yeah, I know,

95
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,090
but he just was so annoying that people
wanted to kill people too weird. Yeah,

96
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
yeah, yeah, yeah. It was
just too, everybody felt like
they were getting filmed too.

97
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,820
They were, yeah. I mean, when you're
walking around with Google glasses on,

98
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:45,820
you assume that people
recording everything. It
was very strange. They were.

99
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:47,570
But I think that's another
thing that we're just,

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,710
all of our lives are going to be
recorded. Of course. Yeah. Now,

101
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:54,490
do you think that that's going to come
in the form of a contact lens or do you

102
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:58,100
think it's going to come in the form of
like ski goggles you're going to put on

103
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,110
and see the world through the
ones to look like an idiot.

104
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,950
And so in the beginning, in
the beginning, all these,

105
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,170
you talked about Michael Douglas with
these or like my favorite one is um,

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,470
is Kurt Russell in escape from New
York? What do you have there? It's like,

107
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,160
it's like this really cool tech.

108
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:17,780
Like he finally gets out of this Manhattan
Hell and he's got this phone and it's

109
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,400
like this big and it's pre cell
phone is free. It's like very,

110
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,960
very early days.
And so you know,

111
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,770
now we have these kind of glasses and
there's like a little bit of a little bit

112
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:31,520
of cachet but all I'm has a cell phone
that's that big. It'd be seen that no,

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,330
I was at the Verizon store. Yeah, I
think it was like an attachment. Earnest.

114
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:40,030
An accessory to a phone. Yeah. You can
bring it with you intervention, find,

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,090
not bring your other phone.
That's the idea behind it. Yeah,

116
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,160
so like you could decide,
well, I'm going out,

117
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,100
let me just bring my tiny phone
for essentials, all this tiny,

118
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,110
I mean the phones are
going to get quote unquote,

119
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,320
phones are just going to get so smart.

120
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,550
So I say they're going
to come inside of it.

121
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:56,570
So you'll have like a little contact lens,
maybe a little thing in your ear,

122
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,610
maybe like a little
permanent implant in your,

123
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,870
you'd behind your tooth or one of your
teeth to replace a tooth with a computer,

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,450
you know,
pipe it right into your nerves.

125
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,190
Any kind of crazy stuff you can think
of that it's probably going to happen.

126
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:11,690
And some of it, some people take, some
of them won't, right? Yeah, right. Yeah.

127
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:15,060
It seems like that's what we're going to
have to see. Like how it plays out. Yeah.

128
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,960
That's one of the things when you were
talking about scientists that are working

129
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,270
on these things, they're working
on what's right in front of them.

130
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,750
They're not looking at the
greater landscape itself
in terms of what the future

131
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:26,630
holds. It's not their job. And
that's why we need other people.

132
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,000
And I certainly see myself or
those people. You and who else,

133
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,500
who would you elect Trump came to you
and said, Jamie, we've got problems.

134
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,700
We need to figure out the future.
What should we do? So we'll certainly,

135
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,330
and we need to have a mix of
different kinds of people. And so I,

136
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,130
I'm certainly people like me who are kind
of big picture futurists. We need that.

137
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,620
We need scientists.
I work with some really incredible sign.

138
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:52,940
I did an event at Harvard last week with
George Church who is kind of like the

139
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,490
Living Charles Darwin Davidson Claire,
who you know,

140
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:59,630
has been on this program is a friend of
mine working on, on life extension. Um,

141
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,500
and we need people just
from all backgrounds.

142
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,890
And so like I would say like, we
need people, we need poor people,

143
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:10,700
we need people from developing world.
We need all kinds of people.

144
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:15,701
But in terms of the people who are kind
of articulating the big picture of the

145
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,260
world and what are the
challenges that we're facing,

146
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,830
I certainly put myself in that category.
People like Yuval Noah Harari,

147
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,830
who were just kinda big,
also kind of big thinkers,

148
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,050
people like Sid Mukherjee Am.

149
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:32,051
I just think we have to articulate the
big picture and we have to do it in a way

150
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,040
so that people can see themselves
in this story and then,

151
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,140
and then enter into the conversation.
