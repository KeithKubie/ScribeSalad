From the blockbuster franchise that

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.170
nobody loves, but everybody likes
enough that they won't change the

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.360
channel when it's on cable, comes
the sequel that kinda sounds like a

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.689
high-speed handjob...

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.439
VOICE (CONT'D)
Fast Five.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.680
VOICE (CONT'D)
Wait, they've made five of these

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.050
already?

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.090
VOICE (CONT'D)
Prepare for the biggest hit of this

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.840
street racing franchise...because
it got rid of all the street-

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.090
racing.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.080
VOICE (CONT'D)
Now it's a heist film on wheels,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.360
orchestrated by Vin Diesel...a
passable action hero...

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.820
VOICE (CONT'D)
Who this time must match wits with

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.930
a far more charismatic action hero:
The Rock...Who's jacked up on baby

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.300
oil

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.550
VOICE (CONT'D)
Together they'll crank up the NOS

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.420
on all the things you've come to
expect from a Fast &amp; Furious movie,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.750
like...

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.050
VOICE (CONT'D)
Gear-shifting

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.360
.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.560
VOICE (CONT'D)
Mumble-growls..

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.220
You got my word Vince

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.970
Wughgh kinda counting on it
I remember everything about my
faaather

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.970
VOICE (CONT'D)
And overt homoeroticism.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.140
VOICE (CONT'D)
To pull off one last job...Dom will
need to gather everyone's favorite

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.120
heist movie stereotypes:

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.140
VOICE (CONT'D)
The hunky mastermind

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.670
VOICE (CONT'D)
The nerd

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.740
VOICE (CONT'D)
The Bernie Mac

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.640
VOICE (CONT'D)
The guy who can't speak English

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.640
VOICE (CONT'D)
And the guy who's constantly

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.040
snacking.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.570
VOICE (CONT'D)
Gear up to steal $100 million

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.400
dollars with the dumbest criminals
ever, as they...

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.360
VOICE (CONT'D)
Take off their masks during

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.340
robberies.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.080
VOICE (CONT'D)
Go for leisurely strolls while all

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.780
of Rio's drug gangs are after them.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.250
VOICE (CONT'D)
And drag-race cop cars they just

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.380
stole down the middle of the
street.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.439
VOICE (CONT'D)
These heroes will stop at nothing

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.270
to take down a sort-of ruthless
drug lord, by...

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.990
VOICE (CONT'D)
Destroying poor neighborhoods...

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.340
VOICE (CONT'D)
Destroying rich neighborhoods...

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.349
VOICE (CONT'D)
Killing 22 cops with a giant metal

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.689
safe...

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.829
VOICE (CONT'D)
And ultimately leaving Rio in way

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.069
worse shape than they found it.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.049
VOICE (CONT'D)
So refuel and ride along while

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.739
these rebels break every law in the
book...of physics...

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.549
VOICE (CONT'D)
Gravity!

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.430

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.389
franchise, that's technically the

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.999
fourth, since the events of Fast

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.010
Three take place after Fast Six,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.840
making the third fast the sixth

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.779
fast, possibly the seventh

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:54.779
depending on where Fast 7 ends up in the timeline--Hey look! Car boobs!

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.829
VOICE (CONT'D)
UGH...we get it! You can nitpick movies!

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.629
But can you do this?

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:22.029
