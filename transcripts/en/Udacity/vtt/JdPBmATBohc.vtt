00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This first one, part of testing a program feature is running the program

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in a way that exercises that feature, that was the last quiz.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes, that is part of testing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have to exercise the feature and then compare the observed output

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to what we expected.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And if they're different, that indicates a bug.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Testing can give us absolute certainty. No.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Testing can give us confidence that our JavaScript interpreter is correct.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Because our JavaScript interpreter could potentially accept an infinite number of inputs--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there are an infinite number of possible JavaScript programs out there--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we don't have time to test them all.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We can't be absolutely certain based on testing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but it can give us confidence.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Finally, one test input is just as good as another. No.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This was the previous quiz.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We need a test input that exercises the feature.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And if we have a bunch of features in our program, we would want a suite of test inputs

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that cover all those features.
