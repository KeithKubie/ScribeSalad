00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:02.718
Now in Android studio,
you can hit the play button

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:04.899
to run the app on your device.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.949
In the device Chooser dialog, 
you should see your connected device.

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:12.095
To prevent the dialog from popping up 
in future times, check this box,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:15.337
and then hit OK to continue. 
Within a few moments,

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:16.591
you should see it on your phone.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:19.325
On the other hand, 
as Raido was mentioning,

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:21.416
you can use command line tools.

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:24.945
&gt;From the root folder of the project,
use grade lw to build your app

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:26.366
on Mac or Linux.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.740
Check the link in the notes below 
if you're using Windows.

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.734
This first command grants 
execution permission

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:34.943
to the gradlw rappers script. 
And you only need to do it the first time

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:36.517
you're trying to build 
from the command line.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.078
Then you can call grade lw assemble debug.
Once the build is successful,

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:47.090
it creates an APK file 
at the app/build/apk directory.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.788
You can use adb to install the app. 
The -r command means

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:52.520
that you can replace an existing version

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.547
of the app if you've 
already done it before.

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:58.694
For more tips on adb, you can see 
the instructor notes below.

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:02.255
Then you can use this adb command 
with the activity manager tool

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:07.494
in order to start the main activity. 
And there you see it on the device.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.163
And now we see it running 
in our phones.

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:11.870
Woo hoo! Fist bump!

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.746
We're on a roll. Let's go find Dan so that
we can build up the sunshine UI. Woo!
