00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
How are you feeling now?

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.450
Good. Fine. Back at work.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.120
What line of work are you in?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.100
Waste management consultant.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.290
The gangster is deeply ingrained in American cinema;

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.239
the gun-slinging badasses of the criminal underworld

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.739
have had enormous success since

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.900
their inception in the silent era.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.290
But how is it that the American gangster, a character so violent,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.480
profane, and cruel is so glorified on the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.190
big screen? I want to explore a psycho-

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.080
analytic approach to this question and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.120
see how the American gangster embodies

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.580
innate and universal human desires.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.170
Let's start with a simple question: who

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.879
was the original gangster? Where did this

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.070
larger-than-life persona come from?

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.960
With this question you run into problems.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.089
I personally consider Rico Bandello in

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.560
'Little Caesar' to be the first true

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.000
gangster. One of the first talking

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.440
gangsters, he's also the first to have

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.780
the iconic accent and distinct speech roll

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.880
now very familiar with. "Now, when I get in a tight spot

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.830
I shoot my way out of it. Why, sure,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.110
shoot first and argue afterwards."

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.360
The problem is that he isn't really a gangster,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.130
he's actually inspired to become a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.869
gangster from a newspaper article about

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.850
Pete Montana to try to enter the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.070
gangster world: He's a copycat. The very

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.869
first gangster film is 'The Musketeers of

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.070
Pig Alley' and the name of the film

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.630
originates from a newspaper article

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.299
about the shooting of a gambler on, quote:

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.300
"New York's Other Side". Perhaps the actual,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.130
original depiction of gangsters was in a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.050
collection of photographs of the slums

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.000
by Jacob Riis, with the famous photo

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.460
'Bandit's Roost' in 1890. The problem with

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.990
the gangster genre begins here

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.300
This photo is staged, Riis constructed the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.250
shot to have its trademark level of fear

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.810
and fascination that we know and love

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.700
today and gangsters, and the influence of

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.650
this picture on the gangster genre is

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.960
seen up and into the 21st century.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.490
This brings me to my first point: there

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.320
is no original gangster. Pretty much

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.909
every gangster we know and love is a

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.800
copycat. Michael Corleone's military

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.810
uniform and original distaste for gang

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.519
life borrows straight from Mike Powers

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.409
in 'The Public Enemy' and this shot in

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.180
pulp fiction eludes directly to 'The

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.310
Godfather'. Tommy's erratic behavior in

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.530
'Goodfellas' echoes Cody Jarrett in 'White

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.900
Heat', 'Scarface' is a remake, and even the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.879
modern "hood" gangster doesn't completely

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.680
depart from conventional gangsters.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.269
"They kept me in the hospital a week or so.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.580
I mostly stayed up thinking about my cousin,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.500
and watching old gangster movies."

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.000
"I've got to see some identification."

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.000
"How about my army discharge, I got it right here."

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.280
and of course the sopranos is famous for

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.080
referencing multiple gangster movies in

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.940
pretty much every episode. "Cheer me up,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.940
babe." "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.600
Every iconic gangster movie is in some

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.640
way copycat-ing. "To make it, what was your

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.640
conversation with yourself, about how the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.980
violence should be handled?" "Well, I,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.380
I confess that I was very impressed

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.760
with Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde' and uh..."

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.640
"I thought about that when watching, um, Sonny

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.489
Corleone get shot." "Without a doubt and I

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.860
thought that the the effects, the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.410
depiction of violence in 'Bonnie and Clyde' always

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.250
had an imaginative twist to it." "...and I'd

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.800
like to think 'Goodfellas' comes out of

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.540
the tradition of something as

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.850
extraordinary as, as the roarin' twenties and 'Scarface'."

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.159
What's important to note here is that

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.870
every gangster borrows something from

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.670
older gangsters, and if you go back far

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.230
enough the gangster isn't based in

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.310
reality at all.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.659
There's only the artificially constructed

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.120
idea of the gangster. This is a key point

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.560
in understanding America's obsession

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.239
with the Gangster. We're not actually

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.010
obsessed with being the leader of the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.629
criminal underworld, we're obsessed with

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.849
what being a gangster represents. Now we

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.319
have to go back to the question at hand:

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.670
what does a gangster represent and why

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.349
do we like them so much? What is a gangster

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.730
even want? If you think it's just

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.410
money, or women then you're wrong.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.140
"Oh, I ain't forgettin' all about the money." "Yeah, money's

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.700
all right but it ain't everything."

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.140
The best thing is, we can find out what a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.120
gangster wants because they tell us.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.310
"I don't want to be a product of my

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.209
environment. I want my environment to be

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.220
a product of me."

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.389
So what does that mean? That line

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.220
describes a desire that any human feels

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.660
and understands. If you watch any

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.460
gangster movie, each one has this similar

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.200
idea. "I don't want no dancin', l figure I'm makin' other people dance."

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.990
To understand

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.669
what this idea means, you have

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.410
to take a trip into the human psyche. I

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.510
point to a quote from psychologist Adam

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.039
Phillips:

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.740
when were angry it's

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.240
because something doesn't happen in the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.770
way we wanted to. Even when you get mad

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.120
at something as simple as losing your keys,

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.310
it means your fantasy of an ideal world,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.229
a world where everything is available to

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.270
you at your fingertips was disrupted. In

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.860
the ideal life the rest of the world

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.930
revolves entirely around you. "How would you

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.669
like to go walkin' in the dining room of the

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.039
Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, wearin' a nice

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.750
silk dress and have everybody waitin' on you?

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.220
Would you like that?"

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.599
The gangster is the perfect embodiment

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.970
of this fantasy. The world operates how

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.800
the gangster wants it to operate. He can

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.120
give orders with the twitch of his

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.590
fingers, when he walks in a room people

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.240
offer them a place to sit, to do

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.010
business all he has to do is nod.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.169
This ability of the gangster transcends

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.780
simple money, or sex, or respect. It is the

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.580
idea that the gangster has complete

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.680
dominion over his world. "I'm gonnna make him

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.229
an offer he can't refuse." In 'The Godfather' what's the

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.840
first thing Vito Corleone asks? "Why did you go to the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.270
police? Why didn't you come to me first?"

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.280
In this scene Amerigo Bonasera acts as

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.139
a threat to the gangster's all-powerful

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.729
reach. Bonasera goes to the police

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.320
first showing that he believes more in

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.330
the American justice system than in Vito.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.979
Even the lighting has Bonasera's face

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.690
look like a rat making him visually

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.490
appear like a traitor. He doesn't buy into

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.380
the Godfather's power, but of course, the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.900
Godfather wins him over.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.470
In all of media, the

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.300
gangster is perhaps the closest

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.490
embodiment to a god. Superheroes come

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.660
close, but even they have to fight

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.890
villains and save the world.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.120
Gangsters have nothing to worry about.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.890
The appeal of the gangster is not that

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.360
he's a gangster, it's that he is

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.160
all-knowing and all-powerful. If he

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.630
doesn't want to pay the tab, he doesn't

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.400
have to. Imagine being able to live like

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.720
that. I think in the movies the worst

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.640
part about the gangsters downfall isn't

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.780
the actual death.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.160
It's much worse than that. It's when the

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.140
gangster goes back to being just like us,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.760
powerless and unable to control his

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.710
world. This idea goes as far back as 'The

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.660
Public Enemy', when the very physical and

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.730
expressive Tom Powers gets physically

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.740
restrained and mummified when he dies.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.210
It's most present in 'Goodfellas', when

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.500
Henry Hill goes into witness protection program...

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.800
"Everybody had their hands out, everything

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.120
was for the taking... and now it's all over."

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.490
...and becomes just like you and me.  "I have to

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.500
wait around like everyone else."  And as he

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.820
closes the door we hear the sound of

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.040
jail cell bars closing, symbolizing his

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.260
loss of the all-powerful aura of the gangster.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.020
Of course, I haven't mentioned one

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.090
crucial detail about the gangster: the

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.200
over-the-top violence. How's the genre so successful with such violence?

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.090
In one episode of 'The Sopranos' Tony takes his

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.920
daughter to visit colleges. On the way, he

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.810
recognizes a rat, hunts him down and

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.500
strangles the rat to death with a wire.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.260
The creators of the show were hesitant

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.700
to make this episode because of its

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.440
hyper-violence, but made it anyway and

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.220
it's brutal.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.810
The shots are extremely close up and it

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.220
follows the strangling to the bitter end.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.870
The episode was praised by critics and

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.790
went on to win two Emmys, which begs

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.350
the question: why do we like this

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.360
horrific violence? The answer comes from

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.580
the idea of the taboo. Something taboo is

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.230
untouchable and there's a fascination

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.610
with things that cannot be touched.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.560
Subjects like drugs and violence are

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.540
taboo, but the fact that they cannot be

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.730
touched gives them a level of power.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.140
If you refuse to touch something then you

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.240
have to be, at some level, obsessed with it.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.160
if that thing didn't matter to you, then

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.630
you wouldn't care if you touched it.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.040
For some, the taboo is rooted in

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.200
superstition, like an aversion to Ouija

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.910
boards or black magic. With that

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.830
obsession comes a desire to observe the

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.240
taboo from a distance.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.710
Naturally, there's a draw to look at

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.419
something that holds so much power over us.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.669
"I know there are women like my best

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.160
friends, who would have gotten out of

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.870
there the minute their boyfriend gave

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.400
them a gun to hide. But I didn't. I gotta admit

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.410
the truth, it turned me on."

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.270
Speaking of rats, in Victorian society

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.669
they were inexplicably taboo. They were a

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.140
symbol of the unclean and were

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.180
certainly untouchable, but a sociologist

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.919
at the time wrote detailed accounts the

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.210
street performers who were trained in

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.890
handling and touching sewer rats.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.810
Spectators would watch in disgust, but

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.550
also wonderment at the performers

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.350
ability to put his hand in a cage of

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.450
rats without getting bitten. That performer

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.340
in many ways had a mystical power to be

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.720
able to handle something that was so

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.490
taboo, and people "ooh'ed" in the crowd at

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.290
something they also found so repulsive,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.729
and doesn't it sound a lot like the

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:30.200
gangster? Don't they have a certain power

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.700
to do things we would never have the

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.710
guts to do ourselves? By participating in

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.110
the taboo: sex, violence, and the criminal

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.880
life, they have an appeal to them, and the

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.530
distance between the movie screen and us

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.089
is the perfect amount of distance where

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:42.860
we get to observe - but not touch - the

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.570
taboo. The gangster is certainly a

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.370
complex character, but we're not all that

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.440
different from them. We all want that respect,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.510
status, and control, the only difference

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.200
is we don't have the guts to do anything about it.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.920
We're satisfied with seeing it on the

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.450
big screen, and maybe that's a good thing,

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.130
or maybe we're all a bunch of suckers

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.900
and they've been right all along.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.100
"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.100
*Rags to Riches by Tony Bennet plays*

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.000
"I know I'd go from rags to riches.."

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:22.000
"...if you would only say you care."

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.000
"And though my pocket may..."
