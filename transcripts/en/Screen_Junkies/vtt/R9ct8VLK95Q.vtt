00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.100
Are you ready for a new kind of Disney movie?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.940
Full of strong female characters,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.020
no forced romantic sub-plots,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.820
and a celebration of Polynesian culture?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.540
Then you'll love...

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.540
...Lilo and Stitch.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.700
"Did not see that coming."

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.620
Oh, and probably also Moana.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.380
Meet Moana,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.540
a strong, determined young woman

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.100
who won't stop until she gets the job done.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.360
"I am Moana."

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.460
"You will board my boat, sail across the sea,"

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.100
Who after 90 minutes of adventure

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.540
becomes a strong, determined young woman

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.200
who won't stop until she gets the job done.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.520
"I am Moana."

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920
"You will board my board, sail across the sea,"

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.160
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.660
She's indestructible,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.040
she's fearless,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.040
and she's got water powers

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040
just as confusing and vague as Elsa's ice magic in Frozen.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.740
So wait, does she have any water powers at all?

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.100
Or does it only protect whoever has the glowy thing?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.840
And if the ocean has her back,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.800
why does it keep trying to drown her?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.380
"Help me!"

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.900
Follow along on Moana's quest to save her homeland,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.300
by following a super obvious sign

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.380
"Maui lies there."

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.780
in a journey that pokes fun at all of Disney's usual tropes

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.480
"If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.580
you're a princess!"

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.720
"If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up."

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.320
while at the same time being 100% guilty of them.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.240
From her cute animal sidekicks,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.780
to her grand-Mufasa,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.140
to her genie, Maui,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.200
an all-powerful, charismatic, brawling, tattooed demi-god.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.320
So pretty much, The Rock.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.560
Enjoy the highest honor a culture can receive these days

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.720
having your traditions commodified by the Disney corporation.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.020
And watch as the Polynesian people,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.260
who traveled between islands thousands of miles apart thousands of years ago,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.740
are represented by paranoid coconut lovers

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.020
who would rather starve to death than sail past a three-foot break.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.740
"We were voyagers.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.340
We can voyage again!"

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.860
Haole for effort, I guess.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.200
So enjoy a film with a soundtrack people can't stop gushing about

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.440
because the guy from Hamilton is involved

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.040
and not even the ocean gushes as hard as Hamilton fans.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.680
Featuring songs like:

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.680
The "They're really into coconuts" song

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.520
The "Uh oh, we're making the Rock sing" song?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
The "Let it Go"-ish song

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.700
And, the "Beautiful song in a foreign language that could be saying anything" song

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.250
I hope you liked that one,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.320
because it turns out it's really freaking hard to find a Tokelauan translator.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.960
Okay, so wait a second.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.060
Rapunzel has demon hair,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.200
Elsa has ice powers,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200
and Moana is a water bender?!

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.380
Are we building up to Disney's Princess Avengers?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.340
*manly squee*
