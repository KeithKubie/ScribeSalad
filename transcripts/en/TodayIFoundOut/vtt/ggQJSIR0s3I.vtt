00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.619
Among those who use recreational drugs, Bill
Murray is something of an icon, having played

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.550
several pot-smoking characters over the years,
including the cannabis-loving sea captain

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.390
Steve Zissou from The Life Aquatic with Steve
Zissou, and noted drug user Hunter S. Thompson

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.180
in Where the Buffalo Roam.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.690
So, was Bill Murray actually arrested for
transporting Mary Jane, or was this story

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.090
just an urban legend concocted by Murray’s
pot-smoking fanbase?

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.860
Believe it or not, this story is actually
true.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.540
Murray was arrested for this on his 20th birthday…not
exactly the best way to celebrate such a happy

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.540
occasion.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.540
Here’s how it went down: on September 21st,
1970, Murray was trying to catch a flight

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.540
to Denver.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.140
At the time, Murray was a pre-med student
(yes, you read that right) at Regis University

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.550
in Colorado.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.560
But Murray never made his flight back to school…partially
because of a stupid joke.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.490
While Murray is considered a gifted comedian
today, at age 20, he still needed to hone

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.490
his craft.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.200
Perhaps he had been smoking a bit before arriving
at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.080
because while waiting to board the plane,
he joked to a fellow passenger that his suitcase

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.000
contained two bombs…

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.941
Unfortunately for Murray, a ticket agent overheard
his comment and alerted the authorities.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:32.900
Of course, Murray didn’t have “two bombs”,
but his luggage did contain a staggering amount

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.970
of grass.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.430
To be precise, Murray had five “bricks”
of marijuana in his possession, which weighed

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.700
a total of about 10 pounds.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.520
That much weed was worth $20,000 at the time,
or about $117,000 today.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.870
That said, even if Murray hadn’t been running
his mouth, he would have been caught red-handed.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.310
Chicago’s finest vice detectives were already
on the scene waiting for Murray, having gotten

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.620
a tip about his suitcase full of drugs.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.790
Suffice it to say, Murray was arrested and
put on probation for five years.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.799
During that time, his doctoral aspirations
were put on hold.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.500
However, Regis did award him an honorary doctorate
in 2007.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
(Student loans not necessary!)

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.590
Incidentally, when he accepted the doctorate,
he did so wearing pajama shorts and top, with

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.810
a suit jacket over them.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.730
Five years after his arrest, Murray was vaulted
into the limelight when he was cast on Saturday

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.370
Night Live, but it wasn’t the Saturday Night
Live most know today.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.490
Rather, he was cast on ABC’s Saturday Night
Live with Howard Cosell.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.340
The show was canceled after the first season,
but Murray quickly found work as a replacement

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.970
to Chevy Chase in NBC’s Saturday Night Live,
which was just into its second season.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.530
And the rest is comedy history.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.340
The Illinois State Police report on Murray’s
O’Hare arrest recorded Murray’s weight

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.910
as 170 pounds in 1970.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:29.060
His skin was described as “ruddy”.
