&gt;&gt;Laura Tyson: Hello, You Tubers, I'm Laura
Tyson, Professor of Economics and Business

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.840
at the University of California Berkley.
I can think of two things in two quite different

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.049
areas. One, I think is important for the central
banks and a number of countries of the world

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.070
to get together to try to make sure that the
world doesn't enter a global recession in

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.580
2008. I think there are things they can do.
I think the kind of international agreement

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.320
of coordination of macroeconomic policies
and exchange rates efforts could be very helpful.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.050
At the same time I think, on a personal level,
what each individual should do is think about

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.739
ways that they can make a meaningful reduction
in their use of carbon based energy. I think

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.840
there are a lot of low hanging fruit in our
lives in terms of efficiency advancements

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.629
and I think if we do that in our homes and
our offices in our travels and we get others

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.030
to do the same thing, we'll be making progress
on the greatest challenge that confronts humanity:

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.440
that is the global climate change challenge.
