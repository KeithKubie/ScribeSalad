00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.540
&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: I'm here today
to introduce Michael Hiltzik.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.180
A Pulitzer Prize winning
LA Times columnist

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.480
and the author of six books.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.070
While the session was
catalogued under science,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.000
Michael is hardly just
a science writer.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.780
His current LA Times
column focuses on business.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.720
His Pulitzer in 1999
was for reporting

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.450 position:56%
on corruption in the music industry.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.490
He has been a financial
and political writer

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.300
and investigative reporter, a
technology writer and editor,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.540
a foreign correspondent
in Africa and in Russia.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.590
His book topics have included
a murder in Kenya, Xerox PARC,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.770
Social Security, the New
Deal and the Hoover Dam.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.050
In other words, he's written
about pretty much everything.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.410 position:56%
So perhaps I shouldn't have been too
surprise to come across this gem,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.870
written by Michael for the
LA Times in 1988, "Of course,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.930
no one would claim that Trump has
ever been weak on self promotion.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.700
Since 1980, he has been
New York's most visible

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.350
and extravagant real estate
man, plastering his name

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.020
over Manhattan Island like the
label on a pair of designer jeans."

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.180
Michael continues "He even
maneuvered himself in a brief spot

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.020
in the national political
limelight by journeying

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.880
up to New Hampshire late last
year to give a speech on,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.400
of all things, foreign policy."

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.060 position:56%
When Michael ask him about that trip

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.550
and possible presidential
aspirations, Trump replies "I went

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.680
up to New Hampshire and
you know what happened?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.700
We had the biggest
reception of anybody."

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.670
But Michael concludes in the piece,
sometimes his incessant overflow

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.880
of self promotion, extravagance

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.140
and high pervaly runs
a little thin, 1988.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.300
Michael's latest book is
"Big Science: Ernest Lawrence

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.790
and the Invention That Launched
the Military-Industrial Complex."

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.170
It's partly a biography of Lawrence
who won a Noble Prize in 1939

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.150
for his invention of the cyclotron
and his lab played central role

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.900
in developing the atom
and hydrogen bombs.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.170
It's also about a shift in science
from a pursuit of individuals

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.040 position:56%
with one or two research assistance,
to an enterprise involving armies

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.780
of researchers and
billions of dollars.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.320
Before we dive into our
discussion, I'm supposed to mention

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.900
that the Library of Congress
has been the festival's host

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.000
for the past 16 years.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.660
I want to thank Co-Chairman
David Rubenstein

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.240
and the many national
book festivals sponsors

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.380
who made this possible in 2016.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500
You can support the
festival with the donation

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.260 position:56%
by checking the information in your
programs and there will be questions

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.100
after the talk and please note that
if you ask a question we record it

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.110
for the Library Congress' records.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.510
And now please help me
welcome, Michael Hiltzik.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.180
[ Applause ]

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Thank you
Marisa for that introduction.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.630
I should tell you that I had almost
forgotten about that piece I wrote

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.950
about Donald Trump when I was the
New York Financial Correspondent

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.670
for the LA Times until
somebody Tweeted it

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.130
at me just a few weeks ago.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.110
And I went back and I pulled it up
and I said "Yeah, I did write that.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.020
That's right, now I remember."

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.980
Anyway, thanks to all of you for
joining me this afternoon to talk

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.450
about science and physics
and the atom bomb

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.220
and how that's all applied together
in history and I should also say--

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.680
give my thanks to the Library
of Congress for hosting me here.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.800
It's one of the great institutions
in Washington and a place

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.700
where I research now free books
including this one that we're going

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.930
to be talking about today.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.030
Anyway, I think talking about
the origins of big science,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.950
that's the capital intensive
became interdisciplinary scientific

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.300
research that's today's
prevailing paradigm of science.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.260
I think it's especially
appropriate these days,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.980
because basic scientific research
is under political attack today

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.480
in this country as never before or
at least not since medieval times.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.750
In part because it
challenges by its nature,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.060
it challenges embedded
interest especially today,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.080
the fossil fuel industry.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.000
And what we tend to see is that
scientific revolutions tend

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.870
to foment economic revolutions,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.980
I think that's really what's
behind a lot of the pushback

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.490
that we're seeing against
basic research in Congress.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.260 position:56%
So it behooves us I think to go
back to the origins of this paradigm

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.470
of research and draw us some
lessons from its history for today.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.210
So I'm going to start by outlining
the background of Ernest Lawrence,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.170
a central figure of my book.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.530
A man who changed science in
ways that still resonate today

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.870
and will continue to do
so well into the future.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.550
So who was Ernest Orlando Lawrence?

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.430
Well the short answer is
that during his lifetime,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.200
he was the most famous native
born scientist in America.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.500
Thank you.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.070
In 1937, he appeared on the cover
of Time Magazine when it was

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.510
that on purpose validation of
international celebrity during

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.170
that prehistoric era, we
think of as the era of print.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.950
And here's that cover.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.110
You can see it stated November
1st, 1937 over the caption

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.450
"He Creates and Destroys."

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.400
And that was true.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.640
He had created a new particle
accelerator, the cyclotron.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.080
The most efficient and powerful
atom smasher of its time

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.830
and he was using it to
destroy atomic nuclei

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.540
as a way to study them.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.280
The invention of the cyclotron
was only the launch path

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.440
for Lawrence's lifelong
fame and influence.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.140
He would go on to play a
crucial role in the development

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.120
of the atomic bomb
and the hydrogen bomb.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.470
And we'll be talking a little
bit later about how to think

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.750
about those programs since we've
just passed the 71st anniversaries

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.450
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
just about six weeks ago.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.560
But Lawrence's overarching
legacy was

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.550 position:56%
that he created this new paradigm
of science that still prevails today

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.450
and big science is all around us.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.960 position:56%
High level research funded by the
NIH, the National Science Foundation

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.990
which received nearly
$40 billion a year

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.480
and government appropriations,
well that's big science.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.390
Masses effort to put a man on
the moon and to send probes

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.790
into the farthest reaches of the
solar system, that's big science.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.160
The human genome project was a $3
billion exercise in big science

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.540
that launched not only new fields
of study, but new industries.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:24.490
Solving climate change will be
impossible without big science.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.650
The Large Hadron Collider,
which discovered

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.450
that illusive subatomic particle,
the Higgs Boson in 2012, well,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.310
that's the latest iteration
of the first cyclotron

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.710
that Ernest Lawrence invented
more than eight decades ago.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.660
That first cyclotron cost less
than a $100 in materials and is fit

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.070
in the palm of this hand.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.750
It's offspring today, it
occupies a tunnel 17 miles

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.000
in circumference buried under
the French in Swiss countrysides

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.300
and it cost $9 billion, and
the cost is still rising.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.510
In fact, here's an illustration
of the cyclotron's phenology.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.750
And one of Lawrence's very first
devices is there on the left.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.050
It's a small container.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.290
It's lathered with red sealing wax

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.460
to keep the vacuum
inside that round unit.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.930 position:56%
In the middle is the 37-inch
cyclotron which was one of the first

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.070
that he built that achieved
significant energies.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.750
And then on the right, that's
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.620
And for perspective, I think
there's a human being in the guts

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.920
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.020
And you can see the
difference on scale.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.180
And here's one of Lawrence's
assistants

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.490
on the 37-inch in the late 1930s.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.530
So that's quite an
evolution of a technology

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.790
over a period of about 80 years.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.650
You may not recognize a family
resemblance but it's there.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.510
The Large Hadron Collider comprises
about six advance cyclotron's

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.500
and other accelerated technologies.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.180
Yet for all that, one central theme
of my book is that this paradigm

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.050
that Lawrence pioneered
raises as many questions

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.060
about human kind search for
knowledge as an answers.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.400
One of the most important
aspects of big science

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.200
that we're still grappling
with is that it gives scientist

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.220
and society access to forces
of truly distractive power,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.220
forces that we found
very hard and we hope

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.230
in the long run not
impossible to control.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.900
Among the first people to warn

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.870
of the implications was
Lawrence's own colleague

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.130
on the Manhattan project,
James Franck, a German

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.320
and a great physicist who two
months before the first atomic bomb

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.180 position:56%
detonated over Japan in August 1945,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.330
was observing that the
age was already passed,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.980
in which as he put it "Scientists
can disclaim responsibility

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.570
for the use to which mankind
has put their discoveries."

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.210 position:56%
And the reason he said was that what
big science had brought about was

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.100
"Fraught with infinitely greater
dangers than all the inventions

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.830
of the past put together."

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.890 position:56%
And we need to talk not merely
about what we do with the knowledge.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.400
Big science brings us but the
resources we spend on that quest.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.690
Lawrence's legacy challenges
us to think about that.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.230
How to way the monumental effort,
it might take to put a man on Mars

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.970
or discover the next fundamental
particle, against the imperative

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.570
to fight cancer or pay for
drugs against hepatitis

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.290
or multiple sclerosis
for every sufferer

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.110
or to end poverty and hunger.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.830
So, all these I think fact is
into what makes Ernest Lawrence

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.030
and his work such an
intriguing subject for us today.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:56.170
He was a small town boy,
born in 1901 in Canton,

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.540
South Dakota to a first generation
Norwegian-American family.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.930
So it could be said that he
grew up with the 20th Century.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.810
Like many of his friends, he was
a thinker, fascinated in his case

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.680
by radio gear and we could see the
qualities that made him a success

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.040
in later life even in boyhood.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.370
Comfortable with technology
and machinery,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.710
I'm assuming curious
and bored with idleness.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.200
Well those qualities came to
fruition in 1929 with the invention

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.780
that made his reputation.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.580
Lawrence had been recruited to join
the faculty at Berkeley at a time

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.600
when physics itself
was at the crossroads.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.850
The deporting generation,
scientist like Ernest Rutherford

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.490
and Marie Curie had been
probing the atomic nucleus

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.470
with the tools that
nature gave them.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.100
The emissions of alpha rays
from radioactive minerals

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.270
like radium husbanded
by the thimble form.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.560
With those small science tools
that generation had figured

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.120
out the structure of the atom
and they had discovered x-rays,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.720
radioactivity and the neutron.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.280 position:56%
But they'd gone about as much as
they could with nature's gift alone.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.970
To go further they recognize,
science would need probes

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.000
of higher energies to delve
deeper into the nucleus

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.330
and this could only be achieved
by applying human ingenuity.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.100 position:56%
It was Rutherford who threw down the
challenge for the next generation,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.510
calling for an apparatus that could
deliver 10 million electron volts,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:30.280
yet as he said be safely
accommodated in a medium size room.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.140
Well, scientist all over the world
took up Rutherford's challenge,

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.610
but what they discovered right
of was that, if you try to apply

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:42.220 position:56%
or load an apparatus with 10 million
volts, what happens is you blow

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.720
up the apparatus so they ended up
with laboratory field with shards

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.870
of glass and metal, think about
trying to fire a mortar shell

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.500
out of a canon with
a cardboard barrel.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.450
Well, one night in Berkeley,
Lawrence had a brain storm,

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.130
what if you don't apply the voltage
to the apparatus but directly

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.330
onto the projectile that
you're trying to use?

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.710
If you start with the proton
say with the 100 volts,

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.840
and give it a 100 volt jolt, now
you've got a proton with energy

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.870
of 200 volts, another jolt
and 300 and so on and so on.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.760
But if you do it to a proton
traveling in a straight line say

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.560
through a linear accelerator, it
would have to be more than a mile

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.310
in length to get to your
particle up to the desired energy,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.130
so it's not exactly fitting and
rested for it's comfortable room.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:40.210
Well, so now comes the second
part of Ernest brainstorm.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.930
He understands that
a particle crossing

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.330
through a magnetic field
will follow a curve path.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.760
So if he applies the magnetic
field to this particle,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.650
he can bend his proton
into a circle,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.680
allowing it to get repeated jolts
from just a single electrode

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.940
and reducing the need to
synchronize the electrode's charge

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.870
and that's the essence
of the cyclotron,

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.860
reduce to its simplest terms.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.840
After enough revolutions,
you've got a particle

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.000
that now carries a million volts,
10 million, even a 100 million

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.380
and all you have to do is aim
it at a target and let it rip.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:21.630 position:56%
The possibilities are limitless and
it all can fit in a medium size room

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.770
or at least the first
cyclotrons could.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.050
And here's a schematic of
that principle as it appeared

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.150
in Lawrence's patent
application for the accelerator.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.150
You can see at the center here,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:42.360
this is where a charged particle
was introduced to this vacuum tank.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.230
It spirals through the magnetic
field and at each of these gaps,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.030
it gets a jolt of energy
until it has enough energy

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:56.910
to reach the very edge of the
tank where it can be directed

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.070
through another magnetic field out

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.030
and toward the target
for bombardment.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.660
Well, Lawrence knows
he's on to something.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.600 position:56%
The very next day, he's seen
bounding across the Berkeley campus,

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.500
but in the holing friends and
colleagues and declaring I'm going

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.280
to be famous, and so he was.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.140
Over the next decade, Lawrence's
team, using the cyclotron

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.780
to bombard nuclei, discovered
scores of new isotopes including

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.450 position:56%
for example carbon 14, which we
know of for its use in carbon dating

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.440
and for other biological
investigations.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.750
Other isotopes became the
foundation of the new science

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.330
of nuclear medicine and
the sources of new cures

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.140
and there were new elements to be
discovered heavier than uranium,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.800
which has not been seen
in the natural state,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.470
like element 94 plutonium.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.500
Every discovery made by the
cyclotron opened new business

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.020
and raise new questions
which hadn't--

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.570
and Lawrence responded by designing
new cyclotrons, each one bigger

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:07.440
and more powerful and more
expensive than the last.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.290
Big science took shape rapidly.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.610
In my book, I quote the
physicist Maurice Goldhaber,

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.800
who's career expand the transition
from small science to big science

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.750
and he recalled as he
put it that the first man

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.920
to disintegrate a nucleus
was Ernest Rutherford

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.760
and he could hold the
apparatus in his lap.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.720 position:56%
Then he said "I remember the
picture of all the scientist sitting

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.600
in the cyclotron's lap and that
gives you an idea of the change."

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.580
And yes, here's Ernest
Rutherford in his lab,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.330
perhaps not holding his
apparatus in his lab,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.750
but you can see it all arrange

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.480
on a rather cluttered
laboratory table next to him.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.730
And here's that picture of the
cyclotron that Goldhaber remembers.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.280 position:56%
Twenty seven scientist of Lawrence's
radiation lab in Berkeley sitting

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.140
in inside the magnet of
their new 60-inch cyclotron.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.730
Remarkably, there are three
Nobel Laureates in this picture.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.060
Let's see there is Luis
Alvarez, right here.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.270
Ed McMillan is over here.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.440
I think that's-- I've got McMillan

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.280
who was not only Lawrence's
successor as head of his lab

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.090
but also his brother
in law and, of course,

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.080
Ernest Lawrence is right here in
the middle and one more scientist

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.080
who perhaps stands as the
most accomplished physicist,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.270
never to get the Nobel Prize

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.540
and that's J. Robert
Oppenheimer who was right up here.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.280
Well, in 1939, Lawrence won the
Nobel Prize for the cyclotron

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.370
and what was really
notable about the award was

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.490
that for the first time, the
Nobel committee recognized

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.380
that the technique of scientific
investigation had become equally

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.070
important as-- or perhaps even
more important than theory alone.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.830 position:56%
And Lawrence demonstrated not merely
inspired scientific technique,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.640
but a genius for scientific
management.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.610
He showed that when you needed
to raise millions of dollars

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.300
to build your apparatus,
you had to show the genius

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.190
of an entrepreneur,
a general, a CEO.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.990
You had to find ways to raise
money from university presidents,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.550
foundation boards, industrial
executives and government officials

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.300
and for scientist,
this was a new religion

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.680
and Ernest Lawrence was to profit.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:38.810
Well, the 1939 Nobels were the last
to be awarded until the war clouds

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.740
over Europe began to
dissipate four years later

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.090
and that brings us I
think to the central event

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.350
in Ernest Lawrence's career.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:52.220
The Manhattan project will
validate the big science paradigm.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.210
The atomic bomb could
never have been invented

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.000
by a solitary physicist working

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.630
in his solitary lab using
hand made equipment.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.980
It required an investment
of billions of dollars,

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.200 position:56%
armies of scientist and technicians.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.800
Laboratories build on
an industrial scale.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.570
The Manhattan project was the
first great big science program

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.540
and it proved how powerful
an approach this could be

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.180
when it brought together a
large team, in that case more

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.560
than 10,000 scientists
pursuing a shared goal.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.440
Now, many of, you know, doubt know
at least the outlines of the making

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.030
of the atomic bomb,
the efforts starting

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.350
with Albert Einstein's famous
letter to Franklin Roosevelt

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.170 position:56%
in August 1939, actually the letter
written by the physicist Leo Szilard

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.990
and signed by Albert Einstein.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.430 position:56%
Observing that the recent
discovery of nuclear fission implied

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.020 position:56%
that bombs could be constructed
from fissionable uranium and warning

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.620
that Nazi Germany might already
be working on the problem.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.790
The US government swung into
action creating a high level

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.750
of uranium committee to
investigate the possibility.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.960
But almost immediately, the
effort became bogged down

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.690
and bureaucracy and inertia.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.240 position:56%
By mid 1941, the two men responsible

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.840
from marshaling America's
scientific manpower and resources

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.390
for the coming war, Vannevar
Bush of the Carnegie Institution

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.040
and James Conant of
Harvard were on the verge

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.920
of cancelling the uranium
bomb project altogether.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.240 position:56%
And the reasons were understandable.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.040
Physicists in America
haven't made the case

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.350
that a bomb could be developed in
time to help win the coming war.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.560
And if that was so, then
every dime spent on a project

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.840
like that would be a dime wasted
because it would be diverted

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.410
from the effort necessary
to win the war.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.450 position:56%
But then it fell to Lawrence himself
to interpose his personal reputation

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.020 position:56%
in front of the young men, convinced

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.380
that cancellation would be a
short sided and dangerous step,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.680
he demanded a face-to-face
meeting with Conant.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.060
And for the first time, James
Conant heard a physicist

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.480
of undisputed stature explain not
only that the bomb was feasible

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.350
in the short term,
but it was urgent.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.900
The opinion of the physics
community, Lawrence explained,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.420
especially among those who had
fled Germany and Austria and come

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.570
to the US and the UK was that the
scientists who had stayed behind

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:24.870
in the Third Reich, people

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:29.630
like Werner Heinsenberg were
intellectually more than capable

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.610
of designing efficient
bomb themselves.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:36.320
And as Lawrence told Conant, if the
Nazi succeed first, they will have

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.240
in their hands the
control of the world.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.470
Well Conant listened and
he was sort of convinced

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.590
but one thing still bothering him.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.840
"If only you scientist are so
sure that a bomb is feasible

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.960
and necessary", he said, "How
come none of you has volunteered

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.460
to step ahead and take
over the building of it."

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.820
Ernest he said, "Are you ready
to devote the next few years

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.680
of your life for getting
these bombs made?"

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.230
While Lawrence sort of swallowed
hard and he said, well "Jim,

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.340
if you tell me this is
my job, I will do it."

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.020
And that right there that
saved the atomic bomb program

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.780
and what may be the single
most important meeting

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.950
of the nuclear age, with Ernest
Lawrence's reputation behind it

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.740
and its personal commitment,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.200
what was soon up the Manhattan
project would never again be

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.740
in doubt.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.220
Now, I want to show you
one more photograph,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.720
a very famous historical artifact.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.880 position:56%
This picture was taken in Lawrence's
office in LeConte Hall in 1940

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.880
at Berkeley and it
shows the brain trust

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.030
of American science
just before the war.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.480
From the left, there's
Lawrence and then next to him,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.760
Arthur Holly Compton another Nobel
Laureate and the future transfer

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.310
of Washington University
in Saint Louis.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.510
Vannevar Bush is next to him.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.700
There in front is Conant, just
behind him is Carl Compton,

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.950
Arthur's brother and then the
president of MIT and they're

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.310
over on the right, a mysterious
figure named Alfred Loomis

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:11.230
who had used the millions he
had made as a Wall Street trader

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:16.100
to build a private physics lab at
his state in Tuxedo Park, New York,

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.010
from which he cultivated and funded
many distinguished young physicist

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.450
including Lawrence
and who is functioning

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.870
as a key behind the scenes adviser
to Bush and Conant during the war.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.420
Now these gentlemen had come
to Berkeley as a delegation

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.370
from the Rockefeller Foundation

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.870
because Lawrence had sought a
huge grant from the foundation

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:41.200
to build his biggest cyclotron yet
and he got it, $1.5 million one

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.300
of the largest grants the
foundation had ever made

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.630
to a single researcher.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.870 position:56%
But what's especially remarkable and
important about this photograph is

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.710
that this exact group would come
together a year later to act

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.940
as a scientific supervisors
of the Manhattan project.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.180
Well over the following four years,

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.260
Lawrence would play a
paramount role in that program.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.680
He converted his new
cyclotron into an invention

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.380
to enrich natural uranium
to bomb grade

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.760
by concentrating its
fissionable isotope U-235.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.860 position:56%
He designed and supervised a
construction of the industrial plant

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.120
to manufacture the enriched
product in a rural district

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.030
in Tennessee known as Oak Ridge.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.030
That plant would produce every
atom of the uranium for the bomb

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.360
that was dropped at Hiroshima.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.810
He gave one of his young
associates, the chemist,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.210
Glenn Seaborg priority time on
its other cyclotrons at Berkeley

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.720
to pursue the isolation
of plutonium,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.540
which would become the core of
the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.560
And when General Leslie Groves, the
head of the project came around,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.130
looking for someone to head up
the actual designing of the bomb

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.940
at the lab that became Los Alamos,
Lawrence nominated his close friend

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.960
and Berkeley colleague, Robert
Oppenheimer, and got him the job.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.710
Now, all that being said, what
about the moral implications

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.020
of this work not only
Lawrence's role

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.830
but big science's role in the war?

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:16.170
And, you know, the study of
history is an exercised in looking

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.420
at advance through the eyes
of the people who live them

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.490
but also applying the perspective
of the years or the decades.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.150
These exercises especially
complicated with nuclear weapons

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.510
because we're so familiar with
the consequences of this work.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.990
We know the toll in lives
and suffering from Hiroshima

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.250
and Nagasaki, we know the
horrific disfigurements

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.930
and long term illnesses of the
civilian residence of those cities,

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.430
unlike anything experienced

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.300
by any other survivors
of warfare in history.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.650
We know the cloud that civilization
has lived under for 70 years

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.360 position:56%
because of the decision in the 1940s

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.160
to unleash the distractive
capacity of the nucleus.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.220
And we know that the Nazis never
actually did have an atomic bomb

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.730
program because the scientists who
stayed behind got the physics wrong

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.490
and concluded it could
never be built.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.160
But, of course, the allies didn't
know that until the war was over.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.650
Now Germany surrendered in 1945
changed the calculus of this work

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.900
but not the momentum of the effort.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.490
But by then, the bombs
were nearly complete.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.600
The impulse to use them was still
strong, to bring a quick end

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.680
to the war and the final
debate among scientist

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.560
and political leaders
before Hiroshima was

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.100
over whether dropping the bombs

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.630
on the unsuspecting
Japanese was truly necessary

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.230
or whether a demonstration say

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.440
over an unpopulated island would
deliver a sufficiently compelling

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.360
and grim message to
the Japanese regime.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.520
The record tells us that the last
hold out against dropping the bombs

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.080
on civilians was Lawrence himself,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.480
but that eventually he too
acknowledged that the risk of it

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.290
that and thus a demonstration that
wouldn't work was too great and he

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.910
and Oppenheimer together signed
the manifesto that was sent

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.970
in Washington, endorsing
the dropping of the bomb.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.100
Now many of the big scientists

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.140
who developed the atom bomb
including Oppenheimer would soon

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.060
reconsider their role.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.140
Many would work to promote the
cause of international patrol

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.640 position:56%
over nuclear technology, recognizing

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.380
that what big science had unleashed
could be managed safely only

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.550
through a new conception of
geopolitics and diplomacy.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.500
Many others would work
to develop nuclear power

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.780
and other peaceful
technologies, perhaps in the hopes

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.740
of expiating the moral
qualms that Hiroshima

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.980
and Nagasaki had brought them to.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.420
Well, Ernest Lawrence
was not among them.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.790
Interest fiction was
not his strong suit

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.040
and when he's old friend
Robert Oppenheimer declared

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.140
that through the atomic bomb,
physicists had come to no seen,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.630
he responded rather
petulantly that nothing

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.820
about his work had
caused him to no seen.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.280
And that was still
true after the war,

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.570
when he became the nation's
leading scientific promoter

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.820
of the hydrogen bomb, a weapon that
many of his own colleagues viewed

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.430
as nothing but a genocidal device

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.510
and that even the pentagon
acknowledge could never be used

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:25.740
in a military campaign but
only as a psychological threat.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.790
But because Ernest died in 1958,
we don't know what he would've made

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.960
of the nuclear world big
science helped create.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.020
His widow, Molly, thought
he would've been a cast

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.400
at nuclear proliferation.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.850
In the late 1980s in fact, she
was so appalled at the role

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.540
in the arms race played
by Lawrence's own lab

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:52.110 position:56%
that she petitioned Congress to take
her husband's name off the facility.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.100
Well, Congress turned her down
and to this day it's known

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.360
as Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.600
But what we can say I think is

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.530
that science itself can't
be seen as good or evil.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:10.150
We can only render judgment on
what human that kind makes of it.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.380
Ernest Lawrence says "New paradigm

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.290
of scientific research has given us
knowledge about the natural world

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.820
that his own contemporaries
could only dream of.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.310
It's given us isotopes

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.480
and diagnostic techniques
that save lives.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.240
It put men on the moon.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.550
It's given us new knowledge
about our own biology.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.490
It provides us with waste to battle
disease and it may provide us

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.630
with weapons against climate change
even as it's given us the tools

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.780
to destroy ourselves too.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.170
And I'd like to leave you with
one last topic to think about

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.640
and that's whether after 70

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.290
or 80 years we may have
reached the political

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:51.100
and economic limits of big science.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.150
The reason that the Large Hadron
Collider is the biggest accelerator

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:59.640
in the world is that the United
States abandoned its own parallel

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:05.440
project, the super conducting,
super collider in the 1990s mostly

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.560
because its budget
had grown so huge,

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.940
but also because the scientific
community itself was not united

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.670
behind it.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.530 position:56%
Almost since the beginning, the cost

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.450
of big science has
prompted its critics

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.160
to ask whether it can get too
expensive, whether it leads us

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.070
to value, monumental scientific
efforts more than programs

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.130
that might have a direct
relevance to our daily lives

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.100
like ending poverty or hunger.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.500
Big science has helped
make our universities great

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.690
but it's also helped turn our
professors into administrators,

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:45.210
housekeepers and publicists all
for the cause of raising more money

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.670
to make science even bigger.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.640
And part of that, I think it's
the political fear it inspires

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.970
because some politicians including
many in congress today recognize

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.200
that left alone big science
can yield discoveries

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.390
that change the world
and that, of course,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:05.310
is always a threat
to in trans interest.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.880
Now that said one thing I think
we can be confident about is

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.440
that the human thirst for
knowledge is never quenched.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.640
And that if-- and if we want
to an illustration of that,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.610
just consider the excitement
felt a year ago.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.430
Not only among astronomers
and cosmologist

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.720
but among the general public about
the extraordinary photos of Pluto

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.270 position:56%
that came from the new horizon
space graph after a nine year voyage

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.690
to the absolute limits
of our solar system,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:38.310
findings that are already
changing scientist understanding

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.520
of the life arc of planets.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.930
So yes, Laurence's genius gave us
new access to knowledge but as true

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.780
with almost every that
gain came at a cause.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.180
He helped us to learn a lot

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.880
but he also gave us a
lot more to think about.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.250 position:56%
And with that with his image and
Laurence himself overlooking the lab

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.690
that he built in a ravine above
the Berkeley campus, I'll thank you

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.510
for listening and throw in
the floor for questions.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:16.130
[ Applause ]

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.920
OK. Again, if you want to ask
some questions we have microphones

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.190 position:56%
up here at the front in both aisles.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.820
So let it rip.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.240
&gt;&gt; Shall we start?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.240
After the war Heisenberg, some
with controversially claimed

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.620
that he had deliberately made
a mistake in the payload needed

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.770
for the weapon in order to slow
down the German atomic bomb project

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.690
that he didn't want Hitler to have.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.740
Obviously there's a
self-serving aspect to that.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.550
Do you think there's
any merit to it as well?

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Well, you
know, I'm not actually sure

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.380
that Heisenberg made that claim
whether it was made on his behalf.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.950
But it's clear if you're familiar

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.600
with the so-called
Farm Hall Transcripts.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.280
Farm Hall was a farm house in
the UK where a German physicist

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.570
that he says would stay behind
we're rounded up after the war

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.140
by the allies and they were shipped
to this form and put together

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.450 position:56%
and they were allowed to communicate
with each and meet and socialize

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.120
and every word they
uttered was bogged.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.880
And it was clear from those
conversations and it's clear

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.130
from those transcripts that
these scientists were absolutely

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.720
flabbergasted when the word came

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.520
over that the bomb
existed and it was dropped.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.660
They were not prepared
for this having happened.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.150
It's-- it really looks
from the transcripts

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.970
that they had a lot
of disagreements.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.550
They were blaming each other for
who made the mistakes that led

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.710
to their failure but it really
does look like it was not so much

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.490
of deliberate mistake
as a misconception

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:52.560
about the essential
physics of atomic bombs.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:34:00.410
So, yeah, I think that Heisenberg
or his patrons wanted to make hero

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.510
out of him or make
him look more heroic

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.240
but I think there is
reason to doubt that story.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.180
&gt;&gt; OK. You said that before
the atomic bomb was dropped

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:16.560
on Hiroshima there was a
debate among the physicists

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.780
about whether the bomb should be
dropped as a demonstration on an--

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:28.030
on populated island, and the fear
was that they might drop a dot.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.790
Why was that that there
was no concern

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.730
about them dropping
a dot on Hiroshima?

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Well I
think if you're dropping a--

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:43.430
I mean, the idea was that a dot
was going to be bad if it failed

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:46.080
to shorten the war
in a demonstration,

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.830
but if you're dropping the bomb
in warfare you're, you know,

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.670
you're basically in for
a penny, in for a pound.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.030
There was concern that
it would be that if--

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.060
just to go into a little bit more
detail than you may be asking for,

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.900
the bomb that was dropped down
in Hiroshima was a one off bomb.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.940
It was a simple bomb because
of the qualities of uranium

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.100
that didn't really think
it was going to be a dude

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.780
but they never tested
it because the engineers

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.330
who built it thought it
was basically a trivial

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.630
engineering device.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.260
It was the plutonium bomb
that was tested in trinity

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.700
because that was a new technology,
nobody was sure it would work.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.550
But I think the idea was they
didn't really think it would a dude

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:33.160 position:56%
but the consequences of that fissile
they thought would much worst

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:40.810 position:56%
than if the goal was to shock the
Japanese regime into ending the war.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:45.650
Then, since they only have the one
uranium bomb, they needed to use it

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.950
in a way that it might work.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.820
&gt;&gt; Hi. I have two parts
of my question.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.740
One, during the time the bomb
was made, were we really worried

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:01.320
about Germany making atomic
bomb, but why did we not worry

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.730
about Japan making atomic bomb?

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.640
And the other part is, if we used
bomb, the atomic bomb in Germany,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.100
could we be benefited the cold war?

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Well the
question is, if we're worried

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.530
about Germany making the bomb why
were we not equivalently worried

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.830
about Japan?

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.610
Is that the question?

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:25.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: I think
the conception of Japanese

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:32.380 position:56%
as enemies was quite a bit different
from the conception of Germany.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.450
In part because we
had so many scientists

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.050
in other people other figures
here in the US and then the UK

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.160
who had direct experience
with the Nazi regime

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.210
and they saw it as
uniquely fearsome.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.110
I don't think there was
quite as much concern

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:50.400
that Japan was banned
on world domination.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.330
They would certainly concern that
it was bent on regional domination.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.920
And it was-- and it was
not as much of a fear

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:02.120
that Japan had the understanding
or the technology that was resident

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:06.780
over in Germany still, even after
all these physicists had left.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.420
So there's very different attitude.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.440
I don't think the Japanese
were nearly as feared in terms

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.540
of their ambitions as the Germans.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I wonder if you could talk just
a little bit about the current state

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:29.080
of funding for science that I've
read that there's less money

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.670
for basics science and
more aimed at science

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.250
that can assist corporate products,

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.710
corporate technology,
industrial technology.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Sure.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.130
I think there's good reason to
be concerned at what's happened

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.910
to scientific funding
especially in the US

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:51.370
over recent years,
really recent decades.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.420
The government, which
had become a major patron

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.720
of basic scientific research
after the war and well

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.890
into the postwar period has
been withdrawing essentially,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.470
it's been stepping back
from this sort of funding.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:09.150
In part, because of
political pressure but also

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.480
because of budgetary
concern, you know,

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.610
essentially conservative
budget making.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:20.480
Now, I think that's got
two affects that scientism

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.180
and we all really should
be concerned about.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:30.570
One is that basic science is facing
in many ways the starvation budget

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.910 position:56%
and that should be a concern because
this is our seed corn after all.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.290
You don't get applied science.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.690
You don't get advance technology
until you start with basic science

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:44.430
and you pursue it in a way
that follows its own logic.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:48.870
You can't direct basic science
to happen within a timeframe.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:53.340
You can't direct basic
science to its specific goal.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.860
You have to let it go
where it leads you.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:00.550
Now, as the government has stepped
back, its role has been taken

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.350
over more and more by industry.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:08.410
Now, in some ways that's good
because industry has a lot of money

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:13.290
but in many ways it's bad because
industry is simply not inclined

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:18.190
to invest in basic science because
it can't see an immediate payoff

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.750 position:56%
and that's understandable but that's
why we have government funding

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.050
of projects like this.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:27.020
Now in previous books, I've written
about the birth of the internet

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.740
and the construction of Hoover Dam.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.160
These were all projects that were
undertaken in their early stages

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.520
by government agencies

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.270
because private industry
couldn't see an immediate payoff

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.300
or a direct payoff for itself

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.420
so it wouldn't pursue
this work on its own.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.560
And that's what we're going to see
as industry takes on the funding

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.620
of scientific research
more and more.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.740
It's going to become
more inner-directed.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:59.290
It's going to become more
directed at the core business lines

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.040
of those industries and
we're going to give up.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.520
We're going to lose a lot
of research opportunities

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:12.380 position:56%
that we would have if we really were
still supporting basic research,

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.610
not only to the degree
we have in the past

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.350
but to an even greater degree.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:21.930
So as I said, I think we should all
be very concerned about this trend.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.880
We should be concern about the
political attack on basic science

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.800
and the misunderstanding and
maybe deliberate misunderstanding

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.900
that we get on Capitol Hill
about the value of this work and,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.660
you know, we should hope that
we can reverse that trend.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.560
Oh, I'm sorry, over here.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.050
&gt;&gt; OK. Oh, my question is, you
know, very short and simple

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.450
but then I'll give some background
and what I can remember just

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.670
so that I'm sure, you know,
this country is so great

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.820
and so is the scientist--
science community.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.340
But in between, I see a lot of
dragging around and, you know,

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.530
a lot of unnecessarily
suffering that people are going

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.560
through especially
decent people like myself.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.870
So, for that purpose, do you
think of the science community

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.740
or the scientist and the,
you know, because they work

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.270
on that true facts,
not about or writing

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.690
about imaginary thing
Shakespeare and this and that.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.540
So is-- are they empowered?

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:24.660
I bet they are but just to educate
the masses, are they the most--

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.920
are they the all president of the
United States or the president

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.250
of the world or, you know,
that kind of council?

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.390
Is it still being worked or is it--

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.400
or have they already reached
that status or it's a struggle

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.310
between the other groups
for example navy, army,

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.480
you know, air force this and that?

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:47.710
So the reason I'm saying that
is, some are I think betting

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:52.240
on the power of Noah's arc
or kind of and which is kind

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.620
of make sense when
the things keep on.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.950
You know, if the parents are
very nice, the children are from,

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:01.050
you know, different kind of world
or whatever and they rescuable

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.350 position:56%
for food crams and things like that.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:06.320
It gets so nasty that the
others will think, "Oh,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.490
we got our Noah's arc so,
you know, we got our thing

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.390 position:56%
and let them do whatever they like."

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.680
I feel like that sort of thing
is going on on a rampant scale.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.820
So for example in Japan and the
Germany thing, I know there's--

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.880
I bet they have finished or
accomplished lot of closure on--

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.260
in terms of how their family
died and this and that.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Well--

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But in terms of like-- for
example the Germans or the Japanese,

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.630
I think they're the most
beautiful people, you know?

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.760
And now that many generations
have passed down,

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.200
are they able to differentiate
for example in sort

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.190
of attacking the all good
Germans or the all good Japanese

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.430
or the good Americans or the
good Saudis or whatever rather

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.890
than saying that, "Oh, these
are, you know, basically this

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.320
but they look similar" but
it's because they are Turkish

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.340
or they are Iranians and then
they are hybrids and this and that

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.860
and then some of them they
get the equal power and--

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: All right.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.460
I--

00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, OK.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Yeah.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.360
I think what--

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.660
&gt;&gt; So yeah.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.960
So my goal is to-- yeah,
minimize the hurts and the things

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.260
that they know, not--
that don't need to go

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.670
through when we have all these
beautiful heaven land I should

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.150
at this rate.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.680
At this rate, I think nobody
should be suffering and arguing

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.590
and feeling a free to
what-- if I see this world,

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.400
my bike would be stolen
when I get out of the--

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: OK.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.000
Yeah. Let me--

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.300
&gt;&gt; -- convention hall.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.600
OK, sir. So in other words, how
much power signs community the

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.900
scientist have?

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: All right, let
me just try to, you know, I mean,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.640
what you're getting at is sort
of a permanent tension among all

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.530
of these sort of groups and
factors in science and politics.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.740
And I don't think we're ever going
to be able to get away from that

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.380
but we really just have to
work our way through it.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.380
And let me take another
question on this side then.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.160
&gt;&gt; Do you have a question to make?

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.000
&gt;&gt; He wanted to know,
Michael, what--

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.570
could you tell us about
your next project?

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:57.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Well, my
next project is a departure.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.290
It's going to be a book
about the gilded age,

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.980
the original gilded age of 1890s.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:10.060
And the consequences for America of
the creation of the Great Railroad

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.970
as the first great American big
business, so it's a departure

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.240
from this book, they're not
necessarily from my previous book.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.680
And I think there's
another question here.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.980
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: And this may
be the last one we have time for.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.580
Yeah.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.880
&gt;&gt; So this goes back to you,

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.180
the comments you're
making about funding.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.480
I'm curious you're talking about
a little bit of an evolution

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.700
from growing our scientists
to the big science.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.580
And now we live in this YouTube
age, blog celebrities, Kickstarter.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.820
How is that affecting, you
know, ground level innovation,

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.270
especially in the sciences there
how could it in the future?

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Hiltzik: Well
that's a good question.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.870
I-- you're right.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.170
There is a trend of
course towards sort

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:53.140
of the entrepreneurial scientist
and funding that comes in new ways.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:59.260
I think there's also a reason to
be concerned about sort of the--

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.940
I guess the commercialization
of early stage science

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:07.230
that we're seeing in places like
Silicon Valley and elsewhere.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:13.730
We certainly have seen cases where
scientist working on basic science

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:19.140
at publicly funded institutions
end up sort of hiding their work

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.360 position:56%
from colleagues because they can
see some commercial potential in it.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.110
Laurence himself was very
skeptical about patenting even.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.680
And this was a skepticism
that was much more common

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.600
in his day than it is now.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.360
He resisted patenting
the cyclotron originally

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.180
but he himself had patrons who
said, look, you have to protect,

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.880
you have to protect your invention

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.980
from commercial exploitation
that you can't control.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.770
So they insisted that he
file a patent and he did.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.660
Reluctantly he didn't
like the process.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.580
He didn't like having to explain
his work through patent examiners

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.880
who couldn't understand it.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.310
Later in his career, he was under
pressure to patent the isotopes

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.040
that we're coming out of his lab.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.380
He resisted that and
he won that battle.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.770
In part, he won it by default
because the patent examiners

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:16.090
of the day couldn't be convinced
that that the creation of isotopes

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:19.880
which were natural
materials could actually be

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.380
that this could be
patentable inventions

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.030
but he didn't like the idea.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.420
He didn't like it originally.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:30.360
He didn't like the encouraging
of that sort of commercialism

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.410
and politics into his lab.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:36.760 position:56%
But I think this was a tide that he
tried to hide back and he wasn't all

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.120
that successful in doing.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.590
So-- And so I think that's it.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.140
If you have more questions
I'm right here and feel free

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.810
to come up and say hello.

[ Applause ]

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.410
