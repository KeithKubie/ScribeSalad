right now I'm a material science to me

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860
right now I'm a material science to me
 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.139
right now I'm a material science to me
and engineering made everybody also

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149
and engineering made everybody also
 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.150
and engineering made everybody also
wanted to do biomedical engineering and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160
wanted to do biomedical engineering and
 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.740
wanted to do biomedical engineering and
because of Carnegie Mellon's program I

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
because of Carnegie Mellon's program I
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.870

gotta be able to not only study

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
gotta be able to not only study
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340
gotta be able to not only study
engineering but also take choir classes

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
engineering but also take choir classes
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320
engineering but also take choir classes
and immerse myself unlike so many of the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
and immerse myself unlike so many of the

it's so equal this time and especially

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
it's so equal this time and especially
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120
it's so equal this time and especially
means a lot since engineering is like

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
means a lot since engineering is like
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.610
means a lot since engineering is like
typically like not super not that many

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
typically like not super not that many
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350

underrepresented so it's really awesome

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
underrepresented so it's really awesome
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.670
underrepresented so it's really awesome
to be in like my physics and math and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
to be in like my physics and math and
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.709
to be in like my physics and math and
intro classes and like there's so many

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
intro classes and like there's so many
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420
intro classes and like there's so many
girls raising their hands to making up

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
girls raising their hands to making up
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.030
