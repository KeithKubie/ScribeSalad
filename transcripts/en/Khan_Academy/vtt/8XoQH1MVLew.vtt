00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.450
While I was doing my tiny
little bit of analysis

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.220
to figure out whether the basic
or the trial plan made sense,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.890
and we did this whole
analysis of saying well,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.400
at what number of sessions
does the trial plan

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.292
give me the same cost
as the basic plan?

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.000
And I did this whole
calculation and said

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.190
it was at five sessions.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.150
I didn't realize it, but the guy
at the front desk of the yoga

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.884
studio was watching
me the whole time.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:25.550
And then all of a
sudden he said, "Well,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.990
that's all cute
what you did Sal.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.156
I understand what you said."

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:30.650
There's some number
of sessions where

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.120
12s is equal to
20 plus 8s, where

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.870
we get the same exact cost.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.990
And so you said 20 plus
8x is equal to 12 plus s.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.490
Or another way you could say it
is the C that 20 plus 8s gets

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.610
is going to be the same
as the C that 12s gets.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.690
So we just equate them
and then you solved for s.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.664
And then you solved
for the cost.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:55.830
But the guy says, "I have
different way of doing it,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.461
and I'm curious to see if I'm
going to get the same answer."

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.002
So here's a way of
thinking about it.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:00.810
He says, well look.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.809
Look at this right here.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.100
We know from our basic plan
that the total monthly cost

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.330
is actually going to be $20
upfront fee plus $8 per session

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.450
times the number of sessions.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.790
So we know that.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.080
And the whole thing we
wanted to think about

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.020
is at what number of sessions
do we get the same cost for both

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.580
the basic and the trial plan?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.920
So he says, I have an idea.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.080
I have an idea of turning this
into an equation of only one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.580
unknown.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.460
Right now it's an
equation of two unknowns.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.940
I have a certain cost that's
dependent on a certain number

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.330
of sessions.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.607
He thinks he's got a way of
getting rid of the C. He says,

00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:52.690
what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just subtract

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.230
a C from the left-hand side.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.400
And then I quickly point to
him, I was like, look look.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.800
You can't just do one thing
to one side of an equation.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.967
Then the equality
won't be true anymore.

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:12.550
And he's like, oh
no, no, don't worry.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.920
I'm going to do the same
thing on the other side

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.844
of the equation.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.260
And so I tell him,
well, what good

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.136
would that be, subtracting
C from both sides?

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:20.593
Because then you're
going to end up

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:22.260
with a C on the right-hand side.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.869
You're going to end up
with 20 plus 8s minus C. So

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.410
you're not going to
get rid of the C,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.076
you're still going
to have two unknowns.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:30.300
He's like, no, no, no Sal.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.490
You don't get it.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.620
I'm going to subtract C
from the left-hand side,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.660
but I know that we're
looking for an s where

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.290
12s is going to give us
the same as whatever C is.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.930
Whether I use the basic plan or
whether I use the trial plan,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.180
I'm going to get the same cost.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.960
So I'll subtract
the cost, whatever

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.880
that cost is, that same
cost that either the basic

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.490
or the trial plan will
give me, I'll subtract that

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.380
from the left-hand side, because
that'll cancel out with that.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.660
But from the right-hand
side, I'll just subtract 12s.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.260
So he says, I'm just
going to subtract C

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.200
from the left-hand
side and I'm going

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.060
to subtract 12s from
the right-hand side.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.980
So I'm wondering, is
this a valid thing to do?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.270
He's essentially
subtracting this equation

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.860
from that equation.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.840
He's subtracting the C
from the left-hand side

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.970
and he's subtracting this
12s from the right-hand side.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.317
Does that make any sense?

00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:40.650
Well, let's just think about it.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.530
We know that if we have an
equation, if we add or subtract

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.200
one thing to one side, we
have to do the same thing

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.670
to the right-hand side.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.460
What he's doing,
he's saying, look.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.000
For either plan we use,
we know that there's

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.010
some number of
sessions where we're

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.000
going to get the same cost.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.530
So let's subtract that same
cost from the left-hand side.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.170
And that's going to be
the same thing as 12s.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.919
We know that this
has to be true.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.460
We know that both
of these statements

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.912
have to be true at
this point of equality.

00:04:10.912 --> 00:04:11.620
So he says, look.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.640
If these two things are equal
to each other, subtracting a 12s

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.769
is completely equivalent
to subtracting a C.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.779
So this actually is
a valid operation.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.120
He is subtracting
the same thing.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.970
He's subtracting a
C over here and he's

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.045
subtracting a 12s over here.

00:04:28.045 --> 00:04:29.920
We know they're the same
thing, because we're

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.730
putting that constraint on us.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.110
We know that both C has
to be equal to 20 plus 8s

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.180
and C has to be equal to 12s.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.660
Because C has to
be equal to 12s,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.390
we can subtract C from one
side and 12s from the other.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.740
But let's see if this
actually gets us anywhere.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.090
So if we subtract C from one
side and 12s from the other,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.150
what do we actually get?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.340
Well, let's think it through.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.710
On the left-hand side,
if I have C minus C, well

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.946
I just end up with 0.

00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:04.570
They just completely
negate each other,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.940
and there's nothing left
here on the left-hand side.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.450
So I just have 0 on
the left-hand side.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.597
On the right-hand side,
I have the 20 still.

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:16.430
And then I have 8 of
something, and then I'm

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.750
subtracting 12 of something.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.890
So 8s's minus 12s's is going
to give me negative 4s's.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.050
So that's going to
give me negative 4s's.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.670
So this is interesting now.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.310
I now have one equation
and one unknown.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.930
That one unknown is s.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.050
And so I should be able
to solve for that s.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.050
But how can I do it?

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.420
Well, I always like
to isolate my variable

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.140
on one side of the equation.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.850
And so now, I'll isolate
it on the left-hand side.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.430
And as you know, there's
many, many ways of doing this.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.990
And so, what can I do
if I want to get the s's

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.160
on the left-hand side
and get rid of them

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.010
on the right-hand side?

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.660
Well, if I want to get rid of
them on the right-hand side,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.620
I'm subtracting 4s's here.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.760
I just have to add 4s's.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.800
But once again, I can't just
do that to the right-hand side.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.830
Then the equality
won't be true anymore.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.720
I have to also do that
to the left-hand side.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.350
And so what will that give me?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.070
Well, we get 0 plus 4s
on the left-hand side,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.910
which gives us just 4s.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.300
And that's going to be equal
to-- On the right-hand side,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.500
negative 4s and 4s,
they negate each other.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.000
We're left with just 20.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.020
So we're left with
4s is equal to 20.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.870
To solve for s, we
just divide by 4.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.510
We have 4 times something.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.560
The special number of
sessions is equal to 20.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.492
Well, 4 times
something divided by 4

00:06:45.492 --> 00:06:46.950
is just going to
be that something.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.120
But we can't just divide
the left side by 4.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.360
We also have to divide
the right-hand side by 4.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.880
So we're left with s is
equal to 20 divided by 4,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.530
or s is equal to 5
sessions, which is exactly

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.370
the answer we got before.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.610
And then we can go back
into either of the plans

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.180
and see that the cost
will still be $60.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.130
And so what's neat here
is that both myself

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.630
and the guy at the front
desk of the yoga studio,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.790
we had very, very
different approaches

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.170
to solving this problem.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.380
But because what each of us
did was logically correct--

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.450
and this is what's really
neat about algebra--

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.930
we got to the same conclusion.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.660
As long as we do
logically correct things,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.640
we will always get
to the same answer.
