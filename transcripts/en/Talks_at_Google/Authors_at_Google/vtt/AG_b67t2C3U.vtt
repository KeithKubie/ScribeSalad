KATHARINE NG: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.410
I'm Katharine Ng.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.410
I'm on the Authors@Google Team
at Google Los Angeles.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.660
It's my pleasure today to
welcome Amy Stewart to our

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.020
Authors@Google series.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.320
Amy is the award winning author
of six books on the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
perils and pleasures of the
natural world, including my

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.040
favorites, "Wicked Bugs" and
"Wicked Plants." Today, Amy

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.540
will talk to us about her new
book, "The Drunken Botanist,"

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.360
which is packed with fun facts,
anecdotes, growing

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.190
tips, and 50 boozy drink recipes
that explores every

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.790
conceivable plant that's
transformed into alcohol.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.860
Amy will also guide us through
a tasting of four types of

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.400
spirits made from the strange
and wonderful agave, which

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.650
grows abundantly
in Los Angeles.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.420
So please join me in welcoming
Amy Stewart.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.190
AMY STEWART: Thank you.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.530
And thanks so much for being
here, and for having me.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.530
You must hear this from every
writer who comes here, but

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.590
there is absolutely no way I
could do my job or could have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.920
written this book--

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.410
accurately at least--
without Google.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.890
So thank you for everything
that you do.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.010
Before I get started, a lot of
you are eating lunch, and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.380
probably don't want to taste
until you're finished eating.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.440
But just in case some of you
can't wait, I think it's cruel

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.510
and unusual punishment to put
a flight of spirits in front

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.580
of people and not let
them taste them.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.850
So before we even really get
going, I want to tell you what

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.270
they are in the order.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.530
So that anyone who's eager to
get going right this second

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.720
can move right along.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.780
The pink cup would be number
one, if you want to arrange

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.530
these for yourself.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.690
And that's a blanco.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.530
That's why we're starting
with that.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.570
And that is this lovely
Bacanora.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.540
And I'll explain what Bacanora
is, and how it differs from

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.250
the other agave spirits.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.350
Anyway, this is number one.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.090
It's a blanco.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.500
So it's unaged.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.860
And then I really debated about
the sequence after this.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.940
But I think this is what
we're going to go with.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.310
The blue one would
be number two.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.830
And the blue one is this amazing
Del Maguey mezcal.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.450
This is their Tobala, which
is a cult classics.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.750
You should be very excited to
be able to taste the Tobala,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.710
because it's highly
sought after.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.500
So let's do that one
for number two.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.340
And then your green
cup has the sotol.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.180
So this is sotol.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.450
And it comes from a
different plant.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.790
It comes from a different
region.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.990
We'll talk more about it.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.970
But this is a repozado.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.730
It's been aged a little.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.060
That's why we're putting
it a little later.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.570
That's green, is number three.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.060
And the number four, which
is practically

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.160
dessert, it's so good.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.860
This amazing Don Julio tequila,
it's an anejo.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.700
It's been aged even longer.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.340
And it has all this wonderful
caramel sweetness from the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.640
wood that is just to die for.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.790
That's in the orange cup.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.170
And that would be
the number four.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.800
We will talk more about them
when we get near the end here.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.580
Let me start out a little bit
by just saying, first, how I

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.510
got interested in doing this.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.400
It actually started over
a bottle of gin,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.620
not a bottle of tequila.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.770
Like many great ideas,
it was born in a bar.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.660
I was sitting with a friend of
mine who is actually an agave

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.150
expert in Tucson.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.110
And he had this bottle of gin.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.570
And he said, I've never really
gotten into gin.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.500
I don't get it.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.020
And I said, how can you be
interested in plants, and not

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.640
be excited about gin?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.180
It's just so interesting
how many different

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.990
botanicals are in it.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.550
There's not only the grains that
make up the base spirit.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.270
Because all gin is really
just flavored vodka.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.170
If you're a gin drinker and
you think you don't drink

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.690
vodka I have bad news for you.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.390
You've been drinking vodka
all this time.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.190
But it's flavored with juniper
berries, and other spices,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.890
other plant material
that makes it gin.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.040
So there's all these
plants in here--

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.450
obviously the juniper.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.740
Cardamom's often there.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.940
There's almost always citrus
peel, because the citrus

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.320
amplifies some of the
other flavors.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.480
So I'm talking with my friend.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.580
And I said, there's nothing
but plants in this bottle.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.320
And we're sitting at the bar.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.470
And I start waving
my hands around.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.300
And I'm like, come to think of
it, all of these things are

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.760
nothing but plants.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.680
There's barley.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.820
And there's agave.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.830
There's sugar cane.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.820
And there's grapes.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.330
And there's wheat.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.300
Everything behind the
bar is a plant.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.840
Don't you find that
just amazing?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.830
Somebody should write
a book about that.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.550
And he goes, maybe you
ought to write a book

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.750
about it and shut up.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.840
I wish I could say that
I wrote it down

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.970
on a cocktail napkin.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.700
But probably it was
an index card.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.060
As a writer, I usually have
index cards with me.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.540
But fortunately I could read my

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.660
handwriting the next morning.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.410
So I knew I was doing for
the next few years.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.730
That was the general idea.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.630
And what I set out to do was
really go plant by plant, and

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.650
look at all the things that we
turn into alcohol, starting

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.810
with things like-- let me
see what I've got here.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.100
I've got some of the grains.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.600
Obviously agave, which we're
going to talk more about.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.100
And sugar cane, and corn,
and the roots--

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.600
that's gentian root.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.170
Violets are used.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.420
All sorts of tree bark,
like cinnamon.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.710
Potatoes for vodka.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.000
All the fruits, there's nuts,
and spices, and seeds.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.030
Juniper, fruit like apples.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.640
There's this vast cornucopia
of plants that have been

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.000
fermented and distilled
around the world,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.590
and made into alcohol.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.510
So now when I go into a
liquor store I don't

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.570
really see this anymore.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.370
I see this.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.380
And that's really what
I'm getting at.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.940
The way I wanted to do this
was to talk to botanists.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.510
For every plant there's a
botanist somewhere that has

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.690
devoted her life or his life
to the study of it.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.150
And very often, I was able to
talk to people doing really

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.310
interesting work with the
genetics of these plants and

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.610
their history, their
applications in medicine, the

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.890
chemistry behind them.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.040
I talked a lot of people in
agriculture who are out

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.840
figuring out new varieties
that make better alcohol.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.390
And then, of course,
distillers.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.510
Probably the most grueling part
of the research for this

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.860
book was having to go around to
distilleries and taste and

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.400
talk to the people actually
making this stuff.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.740
I wrote a book on venomous
insects.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.080
And I got no volunteers
to help with the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.750
research for that book.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.540
And with this one, everybody
wanted to come along and carry

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.950
my suitcase, and help.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.880
That was a lot of fun.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.980
And of course all this traveling
around and visiting

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.210
distilleries and buying bottles
of stuff to taste so

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.690
that I could decide whether to
include it in the book or not,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.270
that's all research.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.060
It's all business expenses.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.430
So it's been a fun few years.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.130
The way I decided to approach
it was to start with the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.710
plants that are actually
fermented and distilled to

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.380
make into alcohol.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.500
And that's what we're
going to talk about

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.990
today with the agave.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.440
But there are at least a dozen
plants widely used around the

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.800
world to actually
produce alcohol.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.130
And then others that are added
as flavorings in the middle of

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.830
the process at the distillery,
like hops for beer, or like

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.660
Juniper for gin.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.460
And then at the end of the
process there's all these

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.000
plants that you might grow
yourself, or buy at the

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.410
farmer's market or whatever, to
mix and muddle and infuse

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.970
and make it into drinks.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.700
That's the journey that
the drinks take.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.520
And I decided that would be the
journey that I would take,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.970
as well, with all of this.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.500
Let me start by just a quick
disclaimer, a quick venture

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.990
into very complex botanical
science, which is this.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.180
This is what plants are doing.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.920
They're taking sunlight, carbon
dioxide, and water.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.270
And they're doing two things.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.540
They're producing oxygen.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.520
And they're producing glucose.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.450
The part of it we're interested
in is, of course,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.040
the glucose.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.560
They take the sugar.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.230
And they store it in all kinds
of interesting ways that make

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.970
for a great drink.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.230
Obviously they put it into
fruit, in the case of wine.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.830
And why is the plant
doing that?

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.420
It's probably doing that as
a bribe, so that a bird or

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.390
someone will want to eat it, and
help move the seed around.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.110
Sometimes they're storing
it in the roots,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.100
like potatoes do.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.419
They put the sugar in the
tubers, because that's where

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.620
the next generation of potatoes
will come from.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.450
In the case of sugar cane, they
store it in the stalk.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.840
And every length of sugar cane,
every node in a stalk of

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.050
sugar cane has root tissue
and leaf tissue in it.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.640
So you can take a cut piece
of sugar cane and

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.920
put it in the ground.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.340
And there's enough sucrose
in the stalk to support

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.520
life for the plant.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.380
And it'll root, and put
up leaves if the

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.760
conditions are right.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.750
And then of course grains
are nothing but seeds.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.540
Plants take sugar and
turn it into starch,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.400
and put it into grains.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.930
So that when the little seedling
starts to emerge, it

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.180
has something to eat.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.310
Because it's not yet big enough
to make its own food.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.350
In the case of grains, it's
a little bit unusual.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.510
I'll just explain quickly
what happens.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.020
When it gets wet, when a seed
gets wet, little enzymes go to

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.350
work in the seed, breaking the
starch back into sugar.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.370
And that's called malting
in the booze world.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.880
So when you hear about malted
barley, that's what it means.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.360
It means they've gotten it
wet to force it to start

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.500
terminating, just like this.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.920
And that's how malted
barley begins.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.830
It just so happens that barley
has so many of those enzymes

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.570
that break starch into sugar
that barley is used in

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.300
everything.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.740
It's used a lot of beers, and a
lot of whiskeys and vodkas.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.230
Because once it's done
converting its own starch to

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.680
sugar, it will go to work on
corn, and wheat, and rye, and

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.140
whatever else is in the mash.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.970
So that's why you always see
malted barley in everything.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.250
It's unusually good at doing
that little trick.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.630
A little bit of chemistry
as well.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.410
And that is this.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.940
Sorry for all the complicated
scientific diagrams.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.410
But what's happening here when
we make alcohol is that we

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.500
take sugar.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.180
And we feed it to yeast.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.210
And yeast eat the sugar, and
excrete two waste products--

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.480
carbon dioxide and alcohol.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.160
So that's where the
bubbles come from.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.570
And that's where the
booze comes from.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.290
It's a little more complicated
than that.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.420
But pretty much this is how we
take plant sugar and make it

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.220
into booze.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.580
And the yeast that we use
has been domesticated.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.450
It's probably the oldest
domesticated

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.100
creature on the planet.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.710
We domesticated it long before
we domesticated any

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.700
other kind of animal.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.860
Because making drinks was a
high priority early on.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.590
It's not always as simple,
though, as just

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.010
feeding sugar to yeast.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.280
A grape is not just
a sugar cube.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.880
There's a lot of other complex
molecules in there.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.020
So there's other things going
on in that process.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.850
And agave is particularly
weird.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.330
And we'll walk through
the process.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.650
But with agave, where's
the sugar?

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:22.610
The heart of the agave that
is used to ferment to make

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.850
tequila mezcal, the sugar is
not immediately apparent.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.040
This mash tub has a lot
going on in it.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.740
But these are slow-roasted,
caramelized sugars that will

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.990
then be fermented.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.270
Once it's fermented,
it gets distilled.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.140
You just heat it up.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.420
And the steam rises.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.270
And it coils and condenses.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.860
And you get alcohol.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.720
That's the very basic process
for most booze, agave being a

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.340
little different.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.850
And that's what we'll
do today.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.960
But the stills can be anything
from a very simple thing like

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.630
I just showed you
a picture of.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.200
These are a little more
complex and high tech.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.890
This is the Saint George
distillery in Alameda, and

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.850
obviously a little bit
more complicated

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.570
equipment to make vodka.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.840
But at its heart you're
just boiling it and

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.360
extracting the alcohol.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:16.610
When you do that, you can
distill to whatever proof you

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.790
would like.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.020
And the clear neutral spirits
are often distilled to a very

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.850
high proof and then
watered back down.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.070
So vodka might be sold
as 40% alcohol.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.170
But it would have been distilled
to 80%, maybe 90%,

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.500
and then watered back down.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.670
Whiskeys and some of these
agave spirits never get

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.570
distilled quite that high.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.130
And that's where a lot of
the flavor comes from.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.770
Just the distillation process
alone affects the taste.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.760
I don't expect you
to memorize this.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.490
But I just put it up
here to show you a

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.720
complex process it is.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.750
A lot of other stuff comes
out of the still.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.410
The first stuff to come out has
the lowest boiling point.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.130
So it lifts out first.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.480
And it's nasty.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.560
It's like nail polish remover.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.540
You do not want to drink it.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.200
Those are what distillers
call the heads.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.310
And that gets cut out
and thrown away.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.440
And then what they call the
heart is just ethyl alcohol.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.320
That's the good stuff.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.490
That's what we drink.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.720
And then at the end, the
things with the highest

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.100
boiling point lift out last.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.650
And they're also pretty nasty,
and not things you

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.930
really want to drink.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.460
A whiskey maker leaves a little
of them in for flavor.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.990
Because they do taste
kind of good.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.470
But you can't drink
very much of it.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.030
It would be very toxic.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.030
So the tails are also cut
out and not used.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.530
That's just the very basic
overview of how the process

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.310
works, in general,
for everything.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.500
I also want to mention, in case
you're wondering-- if

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.710
you're sitting here right now
thinking, wait a minute, if

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.200
all that stuff is present in
the mash, and as you're

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.460
distilling it you're throwing
out the really toxic stuff,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.940
what about beer and wine?

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.850
Wouldn't all that stuff
be in there, then?

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.270
And the answer is,
yeah, it is.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.690
But in such small quantities
that you're not going to drink

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.790
enough to get sick.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.240
Well, you could drink
enough to get sick.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.490
But please don't.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.550
It's just there's so much
else in the bottle.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.040
There's water.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.770
And there's a lot of other
things going on.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.840
But the is yes, to a certain
extent that stuff is in there.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.880
And winemakers and beer makers
very carefully control their

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.010
process to get the product they
want, and not have a lot

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.110
of other, nasty, volatile
components in there that they

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.840
don't like.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.240
That's part of the mastery of
beer making and winemaking, is

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.690
doing that well.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.680
Let's get straight
to the agave.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.440
It has an amazing
history, really.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.010
We know this because of cave
paintings like these, and also

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.840
a certain amount
of literature.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.650
When Europeans arrived,
we burned--

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.910
we arrived in Latin America,
we burned their books.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.030
They had written science.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.090
They had written literature.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.730
They had a written history.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.340
And a lot of those books, we
took them and we burned to

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:11.740
them, as part of our needing
to take over their culture.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.690
So there's not much
the survives.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.950
But there are some--

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.390
these are called codices, these
codex, you'll see them.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.930
They're still in libraries.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.170
That survives.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.370
Cave paintings survive.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.390
And archaeological evidence
survives.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.620
So we know that they were making
alcohol with agave

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.340
prior to the Europeans'
arrival.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.970
Mostly they were
making pulque.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.370
I'll show you what that looks
like in a minute.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.490
But the other thing we have,
the other bit of

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.130
archaeological evidence
we have--

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.100
most of you are more or
less finished eating.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.600
I think you'll be able to
get through this OK.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.470
There's this amazing
archaeologist who has done

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:55.450
analysis of coprolites, which
are basically fossilized feces

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.850
found at archaeological sites.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.710
I didn't know if you knew that
was a job, but that's a job.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.420
In case any of you are looking
to make a career

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.820
move, that's an option.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.720
And what he actually figured out
is that he could rehydrate

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.570
them and tell by the smell how
much pulque or agave--

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.030
I'm sorry.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.370
That's as gross as it's
going to get.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.700
You'll be OK.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.350
But he was able to detect high
levels of pulque, or this

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:27.500
fermented agave drink, just
by doing that analysis.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.920
There's also drawings that
show people making and

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.590
drinking this stuff.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.630
And certainly by the time the
Europeans arrived, once the

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.540
Europeans got here, they
more thoroughly

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.100
documented the process.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.440
So to make pulque--

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.630
some of you guys have surely had
pulque, because we're here

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.580
in Southern California.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.760
You've been to Mexico.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.380
You know what the stuff is.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.200
It is fermented from
the agave sap.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.110
So it's a totally different
process from how these spirits

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:56.090
are made, and different species
of agave are used.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.070
But basically the really simple
version is that as this

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.700
agave plant is getting ready
to put up its central

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.359
flowering stalk, it is cut and
scraped so that sap starts to

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.160
flow from the center
of the agave plant.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.420
And you draw off that
sap, and ferment it.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.060
At the time, of course,
it was just

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.880
fermented with wild yeast.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.240
And you make this mildly
alcoholic drink that doesn't

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.400
stay good for very long.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.750
You cannot go by pulque in the
grocery store in a can.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.270
It's an actively fermenting
thing.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.010
And it goes south after
a few days.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.460
It starts to get really sour.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.080
It's a very short lived thing.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.230
But they were definitely
making pulque

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.330
when Europeans arrived.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.550
So that was a very old
tradition, and an ancient use

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.360
of the plant.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.200
Just some other photos, just so
you can get a sense of the

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.830
enormity of these plants, and
the way this process looked.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.640
What they're doing is they're
extracting the sap by using,

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.280
in this case, a gourd
to siphon it off.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.790
It's a really interesting
process.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.130
Now agave sap is sort of
hard to work with.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.680
So they naturally ferment it.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.480
But they don't distill it.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.980
The thing is that some of these
sugars are just less

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.810
fermentable than others.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.780
There's a lot of different
bacteria and biologically

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.190
active creatures living
on and in the agave.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.450
And the sugar content
is just a lower.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.890
So you cannot really
distill that stuff.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.680
You'd get a lot of very
nasty, off flavors.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.240
And it would not work well.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.440
So that is not what is distilled
to make tequila, and

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.670
other spirits.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.500
It goes through a very
short phase.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.390
It starts out being kind
of like yogurt.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:46.110
It gets to where it's maybe
3% to 7% alcohol.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.120
It goes through a regular
alcoholic fermentation.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.860
And then it goes south really
quickly, and starts to produce

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.760
some pretty nasty off flavors,
vinegar type flavors.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.300
And sometimes they'll do a
second fermentation that helps

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.240
the process.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.680
But basically it's quick,
and then it's over.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.940
Now the spirits that we're going
to talk about are made

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.600
using a completely different
process, and completely

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.100
different species of agave.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.030
The first step is to cut out the
heart of the agave, which

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.830
looks like an artichoke heart
if you think about it.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.640
The plant is killed
for this purpose.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.820
You can't harvest it, and keep
the plant in the ground.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.320
The whole plant is harvested.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.520
And you chop away, and
get this heart.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.530
You can see what they
look like here.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.600
The old way of doing this was
to roast them slowly in an

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.350
underground pit for
several days.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.610
There are more high tech
ways of doing it today.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.160
But originally they would have
been very slowly roasted.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.580
Sometimes they're in above
ground ovens like this.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.750
And modern tequila makers are
often doing them in just giant

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.650
autoclaves.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.190
And they're steaming them
instead of doing the slow

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.810
underground roasting process.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.170
But that's really
the first step.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.510
Then they're crushed.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.960
And back in the day they would
have been crushed like this,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.380
with one of these
donkey wheels.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.500
This is something that's been
done in Europe forever.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.200
You'll see this exact same
process for apple cider, and

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.630
other things in Europe.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.910
And this would be the old
process for crushing the

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.900
agave, and getting this fibrous
mix that's going to

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.020
then be fermented.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.870
There's one from Europe.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.810
So you can see they're
totally the same.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.460
Now why do have to roast them?

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.130
The reason is that you need
this process to happen.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.460
We talked about breaking
starch into sugars.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.010
It's even more complicated
with agave.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.620
So there's a caramelization
process that happens, where

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.580
you get the sugars in the
presence of exactly the right

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.620
he level, and they will
start to break down.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.580
And you will get this beautiful
brown color.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.250
And you'll get those nutty
flavors, and flavors that will

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.520
remind you of rum, that
warm rum flavor.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.220
So that's what happens when
you caramelize something.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.360
And that's part of the process
with agave hearts.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.320
The other thing is that you get
this other reaction, the

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.940
Maillard reaction, which is what
happens when sugars and

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.020
amino acids come together
in the presence of heat.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.110
A good example of this would
be toast, roasted coffee,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.630
roasted potatoes.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.040
And when you caramelize
onions, actually both

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.870
reactions are happening
at the same time.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.930
Caramelization is happening,
because there are sugars in

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.170
onions, but you're also getting
this Maillard reaction

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.820
happening as well.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.100
Both of those things contribute
to this warm,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:59.500
brown, rich, toasty, roasted
kind of flavor.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.270
Now once it's been roasted,
it's time to ferment it.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.710
And sometimes, particularly with
modern tequila, they're

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.720
just taking this wash off
of the crushed stuff.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.300
And they're fermenting that, in
which case it's a big tub

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.260
of basically a liquid
that gets fermented.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.960
But with some of these more
traditional spirits that we're

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.810
going to taste today, the fibers
are still in the mash

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.460
tub for the fermentation
process.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.230
And that definitely changes the
flavor, and is why they

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.360
taste so different
from tequila.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.410
It's wonderful stuff.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.220
I wish I could have had some
here today for you to taste.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.570
I've tasted just the roasted
agave heart.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.470
And it's like a cross
between an artichoke

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.110
heart and beef jerky.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:51.080
It's this wonderful meaty,
fantastic flavor.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.610
Now the still can
be very simple.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.770
And certainly the earliest
stills that we know about look

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.900
not too different from this,
just a big thing where you

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.020
boil the stuff.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.490
And it rises up into some
sort of condensing pipe.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.560
Sometimes it goes through
water to help with the

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.530
cooling, and into
another vessel.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.140
It can be very simple
like that.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.420
There's an interesting bit
of controversy among

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.040
archaeologists right now,
about when exactly this

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.590
process started.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.740
Because we know when the
Europeans got here they were

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.620
totally making tequila, right
when they first arrived,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.220
pretty much.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:33.450
But the natives, the locals,
were already

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.190
roasting agave hearts.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.550
They were doing this
whole process.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.840
And there's a little bit of
archaeological evidence to

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.200
suggest that they were already
distilling, before the

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.690
Europeans got here.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.110
So this is a very unsettled
question right now.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.070
But you do wonder, why would
they go to all the trouble to

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.370
do the whole process, and
not just finish it.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.720
Because it doesn't look like
they were just using it as a

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.470
food source.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.470
It looks like it was
more for alcohol.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.990
So I'll be interested to see
where that issue goes.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.400
Obviously, like I showed you
before, sometimes they're

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.960
using much more modern
looking stills.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.980
So it really depends on the
producer, what kind of still

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.810
they use, what sort of flavor
they want to get.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.140
And I just wanted to mention,
I love this quote from

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.030
"Scientific American,"
from 1897, which I

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.340
found thanks to Google.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.690
Appreciate that.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.310
Anyway, "mezcal is described as
tasting like a mixture of

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.910
gasoline, gin, and
electricity.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.150
Tequila is even worse, and said
to incite murder, riot,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.310
and revolution," which
I just think is a

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.390
wonderful way to describe.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.820
Certainly in 1897 it was
not the fine spirits

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.240
that we have today.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.465
It took while for this industry
to evolve and mature.

00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:50.690
And it's really even been in
only the last 10 or 20 years

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.390
that we've had these really fine
artisanal spirits coming

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.640
out of Mexico.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.580
I know this is a bit
hard to read.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.010
It's actually a page
from the book.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.810
But I did want to point out what
we have, and what we're

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:06.940
dealing with here.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.510
The first definition that you
ought to know is that just

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.940
because it says tequila on the
label doesn't mean it can't be

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.620
a mixture of tequila
and basically

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.520
just a neutral spirit.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.560
So you want to look for 100%
agave on the label.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.330
So you know it's not mixed
with anything.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.720
And in general the definition,
so unaged is called silver or

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.090
blanco or plata.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.440
They all mean the same thing.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.210
In the case of tequila, you
can get a gold, which is

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:42.250
called joven or oro, which is
with caramel color added, and

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.950
maybe some other extracts,
but not aged.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:48.690
So gold is not aged.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.860
And in the aged, of course,
is the repozado.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.230
And it's at least two months.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.620
And the extra aged anejo has
to be at least a year.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.510
And there is a category called
ultra aged, extra anejo, which

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.310
is at least three years.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.290
And most of these spirits
generally follow those

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:11.880
definitions, with some
variations between them.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.790
A couple other things about
what can and can't be in

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.070
there, there is no worm
in tequila, ever.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.120
It is something that by
law you cannot add.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.070
The definition of mezcal
allows them to add it.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.705
What it is the larva of a couple
of different pests of

00:26:27.705 --> 00:26:32.110
the agave plant, the agave snout
weevil, as an example.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.240
And the good mezcal makers hate
it, that this is even

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.730
permitted, and feel that it
reflects badly on all of them.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.370
Obviously it does nothing
to the flavor.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.390
It's just a dumb gimmick.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.030
Ignore it.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.440
Paid no attention to the worm.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.110
There have been some studies
that show that a bit of

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.470
worminess is extracted when you
drop it into a solvent.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.660
So if you are drinking a mezcal
with the worm in it,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.210
I'd like to assure that
a little warm DNA is

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.520
present in every sip.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.450
So have fun with that.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.750
That's important to you.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.490
Yes, go ahead.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.250
AUDIENCE: What's the D.O.?

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:11.960
AMY STEWART: The D.O. is the
geographic area of origin.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.190
Dominacion de Origen, is
what it is in Spanish.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.010
So just like champagne there's
a region in France, and if

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.620
you're going to call it
champagne it has to come from

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.290
that region, for these spirits
they all have regional

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.370
definitions.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.870
I think I've got a map here.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.930
I should be able to show
you some of that.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.600
These are the drinks.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.450
So let's talk about them.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.800
The pictures I have are not
exactly what we're drinking.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.060
But I actually managed
to get pretty close.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.650
And these are in the wrong
order for our tasting.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.100
Because we decided on the order
of the tasting like half

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.830
an hour ago.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.080
And I did this last week.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.640
Taste them.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.890
If you haven't started
tasting yet--

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:51.840
are you ready?

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.120
Have you guys been waiting?

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.430
Or have you been drinking?

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.780
You've been waiting?

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.920
Let's talk about let's
talk about them for

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.220
the purposes of drinking.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.010
And then I will walk
through them.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.620
So the pink is the cielo rojo.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:10.160
So if you haven't tasted it yet,
you have my permission.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160
This is a blanco.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.700
And mostly I went in this order
just because of whether

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.380
or not it's aged.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.100
So that is this bottle.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.310
This is the Bacanora.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.920
Yes, go ahead.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.393
AUDIENCE: They ran out of
it before I came here,

00:28:22.393 --> 00:28:23.866
so I have an empty.

00:28:23.866 --> 00:28:25.340
Can I?

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.700
AMY STEWART: You
want a refill?

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.465
AUDIENCE: They didn't
have them, so I

00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:31.120
just made my own plate.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.690
AMY STEWART: You can totally
just fill up.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.780
We used a measuring cup for
everyone else so that you'd

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.080
only get a half an ounce.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.820
I know.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.440
I can trust you, right?

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.180
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.340
AMY STEWART: Sure.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.620
Wow.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.750
You're watching him.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.560
There's adult supervision
taking place.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.890
OK, so the pink one
is the cielo rojo.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.700
What do you guys think?

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.440
By the way, the guidance when
you're tasting spirits is, if

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.680
you're going to sniff, do with
your mouth open, not your

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.400
mouth closed.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.300
To be honest, I don't know
if it makes a difference.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.550
But that's a thing.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.735
What do you think?

00:29:10.735 --> 00:29:12.160
What do you taste?

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.650
AUDIENCE: Smoky.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.620
AMY STEWART: Still pretty smoky,
because it's roasted,

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.790
unlike some of the tequilas,
which aren't roasted as much.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.430
You still get the smoke
from the roasted.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.110
What else, anything?

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.210
Floral, a little bit of
maybe some bright

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.460
happy floral notes.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.790
Worcestershire sauce,
that's interesting.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.410
What is that, the heat
or the smokiness?

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.880
Feel free to drink some
water in between.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.120
You ready to move on?

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.410
You're good?

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.090
You guys, you're so quiet
and well behaved.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.290
The blue is the Del
Maguey mezcal.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.580
And these guys are
unbelievable.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.450
They're doing these small
village mezcals.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.250
And so every one is different.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.905
It's very specific
to the village.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.030
You go into some of
these villages.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.420
They're really making
it the same way

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.500
they have since forever.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.750
They're doing them
in little huts.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.510
They're often sleeping there,
right next to the still.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.840
There's this whole thing about
how nobody can come in who's

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.250
got on any kind of perfume,
soap, or lotion, or

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.410
anything like that.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.530
Because they don't even
want that getting in

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.110
the way of the flavor.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.920
And this Tobala, I think I'll
have a picture of the Tobala

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.920
in a minute.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.310
So this refers to the
plant that's used.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.360
What do you think?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.770
AUDIENCE: Smells like cheese.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.120
AUDIENCE: Smells
very caramelly.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.470
AUDIENCE: Smells like grappa.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.240
AMY STEWART: Like
grappa, sweet.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.820
Really complex and
interesting.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.120
And I will just tell you that
everything they make is

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.530
different from everything
else.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.920
So when you've had one
Del Maguey, you have

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.470
not had them all.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.020
They're all really rare
and wonderful.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.230
This one is very highly
sought after.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.980
This is something that people
are very into, and always very

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.560
happy to get to taste
when they can.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.660
Any other comments on
the Del Maguey?

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.290
Maguey, by the way,
means agave.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.570
So the third one we're going to
do, we're getting into the

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:19.780
aged stuff.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.040
And some serious yumminess
happening.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.250
This is the sotol.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.430
And in just a second we'll
show you the slides.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.170
And I'll show you the difference
in the plants and

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.110
the regions with the sotol.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.850
It, by the way, is organic.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.430
So this is a repozado.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.690
So it's been aged
a little bit.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:38.940
What do you think?

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.390
More caramel?

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.980
More yummy woodsy?

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.510
AUDIENCE: Smoother.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.980
AMY STEWART: Smoothness, yeah
the wood definitely, the

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.550
process of the spirit going in
and out of the wood acts as

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.330
its own filtration.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.080
So definitely smooths it out.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.410
AUDIENCE: Where does that
color come from?

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:01.880
AMY STEWART: From the wood.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.270
The color comes from the wood.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:07.280
Definitely comes out of the
still clear, but then gets a

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.530
little color from the wood.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.200
You guys doing all right?

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.080
You have water?

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.362
You going to be all right?

00:32:14.362 --> 00:32:15.660
AUDIENCE: Getting
warm in here.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.680
AMY STEWART: Getting warm.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.950
OK, and then the last one
is the Don Julio.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.170
This is the anejo.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.830
And this one is so yummy.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.330
This is just like dessert.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.510
I love all the sweetness
and the caramel

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.676
and the wood in this.

00:32:30.676 --> 00:32:37.100
That's the Don Julio
anejo tequila.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.020
What do you think?

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.320
Yeah, pretty nice.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.050
I know.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.040
Butterscotch.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.920
Do not put that in a
Margarita, please.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.140
Do not pollute this with
lime juice or salt.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.570
No, no, no.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.240
Tequila can only be made
with agave tequilana.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.260
Weber Blue.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.670
Weber Blue is the name of
the specific cultivar.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.610
So all plants have
a species name.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.520
But within that there can be a
lot of different cultivars

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.520
that usually refer to physical
characteristics, other than

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.870
the flower the reproductive
organs.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.000
And so agave tequilana is the
only plant they can use if

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.040
they're going to call
it tequila.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.540
And of course it can only
be made in a region

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.550
right around Jalisco.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:25.050
And there are some issues with
the plants themselves.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.960
There's not a lot of
genetic diversity.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.520
It's kind of a monoculture,
like some grape growing

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.890
regions get to be sort
of a monoculture.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.910
So there's concerns about the
health of the plants, and the

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.690
fact that it hasn't
been allowed to

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.570
interbreed and get stronger.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.510
Because they don't need to
flower to make tequila.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.185
So they don't really get to
flower, and get pollinated,

00:33:43.185 --> 00:33:45.710
and mate, and have children.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:47.950
Unless somebody does that
deliberately, it's not part of

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.020
the process, otherwise.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.420
AUDIENCE: So where do they
get the new plants from?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.200
AMY STEWART: They clone them.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.630
They get the new plants
through cloning.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.960
Now the mezcal we tasted.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:08.639
There's a list of particular
different agaves that can be

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:13.340
used to make mezcal,
in particular.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.510
And the Tobala is on my
list, Agave potatorum.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.889
Maybe I did get a picture
of the Tobala.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.980
I think that is the Tobala.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.790
Certain species, and it has to
be made around Oaxaca and

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.110
particular other designated
regions, in order for you to

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.090
be able to call it mezcal.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.100
Typically always made with the
roasting, none of this

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.880
steaming in big network
containers, like they might do

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.560
with tequila.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.060
The sotol, very different
plant.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.230
Not even an agave.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.510
So that was this one.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.980
This is what's in
your green cup.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.080
It's a plant called the desert
spoon, also called the sotol,

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.720
and made around Chihuaua
and Durango.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.190
I'll show you a map in a second,
so you can visualize

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.440
all this stuff.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.350
And so this is another spirit
that's just starting to come

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.710
in to its own, and really get
some recognition, and get a

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.790
legal definition.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.340
So they have some protection
of what can be called sotol

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.200
and what can't.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.520
But very different plant,
not even an agave.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.740
And then finally, Bacanora,
made in Sonora.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.580
That was actually what
we started with.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.520
We started with a nice
blanco Bacanora.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.620
And it's only one particular
species of agave as well.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.550
It's made from Agave
angustifolia.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.460
Different species, and again,
different region.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.860
Otherwise, the processes are
more or less the same.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.570
Now there's one that we didn't
get to try, which is Raicilla.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.200
And it's harder to
find in the US.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.850
But if you're in Puerto
Vallarta, and you want to look

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.660
around in that area, Raicilla is
starting to be better known

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.900
in that region.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.000
And again, there's only a few
species of agave that can be

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.220
used to produce Raicilla.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.640
So that's the other agave spirit
that's up and coming in

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.340
this world.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.400
Now if you're not in Mexico, if
you're somewhere else, and

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.190
you want to make tequila,
you can.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.570
But you can't call it that.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.860
You can call it 100%
agave spirit, or

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.960
something like that.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.200
So, for instance, Saint George
distillery up in Alameda makes

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:32.150
this lovely stuff, Agua Azul,
which is made from an agave.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.780
I'm not sure if they
use tequilana.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.290
I think they probably do.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:36.220
And it's very nice.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.180
But it's American made.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.700
So they can't call it any
of those other names.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.660
They just have to say agave
spirit, and hope people know

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.120
what that means.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.620
Throughout the world,
that's the same.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.920
There's some coming
out of South

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.670
Africa, places like that.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.280
Same deal.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.050
They just can't use these
protected words.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.720
This map will give you
some idea of where

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.610
this stuff is happening.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.170
The tequila is the
blue region.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.450
That should look familiar to
you, right around Jalisco.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.780
And then the mezcal in green
is further to the south.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.750
But there's other regions,
as you can see, that

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.680
can use it as well.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.890
Bacanora up there to the north,
very specific area.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.940
The Raicilla is not
on this map.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.120
It's near Puerto Vallarta.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.170
But they're not quite
as established yet.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.340
So I don't have it on the map.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.350
Sotol, the big beige
area up there.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.950
And also Charanda is on here,
which is actually

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.180
not agave at all.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:33.900
It's sugar cane.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.280
But that's the chart
that I had.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.010
There's [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.380
in a tiny little region.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.380
So those are the regional

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.220
differences with these spirits.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:48.170
Now I mentioned that there were
some ecological issues.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.980
The Tequila Interchange Project
is working to raise

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.520
awareness about protecting
these plants.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.340
So with the agave tequilana
Weber Blue that's used to make

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.120
tequila, there's concerns
about a lack of genetic

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.860
diversity, that it's getting
weakened and

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.980
more disease prone.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.210
And there needs to be better
breeding programs, and also

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.830
less of a monoculture.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.180
With these others, they're
mostly harvesting wild plants.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.730
So there are some issues
with wild harvesting.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:21.040
And a call for more conservation
put in place.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.740
You will hear some of the makers
of these spirits say

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.990
that they have to be harvested
wild, that these plants cannot

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.010
be cultivated.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.330
And that's not true.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.530
Most of them are already in
cultivation, and being grown

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.480
out in tissue culture labs by
the thousands, and available

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.700
for purchase at Home Depot.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.300
They are not uncommon.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.740
They are not free spirits that
can only grow in the wild.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.450
You could plant them in
a row, and farm them.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.880
So there's a little bit of
mythology about that that

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.290
needs to be corrected.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.170
But all the issues that happen
in any kind of agriculture,

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.030
with water use and chemical
use, and the health of the

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.920
soil, are all issues with these
that are being debated

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.480
and talked about right now.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.240
And the Tequila Interchange
Project works on that stuff.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.230
And also protecting
small producers.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:10.540
There's definitely a big guys
versus small guys conflict

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.920
happening in this
world right now.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.480
As the small producers are
trying to make sure that laws

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.970
don't get written that
only favor the big

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.650
multinational companies.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.680
And if you don't believe
me, you can

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.170
go see it for yourself.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.000
Get on the Tequila Train.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.460
There is a tequila train,
believe it or not.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.760
This is something you
can totally go do.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.550
Just Google Tequila Express.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.590
And there it will be.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.400
Board the train.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.770
And they take you around.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.190
So there's this whole tourism
thing you can do.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.760
And perhaps even more fun that
would be to go to Oaxaca.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.340
And you can take mezcal tours.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.080
You could just wait until you
get to town and figure it out.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.800
That would be totally doable.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.470
But if you like to be a little
more organized than that,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.150
you'll find it.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.570
If you just Google Oaxaca
mezcal tours you'll get

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:03.140
several places that run little B
and Bs and will also arrange

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:03.800
tours for you.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.420
So you can get around
and taste.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.580
And of course, right in Oaxaca
there's lots of places to just

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.930
taste all this stuff.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:14.120
So you can totally go see all
this stuff, if you want to.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.640
If this was not enough.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.100
There you go.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.700
We're at the end.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.780
Does anybody have any questions
or comments?

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.750
You're all stupefied.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.241
You're stunned into silence?

00:40:27.241 --> 00:40:28.714
AUDIENCE: What was
the second one?

00:40:28.714 --> 00:40:30.410
AUDIENCE: What's that
one-- chicha?

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.448
AMY STEWART: Chicha.

00:40:31.448 --> 00:40:33.400
AUDIENCE: So it developed
separately from the whole

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.450
agave movement?

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.560
AMY STEWART: Chicha is a
homemade beer, usually made

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.920
from some kind of grain,
corn, as an example.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.660
There's this real tradition in
Peru, for example, of doing

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.940
chicha with corn.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.020
And the interesting thing with
some of these chichas is that

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.980
the way you get that process
started of breaking the starch

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.427
into sugars that we were talking
about, is that you

00:40:58.427 --> 00:41:00.510
chew dried corn.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.820
And the enzymes in your saliva
start that process.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:09.360
And then you split it into
a communal mash tub.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.530
We'll be bringing in some of
that in just a minute for you

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.400
to taste, as a special treat.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.580
So that's usually how
that process goes.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.030
And this stuff is
all very tribal.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.840
It was really just a question
of what was available.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.910
And people were working
with what they had.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.870
And some tribes really travel
to follow fruit, and other

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.480
food sources, and made a
different alcohol with it

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.260
wherever they went.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:34.550
What else?

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.995
Somebody said something
over here.

00:41:35.995 --> 00:41:37.814
AUDIENCE: What was
the second one?

00:41:37.814 --> 00:41:39.130
What was the name of
the second bottle?

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.580
AMY STEWART: Number two,
this one, blue.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.070
This is Del Maguey.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:47.630
And this is their Tobala,
which is lovely.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.110
That was the blue one.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.053
Yeah, in the back.

00:41:50.053 --> 00:41:54.426
AUDIENCE: I notice with wine,
some people talk about the

00:41:54.426 --> 00:41:57.057
quality of the earth
and so on.

00:41:57.057 --> 00:42:02.436
And I heard you say, in contrast
when growing agave,

00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:06.837
there's ways to cultivate it and
so on where you can do it

00:42:06.837 --> 00:42:09.282
in a more industrial way.

00:42:09.282 --> 00:42:13.031
Is there any discussion about
what kind of soil that you

00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:16.943
need for growing agave as part
of the discussion that you

00:42:16.943 --> 00:42:18.220
were describing?

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.210
AMY STEWART: The question of
what kind of soil you need to

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.230
grow agave is really
important one.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:27.160
Because this plant does what
it does because of stress.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.200
It's a plant that doesn't
need a lot of water.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.240
It can cope with incredible
drought, incredible stress.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.050
And so to a certain extent,
stressing the plant is really

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.320
good for what you're
trying to do.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.040
This is actually true in some
ways with fruits, as well.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.480
They produce more antioxidants
when they're under stress,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.530
things like that.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:48.120
So the soil definitely matters,
and the conditions.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.280
Not being an agave farmer
myself, I hesitate to say.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.160
But if it does seem and from the
agave experts I've talked

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.530
to, that there probably is a
way to cultivate them in a

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.650
more farm-like setting.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.220
But still give them some of the
same stressors that they

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.770
experience in the wild.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:09.550
But the question the soil health
overall is a big one.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.370
And there's real concern about
the soil being depleted,

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.680
particularly in the case of
tequila and these giant farms.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:21.050
So soil conservation and keeping
the nutrient mix where

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.600
it needs to be in the
soil is a big issue.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:29.290
And one that needs a lot more
work, still in its infancy.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.264
What else?

00:43:31.264 --> 00:43:33.675
AUDIENCE: So you said there's a
very strict guideline as far

00:43:33.675 --> 00:43:36.010
as percentage of agave you need
to be classified as a

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.765
certain drink.

00:43:38.765 --> 00:43:40.510
Who made those regulations?

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:41.510
Who enforces it?

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.020
Is it international law?

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.720
How does that work?

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.160
AMY STEWART: How those rules get
enforced about what gets

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.730
called what, originally
everything

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.790
was just called mezcal.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.980
That was just a native
word for it.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.290
And then the word tequila
started being used for those

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.680
spirits produced
around tequila.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.440
And it eventually got codified
into Mexican law.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.420
And then it's only been just
recently that these other

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.070
spirits have been able to come
along and claim their own

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:14.340
geographic designation,
as well.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.850
It's part of federal law.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:18.050
And enforced that way.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.500
Although as with everything,
there's always some activism

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.850
needed to really enforce
it properly.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:27.900
And I know that these smaller
producers are always watching

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.680
labels to look for
infractions.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.900
And then outside of Mexico,
this stuff actually gets

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.430
enforce pretty well
by governments

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:37.720
in the United States.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.870
We are, of course, the biggest
buyer of all this stuff.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.260
But also in Europe.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:49.070
So the TTB here in the US
supports and recognizes these

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:52.400
definitions, and enforces
this labeling on

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.320
products sold in the US.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.590
For any product like this that's
made in Mexico, in

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.510
order for it to be sold in the
US, they have to make a US

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.520
compliant label, and
get label approval.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.720
And then if they want to sell it
in the EU, they have to do

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.800
the same thing there.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.420
And the same thing in Canada.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.680
So a producer has to go through
a different label

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.750
approval process everywhere.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.640
And in the case of these names
and all this recognition, that

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.920
has to be re-looked at every
time they get label approval.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.100
What else?

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.960
AUDIENCE: Do they ever actually
make it differently?

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.430
Like if you buy it in Mexico,
it would be a little bit

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.128
different than the one they
sell here or the one

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:33.250
they sell in Canada?

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.300
AMY STEWART: They certainly
can, and do.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.690
For instance, they might want
to bottle it at a different

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:42.840
proof, if there's a proofing
issue with it.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.000
What they're doing there, you
definitely can get different

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.646
stuff there than you
can get here.

00:45:47.646 --> 00:45:49.394
Yeah, over here?

00:45:49.394 --> 00:46:00.100
AUDIENCE: What is the flavor
ranger in the--

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.205
AMY STEWART: How wide is the
range of flavors for tequilas

00:46:02.205 --> 00:46:04.650
and mezcals as compared--

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.380
the flavor range can really
be quite wide.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.480
And you guys have such a good
opportunities to taste, here

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.130
in Southern California.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:16.010
And you will find, if you sit
down and do a very nice flight

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:21.470
of agave spirits at a good bar
here, you will find such a

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.710
wide range of very floral--

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.410
astonishingly floral flavors--

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:30.360
to the darkest smokiest,
something very close to

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.020
scotch, and everything
in between.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.420
It is astonishing, the range.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.990
But you always get
that agave thing.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.450
So in that way, I think
it is like brandies.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:45.440
Where, while there's a wide
range depending on how it's

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.810
aged and the style, you're
always still

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.930
getting that same fruit.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.610
You're getting that great
thing underneath.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.480
But I think the styles are
getting even wider now.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.240
And I've seen people
doing liqueurs.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.430
There's going to be more and
more agave based liqueurs.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:02.560
There's a coffee liqueur.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.640
There's a nice orange liqueur.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.580
You have that agave base.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.290
But they're there playing
with it more now.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.200
This market has finally
just really matured.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.402
And they can start
to branch out.

00:47:17.402 --> 00:47:18.306
Yeah?

00:47:18.306 --> 00:47:20.114
AUDIENCE: What's the yield
on these things?

00:47:20.114 --> 00:47:23.341
I can see with corn, you get
so much alcohol for so many

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.987
pounds of stuff you put in--
grapes-- it's probably pretty

00:47:25.987 --> 00:47:26.949
well known.

00:47:26.949 --> 00:47:29.354
Are the plants comparable
as well?

00:47:29.354 --> 00:47:31.438
It kind of seems like with a
desert plant, you're going to

00:47:31.438 --> 00:47:34.645
get less juice for the amount
of plans that you use.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.850
AMY STEWART: But they are not
only just pressing and

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.140
breaking the fiber up.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.900
But there's water in that
fermentation process, as well.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.850
So it's a little bit different
than something like grapes,

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:53.470
where all the liquid is just
coming from the plant.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.400
It's more like with beer, where
you're taking the grains

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.960
and water too.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.080
AUDIENCE: More extracted
than just--

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.270
AMY STEWART: Right.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:03.370
And I don't remember.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:04.380
I should know this.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.650
I don't remember how many pounds
of agave it takes for

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:09.480
one bottle.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.540
That's a very good question.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.920
Quick, somebody, come
on you guys.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.250
You already have the
answer, right?

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.460
Somebody looked this up by now.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.680
No?

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.140
You're letting me down.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.350
What else?

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.980
Anything?

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.744
Yeah?

00:48:21.744 --> 00:48:22.784
AUDIENCE: Maybe [INAUDIBLE],
but what's

00:48:22.784 --> 00:48:23.480
your next book about?

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.690
AMY STEWART: What's the
next book about?

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.860
The next book is actually
a closely guarded

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.040
secret at the moment.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.930
I'm not telling.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.190
Is that everything?

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:36.530
OK, well thank you
all so much.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:37.190
This was fun.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:44.227
[APPLAUSE]
