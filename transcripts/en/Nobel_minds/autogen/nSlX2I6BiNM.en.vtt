hello dr. fair this is eric cornell you

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090
hello dr. fair this is eric cornell you
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.490
hello dr. fair this is eric cornell you
and I have something in common we both

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
and I have something in common we both
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.579
and I have something in common we both
want a Nobel Prize as every Nobel Prize

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
want a Nobel Prize as every Nobel Prize
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.830
want a Nobel Prize as every Nobel Prize
winner knows the serious research

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
winner knows the serious research
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930
winner knows the serious research
oftentimes isn't done by the principal

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
oftentimes isn't done by the principal
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.480
oftentimes isn't done by the principal
investigators not by the professor's but

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
investigators not by the professor's but
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.939
investigators not by the professor's but
by the graduate students I wonder if you

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
by the graduate students I wonder if you
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.580
by the graduate students I wonder if you
would mind sharing with us an anecdote

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
would mind sharing with us an anecdote
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769
would mind sharing with us an anecdote
an interesting story about one of your

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
an interesting story about one of your
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.599
an interesting story about one of your
favorite graduate students yes will tell

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
favorite graduate students yes will tell
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.220
favorite graduate students yes will tell
a story is doing of the day of the first

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
a story is doing of the day of the first
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.720
a story is doing of the day of the first
observation of the giant

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
observation of the giant
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.530
observation of the giant
magnetoresistance so I was expecting

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
magnetoresistance so I was expecting
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.470
magnetoresistance so I was expecting
some large effects from the sample we

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
some large effects from the sample we
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.680
some large effects from the sample we
had prepared but I am alway present and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
had prepared but I am alway present and
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.740
had prepared but I am alway present and
modest and so I prefer to be pessimistic

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
modest and so I prefer to be pessimistic
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.459
modest and so I prefer to be pessimistic
so we are using to record the change of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
so we are using to record the change of
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590
so we are using to record the change of
the resistance ax while recorder

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
the resistance ax while recorder
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.639
the resistance ax while recorder
analogic XY recorder and so I say the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
analogic XY recorder and so I say the
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770
analogic XY recorder and so I say the
students put the scale to observe an

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
students put the scale to observe an
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.920
students put the scale to observe an
effect of one or two persons so I was

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
effect of one or two persons so I was
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.359
effect of one or two persons so I was
present so so she indeed put a scare

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
present so so she indeed put a scare
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.649
present so so she indeed put a scare
like I say but then there's a pan of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
like I say but then there's a pan of
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.260
like I say but then there's a pan of
this extra jumpin and went off when I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
this extra jumpin and went off when I
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.630
this extra jumpin and went off when I
say out of the out of the scale and so I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
say out of the out of the scale and so I
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850
say out of the out of the scale and so I
say okay you can increase the scale by a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
say okay you can increase the scale by a
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.520
say okay you can increase the scale by a
factor of two or three again the pen

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
factor of two or three again the pen
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280
factor of two or three again the pen
jump out of the scale and so finally the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
jump out of the scale and so finally the
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.429
jump out of the scale and so finally the
students are the other two several times

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
students are the other two several times
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.649
students are the other two several times
to change the scale and finally we could

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
to change the scale and finally we could
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.530
to change the scale and finally we could
observe the four change of scale of self

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
observe the four change of scale of self
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.039
observe the four change of scale of self
the very large giant magnetoresistance

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
the very large giant magnetoresistance
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.100
the very large giant magnetoresistance
and and so it was the story of the first

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
and and so it was the story of the first
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.670
and and so it was the story of the first
observation of the gmr
