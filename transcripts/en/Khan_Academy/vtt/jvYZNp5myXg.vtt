00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:02.301
- [Instructor] So we're
told that this table

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:05.837
gives select values of the
differentiable function F.

00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:07.929
So it gives us the value of the function

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:11.082
at a few values for X, in particular,

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:12.950
five different values for X and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.813
it tells us what the
corresponding f(x) is.

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:17.921
And they say, what is the best estimate

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:19.762
for f'(4)?

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.158
So this is the derivative
of our function F

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:24.094
when X is equal to four.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:25.809
Or another way to think about it,

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.402
what is the slope of the tangent line

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.960
when X is equal to four for f(x)?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.454
So what is the best
estimate for f'(4)

00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:35.564
we can make based on this table?

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:37.551
So, let's just visualize what's going on

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.782
before we even look at the choices.

00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:42.192
So let me draw some axis here.

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:44.062
And let me block these points.

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:46.851
We know that Ds would
sit on the curve of Y

00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:48.564
is equal to f(x).

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.573
When X is zero, f(x) is 72.

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:52.533
So this is the .072.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.450
This is the .3 comma 95

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.307
clearly, two different
scales on the X and Y axis.

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.011
This is the point

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:00.844
five 112.

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:02.904
This is 677.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.808
This is 954, actually, let me

00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:06.831
write out

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:07.664
the

00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:10.784
this is one, two, three,

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:12.463
four, five, six,

00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:14.315
seven, eight, nine,

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:15.148
and ten.

00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:18.141
Now they want us to know, they want to

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:19.527
what is the derivative of our function

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:20.400
when F is equal to four?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.403
Well, they haven't told us

00:01:21.403 --> 00:01:23.052
even what the value of F is at four.

00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:24.878
We don't know what that point is.

00:01:24.878 --> 00:01:26.166
But what they're trying to do is,

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.838
well, we're trying to
make a best estimate.

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:30.247
And using these points, we don't even know

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:32.137
exactly what the curve looks like.

00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:33.820
It could look like all sorts of things.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.028
We could try to fit a
reasonably smooth curve.

00:01:37.028 --> 00:01:39.261
The curve might look something like that.

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.906
But it might be wackier.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:44.145
It might do something like this.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:45.516
Let me try to do it.

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:48.131
It might look something

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:48.964
like this.

00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:51.724
So we don't know, for sure.

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:52.975
All we know is that

00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:55.470
it needs to go through those points.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.570
'Cause they've just
sampled to the function

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.994
at those points.

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:00.573
But let's just, for the sake of

00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:02.856
this exercise, let's assume the simplest,

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.387
let's say it's a nice smooth

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:06.425
curve without too many twists and turns

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.103
that goes through these
points, just like that.

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.489
So what they're asking, okay,

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.513
when X is equal to four

00:02:13.513 --> 00:02:17.027
if this yellow curve were the actual curve

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:19.996
then what is the slope of the
tangent line, at that point?

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.692
So we would be visualizing that.

00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:22.862
Now to be clear,

00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:24.654
this tangent line that I just drew

00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:25.568
this would be for

00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:27.589
this version of our function that I did

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:28.721
connecting these points.

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:30.627
That does not have to be

00:02:30.627 --> 00:02:31.677
the actual function.

00:02:31.677 --> 00:02:33.409
We know that the actual function has to go

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.357
through those points.

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:36.627
But I'm just doing this
for visualization purposes.

00:02:36.627 --> 00:02:39.069
One of the whole ideas here is

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.917
that all we do have is the sample

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:42.505
and we're trying to get a best estimate.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:43.387
We don't know

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:44.983
if it's even gonna be a good estimate.

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:47.178
It's just going to be a best estimate.

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:48.664
So what we generally do

00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:50.606
when we just have some data

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:52.861
around a point, is,
let's use a data points

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:54.225
that are closest

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:55.372
to that point

00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:58.061
and find slopes of secant lines

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:00.046
pretty close around that point.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.543
And that's going to give
us our best estimate

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:04.813
for the slope of the tangent line.

00:03:04.813 --> 00:03:07.048
So what points do we have near

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:09.227
F of four, or near the point for

00:03:09.227 --> 00:03:10.772
comma F of four?

00:03:10.772 --> 00:03:13.151
Well, they give us what F is equal to

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.543
when X is equal to three.

00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:16.153
They give us this point, right over here.

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:18.027
Let me do this in another color.

00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:19.527
So, three comma 95

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:22.775
that is that right over there.

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:24.641
And they also give us

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.717
five comma 112.

00:03:26.717 --> 00:03:28.680
That is that point right over there.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.128
And so what we could do

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:31.681
we could say, well, what is the average

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.643
rate of change between these two points?

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:35.066
Another way to think about it is,

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:37.309
what is the slope of the secant line

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.898
between those two points.

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:41.042
And, that would be our best estimate

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:43.357
for the slope of the tangent line

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:45.397
at X equals four.

00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:46.844
Do we know that it's a good estimate?

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:48.187
Do we know that it's even close?

00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.577
No, we don't know for sure, but that would

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:50.500
be the best estimate.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.573
It would be better than trying to take the

00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:54.372
the average rate of change between

00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:55.528
When X equals three

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:56.405
and X equals six.

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:58.113
Or between when X equals zero

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.287
and X equals nine.

00:03:59.287 --> 00:04:01.835
These are pretty close around four.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.189
And so, let's do that.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:04.922
Let's find the average rate of change

00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:07.687
between when X goes from three to five.

00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:09.456
So, we can see here

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:10.789
our change in X.

00:04:12.107 --> 00:04:13.749
Let me do this in a new color.

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.658
So our change in X here

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:17.163
is equal to

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:18.037
plus two.

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:19.682
And I can draw that out.

00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:21.454
My change in X here

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:22.287
is

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:24.956
plus two.

00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:27.021
And, my change in Y

00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:28.810
is going to be

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.196
when my X increased by
two, my change in Y is

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:34.278
plus, let's see, this is

00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:36.028
if I add ten I get to

00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:39.177
I get to 105.

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:40.366
If I add another seven

00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:42.398
so this is plus 17.

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:45.953
So this is plus 17 right over here.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.416
Plus 17.

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.164
And so my change in Y over change in X.

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.325
Change in Y

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:52.992
over my change in X.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:56.289
For this secant line between

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:57.918
when X is equaling three

00:04:57.918 --> 00:04:59.874
and X is equaling five

00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:02.943
is going to be equal to 17 over two.

00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:04.110
Seventeen over

00:05:05.984 --> 00:05:06.884
two.

00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:09.102
Which is equal to 8.5.

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:12.086
So the slope of this
green line here is 8.5.

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:13.545
And that would be our best estimate

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.452
for the slope of the tangent
line when X equals four

00:05:16.452 --> 00:05:19.388
of the curve Y is equal to f(x).

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:20.618
And so, lucky for us

00:05:20.618 --> 00:05:22.164
the people who wrote this question had

00:05:22.164 --> 00:05:24.888
the exact same logic, and
they did it right over there.

00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.098
So you wouldn't have to
graph it the way I did.

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.839
I did it just to help us
visualize what's going on.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.014
In general, when you
see a question like this

00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:33.078
they're really saying, look,

00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:34.606
you don't have all the data you need

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:37.282
to figure out exactly
what f'(4) is.

00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:40.200
But if you can find
points close to, or around

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.301
f'(4)

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:43.325
and find the (secant)
line, the average rate

00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:44.909
of the slope of the secant line.

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.295
Or the average rate of
change between those points

00:05:47.295 --> 00:05:49.130
that's going to be our best estimate

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.524
for the instantaneous rate of change

00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:52.819
when X equals four.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.494
Or the derivative when X equals four.
