00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.208
In a prison in Seattle the color pink was used

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:05.709
as mind control...

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:12.250
How does this make you feel?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.375
Does it make you feel… passive?

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.333
Make a fist. Does it feel...weak?

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:23.792
Drunk Tank Pink, Passive Pink, Cool Down Pink

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:28.458
Baker Miller Pink, P618, whatever you call it

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:32.542
the idea that pink might make you weak is actually science...

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:34.208
kinda

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:42.667
So in the 1960s the scientist Alexander Shauss wanted to find out if colors could effect the way you felt

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:46.166
He was a believer in this German theory that you could

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.250
use the colors people chose as a way to understand their inner mental state

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.083
and he wanted to see if he could reverse it

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.041
if he could basically make you feel things

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.834
by showing you certain colors

00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:00.667
and he came across one shade that was special

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.375
So he got 153 volunteers

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.709
and he had them hold out their arms in front of them

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:09.417
and he showed them either a blue piece of cardboard or a pink piece of cardboard

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:13.166
and he had a volunteer push their hands down as hard as they could

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:18.792
151 of 153 people were wea ker when they were looking at pink

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.291
he also tested this with slightly more scientific methods

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.375
of having people use a hand grippy thing

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.083
that tested how hard they gripped

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:28.583
he found a loss of strength between 6 and 23 percent

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.792
it had effects on peoples cardiovascular system

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:32.333
they calmed down

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.625
so he started taking about this

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:38.291
at one of his talks, two guys, Baker and Miller saw his presentation

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:41.208
they happened to run a prison, this is actually a Naval prison

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:45.250
and they said “Hey, what if we paint the drunk tank pink?"

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.500
That’s what they did!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.834
So the Navy’s report was that

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:53.083
Since undertaking this experiment on March 1st, 1979

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:58.917
there have been no incidents of erratic of violent behavior during the confinements

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:02.375
And if you have ever wondered...

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:08.250
What to do with a drunken sailor, what to do with a drunken sailor, what to do with a drunken sailor

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.792
put him in a pink room

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:13.709
As far as they were concerned, it was a huge success

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.875
and this caught on

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:20.041
penal systems around the country began painting rooms pink

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:24.166
San Bernadino in California painted their juvinille detention center pink

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:28.417
and said the couldn’t leave the delinquent in there for too long

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.542
or they would become “too weak”

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:34.875
and the power of pink became one of these well known truths

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:37.709
about ten years later in 1988

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.500
so scientists tried to replicate the results

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.750
and they couldn’t do it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.458
they could not show any measurable differences in grip strength

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:48.792
in heart rate, it was a wash

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:51.458
but the cat was out of the bag

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:56.166
to this day prison systems are still experimenting with Baker Miller Pink

00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.542
Switzerland just painted parts of eight different prisons this shade of pink

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:03.750
while the science on this remains pretty sketchy

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.291
uses for Baker Miller Pink have been proposed from

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:08.000
corporate break rooms

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.542
to the inside of ambulances

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:10.625
panic rooms

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.041
airport security

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.083
for mental facilities

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:16.917
for catastrophe areas, like natural disaster relief areas

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:19.250
regardless of the science behind it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.166
for modern day prisons

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.959
the color of control is pink

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.917
bright bubblegum pink

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:29.291
the pinkest pink you can pink

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:39.709
There is an irony in this too, in that our cultural associations with pink are new

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.917
in the turn of the century pink was the traditional boys color

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:47.458
Like what if it’s true and pink actually creates passivity

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:51.583
and it has been thrust upon the women of the world

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:58.583
as a way to make the docile consumers of home goods and dolls

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.083
our daughters are being brainwashed by pink!
