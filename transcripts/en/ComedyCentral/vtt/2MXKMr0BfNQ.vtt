- Women should be paid
twice as much as men.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.847
- Shut up, libtard.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.349
- Go away, loser.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.620 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I am drinking
your liberal tears.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.424
- Stop.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.126 align:start size:84% position:16%
Are you sick and tired
of trolls ruining

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.061
your social media experience?

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.562

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.332
- Well then the Troll
Cliche Wiki is for you.

When a troll attacks
with an insult

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.802 align:start size:84% position:16%
you've heard a
thousand times before.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.936
- Triggered much?

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.605
Delete your account, bitch.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.507 align:start size:84% position:16%

Just head on over
to trollcliches.com.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.546
Find the cliche that your
troll's been engaging in.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:51.084
Copy and paste that hot URL
and then send him the link.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.552
- What?

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.987
- It's that easy?

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.622
- It's that easy.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.357
- Shut the fuck up, snowflake.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.392 align:start size:88% position:13%
- But what if the
troll keeps responding?

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well, I wish I thought
of that possibility.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:01.928
I did.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.899
Now you just send
him a second URL.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.568 align:start size:97% position:3%
One that says you've
already lost this argument.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:12.572 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just keep sending him the link
again and again and again.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.040
- Again?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.974
No.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:15.909
- [Man With Glasses] And again.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.477
- I'm not fucking triggered.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.812
- [Man With Glasses] And again.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.513

you a lower IQ.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.885
(laughing)

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.886
- [Man With Glasses] And again.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.655
- Make these stop.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.190
- So fun.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.925
- I can't can't can't can't.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.893
- And eventually ...

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.528
They'll go away for good.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.097
- Very cool.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.998
