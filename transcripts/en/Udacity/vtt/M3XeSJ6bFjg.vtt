00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.280
Only packet monitoring can provide timing information

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.620
on a packet level, or packet headers.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.110
But both methods can actually provide the number of bytes in each flow. By

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.820
definition, flow records record the number of bytes in each flow as an aggregate

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.850
statistic. But if you had packet-level information,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.180
you could, of course, compute the statistic yourself.
