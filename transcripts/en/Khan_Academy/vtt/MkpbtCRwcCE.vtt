00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.580
Let's see if we can
write 59.2%, if we

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.900
can write this as a decimal.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.080
Well, 59.2%, this
literally means

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.300
59.2 per cent, which
literally means

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.830
59.2 per 100, which literally
means 59.2 per 100, which

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.290
is the same thing as
59.2 divided by 100.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.790
And If we were to divide 59.2
by 100, what would we get?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.500
So this is the same thing
is 59.2 divided by 100.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.360
So if we were to take 59.2, if
we wanted to divide it by 10,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660
we would move the decimal
over to the left once.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.000
We would get 5.92.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.470
But we want to divide it by
100, so we move the decimal

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.860
over to the left again.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.710
We're dividing by 10
once, and then we're

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.440
dividing by 10 again.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.140
Divide by 10 twice, you're
essentially dividing by 100.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.580
So you move the decimal to
the left twice, you get 0.592.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.140
And we'll just put a 0 out
here just to clarify things.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.959
And we're done.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.290
We've written
59.2% as a decimal.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.220
We essentially just
divided this by 100,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.930
which is dividing by 10
twice, moving the decimal once

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.530
to the left, and
then another time.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.180
Or since we're dividing by
100, moving the decimal twice

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.710
to the left.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.630
And we get 0.592.
