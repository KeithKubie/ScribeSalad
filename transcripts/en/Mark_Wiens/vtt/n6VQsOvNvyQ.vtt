00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.010
Bangkok, Thailand, is a fascinating southeast
Asian city that offers something amusing for

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.290
everyone.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.270
Sometimes referred to as the Big Mango, Bangkok
is an important international hub, and the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.000
home of over 12 million residents.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.320
This video includes twenty five of the best
things to do in Bangkok - so let's jump

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.120
right in and get started exploring this magical,
tasty and diverse city.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.360
Number one is wang lang market which is located
adjacent to Siriraj hospital. There's a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.030
stall that makes deep fried bite sized pieces
of pork that will literally melt in your mouth.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.770
Khanom tungtag is another famous treat at
Wang Lang Market.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.930
Number two is the gigantic Chatuchak Weekend
Market. Including over five thousand permanent

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.860
stores, and if you count the makeshift stalls
and hawkers around the market, the number

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.860
of vendors is closer to fifteen thousand,
making Chatuchak the largest market in Thailand.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.439
Number three is Klong Toey Market, the fresh
food breadbasket of Bangkok. The biggest,

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.439
most bustling fresh wet market in central
Bangkok, and lots of food to buy here, we're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.640
going to check this out. The entire repertoire
of Thai cooking ingredients are available

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.460
at klong toey, including a few interesting
and extremely exotic foods if you look in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.970
the right places.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.770
Number four is to visit a floating market
- and there are a few that set up on the weekends

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.770
just on the outskirts of town. I'm here at
the talad nam bang nam pheung which is a local

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.369
little floating market. Though Bangkok floating
markets are a little Thai touristy, they are

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.920
a great place to spend a day of leisure browsing
and eating wonderful food. It's kind of like

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.360
a sweet tomato juice, maybe with a little
bit of papaya mixed in, that's what it tastes

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.650
like, pretty good.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.650
Number five is Pratunam market. Bangkok's
Prtunam market which is one of the busiest

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.910
wholesale markets in Bangkok. Shopping is
often a major component of any visit to Bangkok

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.940
and Pratunam market specializes in wholesale
clothing.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.980
Number six is MBK shopping center, a mega
mall that's literally a country in and of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.489
itself. Electronics, clothes, souvenirs, and
a huge food court on the sixth floor are a

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.290
few of the draws.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.019
Number seven is or tor kor market, a high
quality fresh market that caters to the upperclass.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.980
The aisles are wide and clean and the produce
is nothing but the finest. There's also

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.170
a great selection of hawker stalls serving
delicious food.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.170
Bangkok's Dusit Zoo is number eight. I'm
here today at Bangkok's dusit zoo, which is

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.510
the central zoo of the city. In case there
are any lions or tigers that decide to escape,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.830
there's a good selection of street food
right outside the gates of the Dusit Zoo to

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.519
distract them as you run for your life.

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.190
Number nine on the list is Lumpini Park, located
just north of the Silom district. Surrounded

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.370
by tall buildings, this is like a sanctuary
of greenness in the middle. It's great if

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.989
you want to go jogging, but I'm not here to
jog today, I'm just taking stroll and eating

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.500
ice cream. Lumpini Park is a natural escape
from the fast pace of Bangkok, it's a sanctuary

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.090
where crows and monitor lizards reside. Don't
miss the evening public aerobic dance sessions.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.569
Getting a Thai massage is number ten. You
cannot visit Bangkok without indulging in

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.980
a traditional Thai massage. I can already
feel my body rejuvenating. I'm going to take

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.620
a quick nap. A Thai massage can actually be
quite painful, but keep in mind that you can

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.789
always ask the masseuse to take it easy on
you.

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.250
Number eleven is the Grand Palace and Wat
Phra Kaew located in the heart of Bangkok.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.220
I'm standing outside Bangkok's grand palace
and wat phra knew which is one of the most

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.560
famous attractions in all of Bangkok. I went
there a couple years ago so I'm not going

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.620
to go in today, but definitely if you come
to Bangkok, you've got to check out the grand

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.620
palace and wat phra knew. It's one of the
most revered sites in all of Thailand and

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.830
one of the most iconic landmarks in Bangkok.
If a tuk tuk driver approaches you and tells

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.580
you the palace is closed for the day, it's
probably a scam, and instead walk yourself

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.300
to the main entrance gate to get in.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.770
So, I'm going to enter the reclining Buddha.
Just behind the Grand Palace is number twelve,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.009
Wat Pho, home of the golden reclining Buddha.
Wat Pho is also famous as being the birthplace

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.139
of the Thai traditional massage.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.550
Number thirteen is Wat Arun, the temple of
dawn. So it costs just three baht to cross

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.759
of the Chao Phraya river, and we're heading
over to wat arun, which is one of the coolest

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.160
temples in all of Bangkok. The fine sculpture
details and the steep climb to the top level

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.910
of the temple, are a few of the main highlights
of visiting Wat Arun. It's definitely not

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.270
for you if you're afraid of heights, because
it's almost like climbing up a ladder, but

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.490
the view from up here is great.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.889
Number fourteen is Wat Saket, also known as
the Golden Mountain. Wat Saket which is also

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.160
known as pu khao tong, which is the golden
mountain, Bangkok's golden mountain. The three

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.169
hundred and eighteen stairs to the top takes
just five to ten minutes to climb, and your

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.840
effort is rewarded with fantastic panoramic
views of Bangkok.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.789
Number fifteen is the Erawan Museum, famous
for its three headed elephant. Within the

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.860
three headed elephant is an impressive museum
while the beautiful gardens that surround

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.580
the complex are neatly manicured and make
a perfect place to take a peaceful stroll.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.580
Number sixteen is the Vimanmek Mansion. It's
the world's largest golden teak mansion. Unfortunately

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.889
they don't allow photography inside, but we
can get some photos from the outside. I just

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.150
finished the tour, it took about thirty minutes,
and it's really cool inside, impressive to

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.259
see.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:49.259
For nightlife, shopping, and restaurants,
Khao San Road is number seventeen. I am on

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:30.610
Khao San Road which is the center of backpacking
here in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:38.750
Victory Monument in Bangkok, Thailand. At
number nineteen is Victory Monument. And since

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.830
it's a transportation hub of Bangkok, the
roundabout is full of shopping, food, and

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.970
entertainment. Don't skip a meal at boat
noodle alley, a collection of canal side restaurants

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:56.970
next to Victory Monument that serve bowls
of pure porky delight.

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:03.509
Number twenty is durian fruit. While its shell
is spiky and intimidating its flesh is sweet

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:10.300
like nectar and creamy like butter. A durian
is a fruit like no other, a unique and sensational

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.470
flavor and texture that should be experienced
by anyone that visits Bangkok. While some

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:22.470
dislike the pungent smell or the pudding texture,
in my opinion, a durian is the absolute heaven

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:29.509
on earth.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:36.760
Thai street food and home style restaurants
is number twenty one. Fresh herbs, spicy chillies,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.660
zesty lime juice and a host of tropical fruits
and vegetables all combine to make Thai food

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.930
intensely appetizing. Rated as one of the
top cities in the world for dining, Bangkok's

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:53.230
food reputation won't let you down. Fancy
sit down restaurants are great, but in my

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.180
opinion it's the street side stalls and the
family run hole in the walls that serve the

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:05.180
best Thai cuisine. A Thai feasting experience
will thrill your taste buds and keep a smile

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.810
on your face.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.140
One way to bring home the wonderful array
of Thai flavors is by signing up for a Thai

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:30.250
cooking class, which comes in at number twenty
two. There are a number of different choices

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:36.180
from professional cooking schools to motherly
style home cooking courses. Often a cooking

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:41.120
course will include a visit to a local wet
market followed by preparing a set menu of

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.450
a number of different dishes. Don't worry,
you'll get to eat what you cook too! This

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:53.260
is the flavor that will give us the deliciousness
of this green curry we're about to cook. I'm

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.820
at the market, I'm going to get some of this
stuff.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.870
Number twenty three, located near Yaowarat
Chinatown is Pahurat, a little slice of India

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:07.529
in the heart of Bangkok. Fabric and clothing,
chai and chapatis, are all available in this

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:13.480
concentrated area of merchants. I go to explore
the mixture of cultures, and or course to

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:19.440
eat Indian, Bangladeshi and Burmese cuisine.
First dip it into the sauce, give me a plate

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.890
of this and I'm happy.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:30.410
The historical pak klong talad, or Bangkok
central flower market is number twenty four.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:36.640
I am at Bangkok's pak klong talad, which is
the famous flower market. People come to purchase

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.850
flowers for everything from gifts for their
special loved ones to flowers with religious

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.829
and cultural significance. The sea of brightly
colorful flowers in mesmerizing.

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:53.070
Finally at number twenty five is Yaowarat,
Bangkok's bustling, and always energetic

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:59.570
Chinatown. Gold stores, lottery ticket vendors,
Chinese medicine dealers, and exotic food

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:06.360
markets all add to the mix. When evening in
Yaowarat falls, street food and seafood restaurants

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.860
take over and don't stop serving until the
wee hours of the night. This is called kuay

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:18.860
jab, and it's in a soup made from all things
pig. Sampeng Market also located in Yaowarat,

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:26.250
is an intensely busy shoppers paradise that
includes an unfathomable range of knick knacks.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.220
So whether you choose to go on a shopping
rampage, a street food pilgrimage, a peaceful

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:37.959
temple visit, or a cultural museum trip, there's
no doubt that the steamy hot capital of Thailand

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:43.959
has it all.

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:50.959
