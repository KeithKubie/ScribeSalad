00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.466
You've seen how to use breakpoints in single stepping, to run your program in

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.410
slow motion. And of course what you really want to be able to do is look at

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.862
variables. I'm going to rerun the program until I hit this breakpoint, here I

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:15.168
am, and over here in this window, you can see the settings of the local

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:21.373
variables. You can see that count is 0, end is 3, and this Boolean inside vowel

00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:26.785
group is false. Up here you can see the settings of the instance variables, of

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:32.512
the class whose method we're currently in. Go ahead at home and do exactly what

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:38.336
I just did. Run the program until this breakpoint. Then click continue one more

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:42.112
time until this breakpoint is reached for the second time, and tell me what is

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:45.400
the value of end when you reach it.
