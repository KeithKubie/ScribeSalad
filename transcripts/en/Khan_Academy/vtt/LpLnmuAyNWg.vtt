00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.790
Use a number line to
compare 11.5 and 11.7.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.630
So let's draw a
number line here.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.310
And I'm going to focus
between 11 and 12,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.430
because that's where our
two numbers are sitting.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.550
They're 11, and then something
else, some number of 10ths.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.390
So this right here is 11.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.700
And this right here would be 12.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.710
And then let me draw the 10ths.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.970
So this would be
smack dab in between.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.190
So that would be 11 and
5/10, or that would be 11.5.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.150
Well, I've already
done the first part.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.090
I've figured out where 11.5 is.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.720
It's smack dab in
between 11 and 12.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.907
It's 11 and 5/10.

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:38.240
But let me find everything else.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.240
Let me mark everything
else on this number line.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.200
So that's 1/10, 2/10, 3/10,
4/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10, 8/10,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.622
9/10, and then 10/10,
right on the 12.

00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:52.080
It's not completely
drawn to scale.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.621
I'm hand-drawing it
as good as I can.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:56.510
So where is 11.7 going to be?

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.676
Well, this is 11.5, this
is 11.6, this is 11.7.

00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:01.970
11 and 7/10.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.450
1/10, 2/10, 3/10,
4/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.110
This is 11.7.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.900
And the way we've
drawn our number line,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.370
we are increasing as
we go to the right.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.980
11.7 is to the right of 11.5.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.510
It's clearly greater than 11.5.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.920
11.7 is greater than 11.5.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.870
And really,
seriously, you didn't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.200
have to draw a number
line to figure that out.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.260
They're both 11
and something else.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.650
This is 11 and 5/10.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.780
This is 11 and 7/10.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.330
So clearly, this one
is going to be greater.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.462
You both have 11, but this
has 7/10, as opposed to 5/10.
