00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.309
John Dalton (1766-1844) was a distinguished
scientist who is known for, among many other

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.150
things, his theories about atoms, his law
of partial pressures of gases and liquids

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.000
(published in 1803), and being one of the
first scientists to study color blindness.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.730
In fact, because of his work, for some time
a common term for color blindness was “Daltonism,”

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.540
and the French for “color blind” is “Daltonien.”

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.329
Color blind himself, Dalton was only able
to see two primary hues: a yellow-ish hue

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.990
that encompassed a typical person’s green,
yellow and orange, and a second that was the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.160
equivalent of a non-color blind person’s
perception of blue and violet.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.750
With regards to what most would call red,
Dalton saw only “little more than a shade,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.050
or defect of light.”

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.780
Since Dalton’s brother shared this condition,
Dalton believed that color-blindness was inherited.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.360
He also theorized after much study that its
precise mechanism was that his eyes (and his

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.680
brothers’) were tinted blue in the vitreous
humour (the gel in the middle of the eye in

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.500
between the lens and the retina).

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.200
Leaving instructions that his eyes be dissected
after his death to confirm or disprove this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.610
theory, his assistant, Joseph Ransome, complied.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.330
On July 28, 1844 (the day after Dalton’s
demise), Ransome excised Dalton’s eyeballs

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.210
and thoroughly dissected one – revealing
a perfectly clear vitreous humour, disproving

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.650
part of Dalton’s theory.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.390
Later scientists noted that Ransome “shrewdly
left the second eye almost intact,” although

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.979
that “almost” is significant.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.710
Before he stored the remaining portions of
Dalton’s eyes, Ransome lopped off the posterior

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.500
pole of the second eye, looked through Dalton’s
eyeball and realized that when he did so,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500
neither red nor green were distorted but appeared
of the proper color.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.900
Clearly, not only was the vitreous humour
not the cause of Dalton’s color-blindness,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.350
but no other filter within the eye was responsible
either.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.900
A contemporary of Dalton’s, Thomas Young
(1773-1829, an English scientist and philosopher,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.189
among other things), first floated the theory
that color vision was the result of sensitivity

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.730
to a combination of three colors: red, blue
and green.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.560
He also hypothesized that color-blindness
was due to “the absence or paralysis of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.780
those fibers of the retina, which are calculated
to perceive red.”

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.980
Fast-forward 150 years, and today we know
that color perception is due to the presence

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.770
of three types of photopigments in the cones
of the retina.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.220
Each pigment is comprised of a specific type
of protein bound together with retinal, and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.770
different types of cone cells are sensitive
to different wavelengths: shortwave (near

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.290
420 nanometers or nm), middlewave (at 530
nm) and longwave (at 560 nm).

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.840
Violet is at the short wavelength end of the
visible spectrum, greens and yellows in the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.480
middle, and reds and the long end.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.371
With these developments in the understanding
of vision, many had theorized that, since

00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:03.050
Dalton had difficulty with red, he was a protanope,
or a person who could not see the colors at

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.280
the longwave (LW) end of the visible spectrum.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.620
To verify (or disprove) this theory and finally
solve the long standing mystery of Dalton’s

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.879
vision, in 1995, a few intrepid researchers
took samples of Dalton’s eyeballs, preserved

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.269
only in air, and subjected them to DNA analysis.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.240
They determined that Dalton actually had the
required genes for the protein necessary for

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.890
the photopgiment for LW perception, but that
he lacked the required middlewave (MW) gene.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.480
Proving that Dalton was partially right, that
his color-blindness was inherited, the researchers

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.090
concluded that rather than being a protonape,
he was actually a much more rare deuteranope

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.090
(green-blind).

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.150
With this type of color blindness, rather
than a mutation, the individual lacks medium

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.670
wavelength cones altogether.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.629
Further, besides being unable to see several
hues of colors, deuteranopes do not see the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.840
vividness of colors at the higher range that
others see, which in fully color-sighted people

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:24.230
is due to the opposing signals between LW
and MW photopigments.
