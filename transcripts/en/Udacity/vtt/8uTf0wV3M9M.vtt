00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.383
The x-coordinate of any y-intercept is, by definition, 0. Let's draw some random

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:10.716
line. Here's my lovely line. The y-intercept is where this line intersects with

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:15.680
the y-axis. Remember, we have our x-axis here and our y-axis here. At the

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:21.175
y-intercept right here, that x coordinate is just 0, since we haven't moved

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:27.585
horizontally away from the y-axis. In fact, the equation for the line that is

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:29.995
the y-axis, is just x equals 0.
