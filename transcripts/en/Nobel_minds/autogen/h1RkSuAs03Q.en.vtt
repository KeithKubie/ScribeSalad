00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.110
years ago
 

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.960
years ago
and those of you who know mathematics

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:06.970
and those of you who know mathematics
 

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.160
and those of you who know mathematics
will say well that's kind of interesting

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.170
will say well that's kind of interesting
 

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.860
will say well that's kind of interesting
and those of you don't just view it as a

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:10.870
and those of you don't just view it as a
 

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.439
and those of you don't just view it as a
it's just it's a counterpoint of goya

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:13.449
it's just it's a counterpoint of goya
 

00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:18.180
it's just it's a counterpoint of goya
it's just a picture here okay maybe not

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:18.190
it's just a picture here okay maybe not
 

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.740
it's just a picture here okay maybe not
so frightening I don't know maybe more

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:19.750
so frightening I don't know maybe more
 

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.030
so frightening I don't know maybe more
frightening but don't don't be

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040
frightening but don't don't be
 

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.840
frightening but don't don't be
frightened don't be frightened so

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:23.850
frightened don't be frightened so
 

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.280
frightened don't be frightened so
economists have focused on the strata so

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.290
economists have focused on the strata so
 

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.079
economists have focused on the strata so
let me just turn out of to a little bit

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:28.089
let me just turn out of to a little bit
 

00:14:28.089 --> 00:14:31.019
let me just turn out of to a little bit
of the actual results so economists have

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:31.029
of the actual results so economists have
 

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:33.509
of the actual results so economists have
focused on the economists and others

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519
focused on the economists and others
 

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:36.360
focused on the economists and others
have focused on strategies to slow

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:36.370
have focused on strategies to slow
 

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.680
have focused on strategies to slow
climate change and they're they're

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:37.690
climate change and they're they're
 

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.280
climate change and they're they're
basically three but

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.290
basically three but
 

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.400
basically three but
strategies abatement or reduction of

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:42.410
strategies abatement or reduction of
 

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.150
strategies abatement or reduction of
emissions is the one I'll focus on the

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160
emissions is the one I'll focus on the
 

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.519
emissions is the one I'll focus on the
second one is removing carbon dioxide

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:48.529
second one is removing carbon dioxide
 

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:49.900
second one is removing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere which would be

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:49.910
from the atmosphere which would be
 

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.939
from the atmosphere which would be
running wonderful but actually you could

00:14:51.939 --> 00:14:51.949
running wonderful but actually you could
 

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:53.889
running wonderful but actually you could
grow trees to do that for example but

00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:53.899
grow trees to do that for example but
 

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:58.540
grow trees to do that for example but
but well I won't say but and then

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:58.550
but well I won't say but and then
 

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.129
but well I won't say but and then
there's management of Soto solar

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:00.139
there's management of Soto solar
 

00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:02.620
there's management of Soto solar

the stratosphere abatement the first one

00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:05.269
the stratosphere abatement the first one
 

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:07.210
the stratosphere abatement the first one
I mentioned is the only realistic and

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:07.220
I mentioned is the only realistic and
 

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.490
I mentioned is the only realistic and
safe option at present others may come

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:09.500
safe option at present others may come
 

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.650
safe option at present others may come
along but at present it's all that we

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:11.660
along but at present it's all that we
 

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.680
along but at present it's all that we
have so I'm gonna concentrate there but

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:14.690
have so I'm gonna concentrate there but
 

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.059
have so I'm gonna concentrate there but
after to say well realistic it's also

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:18.069
after to say well realistic it's also
 

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:22.240
after to say well realistic it's also
expensive particularly in if we are

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:22.250
expensive particularly in if we are
 

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.809
expensive particularly in if we are
ambitious and just to give an example a

century or two this may be good for

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800
century or two this may be good for
 

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.280
century or two this may be good for
nature but it's not actually all that

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.290
nature but it's not actually all that

attractive to voters to reduce their
 

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:03.670
attractive to voters to reduce their
income that sharply so it shows some of

the trade-off
 

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.660
the trade-off
now that's abatement I'll say a word

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:07.670
now that's abatement I'll say a word
 

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.960
now that's abatement I'll say a word
about just a word about damages because

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:09.970
about just a word about damages because
 

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.579
about just a word about damages because
you know economics what we're going to

00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:12.589
you know economics what we're going to
 

00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:15.100
you know economics what we're going to
do is weigh the costs of reducing

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.110
do is weigh the costs of reducing
 

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.189
do is weigh the costs of reducing
emissions and slowing climate change or

00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199
emissions and slowing climate change or

with the reduction in damages on the
 

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.319
with the reduction in damages on the
other so we have to you have to go out

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:26.329
other so we have to you have to go out
 

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:27.730
other so we have to you have to go out
and do the modeling you have to

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:27.740
and do the modeling you have to
 

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.550
and do the modeling you have to
determine what the damages are and you

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560
determine what the damages are and you
 

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.250
determine what the damages are and you
might say well that's impact sound

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:33.260
might say well that's impact sound
 

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.590
might say well that's impact sound
easier because our babymoon do you need

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600
easier because our babymoon do you need
 

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.389
easier because our babymoon do you need
the physics and the chemistry and all

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399
the physics and the chemistry and all
 

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:40.269
the physics and the chemistry and all
that but actually damages and damages is

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279
that but actually damages and damages is
 

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:43.240
that but actually damages and damages is
just economics and ecology but actually

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.250
just economics and ecology but actually
 

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.290
just economics and ecology but actually
damages are much much more difficult and

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:46.300
damages are much much more difficult and
 

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.579
damages are much much more difficult and
it's probably the most difficult task

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:48.589
it's probably the most difficult task
 

00:16:48.589 --> 00:16:50.240
it's probably the most difficult task
and all of

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.250
and all of
 

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.910
and all of
processes that were on that last slide

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920
processes that were on that last slide
 

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.560
processes that were on that last slide
because it's so far in the future the

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:55.570
because it's so far in the future the
 

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.240
because it's so far in the future the
things we don't understand very well

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.250
things we don't understand very well
 

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.930
things we don't understand very well
there

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:57.940
there
 

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.880
there
we don't have historical experience of

00:16:59.880 --> 00:16:59.890
we don't have historical experience of
 

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.090
we don't have historical experience of
this so it's actually the probably the

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.100
this so it's actually the probably the
 

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.910
this so it's actually the probably the
most difficult so what I'll do is I'll

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:05.920
most difficult so what I'll do is I'll
 

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.460
most difficult so what I'll do is I'll
show you some illustrative results I

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:08.470
show you some illustrative results I
 

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.780
show you some illustrative results I
suppose these slides will be available

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:09.790
suppose these slides will be available
 

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.900
suppose these slides will be available
so that they will be available well

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:12.910
so that they will be available well
 

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:13.860
so that they will be available well
they'll be I guess they will be

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:13.870
they'll be I guess they will be
 

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:17.189
they'll be I guess they will be
available on the website so some of you

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199
available on the website so some of you
 

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:19.439
available on the website so some of you
I know this goes by very fast but some

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:19.449
I know this goes by very fast but some
 

00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:20.370
I know this goes by very fast but some
of you who want to look at them in

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:20.380
of you who want to look at them in
 

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.610
of you who want to look at them in
detail can go back and and find them but

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:23.620
detail can go back and and find them but
 

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.390
detail can go back and and find them but
I want to show you an example of the

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400
I want to show you an example of the
 

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.500
I want to show you an example of the
results from the the dice model and this

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:31.510
results from the the dice model and this
 

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.880
results from the the dice model and this
I want to emphasize this is only one of

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:32.890
I want to emphasize this is only one of
 

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.590
I want to emphasize this is only one of
many models there there are people in

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600
many models there there are people in
 

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.169
many models there there are people in
the room who do who do I won't point you

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:37.179
the room who do who do I won't point you
 

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:39.120
the room who do who do I won't point you
out but you know who you are who are

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.130
out but you know who you are who are
 

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.950
out but you know who you are who are
doing my other models and they're

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960
doing my other models and they're
 

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.260
doing my other models and they're
they're wonderful models and people

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.270
they're wonderful models and people
 

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.600
they're wonderful models and people
around the world who are doing this the

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:45.610
around the world who are doing this the
 

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:46.919
around the world who are doing this the
only reason I present well the main

00:17:46.919 --> 00:17:46.929
only reason I present well the main
 

00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:49.080
only reason I present well the main
reason I presented is cuz I know it but

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.090
reason I presented is cuz I know it but
 

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.150
reason I presented is cuz I know it but
also it's a simple model has a virtue of

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160
also it's a simple model has a virtue of
 

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.700
also it's a simple model has a virtue of
simplicity and comprehensiveness in the

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:53.710
simplicity and comprehensiveness in the
 

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.650
simplicity and comprehensiveness in the
sense that it does close that all the

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:55.660
sense that it does close that all the
 

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.830
sense that it does close that all the
boxes the links in that and another

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840
boxes the links in that and another
 

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.190
boxes the links in that and another
model some do and some don't but I would

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200
model some do and some don't but I would
 

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.290
model some do and some don't but I would
emphasize that these are very simplified

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.300
emphasize that these are very simplified
 

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.060
emphasize that these are very simplified
models and so for example the climate

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.070
models and so for example the climate
 

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.270
models and so for example the climate
sector two equations whereas if you go

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280
sector two equations whereas if you go
 

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.400
sector two equations whereas if you go
to some of the large climate models

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.410
to some of the large climate models
 

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.919
to some of the large climate models
they'll have a million equations and so

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:13.929
they'll have a million equations and so
 

00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:15.750
they'll have a million equations and so
these are very very these don't have the

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760
these are very very these don't have the
 

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.380
these are very very these don't have the
resolution of the most the the most

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.390
resolution of the most the the most
 

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.770
resolution of the most the the most
comprehensive and up-to-date models so

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:22.780
comprehensive and up-to-date models so
 

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.130
comprehensive and up-to-date models so
he let me do pews me so I want to talk

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:26.140
he let me do pews me so I want to talk
 

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.900
he let me do pews me so I want to talk
about four sets of policies and I'll

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:27.910
about four sets of policies and I'll
 

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.630
about four sets of policies and I'll
just mention these briefly one is what a

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640
just mention these briefly one is what a
 

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.000
just mention these briefly one is what a
business-as-usual which is basically no

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.010
business-as-usual which is basically no
 

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.610
business-as-usual which is basically no
policies or minimal policies a second

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:35.620
policies or minimal policies a second
 

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.320
policies or minimal policies a second
one is where you balance the costs and

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:37.330
one is where you balance the costs and
 

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.409
one is where you balance the costs and
the benefits a third is where you limit

00:18:40.409 --> 00:18:40.419
the benefits a third is where you limit
 

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.450
the benefits a third is where you limit
temperatures over time to say one and a

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:42.460
temperatures over time to say one and a
 

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.950
temperatures over time to say one and a
half degrees which is the latest

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960
half degrees which is the latest
 

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.690
half degrees which is the latest
objective or two degrees or two and a

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:45.700
objective or two degrees or two and a
 

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.970
objective or two degrees or two and a
half degrees and a third is is my

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:47.980
half degrees and a third is is my
 

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.159
half degrees and a third is is my
modification of that where you don't

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:50.169
modification of that where you don't
 

00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:52.890
modification of that where you don't
limit it as an absolute cap but you're

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:52.900
limit it as an absolute cap but you're
 

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.630
limit it as an absolute cap but you're
limited over an average period the idea

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640
limited over an average period the idea
 

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.400
limited over an average period the idea
being that actually makes more sense

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:56.410
being that actually makes more sense
 

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.530
being that actually makes more sense
because a lot of processes are function

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:58.540
because a lot of processes are function
 

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.150
because a lot of processes are function
of averages rather than just the

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160
of averages rather than just the
 

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.320
of averages rather than just the
absolute level at point

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:02.330
absolute level at point
 

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.110
absolute level at point
time so those are the four that I'll

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120
time so those are the four that I'll
 

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:11.680
time so those are the four that I'll
I'll show you some results from so one

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:11.690
I'll show you some results from so one
 

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.169
I'll show you some results from so one
is you you take these and I'll just one

00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:14.179
is you you take these and I'll just one
 

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:15.759
is you you take these and I'll just one
other thing so you take this business as

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:15.769
other thing so you take this business as
 

00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:17.259
other thing so you take this business as
usual what happened and then let's say

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:17.269
usual what happened and then let's say
 

00:19:17.269 --> 00:19:20.019
usual what happened and then let's say
if you want to limit the temperature to

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:20.029
if you want to limit the temperature to
 

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:21.730
if you want to limit the temperature to
two degrees C which is in the third

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:21.740
two degrees C which is in the third
 

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.919
two degrees C which is in the third
bullet there how can you do that most

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:23.929
bullet there how can you do that most
 

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.840
bullet there how can you do that most
efficiently so it's not just any old way

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:25.850
efficiently so it's not just any old way
 

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.299
efficiently so it's not just any old way
but if that you've got costs of doing it

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:28.309
but if that you've got costs of doing it
 

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:30.549
but if that you've got costs of doing it
and you've got the systems and you want

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559
and you've got the systems and you want
 

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:31.870
and you've got the systems and you want
to find how can I limit it to two

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880
to find how can I limit it to two
 

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.680
to find how can I limit it to two
degrees in the way that's the most

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:34.690
degrees in the way that's the most
 

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.360
degrees in the way that's the most
caught the least costly and in the

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.370
caught the least costly and in the
 

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.210
caught the least costly and in the
economic sense so here's a here's a

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:40.220
economic sense so here's a here's a
 

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.820
economic sense so here's a here's a
picture that shows it's a little it's a

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:42.830
picture that shows it's a little it's a
 

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.070
picture that shows it's a little it's a
little crowded but I'll give you a quick

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080
little crowded but I'll give you a quick
 

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.440
little crowded but I'll give you a quick
rundown so the top so on the this is

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:47.450
rundown so the top so on the this is
 

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.500
rundown so the top so on the this is
time from 0 to I've gone to 2150 just to

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.510
time from 0 to I've gone to 2150 just to
 

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.840
time from 0 to I've gone to 2150 just to
give it a little further depth and this

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:52.850
give it a little further depth and this
 

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.250
give it a little further depth and this
is then from 0 to 6 degrees C above

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:56.260
is then from 0 to 6 degrees C above
 

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.720
is then from 0 to 6 degrees C above
pre-industrial we're already at about

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:58.730
pre-industrial we're already at about
 

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.289
pre-industrial we're already at about
0.8 0.9 so and then this shows you

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:02.299
0.8 0.9 so and then this shows you
 

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:05.169
0.8 0.9 so and then this shows you
different paths doing this and the top

00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:05.179
different paths doing this and the top
 

00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:07.060
different paths doing this and the top
path is if we do nothing and you can see

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.070
path is if we do nothing and you can see
 

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.460
path is if we do nothing and you can see
that just keeps climbing and it's it's

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.470
that just keeps climbing and it's it's
 

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.629
that just keeps climbing and it's it's
pretty pretty substantial by the 20 120

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:13.639
pretty pretty substantial by the 20 120
 

00:20:13.639 --> 00:20:16.060
pretty pretty substantial by the 20 120
150 and then there are other paths

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.070
150 and then there are other paths
 

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.350
150 and then there are other paths
there's one that have say economic

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360
there's one that have say economic
 

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.820
there's one that have say economic
cost-benefit path where you balance

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:21.830
cost-benefit path where you balance
 

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.519
cost-benefit path where you balance
costs and benefits and then there's this

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:24.529
costs and benefits and then there's this
 

00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:26.080
costs and benefits and then there's this
green one where you limit it to two

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.090
green one where you limit it to two
 

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.240
green one where you limit it to two
degrees C and then some of the other

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.250
degrees C and then some of the other
 

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.629
degrees C and then some of the other
ones are where you limited say two

00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:31.639
ones are where you limited say two
 

00:20:31.639 --> 00:20:33.669
ones are where you limited say two
degrees C with the 200-year averaging

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679
degrees C with the 200-year averaging
 

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:37.000
degrees C with the 200-year averaging
two degrees C with a 100 year averaging

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.010
two degrees C with a 100 year averaging
 

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.310
two degrees C with a 100 year averaging
or one and a half degrees with a one

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320
or one and a half degrees with a one
 

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.529
or one and a half degrees with a one
year 100 year averaging they all look

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:41.539
year 100 year averaging they all look
 

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:44.200
year 100 year averaging they all look
pretty much this so if you go out and

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.210
pretty much this so if you go out and
 

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.149
pretty much this so if you go out and
you they actually don't look very

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159
you they actually don't look very
 

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:47.590
you they actually don't look very
different for quite a while and then

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600
different for quite a while and then
 

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.769
different for quite a while and then
they begin to diverge after 2050 or so

00:20:50.769 --> 00:20:50.779
they begin to diverge after 2050 or so
 

00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:52.720
they begin to diverge after 2050 or so
but they'll have a very different path

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:52.730
but they'll have a very different path
 

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.279
but they'll have a very different path
but the main thing I'll show you is

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:54.289
but the main thing I'll show you is
 

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:56.409
but the main thing I'll show you is
actually if you take steps now to

00:20:56.409 --> 00:20:56.419
actually if you take steps now to
 

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:57.700
actually if you take steps now to
implement these you have quite different

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:57.710
implement these you have quite different
 

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.060
implement these you have quite different
futures from very very high temperatures

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.070
futures from very very high temperatures
 

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.129
futures from very very high temperatures
on the one hand to relatively low for

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:03.139
on the one hand to relatively low for
 

00:21:03.139 --> 00:21:06.750
on the one hand to relatively low for
the for the temperature limiting paths

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760
the for the temperature limiting paths
 

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.970
the for the temperature limiting paths
the next slide I want to show you it

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:09.980
the next slide I want to show you it
 

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.480
the next slide I want to show you it
shows you the of the economics of this

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:13.490
shows you the of the economics of this
 

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.520
shows you the of the economics of this
so the the green

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:15.530
so the the green
 

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.700
so the the green
align the green bars show you and don't

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:18.710
align the green bars show you and don't
 

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.810
align the green bars show you and don't
worry too much about the the the units

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:22.820
worry too much about the the the units
 

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.370
worry too much about the the the units
here on the left they're their present

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.380
here on the left they're their present
 

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.100
here on the left they're their present

what I want to emphasize on so you can

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:28.820
what I want to emphasize on so you can
 

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.690
what I want to emphasize on so you can
see the damages from doing nothing to

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:31.700
see the damages from doing nothing to
 

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.820
see the damages from doing nothing to
the optimal to the temperature limiting

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:33.830
the optimal to the temperature limiting
 

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.220
the optimal to the temperature limiting
and the damages obviously as you limit

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:36.230
and the damages obviously as you limit
 

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.840
and the damages obviously as you limit
temperature increase the damages are

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:37.850
temperature increase the damages are
 

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.730
temperature increase the damages are
going to go down from from left to right

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:39.740
going to go down from from left to right
 

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.350
going to go down from from left to right
and these are increasingly stringent

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360
and these are increasingly stringent
 

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.270
and these are increasingly stringent
policies from left to right increasingly

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280
policies from left to right increasingly
 

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.540
policies from left to right increasingly
ambitious policies and then so the

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:46.550
ambitious policies and then so the
 

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.310
ambitious policies and then so the
damages go down but then what are the

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320
damages go down but then what are the
 

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.990
damages go down but then what are the
costs well they're not not much cost if

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000
costs well they're not not much cost if
 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.960
costs well they're not not much cost if
you don't do anything but as you become

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:52.970
you don't do anything but as you become
 

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.170
you don't do anything but as you become
increasingly ambitious the cross rise

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:55.180
increasingly ambitious the cross rise
 

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.170
increasingly ambitious the cross rise
and so you wanted but economics says

00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.180
and so you wanted but economics says
 

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.460
and so you wanted but economics says
well how are you going to balance these

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:00.470
well how are you going to balance these
 

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.840
well how are you going to balance these
and if you if you were if your manukan

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:04.850
and if you if you were if your manukan
 

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.240
and if you if you were if your manukan
see that the extremes you have a lot of

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.250
see that the extremes you have a lot of
 

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.070
see that the extremes you have a lot of
damages and no cost at one extreme and a

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080
damages and no cost at one extreme and a
 

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.050
damages and no cost at one extreme and a
lot of costs and very low damages or the

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.060
lot of costs and very low damages or the
 

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.210
lot of costs and very low damages or the
other and somehow in between you can

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.220
other and somehow in between you can
 

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.820
other and somehow in between you can
balance the two and what you want to

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:15.830
balance the two and what you want to
 

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.770
balance the two and what you want to
think of in economics or in more

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:17.780
think of in economics or in more
 

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.660
think of in economics or in more
generally is what's the best balance

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:19.670
generally is what's the best balance
 

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.580
generally is what's the best balance
between these two is that the optimal is

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:21.590
between these two is that the optimal is
 

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.860
between these two is that the optimal is
that a to degree is a averaging period

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:23.870
that a to degree is a averaging period
 

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.870
that a to degree is a averaging period
what different averaging period so you

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880
what different averaging period so you
 

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.640
what different averaging period so you
want to find some balance between the

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:27.650
want to find some balance between the
 

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:33.180
want to find some balance between the
costs and the bending the damages no

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.190
costs and the bending the damages no
 

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:41.650
costs and the bending the damages no
economics yep

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:41.660
economics yep
 

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.860
economics yep
so economics points to one inconvenient

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:44.870
so economics points to one inconvenient
 

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.080
so economics points to one inconvenient
truth about climate change policy and

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.090
truth about climate change policy and
 

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.750
truth about climate change policy and
that is to be effective the policies

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760
that is to be effective the policies
 

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.310
that is to be effective the policies
have to raise the price of carbon or co2

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320
have to raise the price of carbon or co2
 

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.530
have to raise the price of carbon or co2
and by doing that correct the

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:56.540
and by doing that correct the
 

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.090
and by doing that correct the
externality of the marketplace and so

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.100
externality of the marketplace and so
 

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.920
externality of the marketplace and so
one of the I think one of the insights

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:02.930
one of the I think one of the insights
 

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.260
one of the I think one of the insights
of economics that I feel very strongly

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.270
of economics that I feel very strongly
 

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.690
of economics that I feel very strongly
about is if you're going to be effective

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:07.700
about is if you're going to be effective
 

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.670
about is if you're going to be effective
you have to raise the price because

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:09.680
you have to raise the price because
 

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.860
you have to raise the price because
putting a price on our activities is the

putting a price on our activities is the

you would see the dual variables there

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600
you would see the dual variables there
 

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.380

really occurred to me that to think of
 

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.270
really occurred to me that to think of
this in this way and so what basically I

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.280
this in this way and so what basically I
 

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.610

it is evolved over time and I won't i
won't spend much more time on that i'll

won't spend much more time on that i'll
 

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.920
won't spend much more time on that i'll
just mention that this actually

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:29.930
just mention that this actually
 

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.540
just mention that this actually
disappeared for a long time and then

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:31.550
disappeared for a long time and then
 

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.820
disappeared for a long time and then
re-emerge about 20 years later in the

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:33.830
re-emerge about 20 years later in the
 

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.030
re-emerge about 20 years later in the
idea of the social cost of carbon which

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.040
idea of the social cost of carbon which
 

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.310
idea of the social cost of carbon which
is how much it costs to put a ton of

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320
is how much it costs to put a ton of
 

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.000
is how much it costs to put a ton of
carbon in the atmosphere

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.010
carbon in the atmosphere
 

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.720
carbon in the atmosphere
and that's actually central now to

and that's actually central now to
 

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.310

I'm not going to go through the various

I'm not going to go through the various
proofs of that but I want to talk about

proofs of that but I want to talk about
 

00:26:43.049 --> 00:26:47.360
proofs of that but I want to talk about
what why that's a problem and what we

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:47.370
what why that's a problem and what we
 

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:53.180
what why that's a problem and what we
might do about it enough so as I think

might do about it enough so as I think

about this the the read the problem here
is the that these treaties have been

00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:02.549
is the that these treaties have been
 

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:04.789
is the that these treaties have been
ineffective in limiting carbon emissions

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799
ineffective in limiting carbon emissions
 

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:05.840

dealing with climate change and the
 

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.350

reason is because of free riding and
 

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.970
reason is because of free riding and
freeriding is where you receive the

freeriding is where you receive the
 

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.310
freeriding is where you receive the
benefit of collective activity

of international climate policy what it

of international climate policy what it
 

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.620
of international climate policy what it
means is you ways you get the reduction

called a climate club and want to talk

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:13.190
called a climate club and want to talk
 

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.230
called a climate club and want to talk
about that in my last three minutes so

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240
about that in my last three minutes so
 

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.000
about that in my last three minutes so
what is the idea of a climate club the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.010
what is the idea of a climate club the
 

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.150
what is the idea of a climate club the

where you you know what clubs are we're
all in clubs of various kinds but

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520
all in clubs of various kinds but
 

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.190
all in clubs of various kinds but
they're also international clubs is the

remember there's the club of NATO which
 

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.610

you're not a member but the Sweden is
not a member but is a beneficiary

there's the club of the World Trade

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:49.280
there's the club of the World Trade

Organization of which we're all
beneficiaries and the idea for club here

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:53.390
beneficiaries and the idea for club here
 

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.270
beneficiaries and the idea for club here
is to change the way we think of

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:55.280
is to change the way we think of
 

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.950
is to change the way we think of
international agreements which are

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960
international agreements which are
 

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.680
international agreements which are
essentially voluntary for climate to

00:28:59.680 --> 00:28:59.690
essentially voluntary for climate to
 

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.650
essentially voluntary for climate to
make them ones where you you not only

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:02.660
make them ones where you you not only
 

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.800
make them ones where you you not only
benefit but you pay and for the example

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:05.810
benefit but you pay and for the example
 

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:11.500
benefit but you pay and for the example
that I'll suggest is an international

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:11.510
that I'll suggest is an international
 

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.990
that I'll suggest is an international
climate club to overcome free-writing is

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000
climate club to overcome free-writing is
 

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.600
climate club to overcome free-writing is
the idea is that you would have club

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:16.610
the idea is that you would have club
 

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.910
the idea is that you would have club
played ooze through abatement but

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:18.920
played ooze through abatement but
 

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.240
played ooze through abatement but
members but non-members are penalized by

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.250
members but non-members are penalized by
 

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.260
members but non-members are penalized by
having tariffs on their imports into the

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:25.270
having tariffs on their imports into the
 

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.860
having tariffs on their imports into the
club region and so let's say you set a

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:29.870
club region and so let's say you set a
 

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.170
club region and so let's say you set a
target carbon price of $50 a ton

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:35.180
target carbon price of $50 a ton
 

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.900
target carbon price of $50 a ton
then nations would have their domestic

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:37.910
then nations would have their domestic
 

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.820
then nations would have their domestic
price through whatever mechanism they

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:39.830
price through whatever mechanism they
 

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:43.120
price through whatever mechanism they
would choose at $50 a ton but if you

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.130
would choose at $50 a ton but if you
 

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.530
would choose at $50 a ton but if you
weren't a participant then you would

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:44.540
weren't a participant then you would
 

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.530
weren't a participant then you would
have a penalty attack a penalty tariff

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:47.540
have a penalty attack a penalty tariff
 

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.590
have a penalty attack a penalty tariff
into the club region so the dues are

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600
into the club region so the dues are
 

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:56.280
into the club region so the dues are
abatement and penalties are the tariff

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:56.290
abatement and penalties are the tariff
 

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.420
abatement and penalties are the tariff
and I'll just show you a very simple

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:58.430
and I'll just show you a very simple
 

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.580
and I'll just show you a very simple
example this is from my during my

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:00.590
example this is from my during my
 

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.170
example this is from my during my
presidential address to the American

and it's a very simple idea here the

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:06.140
and it's a very simple idea here the
 

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.560
and it's a very simple idea here the
bars from left to right are the tariff

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:08.570
bars from left to right are the tariff
 

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.730
bars from left to right are the tariff
rates of a club there are 15 regions in

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:12.740
rates of a club there are 15 regions in
 

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.159
rates of a club there are 15 regions in
this and the height of the bar is how

00:30:15.159 --> 00:30:15.169
this and the height of the bar is how
 

00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:17.289
this and the height of the bar is how
many participants there are as a

00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:17.299
many participants there are as a
 

00:30:17.299 --> 00:30:20.019
many participants there are as a
function of each tariff level and the

00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:20.029
function of each tariff level and the
 

00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:22.269
function of each tariff level and the
first tariff level is zero and that's

00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279
first tariff level is zero and that's
 

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:23.889
first tariff level is zero and that's
the basic structure where there's no

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:23.899
the basic structure where there's no
 

00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:26.500
the basic structure where there's no
penalty to non participation and there

participate and then it is high enough

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.460
participate and then it is high enough
 

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.409
participate and then it is high enough
all nations participate so we are

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:44.419
all nations participate so we are
 

00:30:44.419 --> 00:30:46.149
