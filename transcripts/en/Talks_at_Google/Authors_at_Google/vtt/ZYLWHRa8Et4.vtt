00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.689
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: A little bit of a souvenir
from Maryland of the Human Computer Interaction

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.670
Lab, a T-shirt in our bright green so it goes
with your usability green leafs.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.769
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker: Thank you very much.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.680
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Thank you for hosting me
here and guess I'll just at least show you

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.570
the Maryland caps so we're very proud of the
relationship of Maryland with Google. Of course

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.830
Sergey Brin was one of our graduates in 1993.
His father's a professor of math at Maryland

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.820
and Sergey graduated from Maryland and he
did go to Stanford, didn't graduate from there,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.910
but he is a graduate of Maryland. So we're
pleased by all that and [laughs] I'm pleased

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
with the connections to Google and those have
been expanded recently thanks to Dan Russell

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.420
for his help in making some of those connections
get stronger.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.160
And I'm a professor of computer science and
doing traditional database file design optimization

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.930
techniques as my early work, but I've grown
up to do something a little bit different

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.440
and cross over to the side of integrating
psychology with the computing. And I'm proud

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.569
of the 28 year old or 28 year young Human
Computer Interaction Laboratory that's interdisciplinary,

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:12.270
shared between the College of the Computer
Science Department and the College of Information

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.159
Studies, but also has these other wonderful
connections around campus with different departments

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.799
including the wonderfully titled Maryland
Institute for Technology and the Humanities

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.139
(MITH). And so you can visit our website,
more than 600 papers, 200 videos, 40 pieces

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:35.639
of software and so on. And we'll take a visual
look a little bit later at some of the representation

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.439
of those tech reports.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.669
I hope some of you know me from "Designing
the User Interface," the book. The first edition

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:50.439
was in 1986 and it's grown and changed and
tried to represent what happened. And my collaborator

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.689
for the fourth and fifth editions is Catherine
Plaisant who's been working with me as a researcher

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:03.229
for more than 20 years. And this fifth edition
represents a substantial change, even from

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.869
the times of the fourth edition when YouTube
was just getting started, Facebook didn't

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:16.010
exist, Twitter was not even an idea, and now
we have five billion cell phone users and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.650
a remarkable transformation where the social
media are bridging out to be evermore impactful.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.379
So a lot of our effort has shifted towards
studying these social media and trying to

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.909
understand the complex networks that are embedded
in these social media with the goal of course

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.819
of facilitating the beneficial outcomes and
limiting the negative ones, the malicious

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:49.879
attacks, the use for nefarious purposes endangers
the whole venture of social media and yet

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.190
the attractions are very strong and that's
where we're gonna go today. And I'm gonna

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.390
focus narrowly on the use of information visualization
and analysis for understanding these complex

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.390
networks.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.829
So we had started in this book, now 12 years
old, tried to define the topic, and it had

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:20.230
the subtitle given by my co-authors Stu Card
and Jock Mackinlay to call it Using Vision

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.670
to Think. That is your eyes are not just input
devices but they're ways of solving problems;

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.230
that the optic nerve and your mind is well
designed to in a few hundred milliseconds

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.739
pick out trends, clusters, gaps, and outliers
if the visual representations are appropriate

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.060
in terms of colors, size, shape, and proximity.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.269
So the remaining set of challenges people
are getting better at understanding this.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.280
The topic of scientific visualization has
been around for 50 years, but information

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.290
visualization only about 16 or 18 years by
way of the conferences that use that title.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.709
Visual analytics has grown up in the last
six years as a major topic and it really provides

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.579
a encompassing view where information visualization's
usually seen as the technology but there's

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.759
a framework of getting the problem, getting
the data, choosing the hypotheses, working

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:22.639
on the insights, developing and understanding,
preparing a decision, making a presentation.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.210
So that's the sort of the end to end effort.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.590
I'll sort of start by showing off a little,
a risk of showing off a little, but this was

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.250
done by somebody else, Katy Borner at Indiana
University. These are all the papers in the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:42.389
world of InfoVis as of the 2004 collection
of papers. And what you see here are the authors.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:50.410
The number of papers they wrote is the size
of their circles and you see the number of

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.530
co-authorships very tight working group of
that my partners from PARC, Jock Mackinlay,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.300
Stu Card, and George Robertson, who subsequently
went to Microsoft.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.510
And there's my circle and I work with lots
of students. So that's the difference between

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.539
an industrial research group that's stable,
funded, and produces good work over many years

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.639
and an academic group which has a lot of traveling
people who come and go. Now and then you might

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.060
see Martin Wattenberg who I work with who's
now working at Google and I think he's out

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.690
there somewhere, but I'm sure he's probably
writing good code and trying to take the good

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.810
ideas he's developed and put them to work
for Google.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.870
You may also notice other familiar names like
Mark Weiser who was a faculty member at Maryland

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.680
before he went to PARC and did a lot of important
work there, but a lot of people you'll see

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680
around here.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.881
You can also distinguish the clusters that
may be relevant or interesting to you. There's

00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:53.720
the Carnegie Mellon bunch over here; we have
UC Berkeley; you have University of Minnesota,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.540
there's Georgia Tech. You come to know these
and finding the meaningful clusters becomes

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.909
one of the natural things that you wanna do.

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.690
So this slide is sort of the motivator for
the idea of thinking about networks and deriving

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:13.039
visual analytics from a single graphic design.
Now of course you're going to apply statistical

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.139
methods as well to not only develop the visualization
but confirm the kind of hypotheses that you

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.560
might be getting from these visualizations.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.419
That book, the InfoVis book, brings the link
between myself and Card and Mackinlay.

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.370
Alright, so just a further few words about
information visualization, few examples, and

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.570
then my main focus today is about network
visualization using the tool that we've developed

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.110
over the last four years called NodeXL. So
I hope visualization's well and placed here,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:51.319
but to push it along there's the companies
that got started five and ten years ago, got

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.580
bought by the medium-sized companies, and
then the medium ones by the big companies.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.420
Google bought Gapminder and maybe other visualization
companies that I don't know about, but there's

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:06.070
been a whole cascade of the purchase and the
integration of visualization into many companies.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:13.800
Our own work was by way of Spotfire. Any Spotfire
users here? Alright! Great! And Spotfire was

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.260
the work of myself and Chris Ahlberg and published
in CHI Conference of 1994, remains one of

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.889
the most highly cited papers in that literature
and he formed the company in '97. I was part

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.659
of the board of directors for five years,
it grew to 200 people, and was bought in 2007

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.659
by TIBCO.

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:38.660
It remains probably the premier visualization
tool and this slide encompasses a rather simple

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.900
version which shows you one of its features,
The Guide where the author here, Nick Thomas,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.229
wrote a little explanation of what's here
and provided some guidelines by which you

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.080
could do further analyses.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:58.770
The multiple coordinated windows are linked,
a 3D scatter gram, a heat map over here, plate

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.840
map over here. And the significant discovery
here that Nick Thomas made from this slide

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:13.919
was the unusual or surprising activity of
the RBP1 gene which was not known to be as

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:19.860
active and it's important because it influences
retinol and retinol in turn influences embryonic

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.610
development and vision.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:27.129
The other aspects of the sort of standard
visualization tool kits are sets of sliders

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:32.070
and controls. Here are the double box sliders
that we call dynamic queries and have propagated

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.770
into lots of places but not everywhere. They're
still not part of standard tool kits, but

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.850
they're widely used on Web applications and
others, some of which I'll show.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:48.130
And so the sort of basic ideas were put in
place, but Spotfire's a high end tool used

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:54.640
by a lot of ambitious organizations, intelligence,
and analysts. Its main success story was pharmaceutical

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.010
drug discovery. All 25 of the leading pharma
companies use that as their process for weeding

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:06.750
out the hundred thousand pharmaceutical compounds
into the three that they're gonna run clinical

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:13.590
trials on, and so that kind of process that
a company like Pfizer has, like 3,000 people

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:20.040
who use Spotfire in rather systematic ways;
similar for AstraZeneca or Norvartis and so

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.040
on.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.331
But visualization's used in lots of places
and getting more pixels is the desirable thing.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:30.140
As I walked around the floor here I saw people
with two large displays each, that's probably

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.940
about right. But getting higher resolution
we've moved towards larger, not larger in

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.750
inches but larger in pixels, so that we can
get more on the screen and read them carefully

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.790
without having to move your body too far left
or right and still be able to read all the

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:54.680
text, but when the detail gets rich and interesting
you can see it all there at once. So these

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.830
larger displays are of growing fascination
for some people and actually growing benefit

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.830
from it.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.640
Also visualization on small displays is becoming
an important topic and so people are looking

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.840
for the ways to be able to explore data on
megapixel or smaller displays.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:20.280
So the lessons we learned in that 10 year
process are summarized in this phrase that

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:26.860
I playfully labeled as the mantra and I wrote
it in a paper just like this, 10 copies of

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.520
it or 12, 10 copies where each line represented
a project where we struggled for weeks or

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:39.070
months to come up with a design. And it was
overview first, show the user the whole data

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.570
set whether it's a million or a billion items,
see the whole data set, see the whole board:

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:50.260
where has the data clustered, where are the
outliers, where are the anomalies. Ok? And

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.540
then allow the user to zoom in on what they
want, filter out what they don't want, and

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.610
then click for details on demand; that became
the principle.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:05.190
And the application of this principle went
through a variety of domains so the scientific

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.760
visualization I've mentioned has been around
a long time, but it had a very different flavor

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:16.421
than these newer InfoVis problems. The sci
vis problems were meant to show two and three

00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:24.640
dimensional worlds and the question was where?
Where does the constriction in the arteries

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.930
influence blood circulation? Where is the
turbulence greatest in the air flow over the

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.470
wing of an aircraft? And you wanted to know
things were left or right or up or down or

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.590
east or west or inside or outside.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:46.240
By contrast, InfoVis is a very different set
of problems and it's not so much where but

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.730
you get a new set of questions. So I've talked
about multi-variant data which is what Spotfire

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:59.180
and its competitors now like Tableau; there's
a variety of other tools out there. They try

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:06.100
to show you when you have high dimensional
data sets, a set a series of multiple two-dimensional

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.270
projections to give you an understanding of
what the relationships, what the clusters,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.030
gaps, outliers might be.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:17.460
For temporal data you might have patterns
that rise: stock market information, gene

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:24.140
expression data, and when Google goes up does
Microsoft go up or does Microsoft go down?

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.610
Or does Apple go up or down? Is there a relationship
that might be interesting, that might be useful,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:37.220
that might be significant? So that is most
commonly seen in temporal data that has continuous

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:43.060
values like stock market closing prices, but
as I'll show you we also look at places where's

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.930
there's categorical data like patient event
histories. Patients are admitted to a hospital,

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:54.420
they have a surgery, they get treated, they
receive the medication, they're sent home.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:01.780
And trying to track the patterns in categorical
event streams like Web Log Data we think is

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.830
a significant and important problem.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:11.000
Tree structured data is another common space
I'm gonna show that quickly. But my main focus

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.810
today is network data.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:18.560
So just to motivate the idea of information
visualization I give you this little challenge:

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:25.630
Anscombe was a statistician at Princeton University
and he developed this little example: 12 lines

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:35.990
of 12 data points in 4 groups. And I'll just
pause a moment and ask you do you see anything

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.300
interesting in these four groups?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.300
[pause]

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.710
It's a little audience participation here.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.710
[pause]

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.460
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:50.890
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: There's a big outlier in
four and I think you're pointing out to this

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.890
19 here, right? That one stands out. How did
you catch that?

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.440
&gt;&gt;male #2: Very visually distinct.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.910
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: It's visually distinct,
right? It wasn't just that the number was

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.310
distinct, if that was seven I think you would
have had a hard time, or six maybe you would

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.780
have had a hard time seeing it. All the other
ones here are eight which you might comment

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.270
on also. Anything else, anybody see anything
interesting?

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.270
[pause]

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.270
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.500
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Very good. Column, the
X columns in one, two, and three are exactly

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.170
the same. So that takes a while to spot that.
Can you, would you be able to draw these curves?

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.350
[pause]

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.060
Be a little tough and it'll take awhile. You
probably could, but it would take a while.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:32.080
So you say, "I'm a statistician I can do data
mining, I can do statistics." So you're gonna

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.070
apply statistics, means, standard deviation,
and variance, correlation, coefficients are

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:44.480
all the same. So the point of this, of Anscombe's
Quartet was that the statistics don't always

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.130
tell you what's happening and that the blind
application of statistical methods and data

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.610
mining and machine learning is not enough.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:59.290
These four are not special; there are 40 more
or 400 million more that I could create that

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:05.010
would have the same statistical properties.
Okay? And so it may be helpful to look at

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.870
them and if you take a look in a few hundred
milliseconds, you ready? One, two, three,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:16.890
there we go. You immediately grasp and potentially
will remember what each of these patterns

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.360
are about.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.200
The first one being a sort of low, linear,
positive correlation; the second being a very

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.740
high correlation, quadratic in nature though;
and then the third one is a straight linear

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:34.770
correlation with one outlier or anomaly? I
would call it an anomaly. Outliers are usually

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.320
defined as three standard deviations from
mean in a normal distribution, but I almost

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:46.850
never get to see a normal distribution and
so having something weird like this indicates

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.100
probably, I would say, an error in the data.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:54.990
And I would say visualization is beneficial
even if you only use it for data cleaning.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.750
The major of data sets that people bring to
me in my office have something wrong with

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.300
them that people just don't know about.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:11.570
I had 6,400 hospital admissions or hospital
emergency room visits and the age was recorded

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:17.610
and studied by male and female, admitted and
sent home, insurance, non-insurance. It turned

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:25.080
out three of those patients were 999 years
old and nobody knew it and they run the data

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.030
analysis on that.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:32.610
Other cases I had years' worth of data given
to me, a times series data, but April was

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.260
missing and they never knew this.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.400
Other cases, [clears throat] few hundred lines
of data [clears throat] and 41 lines were

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.670
copied exactly the same twice in the data
set. So the data sets we get to see have a

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:52.100
lot of varied kind of errors and the visualization
will help people understand them.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.750
I'm not gonna do demos here but we could take
a look or you can download it for free, we've

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:02.610
worked on time series data that looks like
stock market data or others and finding peaks

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:09.230
and valleys, finding stable portions, finding
growing ranges were all things we were able

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.390
to do in a very systematic way by visual presentation.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.600
We extended this in TimeSearcher 2, also free
to download, so that you could look at tens

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:25.689
of thousands of points even on a thousand
point wide display and search for common patterns.

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:31.879
Here we're looking at some weather data in
Italian cities. So we're looking at the sunlight,

00:17:31.879 --> 00:17:36.679
this is over a five year period. You can see
the seasonal variations and here's a two month

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:42.559
period selected from the end of August to
the end of October, that's expanded over here.

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:48.350
We've got two cloudy days and seven sunny
days in between. We search for patterns like

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:54.429
that and the triangles in the overview show
me where those things occur and I can go looking

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:56.690
for things that are similar.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.150
We also looked for patterns. As I mentioned
in temporal event sequences, this is out sort

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:06.950
of hot breakthrough area these days, although
this early example goes back now more than

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:16.909
10 years of looking at patient visits to physicians,
hospitalizations, lab tests, then medications.

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:21.179
And so if you click on the sonogram you see
the sonogram, there's the fetus. If you click

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:26.240
on the x-ray you'll get to see the x-ray.
And the today line shows you where we are:

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.970
this patient is pregnant and is predicted
to be pregnant for another two, three months;

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:36.590
has been diagnosed as having diabetes; receiving
insulin; increased dose of insulin; and last,

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.350
likes to counteract the side effects.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:44.899
So getting an overview of a patient in one
screen rather than 103 pages of documentation

00:18:44.899 --> 00:18:50.320
is proving to be a significant advantage and
as we move to electronic medical records that's

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.850
become a big issue for us in trying to study
how to build the right kind of designs.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:01.580
We've also taken on the problem if I have
a million or 10 million patients how do I

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.289
find patterns? And so each of these rows here
represents one patient and here we were looking

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:14.450
for radiology contrast patterns [clears throat]
and the pattern we were looking for low creatinine

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:20.259
before the radiology injection and then high
creatinine afterwards. We were able to find

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:27.799
that in a group of some 4,000 patients, find
100 and I think 51 who had this particular

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.570
pattern of behavior.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:35.899
So again free to download Life Lines 2 and
I don't think I have it here but the new tool

00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:40.820
which is really a breakthrough on top of this
called LifeFlow lets you look even if you

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.350
have a million of any kind of event sequences
see you can see 'em on the screen in a single

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:51.460
screen. That's proven to be a huge payoff
and we're working on a variety of applications

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:58.240
for that, mainly medical, but we've just received
support from Oracle to go after that and expand

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.970
that topic as well.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:05.399
Okay, I can't resist showing you some tree
maps. If you haven't seen the tree map idea

00:20:05.399 --> 00:20:10.440
this goes back now some 20 years and that
was our tree map for the Gene Ontology which

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.220
was 14,000 genes in a 23 level hierarchy.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:21.830
I hope you're more familiar with Martin Wattenberg's
tree map of smart money, Market Map done in

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:30.909
1999. I was a consultant for working with
them at the time. And each of the companies

00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:40.279
has a rectangle whose size is a function of
the market capitalization and the color indicates,

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:47.090
green mean it's rising, red means it's falling.
They're organized into 11 industry groups:

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:52.380
health care, financial, energy, technology,
and then broken down into two more levels

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.809
of hierarchy so you can zoom in on those.

00:20:55.809 --> 00:21:01.610
And one day this is what the market looked
like, so here's another bad day for the market,

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:05.240
pretty red. Anybody see anything interesting?

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240
[pause]

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.350
Yeah, I see some fingers pointing. If you
take a moment it won't take you long even,

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:15.350
whoops, it won't take you long to see there's
one bright green dot, it's not just a little

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.639
green, it's bright green. And when I click
on that as you click on any one of these stocks

00:21:20.639 --> 00:21:27.029
you get a 20 year trading history and a mountain
of data about their previous transactions,

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:33.460
insider trading, and so on. And that green
dot was the A&amp;P Trading Company which that

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:39.500
day had bought the Pathmark chain of grocery
stores. They were up 6% when everybody else

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.929
was down.

00:21:40.929 --> 00:21:46.490
And so I like this slide because it makes
the point about visualization which is that

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:52.190
it gives you answers to questions you didn't
know you had, okay? Things leap out when your

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:58.080
eye becomes trained to us this, and it does
take a little training to understand and see

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:05.630
the hierarchical structure in this two-dimensional
space-filling, space-limiting representation.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.590
Other days the patterns are a little more
subtle, mostly green for technology, mostly

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:16.620
green for energy, mostly green for financial,
mostly red for financial, and mostly red for

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.129
health care except one [bad audio] over there.

00:22:20.129 --> 00:22:25.659
So you can begin to discern these patterns.
I like this one which was a green day if you

00:22:25.659 --> 00:22:33.980
like happier news and, oh sorry, over here
we see the contrarian gold stocks go differently.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.720
When the market's up the gold stocks go down
typically, not always but that's a pattern

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.809
I've come to understand. And others, basic
materials, defense industries are over here,

00:22:45.809 --> 00:22:51.139
and so on, Google over here. I've come to
know where the favorites are over time. You

00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:56.510
can do this, this is free at smartmoney.com/marketmap.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:01.669
This was an interesting one not too long ago
when the market was pretty green but Sprint

00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:07.139
had a huge decline of 16%, that's a lot for
one day. And does anybody remember why that

00:23:07.139 --> 00:23:08.139
happens?

00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:09.139
[pause]

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:11.840
&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.890
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Right, AT&amp;T bought, what
did they bought, they bought ?

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:16.890
&gt;&gt;male #3: T-Mobile.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.100
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: T-Mobile right? So that
was bad news for Sprint and it tumbled badly

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.600
on that day.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:28.809
So if you know enough of the background domain
knowledge you can begin to understand what's

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:32.220
going on and that's kind of the power of these
tools.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:37.779
Others have done tree maps of many kinds.
This is Marcos Weskamp's news map which shows

00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:42.340
all the world's news based on the Google news
aggregator. It simply takes the values from

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:49.290
the Google news aggregator, shows them here
U.S. only organized by world news, international,

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:54.159
national, technology, sports, entertainment,
and health. And then you can compare U.S.

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:59.480
to U.K., Spain, Netherlands, Mexico, or 20
different countries. So you can see how a

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.370
story plays in one country versus another
country.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:09.649
This one I just added last week was the Encyclopedia
of Life project you may know about. It's two

00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:13.830
million species on planet earth and the idea
is to get a webpage for every one of them

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:18.640
and get photographs and data, scientific data,
for every one of them as a kind of Wikipedia

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:24.360
project and of course it takes from Wikipedia,
but this was the way they organized, or one

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.659
of the ways they organized, by a tree map.
So I think chordate are where humans are right,

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:35.340
am I right the chordate are spine and then
all these other, and you can see the number

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:40.769
of species represents the size.

00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:46.200
Spotfire added tree maps a few years ago and
that's become a regular staple and very useful

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.940
part of that tool extending its value.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:56.330
New York Times began using tree maps in 2007
and continues to do that for a variety of

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:01.220
applications including the more sort of esoteric
ones like the Voronoi Treemap, a nice invention

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.330
of a German researcher named Michael Balzer,
who within a year of publishing it appears

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:12.889
in the New York Times to show the consumer
price index in a more organic take a look

00:25:12.889 --> 00:25:13.889
in form.

00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:20.529
For scalability there's a million node tree
map, shows all the files and directories on

00:25:20.529 --> 00:25:25.259
the servers in the computer science department
at Maryland and there's an hour's worth or

00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:30.619
discussion of insights here but this large
gray area was about 7% of the storage space

00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:37.179
that was being not garbage collected and was
just wasted space which was a surprise.

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:42.369
Other obvious things are three large directories
that had, were simply copied and shouldn't

00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:47.010
been. There's other places where's there's
six copies of the same directories and a variety

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.059
of other interesting things.

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:55.169
Okay, so that's all the preface. Here's what's
the talks about today: analyzing social media

00:25:55.169 --> 00:26:02.200
and I choose Manuel Lima's page ironically
entitled "VisualComplexity," where he has

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:09.869
cataloged more than 700 ways of showing networks.
And they are many very beautiful, but many

00:26:09.869 --> 00:26:15.690
very tangled bowls of spaghetti as they're
often called, and so while they may look pretty

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.360
they don't always provide you the kind of
insights you're after.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.580
So we begin to develop our own strategies
and this is the Ph.D. work of Adam Perer called

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:31.490
"Social Action" which we still use and it
integrates statistical methods with a search

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:38.409
process, a visual analytics process called
systemic yet flexible, and gives you control

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:42.289
over the visualization.

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:51.289
I'm gonna show one little video, this is my
favorite one minute story. It shows the Senate

00:26:51.289 --> 00:27:00.509
voting data for the year 2007, the red Republicans
and the blue Democrats and every senator is

00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:06.370
connected to every other senator by a link
so there's about 5,000 links here. The strength

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:14.140
of each link is the number of times they voted
the same way. Okay, the number of times, there

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:20.119
were 330 roll call votes and the most similar
votes were Cardin and Mikulski, who you may

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:26.700
know are both Maryland senators, they voted
the same way 303 times. And then we go down

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.840
295, 285, down to 100 or so.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.610
We used the Fruchterman-Reingold layout algorithm
and we start jiggling around and we're now

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:45.419
gonna start filtering out the low value ones:
110, 120, 130, 140, 150. So those who aren't

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:48.769
that similar to the others break out and McCain,

00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:49.769
[laughter]

00:27:49.769 --> 00:27:54.409
who was running for President didn't vote
enough times to be similar to anybody, okay?

00:27:54.409 --> 00:28:01.700
And then you get this remarkable, unbelievable,
too good to be true visualization. Brownback

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:09.989
was running for President and he drifts off
separately and it's just amazingly you get

00:28:09.989 --> 00:28:14.769
this nice strong separation going on here.

00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:20.200
And I'm gonna stop it right here just to draw
attention to a few things. You do see the

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.299
Democrats have a strong group and the two
independents, Lieberman and Sanders, they

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:29.739
may call themselves independent but they're
pretty much Democrat and Sanders very much

00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:35.860
so, very far from the Republican positions.
And way out on the side are Dodd, Biden, Kerry,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:42.499
and Obama, okay this is before Obama went
more center, he was far from the Republican

00:28:42.499 --> 00:28:43.499
positions.

00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:48.470
Now in the middle you have Olympia Snow of
Maine, Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania, Susan

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:54.769
Collins, and those three as you can see get
sometimes close to the Democrats. In fact

00:28:54.769 --> 00:29:01.190
those are the three senators who two years
later in January 2009 voted in favor of the

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.880
stimulus bill with the 50 Democratic senators.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:13.360
So that was a pretty strong, compelling result
here and that showed this remarkable, I didn't

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:20.009
expect this strong separation, but there it
was and yet you could see somehow these crossover

00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:22.690
patterns which really leap out at you.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.610
Any questions about this? Do you see this?
Do you understand what you're looking at?

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:33.659
I'm gonna continue rolling it and we're gonna
freeze the topology, turn off Fruchterman-Reingold

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:40.630
and now continue filtering to get rid of the
similarities that are 190, 200, 210, 220,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:46.840
and the really similar voting patterns and
now you see another remarkable pattern emerging,

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:52.450
and there it is. The Republicans during that
voting season had lost their party cohesion,

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:58.029
whereas the Democrats were still pretty well
connected, although Dodd, Biden, Kerry, and

00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:03.249
Obama were not connected to the Democratic
mainstream. If you do a deeper analysis you'll

00:30:03.249 --> 00:30:08.769
find that this linkage is tied up a lot with
a group of Midwestern Democratic senators

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:12.119
who caucus together and often vote as a block.

00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:18.570
Within the Republicans there's one left, so
any algorithm that was looking for no connection

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:23.649
wouldn't have found it, but there's one of
Isakson and Chambliss who still have a connection

00:30:23.649 --> 00:30:27.950
there, but as you can see the Republican Party
did not have the cohesion.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:30.739
Others have since followed up and done other
years going back in time, forward in time,

00:30:30.739 --> 00:30:36.360
and this has become a sort of standard method.
Chris Wilson was the journalist who brought

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.130
this to us for Slate Magazine and he wrote
about it in Slate with Adam Perer as well.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.830
Any questions about this before I leave it?

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:49.389
Again I wanna sort of convey to you that when
you do have the right layouts, when you do

00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:55.409
have the right organization of information,
then the insights essentially leap out at

00:30:55.409 --> 00:31:00.490
you. It does take some training in getting
your eye accustomed to what the normal patterns

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:07.739
are, but once you do that you really can begin
to make these discoveries that can be significant.

00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:10.960
Okay, so we did that, that was Adam Perer's
work.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.700
We still use SocialAction as part of other
tools, but today I wanted to take you down

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:24.139
the path and talk about the social media analysis
and I liken it to footprints in the sand.

00:31:24.139 --> 00:31:30.929
Here's a social media of walking on the beach
and with a little skill you could begin to

00:31:30.929 --> 00:31:36.429
read these: which direction are they walking,
is it a young person, an old person, are they

00:31:36.429 --> 00:31:41.240
heavy, are they light, are they walking together,
did the same pair of footprints return two

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:48.119
hours later, are they walking a dog, what's
going on? How long did it? So we are just

00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:52.519
beginning to learn how to interpret or track
these social media.

00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:57.249
And the tool we've been building for four
years is called NodeXL. It's embedded inside

00:31:57.249 --> 00:32:05.869
Excel 2007 and 2010, sorry to say that means
that it runs on the PC side. The MAC even

00:32:05.869 --> 00:32:12.359
2011 version of Excel does not have the foundational
tools we need. So we'll have to work on that

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:14.279
and get that to happen.

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:20.789
So the idea is very simple; in the spreadsheet
side you just put Ann invited Bob, Bob invited

00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:28.369
Carol, Carol invited Dave, and so on and then
you say if you can make a bar chart or a pie

00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:33.899
chart you can make a network drawing. And
it will draw the network and then you can

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:39.470
change the visual properties and make the
girls pink and the boys blue and add labels,

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.019
etcetera.

00:32:41.019 --> 00:32:44.899
If you do the Senate voting data it works
very nicely; it comes with the tool when you

00:32:44.899 --> 00:32:51.659
download it, it's free to download, open source
and free, and so you can do the Senate voting

00:32:51.659 --> 00:32:57.740
and there again we have Specter, Collins and
Snow right in the middle in this case. Okay?

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:03.730
So I just wanna give you a little tour of
the possibilities to tantalize you, the copies

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:09.750
of the book is on the table here, give you
more details and show you how to do it, motivate

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:15.640
it, and then walk you through the application
in many different places.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.470
Part of NodeXL's charm is the importers, or
as we call them spigots, that let you import

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:29.860
your email, import your Flickr, Twitter, YouTube,
Facebook, variety of other sources and we're

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:34.840
working with a variety of publishers and organizations
who wanna create spigots either for their

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:41.200
internal use or to publish within the NodeXL
framework or sometimes an independent one.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:49.530
So the VOSON system lets you map websites,
you give it a seed of whatever 10 or 15 websites

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:54.950
and it will fan out and collect all the network
connections of a set of websites and then

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:58.659
you can browse them in NodeXL.

00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:03.590
The particular charm is the Twitter importer
which has become very hot and I'm gonna show

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:08.040
you a bunch of the Twitter streams and then
show you a bunch of other applications.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.410
This is one of our early ones at NYU just
a few blocks from here. September 2009 there

00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:20.350
was a conference at the Business School called
A Workshop on Information in Networks. And

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.310
about 80 people assembled and there was a
real feeling there was a bunch of sociologists

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:30.000
talking over here and a bunch of computer
scientists over there. And my buddy Mark Smith

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.610
went to the Twitter stream and downloaded
all the Tweets that had the hash tag win09.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:41.310
And sure enough when you plot the follower
and follower's network you find the sociologists

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:46.561
right over here and you find the computer
scientists right over here and one MIT graduate

00:34:46.561 --> 00:34:52.390
student as the bridge between them. It was
a very encouraging and fortuitous initial

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:58.380
discovery that we were able to find this pretty
interesting pattern. Some of you may recognize

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:02.600
sociologists like Barry Wellman, a sort of
important figure in the field, they're sized

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.060
by the number of followers.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.990
So we've done this over the few years, this
is the Worldwide Web 2010 Conference, a very

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:16.500
different pattern, somewhat larger one where
you can see it's a very cohesive group. These

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.290
people all know each other quite well and
follow each other, they're a large group.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.760
On the bottom we put up the people who are
not connected. So only about 5% of the group

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:32.530
were not connected; this is a very different
pattern and this nexus of tight connections

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:38.950
over here shows a well-organized, coherent
group that actually talks to each other.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:46.390
By 2011, we had polished our techniques still
further and so we're able to apply clustering

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:51.810
algorithms and then put the different groups
into separate boxes whose size was determined

00:35:51.810 --> 00:36:00.920
by the number of nodes in each box, and so
you get a set of researchers including our

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:07.300
own Jimmy Lin over here sized by the number
of followers. Tim Berners-Lee has got a big

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:12.050
set of followers so he's over here, but some
of his collaborators you may know, Jim Hendler

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:17.110
and Nigel Shadbolt have a separate group.
The Brazilians were over here and we're able

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:23.590
to discern patterns and I'll show you some
other examples of those, of how we began to

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:29.510
be able to organize and present the information
inside of a bowl of spaghetti into meaningful

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.780
ways you could see clusters and groups and
outliers.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.780
This is --

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.780
&gt;&gt;(Dan): So Ben --

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.780
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Yeah.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.780
&gt;&gt;(Dan): can I interrupt real quick?

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.780
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Yeah.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.780
&gt;&gt;(Dan): I got a quick question about that
one --

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.780
&gt;&gt;Ben Schneiderman: Yeah.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.780
&gt;&gt;(Dan): go back one.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.780
&gt;&gt;Ben Schneiderman: Right, there you are.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.380
&gt;&gt;(Dan): The boxes are interesting but they
have no apparent connection to the obvious

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.620
underlying structure of the visualization.
How did you get the boxes?

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:56.670
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: If you look within each
box all the nodes are the same color so we

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.370
apply a clustering algorithm to it and we
have several embedded in NodeXL, so we'll

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:07.560
do the clustering for you and then you've
got one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:14.581
clusters here and then we'll draw the boxes
to include where the size the biggest one's

00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:21.050
in the upper left and it's the most number
of nodes in selection from Twitter. In this

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:28.600
case, this one's a little messy because it
shows the edges go across the boxes as well.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:35.170
I'll show you another one later where it doesn't
have, there's a check box where you can eliminate

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:41.550
the edges that go across the boxes so you
can look at the structure within each cluster.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.630
So Dan does that explain it?

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.630
[pause]

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.630
It's a pretty nice --

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah --

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.630
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: feature.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:53.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: I assume that there's a way to actually
create a cluster that follows that dramatic

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.960
diagonal stripe, the sort of light from the
sun god up there in the center --

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.960
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Yeah --

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: radiating down below --

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.500
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: Tim Berners-Lee and I'm
sorry, that's Tim Berners-Lee. This is, the

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:11.460
way it's going out these are his close collaborators.
The clustering algorithm actually put them

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:17.560
in a separate cluster, not together with him
which is that's the way clustering algorithms

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.990
go. But you can see there's a preponderance
he's connected to these people very well and

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:28.890
Jim Hendler, Nigel Shadbolt, and others I
can't see them right now. But we tend to do

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:35.760
these on 3K by 4K displays. On Mark's Flickr
Website you can download the full original

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.120
one of these and take a look at reading the
labels.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.070
Does that get you what you want?

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.070
&gt;&gt; Dan: That’s, that's--

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:49.090
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: We do drop all the singletons
in a separate bin over here and so we're able

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:54.350
to discern, we did a nice one with soccer
teams and they had interesting patterns so

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.330
that was kind of fun. I'll show you another
one in a little while.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:02.030
But this feature's our hot new feature and
we're just writing a paper on this so this

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:09.170
group in a box idea turns out to be I think
a very significant way of doing layout better.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.530
When you do this by straight Fruchterman-Reingold
you really can't see much, but when you throw

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:20.230
them into clusters and then into the boxes,
it really opens up your understanding.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:28.180
Alright, this was a simple one where we searched
on the term "HCI" and you can see it has two

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.860
actual clusters: this one is actually instead
of human computer interaction is human capital

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.740
index. And then all of these people are people
we knew, including Ed Shea who's just joined.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:44.680
Is Ed over there? But Ed's joined Google now
as well. And then this huge one we sized by

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.810
the number of followers is RKMT some of you
may know him, it's Jun Rekimoto who's the

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:56.260
head of the Sony Computer Science Lab in Tokyo.
And I sent him a note and I said, "Jun, how

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:02.340
did you get 160,000 followers?" And he said
well, at one point he was a recommended follower

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:10.251
and so he got 160,000 followers. That's way
beyond anyone else in this screen. Although

00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:15.180
[inaudible] of Twitter has of course even
more than that.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.430
So this showed you a structure, less well
developed structure and a lot of singletons,

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:26.010
a lot of people and a lot of mention HCI in
a variety of circumstances. But they're not

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:31.210
connected up as a group; the community of
HCI is not well structured, okay? On the other

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.970
hand, the CHI 2010 community did have a pretty
good structure and here we're showing it in

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:44.260
yet a different way where we have the number
of followers and number of Tweets algorithmically

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.110
on the sides there and it's pretty clear that
there's a strong cluster in the middle and

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:56.290
a dramatic outlier and that is Zephoria some
of you may know her. Danah Boyd, she's a senior

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:03.520
researcher for Microsoft but she has the most
number of followers even though she doesn't

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.850
have the most number of Tweets. But her Tweets
are interesting to read and a lot of people,

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:16.110
about 45,000 people follow Danah Boyd and
care about what she says.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:21.780
The place you wanna be is below the diagonal.
My buddy Mark Smith's right over here; he

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:29.300
gets attended to quite well. At this point,
I was only a moderately active Twitter person;

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:34.240
I'm over here still below the diagonal; that's
the good place to be. The ones above the diagonals

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.880
we call losers because --

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880
[laughter]

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:44.880
they Tweet a lot but nobody listens really.
And over here is this voice bot which is Tweets

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.850
a lot but nobody listens. So you can begin
to see these patterns of what's going on --

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.030
[pause]

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.610
that Tweet right. If so if you Tweet in a
forest does anybody hear? Right.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:01.020
So this is another way you can begin to look
at the data and NodeXL lets you represent

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.600
the X, Y positions.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:08.990
Now we began to study controversial communities.
So last year the oil spill was a controversial

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:15.390
topic and oil spill's sort of a open term
so a lot of people talked about it but were

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:20.780
not connected to anybody. In fact, I would
say more than 50% of the people were not in

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.320
any organized group. But here were see the
pattern of controversy: you have one group

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:33.560
that's well connected here which is USA Today
and NPR and other climate related groups,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.290
whereas the group below are the climate skeptics,
so they provide a different perspective. They're

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:44.510
well connected and only a few bridging edges
that take them across.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:51.350
So there's concern about polarization in the
political sphere is often raised and you can

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:58.360
see it lightly over here and more dramatically
in this case, which was in January we began

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:07.580
to do work on the political issues and so
just the keyword GOP, Grand Old Party for

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:12.870
those who don't know, or the Republic Party,
but all the Tweets that had GOP in them.

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:18.110
And then we used the clustering algorithm
and the layout to produce this dramatic and

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:25.090
very stereotypic picture of controversy. You
have one large cluster which we made red,

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.540
which are all the Republicans who are well
connected with each other and then the people

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:34.540
who were saying negative things about GOP,
and we painted them blue, they were the Democrats.

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:39.870
They're a smaller bunch in this case; not
a surprise because we searched for the term

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.440
GOP and so you do get some bridging things.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:50.000
And the largest node, here we rank by the
betweeness centrality metric is over here,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.680
Politico, which is the political blog in Washington
and it's followed both by Democrats and Republicans.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:08.750
The clustering algorithm painted with the
blue Democrats but it's as you can see a good

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:14.070
bridging organization. These others are highly
conservative, the high betweeness centrality

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:21.650
groups otherwise beyond that are conservative
groups. And we've repeated this for the Pew

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:27.820
Internet and American Society doing a study
of the State of the Union address and the

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:35.300
Tweets related to Obama pro and negative and
then the follow on Michelle Bachman and Paul

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.360
Ryan presentations that followed. So that's
about to appear, it'll be on the Pew Internet

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.360
site soon.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:49.850
So we're getting to understand how to take
this rich stream of social media data and

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:56.090
be able to filter it in a way, get an overview,
then filter and zoom in on the key things

00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:00.490
that are important, that could lead to interesting
decisions.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:06.890
Here's another sort of great example of the
clustering. On Flickr, we took all the tags

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:12.950
that had the word "mouse" in them and then
did the cluster and layout and you find a

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:19.130
yellow group over here which is the computer
mouse and the blue group which is the animal

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:25.200
mouse and the red group which is Mickey Mouse
and these are pictures that come from each

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.010
of those so clearly you can see the mouse
there.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:32.710
So this is what natural language processing
people would usually describe as word sense

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:39.730
disambiguation and here we're showing that
you can do that often just by the network

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:45.150
analysis of common occurrence of terms. So
that was sort of a nice idea.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:51.090
Here I show you my personal Flickr, it's a
little washed out on this display, but you

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:57.300
can see there's two natural groups here. On
the right hand side is my family, my two daughters,

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:03.990
Anna and Sarah. There are 28 pictures in which
I appear with Anna, 25 with daughter Sarah,

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:10.380
39 of them together. And Sarah got married
a few years ago to Mark and I have 93 pictures

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:16.990
of them together. And my sister's here with
her husband and children and then other cousins

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.240
are over here.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:26.000
On the professional side, the lab people,
Catherine Plaisant and Jenny Priest and Ben

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.350
Bederson, Allison Druin, all those appear
in one cluster. And a few other of our close

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:36.670
buddies like George Robertson and Jakob Nielsen
also got colored green. Then another bunch:

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:42.080
Austin Henderson, Wendy Kellogg, John Thomas
was another group. And then you'll see other

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:47.700
people who I often photograph at CHI Conferences,
Terry Winograd may be familiar to some of

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.910
you and a variety of other people.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:56.660
But the clustering structure and algorithms
are very powerful to tease out structure in

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.200
complex networks.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.141
This was done by a student just this semester
as part of a homework assignment, but it was

00:47:03.141 --> 00:47:10.090
so nice I wanted to include it here. He took
the 600 tech reports from the HCL Website,

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:15.460
downloaded them, scraped them all, put 'em
into a co-occurrence, a co-authorship network,

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:22.570
and you can see that within that community
of 600 papers Catherine Plaisant and I have

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.430
written a lot of papers together.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:28.420
But she has lots of other groups that she
works with separately. There's some groups

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.820
and people we've worked with together and
there are other groups that I've worked with

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.000
on my own.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.330
Similarly Allison Druin and Ben Bederson work
closely together; they're a little younger

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:44.350
so maybe fewer papers, but Bederson has his
own group and Allison has lots of people.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:49.730
One of Allison's students is right here as
well [laughs]. So I'm not sure if you, were

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:53.050
you the co-auth? You're looking. Were you
one of the co-author for one of the papers

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.110
there? But sometimes they work together.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:48:00.970
On the hand there's very few paper, or in
fact there's no paper where we are all together.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:06.980
And if you tease out by filtering a little
bit more and look for only the links where

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:13.630
there's at least five co-author papers, you
seen an even more distinct pattern here where

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:19.710
Catherine and I are linked by the work we've
done together. Here color represents the age

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:25.440
or the number of years we've been part of
the lab so Bederson and Druin are newer. Only

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:30.690
Anne Rose who works in our lab has collaborated
with with all of us, okay? So we have pretty

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:37.300
much independent bunches. I've worked with
Bederson on some things, but I've never written

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.730
a paper with Allison Druin okay or I haven't
written five anyway.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:47.740
And you can see some other patterns which
we like show even more strongly. These three

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.270
should be together as a group because they
have the same relationship and similarly over

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:58.380
here Kang, Chao, and Marchionini have the
same relationship, but these others have a

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:04.270
different one. These others would produce
a fan, we'd like to put them together in a

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:10.850
group. So we're still working on the ways
to more clearly represent the relationships

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:18.430
that are important that your eye can pick
them out in a second instead of 10 seconds.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.250
Francois Guimbretière, one of Terry Winograd
students, spent a few years at Maryland but

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:28.870
did not publish a lot with the rest of us,
he was pretty much more an independent. Okay?

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:34.240
And the one I just grabbed yesterday to show
you. We're studying the Nation of Neighbors

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:40.340
which is a community safety system; it's got
160 communities around the country; and we

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.760
were looking at the postings among, within
the different groups. So we had all of that

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:51.390
data and it was, when we looked at it just
in Fruchterman and Reingold or Harold Corn

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:56.300
layouts it was just kind of a mess so we threw
it into the group in the box thing and low

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:02.960
and behold it showed a pretty strong structure
here, and we eliminated the links across them

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:10.140
so the post and the response pattern stands
out very apparently here, the biggest ones

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.880
in the upper left and then all the small ones
in the lower right. But you quickly get a

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:24.490
very memorable understanding of the pattern
of relationships within these groups, okay?

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:29.040
So I just close by saying that's the book
and there are copies here in New York; maybe

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:35.290
some we can get to Mountain View but appreciate
that and the first three chapters are introduction

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:40.500
to the theme of social media networks and
then four, five, and six are very much how

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:47.400
to do, it walking you through the use of the
tool. And then chapters 8 through 15 apply

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:52.830
these things and some of the examples I've
shown you are from the book, but there's ways

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:58.300
to be able to study email and threaded networks
and then Twitter, Facebook, Worldwide Web,

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.840
Flickr, YouTube, and Wiki networks as well.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:07.150
And as we go down the road we find lots of
other groups that are interested for building

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:12.550
a spigot, so that's sort of the natural thing
then either they can work internally or we

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:15.490
can make it public for them.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:21.860
The group itself is supported from Microsoft
External Research, but Maryland, Stanford,

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:28.280
Cornell are involved and this. Mark Smith
and we've formed the Social Media Research

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.240
Foundation which promotes open data, open
tools, and open scholarships.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:42.060
So we'd like to hope that NodeXL will be as
widely used as other popular tools like Firefox

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:49.520
and so on that are free and open on the Net
and like the Mozilla Foundation or Linux Foundation,

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:55.020
we'd like to make these things open and accessible,
that's our goal and if you can help join us

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.100
with that that'd be great.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:01.690
I'd like to just say we wanna put all these
things all to good work to make the world

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:07.090
a better place in ways such as helping the
Millennium Development Goals that's a talk

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.090
longer.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:14.080
And it just sort of close with saying we just
had our 28th annual lab symposium; we had

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:20.560
more than 250 people attending and a much
larger format. And the next event will be

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:26.080
the summer Social Webshop. We're being about
20, 25 speakers, about 40 students, doctoral

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:31.320
students from around the country. And just
two days ago I'm pleased to report that Google

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:36.490
helps us along by sponsoring so we can bring
some more students and speakers in. And it's

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:41.340
mainly sponsored by National Science Foundation,
but I'm real pleased and you can visit our

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:47.600
website there and see who the speakers are
and I hope you'll come join and find it to

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.400
be a good event.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:55.800
So the summary of this and the take away message
is networks have been around for a long time,

00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:02.670
visualization of networks go back 75 years.
Computerization of such network visualizations

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:09.300
has 15, 20, 25 years of history, but only
now I mean we and others are developing the

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:15.540
strategies by which we can filter, do the
layouts, and be able to interpret these data

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:20.900
and apply statistical methods so that we can
extract the insights that allow you to make

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.900
important decisions.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:28.200
So we're quite excited about that. We're on
to Version 170 of NodeXL. We drop a new version

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:34.271
about every two weeks or three weeks. And
so it's of continuing satisfaction to see

00:53:34.271 --> 00:53:40.490
how that evolves and there's just a lot of
support and good people who are using it all

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:41.530
around the world.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:45.100
So we're very pleased. Thank you for the opportunity.
The books are here. I'd be glad to sign them

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.100
for those who like and I'm open for questions.
Thank you.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.100
[applause]

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.100
[pause]

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.640
In the back, yes.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:54:01.540
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:13.300
Ben Shneiderman: No, I think that was the
idea we found the ex. Oh, the question was

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:20.690
why do we choose Excel as a sort of platform?
The answer is that all of us who had done

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:26.170
network analysis with tools like UCINet or
Pajek or any number of other tools you wind

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:31.320
up doing enormous amount of cleaning up and
transforming and organizing the data so it

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.490
tends to be you're using some kind of spreadsheet
or database, then you import to the visualization

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:40.540
tool, you look at what you get, and you say,
"Oh, I need to go back and change that." You

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:46.050
go back out and you're going back and forth.
This way we integrated the process, not perfectly,

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:48.730
but we did integrate it in a platform that
makes it go.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:55.430
We'd love to do it on Google spreadsheet and
make a web-based viewer, that would be a nice

00:54:55.430 --> 00:55:02.130
project to do together. We're sorely, let's
put it this way, we're very eager to make

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:08.330
a web-based version of this and we have, although
we're very appreciative I should say of Microsoft

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:15.550
research for having supported this for several
years. They encourage us and we are eager

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:21.720
and I spoke at Mountain View in November about
this and I'm speaking here, we'd be delighted

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:27.050
to have a partnership with Google and if somebody
wanted to pick up and help make a, based on

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:37.630
the Google doc spreadsheet, a browser on the
Web, hey that's very high on the list.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:38.630
[pause]

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:48.110
Source is open. Csharp.net, but that [laughs]
that could change too [laughs]. Right? We've

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:54.540
included other platforms like Jure Leskovec
at Stanford has this SNAP toolkit which is

00:55:54.540 --> 00:56:00.900
algorithms do very large networks and so we're
happy to integrate those or work with other

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:06.180
tools. We have no devotion to any particular
platform or language, we've love to see variations

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.180
on this.

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:14.160
Our current effort, I think, will bear fruit
in a month or two will be to have a web browser

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:20.710
for people who if you're using NodeXL you
export, it goes on the website, the image

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:25.750
goes there, the dataset goes there, and your
explanation goes there. And then people can

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:31.040
then download and browse it. So that will
get us started with a web facing version.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:38.250
Right now it's on code collects website; there's
a good discussion group; I must give high,

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:44.770
high congrats, thanks to Tony Capone who's
our lead developer and he's done a remarkable

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:50.460
job and he also answers the questions quickly
and very effectively. People really are very

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.030
happy about becoming part of that user group.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:58.110
There's frustrations with it, there's all
kinds of things we could talk about that we

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:02.670
wish we had done or so on and I can recommend
other tools like Gliffy, we've very good friends

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:06.810
with them if you're looking at network drawing
tools they do a lot of nice things that we

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:11.520
don't do, we do a lot of nice things they
don't do. There's a lot of room for possibilities

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:18.960
here. We keep exploring on the research side
of what other ways we can better extract meaningful

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.160
insights from these network datasets.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.910
Thank you. Other questions here or elsewhere?

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.560
[pause]

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:38.860
Yes, okay, alright. Well Dan thank you for
sitting through the whole time, I see you

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.820

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.820
[pause]

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.820
Alright.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.850
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was excellent.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:50.850
&gt;&gt;Ben Shneiderman: [laughs] Thanks. See you
again and thank you all here. I appreciated

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:54.710
