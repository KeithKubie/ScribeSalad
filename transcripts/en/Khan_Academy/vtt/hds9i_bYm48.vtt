00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:02.475
- [David] Hello historians and welcome to

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:05.093
South Central Asia circa 280

00:00:05.093 --> 00:00:06.671
BCE.

00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:09.663
We're looking at two empires

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:12.964
that occupied some of the same area.

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:14.993
We've got the Mauryan Empire here.

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:16.549
You can see that this is the
expansion that took place

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.512
under Ashoka around

00:00:18.512 --> 00:00:19.345
250

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:20.473
BCE.

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:23.773
The Mauryan Empire encompasses
the Indus River Valley.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.503
This is today what is Pakistan.

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:28.848
Over here, we've got this
region that is known as Gandara

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:32.090
which is actually we think
what the name Kandahar

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.619
in Afghanistan comes from today.

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:37.009
What we've got here is this

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.265
intersection between two empires.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.042
We've got the Seleucid
Empire over here in orange.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.534
These are, remember the remnants,

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:45.990
this is one of three remnants

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.244
of the empire of Alexander the Great.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:52.070
His general, Seleucus, took
this part of Asia Minor,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.765
stretching into Central Asia.

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:59.298
This is the extent of that
empire around 280 BCE.

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.582
What happens in 250 BCE
is that a satrapy of

00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:06.153
the Seleucid Empire called Bactria

00:01:06.153 --> 00:01:07.258
secedes.

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:08.984
It fights a war of independence

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:11.328
to establish itself as its own kingdom.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:14.073
This is what we call the
Greco-Bactrian kingdom.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.492
This is around 250 BCE.

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:20.085
It names itself Bactria,
after the great city of Bactra

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:22.710
which gives it name to
Afghanistan's Balkh province

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.888
and up here on the northeast,

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:25.405
you can see the city of Fergana

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:27.898
which is today in Uzbekistan.

00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:31.518
If you remember from the
article about the Silk Road,

00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:33.947
this is the very same Fergana

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:35.840
where the Han Chinese first encountered

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.257
those heavenly horses that sweated blood.

00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:44.248
What I wanna talk about
is the culture of this

00:01:44.248 --> 00:01:46.939
purple region of Greco-Bactria

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.988
because for many hundreds of years,

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:52.062
this region had been passed
back and forth between

00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:53.849
Indian powers

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.383
and Macedonian powers.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.113
It has Hellenic influences

00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:00.367
and it also has Indian influences.

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:02.277
That means we're gonna be
talking about something called

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:03.433
cultural syncretism.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:06.454
Let me put that down right
here in the middle of China.

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:07.837
Cultural

00:02:07.837 --> 00:02:08.754
syncretism.

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:12.379
What syncretism is is a

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.067
mixing of cultural objects.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.660
That's really it.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.928
It's the mixture of cultures
and ideas and faiths.

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:22.812
Follow me over here

00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:24.477
because I am interested in talking about

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:27.035
the influence that Greek culture had

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:29.798
on Buddhism and vice versa.

00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:30.881
These are two

00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:35.184
representations of the Buddha
from around the same time,

00:02:35.184 --> 00:02:37.139
and in fact, from around the same region,

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.276
the region of Gandara
near modern-day Kandahar.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:43.124
So, within the kingdom
of Bactria that we saw.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:45.573
Sandwiched between Hellenic influences

00:02:45.573 --> 00:02:47.937
and Indian influences.

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:51.985
Both of these works are
from the 1st Century CE.

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:53.199
But let's talk about this footprint

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.407
because this was a pretty
common way to depict the Buddha

00:02:56.407 --> 00:02:58.676
prior to the 1st Century CE.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:02.442
We see, this is what's called
an aniconic representation.

00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:04.621
This represent a footprint of the Buddha.

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.621
You can see here some of

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:10.997
the themes of Hinduism and Buddhism,

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:14.364
so we've got this dharmachakra wheel

00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:16.203
in the center of the sole.

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:17.340
We've got

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.330
triratnas

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.163
here

00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:20.486
near the heel.

00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:22.187
We've got, as you can
see them very faintly,

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:23.520
little swastikas

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.527
near the metatarsals yonder.

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:30.831
And these are all
Buddhist or Hindu symbols

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:34.315
that approach depicting the
Buddha but do not actually

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.059
put the Buddha into any kind of

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.561
human physical representation.

00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.066
It's more about what the
Buddha has left behind

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.782
so that human beings can
follow in his footsteps.

00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:47.500
But around the same time in
the same region we see this.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.567
This is a statue.

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:51.798
This is the standing Gandara Buddha.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.052
This again dates from the 1st Century CE

00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:56.280
from the same region

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.793
of Bactria.

00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:00.540
But you can see this is the Buddha wearing

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.425
Greek clothing.

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:05.091
This is a Greek chiton
and that's a himation.

00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:07.622
These are forms of Greek dress

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:11.480
and the Buddha is being
depicted in a Greek style.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.809
This is very similar
to the other sculpture

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.500
that we're seeing coming out of

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.646
Hellenistic cultures at the same time.

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:20.151
And so what we see when we
see this Gandara Buddha,

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:21.241
the standing Buddha,

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.251
we have the combination of Buddhist faith

00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:26.550
or Buddhist philosophy combining

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.133
with Greek cultural aesthetics.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.803
Indeed, Buddhism was
practiced in this region

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:36.212
for many hundreds of years.

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:39.705
Since if you recall,
let's go back to the map,

00:04:39.705 --> 00:04:42.081
because you're recall
that Fergana and Bactria

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.724
and all of these cities
throughout Central Asia,

00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:45.796
Kandahar is back down here,

00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:47.463
are on the Silk Road

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:49.975
that connect

00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:54.142
the world of what's called
as the west shore to China.

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:57.320
Through Fergana and through Bactria,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.965
you could get to the
great centers of India.

00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:03.011
You can get to Pataliputra and Suvarnagiri

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.364
and have access to the sea routes

00:05:06.364 --> 00:05:07.871
of trade.

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.087
Many historians believed that it is

00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:13.724
through the cities of the
Greco-Bactrian kingdom that

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:17.411
Buddhism made its way along
the Silk Road to the various

00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.411
oasis cities

00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:21.070
of Central Asia,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.144
and from then on,

00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:24.503
into China.

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:25.550
We see syncretism

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.707
whenever cultures
combine with one another.

00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:31.179
And it is said that
when Alexander the Great

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:33.540
came to the head waters
of the Indus River Valley,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.200
remember this is in upper Pakistan,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.449
he brought many philosophers with him

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.404
to meet with the great thinkers

00:05:40.404 --> 00:05:43.627
of the Hindu ascetic tradition.

00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:47.036
These, the Greeks called
the Gymnosophists,

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:50.196
which means the naked
thinkers because these men

00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:53.742
were so devoted to the
practice of philosophy

00:05:53.742 --> 00:05:55.942
that they fasted and they wore

00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:57.819
either no or very little clothing

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.109
because they felt that it got in the way

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:03.228
of their pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.

00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:06.106
And if you make a study
of Greek philosophy,

00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:09.027
you will see the impact
that these Indian thinkers

00:06:09.027 --> 00:06:13.596
had on Greek philosophy
during this period as well.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:16.057
Let's talk about some other
examples of syncretism.

00:06:16.057 --> 00:06:19.864
This right here is the Nestorian Stele

00:06:19.864 --> 00:06:23.648
or rather this is a rubbing
of the Nestorian Stele.

00:06:23.648 --> 00:06:25.400
This is a giant limestone block

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.795
that was erected in 781 in Chang'an,

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:32.526
the imperial capital of
the Tang Empire in China.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:35.596
Celebrating 150 years of
Nestorian Christianity.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:36.429
If you look very closely,

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.562
you can see this little cross up here.

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:39.806
There you go.

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:43.452
There's your Nestorian
cross, see right there.

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:46.338
You can see all these Chinese text that

00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:49.144
symbolizes the important connection

00:06:49.144 --> 00:06:53.058
of the Church of the East to Tang China.

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:55.495
What's interesting about
this stone monument

00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:59.662
is the way in which Christianity
is described within it.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.362
In order to proselytize
to a Chinese population,

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:06.813
Nestorian Christianity

00:07:06.813 --> 00:07:08.968
adapted its approach

00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:10.268
to suit

00:07:10.268 --> 00:07:13.851
the mores of the people that lived there.

00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:14.934
In this text,

00:07:16.687 --> 00:07:18.520
Christ is described in

00:07:19.435 --> 00:07:21.433
Daoist and Buddhist terms.

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.647
Let me read you a little
bit of the translation.

00:07:23.647 --> 00:07:26.542
"A virgin gave birth to
the holy one in Syria.

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:28.535
"A bright star announced
the felicitous event

00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:30.021
"and Persians observing the splendor

00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:31.420
"came to present tribute.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.920
"The ancient dispensation is declared

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.269
"by the 24 holy men was then fulfilled.

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:37.167
"And he laid down great principles

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:38.620
"for the government and
families and kingdoms."

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.490
They're talking about the messiah here.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.818
"He established the new religion of the

00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:45.846
"silent operation of the
pure spirit of the Triune.

00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:48.493
"He rendered virtue
subservient to direct faith.

00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.527
"He fixed the extent of
the eight boundaries."

00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:51.812
Now, we're getting into some concepts

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:53.386
from Mahayana Buddhism.

00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:57.058
"Thus completing the truth
and freeing it from dross.

00:07:57.058 --> 00:07:59.425
"He opened the gate of the
three constant principles."

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.616
Again, these are Buddhist concepts.

00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:05.185
The impermanence, suffering, and non-self.

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.228
"Introducing life and destroying death.

00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:08.890
"He suspended the bright sun to invade

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.926
"the chambers of darkness,

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:12.329
"and the falsehood of the
devil were thereupon defeated.

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:14.437
"He set in motion the vessel of mercy

00:08:14.437 --> 00:08:17.102
"by which to ascend to
the bright mansions.

00:08:17.102 --> 00:08:19.130
"Whereupon rational
beings were then released,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.133
"having thus completed the
manifestation of his power,

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:24.180
"in clear day he ascended
to his true station."

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.400
You can see the way that

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.183
Buddhist thought

00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:29.266
is being used

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:33.609
to contextualize Christianity,

00:08:33.609 --> 00:08:36.543
and really, that's what
syncretism is all about.

00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:39.455
It's about taking a new idea,

00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:40.713
this thing,

00:08:40.713 --> 00:08:43.198
and putting it in line with this stuff,

00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:46.387
the eight boundaries,
the constant principles,

00:08:46.387 --> 00:08:49.197
freeing the truth from dross.

00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:51.982
What these Nestorian missionaries
were attempting to do

00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:56.031
was take these Christian
principles and recast them

00:08:56.031 --> 00:08:56.864
in a

00:08:56.864 --> 00:08:59.333
Buddhist or Daoist light.

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:02.866
Taking something and recasting
it to fit the context

00:09:02.866 --> 00:09:04.291
of a new situation.

00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.471
You can learn anything.

00:09:05.471 --> 00:09:06.304
David out.
