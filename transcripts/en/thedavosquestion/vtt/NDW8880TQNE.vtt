&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
My name is Jennifer Schenker.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.990
I'm the technology journalist for Business
Week in Europe.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.360
Uh, I've never been on YouTube before.
This is a first.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.870
Uh, I'm here in Davos covering technology
people.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:20.619
The companies but also all, uh, of the creative
non companies that

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.540
form the technology pioneers this year.
I'm convinced that technology can help mac

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.150
the world a better place,
umm, particularly by linking with, umm, social

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.280
projects.
So if you have a -- if you're a social entrepreneur

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.700
and you've got a
project you think, uh, could really benefit

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.120
the use of technology to
scale up, write me and, uh, I'll try to find

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.350
the right person here for
you to connect with and try to do my part

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.650
to help make the world a
better place in 2008.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.089
Thanks.
