00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:02.494
- [Instructor] The population of a town

00:00:02.494 --> 00:00:04.537
grows at a rate of

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.766
r of t is equal to 300

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.349
times e to the 0.3t

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:11.851
people per year,

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.934
where time, where t is time in years.

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:18.376
At time t is equal to two

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:21.441
the town's population is 1,200 people.

00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.608
What is the town's population
at t is equal to seven?

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:29.823
Which expression can we
use to solve the problem?

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:31.936
So they don't want us to
actually answer the question.

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:33.724
They just want us to set up the expression

00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:36.998
using some symbols from calculus.

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:38.299
So why don't you pause this video

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.224
and try to think about it.

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.314
So let's just remind us
what they've given us.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.658
They've given us the rate
function right over here.

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:48.825
And so if you want to find

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:51.697
a change in population

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:52.780
from one time

00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:56.085
to another time,

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:58.338
what you could do is you
could take the integral

00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:00.636
of the rate function

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:02.285
from the starting time,

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:03.957
t is equal to two years,

00:01:03.957 --> 00:01:05.838
to t is equal to seven years.

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:08.810
So we're gonna take the
integral of the rate function,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.435
and what this is going to tell us,

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:13.361
this is going to tell us
the change in population

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:16.194
from time two to time seven.

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:17.610
So this is,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.910
we could say let me just write this,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.302
this is the change.

00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:22.881
I'll use delta for change
or I'll just let me

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:24.297
just write it out,

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:27.880
change in population,
change in population,

00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:29.858
population.

00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:33.307
But they don't want us to, we don't,

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:34.746
they don't, they're not asking us

00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:35.768
for the change in population.

00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:37.997
They want us to know what
is the town's population

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.483
if t is equal to seven.

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:41.109
So what you would want is,

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.568
you would want what your
population is at t equals two

00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:47.169
plus the change in
population from two to seven

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:49.746
to get you your population at seven.

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:52.951
So they tell us the population
at time t equals two,

00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:55.041
the town's population is 1,200 people.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:58.268
So if you want the population
at t is equal to seven,

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:00.172
it's going to be

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:04.468
1,200 plus how whatever the
change in population is.

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:06.163
You take the integral
of the rate function,

00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:08.137
you are, and this is
the rate of population,

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:11.132
this integral is gonna give
you the change in population

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:13.663
from time t equals two to t equals seven.

00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:17.425
So we can see clearly that
is choice D right over here.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:20.188
These other choices, we could
look at 'em really quick.

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:22.812
Choice b is just the change in population.

00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:26.295
Assuming that this, and
this is actually increasing,

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.872
so this would tell us how much
did the population increase

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:32.959
from t two, from t equals
two to t equals seven.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.515
So that's not what we want.

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:36.976
We want what the actual population is.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:39.275
This is how much the population increases

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.479
from time zero to time seven.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.942
Now you might say well wouldn't that be

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:45.196
the town's population?

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:46.705
Well that would be the town's population

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:48.493
if they had no people at time zero,

00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:49.770
but you can't assume that.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.928
Maybe the town got settled by
10 people or by 1,000 people

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:54.623
or who knows whatever else.

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:55.970
So right over there.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.058
And this is taking the
derivative of the rate function,

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:01.868
which is, it's actually a little hard

00:03:01.868 --> 00:03:03.122
to think about what is this.

00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:05.490
This is the rate of change of the rate

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.462
at time seven minus the
rate of change of the rate

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:09.832
at time two.

00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:11.713
So I would rule that one out as well.

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:14.337
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:15.670
So here we have,

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:20.676
the depth of water in a tank

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:23.184
is changing at a rate of r of t

00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:26.574
is equal to 0.3t centimeters per minute,

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:29.430
where t is the time in minutes.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.287
At time t equals zero,

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:34.538
the depth of the water is 35 centimeters.

00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:37.371
What is the change in the water's depth

00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:39.454
during the fourth minute?

00:03:40.297 --> 00:03:42.851
So let's pause the video
again and see if you can

00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.244
figure this out again,

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:46.171
or figure out what expression can we use

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:47.147
to solve the problem,

00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:49.654
the problem being what is the change

00:03:49.654 --> 00:03:51.744
in the water's depth

00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:53.827
during the fourth minute.

00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.617
Alright so we've just talked
about if you're trying to find

00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.450
the change in a value,

00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:04.120
you could take the integral
of the rate function

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.001
over the appropriate time.

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.778
So we're talking about
during the fourth minute,

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:10.589
so we definitely wanna take the integral

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.540
of the rate function.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.096
We just have to think about the bounds.

00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:15.791
And all the choices here
are taking the integral

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:16.975
of the rate function.

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:18.368
So really the interesting part is,

00:04:18.368 --> 00:04:20.992
during the fourth minute.

00:04:20.992 --> 00:04:22.826
So let me just draw a
little number line here,

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:25.845
and we can think about what
the fourth minute looks like.

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:27.679
Or actually let me just
draw the whole thing.

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:31.627
So let's say this is r
of t right over there,

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:33.717
I could say y is equal to r of t,

00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:35.634
and this is, this is t.

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.009
And let's see, the first
minute goes from zero to one,

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.169
second minute goes from one to two,

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.351
third minute goes from two to three,

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.813
fourth minute goes from three to four.

00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:49.204
The rate function, this
actually just looks like

00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:53.105
a straight up linear rate
function, something like this.

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:55.520
And so what is the fourth minute?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.935
Well the fourth minute is
the first minute is this one,

00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.839
second, third, fourth.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:04.599
The fourth minute is going from
minute three to minute four.

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.291
So it's what we wanna do is
the expression that gives us

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:11.495
this area right over here
under the rate curve.

00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:14.259
Well this is our lower
bound's going to be three,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.673
and our upper bound is going to be four.

00:05:16.673 --> 00:05:18.160
And so there you have it,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.064
it is this first choice.

00:05:20.064 --> 00:05:21.526
You might have been
tempted here if you got

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:22.525
a little bit confused,

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:24.359
hey maybe the fourth minute
is after we've crossed

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:26.287
the t is equal to four,

00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:28.260
but no that would be the fifth minute.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.909
This would tell us,

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.740
this would tell us our change
over the first four minutes,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.575
not just during the fourth minute.

00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:38.593
And then this, well this
is just gonna be zero.

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:40.172
If you're taking, this is,

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.332
what is the change in the
value from three to three.

00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:44.282
Well it didn't change at all,

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:47.393
because it's essentially at an instant,

00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:49.483
there's no time that
passes from three to three.

00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:51.801
So you can rule all of these out.
