00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.400
Snowflakes are one
of mother nature's

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.767
most exquisite creations--

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:08.000
fragile snow crystals
that dazzle us in an array

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.633
of shapes and sizes.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.100
But there's a lot more to
these intricate ice formations

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.567
than meets the eye.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.700
Turns out that by
looking a lot closer,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.066
snowflakes may also
help us save lives.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:25.100
Here's correspondent Francesca
Fiorentini's fascinating look

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.066
at the secrets of snowflakes.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:35.600
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: Beautiful
and delicate, but also deadly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.433
MAN: It came out of nowhere.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:45.100
When you're caught in an
avalanche, it's terrifying.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.467
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
Most avalanche deaths

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:49.233
are caused by suffocating
under deep drifts

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.967
or from the blunt
force trauma inflicted

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.533
by the onrush of snow.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.567
In fact, these giant
masses of snowflakes

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:06.200
can reach speeds of 80 miles per
hour within about five seconds.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.700
MAN: Imagine being
in a car crash,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.734
and you're trying to just
hopefully save yourself.

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:13.133
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: And
time runs against you.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.000
After an hour has
passed, only one

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.266
in three of those hit by an
avalanche are found alive.

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.500
The threat is so
real that 150 people

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.867
get killed by these juggernauts
around the world every year.

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:29.000
In just a two-week span
in February, 2018, seven

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.467
people died from avalanches in
one area of Washington state.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:40.400
Three of them lost their
lives on mountain passes

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.300
just like this one.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.633
REPORTER: Three people
have been killed

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:46.133
in two separate avalanches
over the weekend.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.800
Rescuers found an adult
near Stampede Pass

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.467
in Kittitas County yesterday.

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.500
These deadly incidents
illustrate the extreme risk--

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
not just in the back
country, but even

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.400
on the heavily used trails.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.500
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
That's why I

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.567
came here to the shadow of Mt.

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:05.400
Rainier to meet the daredevils
that stop these deadly beasts

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
before they strike.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.266
So what's strange is that
you all work for the Department

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.734
of Transportation.

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:14.834
When I think of the DOT, I
don't think of avalanches.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.934
I think of a bus depot, or--

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:17.934
Right.
Right.

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:19.500
Yeah.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.767
Because we have snowy mountain
passes and avalanche hazard,

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:25.800
we also have avalanche
specialists who are

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500
highway avalanche forecasters.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.400
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
State Route 140 takes us

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.266
up the mountain on the Chinook
Byway, a 92-mile hotspot

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.600
for avalanches.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.166
And this road turns out
to be one of the worst

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:39.166
places an avalanche can hit.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.367
With 30,000 vehicles
a day, and midweek,

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.000
we have 7,000 to 10,000 semis--

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.500
so there's a tremendous
amount of people

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.667
moving across the highways,
but also a lot of goods.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.667
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: We
finally make it to Chinook's

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.300
actual mountain pass.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.667
The snowiest mountain
pass that WSDOT operates.

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:02.867
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: It's
here where we find clues

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:06.300
to the formation of avalanches.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.500
We have today's snowfall.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.000
And then we can look
at this upper layer.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.667
That can pull off pretty easily.

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:15.867
It's sitting on this
nice, thin little crust.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:17.433
It's very fragile.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.033
Underneath that is
this really loose,

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.600
unconsolidated, wet snow.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.934
Yes.

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.166
As we move down, it gets a
little more firm, and again,

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:26.667
wetted snow underneath there.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.000
We can start to see
some additional layers.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.667
So the fact that there are
different consistencies of snow

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.200
layers actually make the
conditions for an avalanche

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.133
more likely.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.834
More likely, exactly.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.300
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: It's not
long before John's team finds

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.400
a classic avalanche trigger--

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.200
a cornice, a mass of
hardened snow hanging

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.600
precariously above the road.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.266
And you see the big
overhanging piece of snow?

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:53.900
That's the cornice
that we're looking at.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.934
Your concern is that it's
going to fall on its own.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.400
If it falls on its own, yeah.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
We hope to remove the cornice
and make that area safe.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.867
Meaning explode it away?

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.400
Exactly.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.934
So the crew started setting
up explosives in that area.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:08.100
Would you hold that, Andy?

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.934
Sure.

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:10.233
Thank you, sir.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:11.100
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
The demolition team

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.433
has a tough task.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.433
They need to blow up the
cornice without rattling

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:19.767
the surrounding area and setting
off an uncontrolled slide.

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:20.633
This is going to be loud.

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:23.967
All right.

00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:25.166
You ready for this?

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.100
I think so.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.734
OK.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.934
All right, guys.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.700
3, 2, 1, fire.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.100
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.300
Yeah.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.100
You can see the slide
coming down now.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.400
There it goes.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.033
Whoa!

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:47.934
That was crazy.

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.300
That went really fast.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.367
Yeah, that looked good.

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:52.000
OK.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.600
Copy that.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.400
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: Their work
is crucial for people's safety

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.967
and for the economy.

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:58.500
But what if there
was a better way

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.633
to prevent avalanches than
hunting them down one by one?

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.500
Well, in order to
understand avalanches,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.700
you first have to
understand snowflakes.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.867
I'm here at Montana State
University's Subzero Lab, where

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:18.533
researchers are at the
forefront of discovering

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.633
the science behind snowflakes.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:24.133
This 27,000-square-foot
facility is

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:28.467
one of the leading cold science
research centers in the world.

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:29.100
Yeah, OK.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.266
Now I get it.

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.600
I know why it's a subzero lab.
OK.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.967
How cold is it in
here right now?

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:34.734
Around minus 10 Celsius.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:35.800
All the time?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.367
All the time.

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:41.667
Over here in the center, can
actually see the crystals grow.

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.467
That is so cool.

00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:46.400
So if you put
your glove behind--

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.533
May I take a snowflake?

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:48.567
Sure.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:49.200
Wow.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.800
It's beautiful.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.533
That's totally doable.

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:56.834
Lab Director Dr. Ed Adams
says there's a lot more

00:05:56.834 --> 00:06:00.200
to snowflakes than we think.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.934
Snow is-- it's kind
of like a shape shifter.

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.867
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: Snowflakes
aren't frozen raindrops.

00:06:04.867 --> 00:06:08.400
They form when water vapor in
clouds skips the liquid phase

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.734
and crystallizes
straight into a solid.

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:14.300
There are at least 35
types of snowflakes.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.433
Some are shaped
like needles, others

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:18.734
are dotted with ice
granules, and some

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:20.300
are irregular crystals.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.700
Even though all of them
fall at the same time,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.500
when it comes to
forming avalanches,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.400
the prettiest one of them all
can be the fastest to act out--

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.033
the stellar dendrites.

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:31.266
The little stellar
dendrites, those

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.800
little star-shaped crystals--

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.166
Those are the beautiful,
holiday card, star snowflakes.

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:37.033
Excactly.

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:38.233
Exactly.

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:39.367
After they hit the
ground, then they

00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:40.900
go through this metamorphism.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.400
They tend to change form.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.066
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
Most snowflakes generally

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:46.233
have six arms formed
by the accumulation

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:47.433
of water molecules--

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:50.500
two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.000
But the stellar dendrites'
arms are particularly unstable.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.667
They morph faster than other
snowflakes, which can create

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.900
a continuous hard layer
of snow that can stretch

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.266
across entire mountainsides.

00:07:02.266 --> 00:07:04.800
But sometimes, the
snowflakes stay separate,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.567
creating a weak, pillowy layer.

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:10.367
If another hard layer is
forged on top of this snowpack,

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:12.467
the millions of
snowflakes beneath them

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:15.967
have set the stage for one
of the most deadly forces

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:16.967
on Earth.

00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:18.066
You've got a strong layer.

00:07:18.066 --> 00:07:19.367
You've got a little weak layer.

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.734
Then we have a strong
layer on top of it.

00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:25.333
That's your recipe
for the avalanche.

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.834
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: By
studying the mechanics

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:30.400
of a snowpack and analyzing
the snowflakes inside it,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.400
Dr. Adams' team is trying to
improve avalanche prediction

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.233
in order to save human lives.

00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:40.333
Ultimately, what could
your research lead to?

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:44.266
Could you imagine something
like a Google Maps of avalanches

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:46.166
in the next 15, 20 years?

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.133
Yeah, certainly.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.100
We can get closer to that.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.340
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
One day you might

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.260
be able to browse an
app that tells you

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.360
where the snowflakes
to avoid lie.

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:55.900
But until then,
avalanche hunters

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.333
are going to keep trudging
into the back country

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:01.533
to try and understand and
prevent the next disaster.

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:04.066
So the next time you see snow
falling from the sky, just

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.266
remember that these
tiny crystals are

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:10.133
beautiful, but also dangerous.
