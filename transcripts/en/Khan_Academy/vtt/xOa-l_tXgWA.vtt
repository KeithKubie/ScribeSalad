00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:03.001
Voiceover:So this kind of
hairy looking expression,

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.882
we're just dividing one complex number,

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:08.005
written in blue, by
another complex number.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:09.327
This first complex - actually,

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:11.020
both of them are written in polar form,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.694
and we also see them plotted over here.

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.808
This first complex number, seven times,

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:16.294
cosine of seven pi over six,

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:19.101
plus i times sine of seven pi over six,

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:20.503
we see that the angle,

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:22.906
if we're thinking in polar
form is seven pi over six,

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:25.991
so if we start from
the positive real axis,

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:30.176
we're gonna go seven pi over six.

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:31.958
So we're gonna go seven pi over six,

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.136
all the way to that
point right over there.

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:35.585
And then from the origin,

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.339
we're going to step seven out,

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:38.715
or seven away from the origin.

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:43.510
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.407
to get to that point right over there.

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:49.173
And then the second number,

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.736
the angle is seven pi over four.

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:57.036
So that takes us all the way around here.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.329
It takes us all the way -
so I should do it smaller

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.559
since that has a smaller distance,

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.968
so let me - so let's
say we start over here,

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.623
so we're going to go all the way over here

00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:12.152
to that point right over here,

00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:14.736
and it's distance from the origin is one.

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:17.760
You can imagine that there's
a one in front of that.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.424
And we want to divide the two,

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:20.981
and I encourage you to
pause this video and

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.421
try to do this on your own,

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:25.625
and then plot the resulting
number when you divide

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:29.619
this blue complex number
by this green one.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.185
Well, as you might have realized,

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:33.128
if you somehow just try
to divide it straight up,

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:36.403
it can get quite hairy,
and the way to tackle it,

00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:38.654
is to write it in another form.

00:01:38.654 --> 00:01:40.751
And what might have jumped out at you is

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.694
that exponential form would
be much, much simpler.

00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:46.319
And the way that we convert
this to exponential form

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.992
is to recognize that this
business right over here

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:53.185
is the same thing, this comes straight out

00:01:53.185 --> 00:02:01.933
of Euler's formula, this is
e, to the seven pi over six i.

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:05.243
Seven pi over six i.

00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:07.276
That's this expression right over here.

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:10.272
So this entire top complex
number can be rewritten

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:17.796
as seven e, to the seven pi over six i.

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:21.682
And this bottom complex
number can be rewritten

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:27.244
as one times, we didn't
really have to write the one,

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:29.043
but this bottom part
right over here is going

00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:33.326
to be the same thing as e,
to the seven pi over four i.

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:36.960
Seven pi over four i,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.046
and this comes straight
out of Euler's formula.

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:41.854
And when you write it in
this way, then we can just

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:44.995
use exponent properties to simplify it.

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:48.270
We have the same base, and
so we can just subtract

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.006
this exponent from that
exponent right over there.

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.101
So this is going to be equal to seven

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:55.676
divided by one, is just seven.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:03:01.417
So it's going to be seven
to the, or seven times e.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.371
Let me do this in a brighter color.

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:11.576
Seven times e, to the seven pi over six i,

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:16.158
minus seven pi over four i.

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:21.577
Minus seven pi over four ith power.

00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.776
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:25.508
Well if I have seven pi
over six of something

00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:27.722
and I subtract seven pi
over four of that thing,

00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:29.585
how many do I have left over?

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.807
Well, let's see, I'm essentially -

00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:34.912
let's just rewrite all of this.

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:35.843
This is really just about

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:37.907
subtracting fractions at this point.

00:03:37.907 --> 00:03:39.412
So if I were to rewrite this, let's see,

00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:41.874
if I were to rewrite it
with a denominator of 12,

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:43.415
then I'll have a common denominator.

00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:45.843
It's my least common
multiple of six and four.

00:03:45.843 --> 00:03:50.748
So this one I can rewrite
as 14 pi i over 12.

00:03:50.748 --> 00:04:00.323
Or I can write it as 14 pi
i over 12, and then minus -

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.654
so I multiplied the
numerator and denominator

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:13.795
by three, minus 21 pi i over 12, as well.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:14.927
Right? I just multiplied numerators

00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:17.258
and denominators by three right over here.

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.317
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:04:19.317 --> 00:04:22.234
I'm going to have, 12 in the denominator,

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:25.923
14 pi i, minus 21 pi i,

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:33.013
is going to be negative seven pi i.

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:38.879
So, this thing is equal to seven e,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:46.872
to the negative seven pi i, over 12.

00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:51.486
Now let's see if we can do a
decent job of plotting this.

00:04:51.486 --> 00:04:53.051
So let's see, each of these increments

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:55.354
that they've done, in
each of these quadrants,

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:59.098
we have one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:03.032
So they split this quadrant
into six equal angles,

00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:06.156
and this quadrant is pi over two,

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:09.603
so each of these are pi over 12.

00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:13.972
Each of these little
subangles are pi over 12.

00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:17.715
So we're going to have
negative seven pi over 12.

00:05:17.715 --> 00:05:19.370
So we're going to go in
the negative direction.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.810
We're going to go
counter-clockwise, or sorry,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.025
we're going to go clockwise.

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:24.896
So we're going to go, let me start here,

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:32.887
so if I go one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:41.885
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,
gets us right over there.

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:45.169
Did I do that right? That
doesn't - let me make sure

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.247
I got that - negative seven,

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:52.106
so each of these are pi
over - let me make sure.

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:55.706
So this whole thing is
pi, so we have one -

00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:58.611
let me make sure, this whole thing is pi.

00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.257
We have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:03.482
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:04.858
So each of these are a twelfth of that,

00:06:04.858 --> 00:06:06.361
so it's pi over 12, that's right.

00:06:06.361 --> 00:06:08.322
Then we want to go negative seven of them.

00:06:08.322 --> 00:06:10.743
Negative one, negative
two, negative three,

00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:12.444
negative four, negative
five, negative six,

00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.890
negative seven, oh ya, I just kept going

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.976
all the way to negative 12 the last time.

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:22.961
So this is the angle, this
is our angle right over here.

00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:26.049
And our distance that we
go out from the origin

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:31.100
is seven, so we go out
one, two, three, four,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.629
five, six, seven, so we
come out right over there.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.374
So this complex number divided by that

00:06:39.374 --> 00:06:42.749
complex number is equal
to this complex number,

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.790
seven times e, to the
negative seven pi i over 12.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.419
And if we wanted to now write this

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.531
in polar form, we of course could.

00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:51.971
We could say that this is the same thing

00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:58.757
as seven, times cosine of
negative seven pi over 12,

00:06:58.757 --> 00:07:08.263
plus i sine of negative seven pi over 12.
