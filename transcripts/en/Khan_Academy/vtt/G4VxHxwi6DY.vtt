00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:02.331
- So this hexagon right over here,

00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:05.088
the whole thing is filled
in with this pink color.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.997
So we'll say that this
represents one whole.

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.077
The whole thing is filled in.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.498
Now, what I want you to think about is,

00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:17.498
which of these other
hexagons have 2/3 filled in?

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.974
So, our goal is to identify the hexagons

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:24.197
that are 2/3 filled in.

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:26.865
So, pause the video now.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:30.076
So, I assume you have given
a go at it, you have tried

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:31.847
to determine which of
these are 2/3 filled in.

00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:33.946
Now let's work on this together.

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:36.332
So, when you're thinking in
terms of thirds, and here we're

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:40.474
thinking in terms of 2/3,
literally two thirds,

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:41.831
what we think about is dividing

00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:43.569
things into three equal sections.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.513
Let me see if I can draw
a hexagon fairly well.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:51.197
So, let me draw the hexagon.

00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:52.498
And I'm going to try to split it up

00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:55.635
into three equal sections.

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.714
Whoops, I'm going to try to split it up

00:00:57.714 --> 00:00:59.803
into three equal sections.

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:02.714
So, this is the center of
the hexagon right over here.

00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:06.907
And so, maybe that's one
of the equal sections.

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:09.069
And then if I do one
more line, I split it up

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.770
into three equal
sections, one, two, three.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.436
It's actually kind of
neat the way it's drawn.

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:15.672
It looks like a three dimensional cube.

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:17.053
But that was not my intent.

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:19.537
My intent was to draw a hexagon.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:23.568
So each of these is a third,
actually I could write this.

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:27.719
That's one third, that's one
third, and this is one third.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.938
But what we care about is two thirds,

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:31.970
so two of these one thirds.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.354
And so, let me clean this up a little bit.

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:40.354
So, I would fill in one of the one thirds

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.926
and then two of the one thirds.

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:46.236
And this right over here,
this hexagon that I've just

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.543
drawn, now has 2/3 of it filled in.

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:50.609
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.543
"All right, Sal, that would
have been pretty straightforward

00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:54.379
"if these were divided into thirds."

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:55.992
"But these are not divided into thirds.

00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:57.996
"Each of these are divided into one, two

00:01:57.996 --> 00:02:00.375
"three, four, five, six equal pieces.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.009
"This is divided into sixths.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.426
"How do we figure out how many of the

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:06.176
"sixths should be filled in, in order

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:08.991
"to have the same thing as 2/3?"

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.975
Well, I would tell you,
"You, don't worry too much."

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.724
All we have to do, is we can redraw this

00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:18.860
or we can do a little bit
of work here to split this

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.459
into, instead of three equal sections,

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.625
we can split it into six equal sections.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.025
Well, how would we do that?

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.259
We take each of those three equal sections

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.642
and then split them
into two equal sections.

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:30.037
So, this one right over here, I can split

00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:32.074
this into two equal sections.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:33.425
This one right over here, I can

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:35.370
split into two equal sections.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.474
This one right over here, I can

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.074
split into two equal sections.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.809
So, I had three equal sections before,

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.710
now each of them have been split into two,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.809
so now I have six equal sections.

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.309
So now, they way I've drawn
it, I'm dealing with sixths.

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:49.659
And how many sixths represent the

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.275
same fraction as the 2/3 did?

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.759
I still have my shaded area.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.759
I have one, two, three, four sixths.

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:05.404
So, 4/6 is the same thing as 2/3.

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:07.676
Or, another way to think
about it, any of these

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:09.891
that have four out of
the six equal sections

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:12.416
filled in, that means that 2/3

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:14.242
of the sections are filled in.

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:19.242
Or I could say 2/3 of
the hexagon is filled in.

00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:21.241
So, let's just look at these.

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:24.409
This one, we have one, well
let me do it in a color

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.625
that has a little more contrast.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:28.759
So we have one, two, three, four

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.510
out of the six is filled in.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.344
4/6 are filled in, that's
the same thing as 2/3.

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:36.642
So, this one represents 2/3.

00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:39.209
This one only has two
of the sixths filled in,

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.209
so it's not 4/6, which has
to be 2/3, this is 2/6.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:46.126
We want 2/3.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:50.376
This one is one, two, three, four.

00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:52.260
Four of the sixths are filled in.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.176
So this is 2/3.

00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:57.292
So I will put a square around that one.

00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:00.558
And this one has one, two, three, four

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:03.074
of the sixths filled in, so this is 4/6,

00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:04.876
which we've already figured out

00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:09.542
is the same thing as 2/3.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.054
And we're done.
