00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:01.790
MALE SPEAKER: Well, everybody,
welcome.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.170
Thanks for coming to today's
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.740
We are absolutely delighted to
have Dr. Peter Henry, the dean

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.380
of the Stern Business School,
here with us today.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.500
He's here, first of all, to
talk about his new book,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.440
"Turnaround--

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.149
Third World Lessons for First
World Growth," which talks

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.360
about in pretty interesting
detail what the First World

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.980
can actually learn from what
the Third World has been

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.730
living through for the last
number of decades.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.470
And he has some pretty
interesting takes on it that

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980
he'll share with all of us.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.246
Before he does, though, I'd
like to embarrass him a

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:32.450
little, and give a little
about his background.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.500
I had a choice of sort of a
one-line bio which said, he's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.720
the dean of the Stern Business
School, or the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.600
more extensive one.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.340
And I'll go a little
bit longer.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.900
He's not only the dean of New
York University's Stern School

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.290
of Business, but in 2008, he
also led President Obama's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.060
presidential transition team in
its review of international

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.040
lending agencies, such as the
IMF and the World Bank.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.410
He's a member of a number of
prominent boards, including

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.350
the National Bureau of Economic
Research, the Council

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.400
on Foreign Relations, and
the Kraft Foods Group.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.660
He received his Ph.D. In
economics initially from MIT,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.510
and that was preceded by a
bachelor's degree from Oxford

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.100
University, where he was
also Rhodes Scholar.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.130
And his studies at the
University of North Carolina

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.910
where he was a Morehead Scholar
and a finalist in the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.760
1991 campus-wide slam dunk
competition, which I think is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.260
probably the most retweeted part
of his "New York Times"

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.790
interview that he did
a few years ago.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.600
He was born in Jamaica
but lives in New

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.210
York with his family.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.880
And we are absolutely delighted
to have him here.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.230
So, Peter, we'd love
to hear from you.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.480
Thank you.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.840
PETER BLAIR HENRY:
Really, really

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.530
thrilled to be with you.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.440
So we're at a really
important time.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.090
And that sounds trite to say,
but there's a reason for it.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.580
The world economy is in an
unprecedented period.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.470
And I just want to start off
by giving you a few numbers

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.150
that capture the essence of
why I think the ideas in

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.390
"Turnaround" are so critical
to all of us.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.740
So from 2002 to 2007, the world
economy experienced its

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.710
most rapid period of growth
in recorded history.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.220
So since the time in which we've
had GDP growth numbers,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.710
macroeconomic statistics
essentially, which is really

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.230
roughly over a century, we've
never had a period during

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.430
which the world economy
has grown as fast.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.940
From 2000 to 2007, the world
economy grew at 4.9% per year.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.310
But just to put that in
perspective, it's important

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.720
understand that emerging
economies, what are now called

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.860
emerging economies, really
drove that growth.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.320
So emerging economies grew at
something close to 7% per

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.640
year, whereas advanced economies
grew at just under

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.790
3% per year.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.600
So emerging economies are
driving global growth, and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.555
emerging economies have turned
themselves around from what

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.780
were formerly known as Third
World countries to now become

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.520
emerging economies.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.460
And what's really critical is
that, given where we are right

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.470
now, so 2002 to 2007
was a great period

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.520
of the world economy.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.610
We're in a much less
robust period.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.535
In 2012, the advanced nations
of the world grew at

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:22.600
only 1.3% per year.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.450
Europe actually contracted.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.130
Europe's in recession.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.550
Emerging economies still
grew at 5.3%.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.800
So in the aftermath of financial
crisis from 2008 to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.230
2009, from which we're
still recovering--

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.640
and very importantly we know
from work by a number of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.400
scholars, including Carmen
Reinhart and Ken Rogoff that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.240
countries recovering from
financial crisis, when

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.240
financial crises are the cause
of the recession, countries

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.040
grow much more slowly when they
recover from those kinds

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.990
of recessions.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.170
And that means we need emerging
economies to continue

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.940
to grow at rapid rates in
order to pull along the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.330
advanced world as
it struggles.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.670
And in particular, advanced
nations now look a lot like

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.960
Third World nations did three
and a half decades ago--

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.230
high debt, slow growth, and
a lack of direction.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.040
And the central idea in
"Turnaround" is that the

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.120
history of the formerly Third
World, its history with the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.790
struggle of economic reforms,
teaches us three really

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.090
important things that we need
in order for the advanced

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.620
nations to get back on track.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.990
And so I want to share with you
very quickly what those

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.940
three things are.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.890
And then I want to explore them
in a little more detail.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.050
So what are the three key
lessons that we can learn from

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.900
emerging economies?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.310
The Third World turned itself
around through discipline, and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.800
discipline doesn't mean
fiscal austerity.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.190
I'll define it in a second.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.440
Clarity--

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.880
and the example of clarity I
want to use comes from the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.440
small, tiny island of Barbados,
an even smaller

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.210
country than where I
come from, Jamaica.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.160
And trust is also critical
to turnaround.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.780
And I'm going to argue that the
emerging nations of the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.070
world that are so critical to
driving global growth suffer

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.580
from what I call a trust deficit
with the First World.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.390
And the trust deficit, the
lack of reciprocity and

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:45.460
respect of the Third World by
advanced nations, threatens

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.040
the willingness and ability
of Third World leaders to

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.410
continue on the path of
discipline and clarity that

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.930
has produced these record rates
of growth that are so

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.540
critical to our shared
prosperity.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.645
So that's the book
in a nutshell.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.690
I think it's important--

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.890
any time you talk about
macroeconomics, it's easy to

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.000
get lost in sort of GDP growth
rates, rates of inflation.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.660
Economics ultimately matters
because we're

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.920
talking about people.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.660
The reason why it's so critical
that the advanced

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.230
nations only grew at 1.3% last
year is because there's

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.130
unemployment.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.070
1.3% is below what economists
call the trend rate of growth.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.495
In advanced nations,
it's about 2.2%.

00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:34.090
In the United States, it's
a little higher.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.720
It's about 2.7218%.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.180
So when countries grow below
their trend rate of growth,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.220
unemployment tends to rise
through something called

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.980
Okun's Law.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.820
And so that means if we're
growing below potential--

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.980
we're not living up
to our potential--

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.740
it's really hard
to create jobs.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.800
And jobs are important,
not only for

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.540
incomes but for dignity.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.310
So what I'd like to do before
going further is just to share

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.640
with you a short passage
from "Turnaround."

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.020
I'd like to read a short passage
from "Turnaround" that

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.460
I think provides some context
for understanding

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.390
why economic growth.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.920
Why does economic growth
even matter?

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.720
Why are we talking about this
in the first place?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.990
So with your permission, I'll
do a short reading.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.170
This is from the first
chapter of the book.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.350
"Growing up as a little boy on
the island of Jamaica in the

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.860
early 1970s, I cherished the
time I spent on the porch of

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.520
my grandmother's simple two
bedroom ranch house in

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.180
Kingston, the nation's
capital.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.530
There, at 3 Windy Way in Harbour
View, a middle and

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.050
working class neighborhood at
the southern edge of the city,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.450
I would sit on the brown
speckled tile, leafing through

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.730
the pages of Encyclopedia
Britannica, reading Bible

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.640
stories, and pouring over
back issues of "National

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.060
Geographic" for hours on end.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.590
As sea breezes stirred the
needles of the casuarina trees

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.180
that lined the front yard and
shaded my world from both the

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.940
sun and the gazes of people
passing by on the sidewalk,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.450
scents from Grandma's
kitchen--

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.510
pumpkin soup, baking bread,
brown sugar, and lime juice--

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.080
wafted through the air.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.610
Things only got better as
the day progressed.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.670
And the sun made its arc through
the cobalt expanse of

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.309
the Jamaican afternoon sky.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.870
The approach of evening
was always my

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.140
favorite stretch of time--

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.610
a welcome pause between
the heat of day

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.590
and the fall darkness.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.540
Grandma, finished with her
cooking and housework, would

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.710
come outside and sit with me
in the early evening air.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.240
Encouraging children to read and
dream was what Grandma, a

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.830
former school teacher,
did best.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.470
And she never missed an
opportunity to work with one

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.420
of her favorite students.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.950
Sitting together in the fading
light, we lost ourselves in

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.520
conversation, accompanied
by the pulse of chirping

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.200
crickets, the reverberating
reggae beats from a nearby rum

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.125
shop, and the animated voices of
young men playing soccer in

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.050
the street.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.900
These are the sounds of the
Caribbean, the lyrical

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.490
backdrop to Grandma's outdoor
classroom, where I asked

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.900
question after question about
the people and places I had

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.780
encountered in the
day's reading.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.310
And my ever patient teacher
shared with me facts and

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.540
figures about distant lands.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.340
Yet the greatest lesson I
learned from my grandmother

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.440
came not from something she read
to me, but from something

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.990
she did for someone else.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.230
In Jamaica, as in many
developing countries, poverty

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.610
is never far away.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.910
On one occasion, the ambient
sounds of those Caribbean

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.590
evenings gave way to the
piercing call of a woman at

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.760
the front gate.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.920
'Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.430
You deh so?

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.530
Me beg you let me come in.'

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.180
When poverty calls to you
from the gate, you

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.380
have to make a choice.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.980
You could avert your eyes,
perhaps even turn your back

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.830
and harden your resolve
not to engage.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.800
But poverty will still be there
looking at you, even if

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.020
you don't have the courage
to return its gaze.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.940
'Soon, come,' grandma called
out, as she lifted her tiny

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.000
slightly hunched frame from the
chair next to me, walked

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.680
across the tiles, stepped from
porch to cardboard, and made

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.820
the 30-foot journey
to the gate.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.620
'Good evening, Ms. Mama, how
are you?' Ms. Mama's

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.660
appearance belied her reply.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.830
'Me all right so far,
Mrs. Henry.'

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.530
Ms. Mama looked anything but all
right to me, as I watched

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.600
her follow grandma
toward the porch.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.600
The closer Ms. Mama came to my
sacred classroom, the sharper

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.260
the contrast I discerned
between her

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.100
and my beloved tutor.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.985
With bare feet, tattered
clothes, matted hair, and a

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:20.035
protruding belly, seemingly at
odds with her thin frame, Ms.

00:11:20.035 --> 00:11:22.970
Mama appeared to be from an
entirely different planet than

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.760
my grandmother, who, with her
pressed and starched cotton

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.290
dress and neatly groomed
appearance, was the

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.900
quintessential school teacher
and matron of

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.530
the Anglican Church.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.380
After inviting Ms. Mama to sit
down next to her and across

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.530
from me, grandma asked Ms.
Mama if she was hungry.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.995
Ms. Mama replied, 'Yes,
Mrs. Henry.

00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:50.090
It's a long time me not
eat, you know, ma'am.'

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.980
My grandmother disappeared
inside, then emerged a few

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.290
minutes later with a large
tumbler of milk and a plate of

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.950
warm hard dough bread,
dripping with butter.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.050
I sat there, watching Ms. Mama
eat and listening to the

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.790
exchange, my grandmother
asking questions in the

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:13.810
Queen's English, Ms. Mama
responding in patois.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.300
They continued on for some time,
Ms. Mama chronicling her

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.750
tough circumstances, my
grandmother offering words of

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.590
comfort and encouragement, until
the crumbs disappeared

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.120
from the plate, the milk was
drained, and my grandmother

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.910
sent Ms. Mama on her way, with
the familiar Jamaican

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.550
benediction--

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.980
'Walk good.'

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.790
I don't know how Ms.
Mama got her name.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.510
And I don't know where
she came from.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.000
But I can picture her today
just as I saw her in that

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.400
first encounter in late 1977,
when I was eight years old.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.160
Over the next several months,
Ms. Mama appeared at my

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.100
grandmother's front gate with
increasing frequency.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.910
One day in 1978, following what
turned out that the last

00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:02.865
time I saw Ms. Mama, I asked my
grandmother, 'Grandma, Ms.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.100
Mama has a big belly.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.460
So why is she always hungry?'

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.420
My grandmother applied that some
people have big bellies

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.160
not from eating too much,
but because they never

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.660
get enough to eat.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.600
For me, economics is
all about Ms. Mama.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.560
I was drawn to the subject
because I wanted to help

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.170
people in developing countries
like my native Jamaica help

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.990
themselves.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.510
Feeding the hungry is
an act of kindness.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.310
Providing the hungry with the
means to feed themselves is an

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.060
act of empowerment that confers
dignity as well as

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.560
nourishment.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.740
My grandmother was too old and
lacked the technical training

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.440
to give people like Ms. Mama
that kind of enabling

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.170
assistance.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.930
I wrote this book because
I have no such excuse.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.690
Helping people to help
themselves begins with a

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.350
simple observation.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.240
Never in the history of the
world has a country

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.110
sustainably reduced poverty
without significantly

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.450
increasing its population's
average

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.200
overall standard of living.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.270
The gains from economic
expansion may not be evenly

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.520
distributed.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.730
So growth alone is not a
sufficient condition for

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.330
development.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.970
But it is absolutely
necessary.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.160
Without growth, life becomes a
series of zero sum struggles,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.180
directed at preserving one's
share of limited resources.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.680
With growth, the pie expands,
and the politics of

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.460
distribution no longer involve
such stark trade offs.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.870
Because economic expansion
provides the most reliable

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.560
means of enabling the poor
to lift themselves out of

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.310
poverty, the critical question
is, what kinds of economic

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.280
policies lay the foundation
for growth?

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.890
The economic policy decisions
implemented in the months and

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.310
years ahead will determine
whether people eat or starve,

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.060
live or die, and not just
in emerging economies.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.240
The financial crisis of
2008-2009 drove record numbers

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.900
of people in the United States
into unemployment,

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.640
foreclosure, and poverty, to say
nothing of the devastating

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.600
impact of its aftershocks
on the economies

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.730
and people of Europe.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.200
Whether in the First World or
the Third, there is no place

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.420
to hide from the power
of policy."

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.380
So that's why I think
economics matters.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.290
That's why growth matters.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.310
And that's why macroeconomics,
the big picture, if you will,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.670
is critical to our shared
prosperity in the future.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.610
So what I'd like to do briefly
now is to talk about these

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.490
three elements-- discipline,
clarity, and trust--

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.680
these lessons from the Third
World struggle with economic

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.200
reforms that have so much to
teach us here in the First

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.870
World and advanced nations
about how we create more

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.810
prosperity here and abroad.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.790
So discipline--

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.735
this one does not mean
fiscal austerity.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.480
In the book, I talk about what
discipline means in the

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.970
context of free trade, capital
flows between nations, and

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.890
other economic policies.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.250
I won't go into detail on
all those here today.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.250
We can certainly have questions
about that during

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.640
the question and
answer period.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.340
But I want to focus
on fiscal policy.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.260
What does discipline mean in the
context of fiscal policy?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.130
Because there's so much
discussion about fiscal policy

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.320
right now in the newspapers,
whether it be in the United

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.635
States, Western Europe,
or Great Britain.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:42.850
So discipline, I define
discipline to be not

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.970
austerity, not the willingness
to take extreme measures.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.670
But discipline means a sustained
commitment to

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.240
long-term prosperity, a
sustained commitment to a

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:59.290
pragmatic growth strategy that
is vigilant, and flexible, and

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.430
values what's good for the
country as a whole over what's

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.270
good for any individual,
interest group, or person

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.000
running for political office.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.220
That's what discipline means.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.199
And in the context of fiscal
policy, discipline is actually

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.980
no more complicated than the
story of the ant and the

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.960
grasshopper in "Aesop's Fables."
I have four sons, so

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.920
bedtime stories are a good way
for me to get a grasp on how

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.090
to make things very simple.

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.400
You know the story of the
ant and the grasshopper.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.180
During good times, during the
summer, the ant saves.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.980
He has a surplus so that
when winter comes, it

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.840
runs down the surplus.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.690
The grasshopper had a party and
didn't have anything to

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.490
eat during the winter.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.100
First World grasshoppers and
Third World ants is what I'd

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.560
like you to keep in mind.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.290
And I'll give you two very
specific examples.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.240
Let's take the United
States and Chile.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.152
In 2001, the United States,
we had a $236

00:18:00.152 --> 00:18:02.720
billion fiscal surplus.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.507
We decided to give that
surplus back in

00:18:04.507 --> 00:18:07.660
the form of tax cuts.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.260
We gave tax cuts back and ran
deficits during that period

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.080
from 2002 to 2007, I mentioned
earlier, when the world

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.820
economy was booming.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.630
Basic economics teaches us
that we should have done

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.170
exactly the opposite.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.510
You save when times are good,
just like the ant.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.040
And we know the rest
of the story.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.450
And the story generalizes beyond
the United States.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.770
Advanced nations as a whole
between 2002 and 2007, were

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.200
running fiscal deficits
of about 3% of GDP.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.880
So when the crisis hit, we
didn't have a cushion.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.510
And debts are now
where they are.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:49.150
Chile in contrast, during those
boom years in 2002 to

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:54.980
2007, copper, Chile's principal
export, the price of

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.650
copper soared, in large part
due to rising demand in the

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.470
emerging world, building of
cities, building of homes,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.990
wiring of offices and
homes and cities.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.240
As the price of copper was
booming, the Chilean treasury

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.790
filled up with revenue.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.410
And the people of Chile in 2008
took to the streets and

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.950
burned the finance minister
Andres Velasco in effigy,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.360
asking him--

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.605
well, asking's a polite way--
demanding that he return the

00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:28.890
people's money, so to speak.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.070
He said no.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.520
This is money for a rainy day.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.640
When the financial crisis hit,
Chile had a surplus.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.605
They were able to institute a $4
billion tax cut package to

00:19:40.605 --> 00:19:43.520
help cushion the blow of the
recession, the financial

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.780
crisis, and help the poor.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.700
Third World ants, First
World grasshoppers--

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.390
so discipline in the context
of fiscal policy, again,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.810
doesn't mean austerity.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.100
It means running counter
cyclical fiscal policy, saving

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.260
for a rainy day.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.510
Second point, clarity--

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.990
I mentioned that I want to tell
you a story from the tiny

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.900
island of Barbados.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.790
So you may say, what can you
learn from a small island?

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.620
Well, I think there's a lot we
can learn from a small island.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:24.100
In 1992, Barbados was on the
brink of financial ruin.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.360
They were running out of foreign
exchange reserves.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.500
And their currency, the
Barbadian dollar, was pegged

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.610
to the US dollar--

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.005
1.7 Barbadian dollars
for each US dollar.

00:20:34.005 --> 00:20:39.210
It had been pegged since
the early 1970s.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.800
The United States economy
was in recession.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.090
We had a credit crunch.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.540
Barbados, being heavily
dependent on exports, in

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.900
particular tourism,
was suffering.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.360
The International Monetary Fund
went to Barbados and sat

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.170
down with the leadership and
said, we think that you need

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.360
to devalue your currency.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.410
You need to change the parity
from, let's say, 1.7 Barbadian

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.560
dollars to 1 US dollar to,
let's just call it 2.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.810
Let's make that number up.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.080
Barbados said no.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.330
We don't want to do that.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.830
There's a reason why our
exchange rate is fixed.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.670
We're a small island.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.710
We import much of
what we consume.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.626
And if we devalue our currency,
we're worried that

00:21:22.626 --> 00:21:25.080
this is going to cause an
inflationary spiral.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.170
As the cost of imports goes up,
people are going to demand

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.500
much higher wages, and this is
going to set off higher costs.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.270
And we're going to get
into a spiral.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.460
But the others said, but
speaking of costs, much like

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.710
Europe today outside of Germany,
wages have risen too

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.880
quickly so that production
costs, unit labor costs, have

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.280
made you uncompetitive.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.900
How are you going to
be competitive?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:52.330
So rather than just saying they
weren't going to devalue,

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.030
the leadership in Barbados said,
OK, we've got a serious

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.620
problem on our hands.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.470
We've got to propose
an alternative.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.280
So what they did is
they got together.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.630
The unions, the owners of
corporations, and the

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.460
government all sat down.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.880
And they could see that the way
around this problem was

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.410
that they needed to cut wages.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.052
The problem, of course,
is no one likes to

00:22:15.052 --> 00:22:17.750
have their wages cut.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.000
Raise you hand if you like
to have your wages cut.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.740
So what do they do?

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.590
Well, a 9% wage cut
was on the table.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.000
The government decided they were
going to go ahead with

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.820
this, a public sector
wage cut.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.960
The public sector unions took
a strong opposition to this.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.120
And 30,000 people took to the
streets of Bridgetown, the

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.940
capital of Barbados
in protest.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.965
And just to put it in context,
there are only 250,000 people

00:22:49.965 --> 00:22:50.650
in Barbados.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.810
So this is roughly an eighth
of the population.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.860
This is like 40 million people
marching on Washington in

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.640
protest of cuts in government
federal wages.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.050
So the wage cut had been
proposed by Prime Minister

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.870
Erskine Sandiford.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.470
The leader of the trade unions,
Sir Leroy Trotman, had

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.780
been against the wage cuts.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.990
But when he saw this protest,
to his credit,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.920
he changed his position.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.810
He said this is not good
for the country.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.570
We can't have this.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.830
They resumed the three-party
talks.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.400
And I'll just come to the end
of story very quickly.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:43.480
The leadership of corporations
opened the books to workers.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.820
And said, hey, what we're going
to do is we're going to

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:53.220
have a negotiated agreement
that in the future, wage

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.280
increases will be tied
to productivity.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.630
So therefore, we're going to
share the fruits of prosperity

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.640
in such a way that we can
keep wages in line with

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.130
productivity so that costs
don't get out of control.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.350
The union supported this.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.970
The government didn't devalue.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.690
Wages were cut by 9%.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.180
Within a year, the Barbadian
economy recovered.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.230
For his troubles, Prime Minister
Erskine Sandiford and

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:24.990
his party were kicked out
of office for 14 years.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:30.270
When asked, in retrospect,
would you do it again?

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:35.100
The former prime minister said,
the price I paid was a

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.390
small price to save Barbados.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.560
That's clarity.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.655
That's clarity of purpose and
understanding what discipline

00:24:43.655 --> 00:24:46.430
meant in that context.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.300
Barbados, yes, it's a small
country, but the problems in

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.880
Barbados are very similar to
the problems that Europe

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.860
outside of Germany
faces today.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.430
Wages have risen too fast,
relative to productivity.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.773
Countries aren't competitive.

00:24:59.773 --> 00:25:03.470
And just to connect clarity to
discipline, discipline doesn't

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.940
mean austerity in a
European context.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.825
It means more reform
and less austerity.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.110
Last point before opening
up to questions--

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.360
trust.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.940
I made the claim that the trust
deficit, the lack of

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:26.190
trust between emerging market
nations and advanced nations,

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.530
stands in the way of our
future prosperity.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.300
What do I mean by that?

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.110
Generalize now from Chile and
Barbados to the larger

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.510
emerging market countries,
the so-called BRICs--

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.640
the Brazils, the Indias, the
South Africas of the world.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:47.890
The BRIC nations account for
roughly 21% of global GDP.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:53.600
Brazil, India, China, all these
countries in their own

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.830
way have practiced discipline.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.080
And it's important to say in
their own way, because what

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.060
discipline means for specific
policies differs from country

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.720
to country.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.470
That general definition
applies.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.145
It's sustained commitment
to long-term prosperity.

00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:08.070
It's pragmatic.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.780
It's flexible.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.700
And what pragmatic
means depends on

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.820
the cultural context.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.600
It depends on the political
context.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.350
It depends on the country's
natural resources.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.050
There's a whole range of things
that will determine

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.820
what's the optimal strategy
for a country to grow.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.900
But the common thread is
discipline, a sustained

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.340
commitment to long-term
prosperity.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.450
Through discipline, these
countries have turned

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:36.270
themselves around, accounting
now for 21% of global GDP, are

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.440
driving global growth.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:44.480
But yet, at the institutions
that determine the contours of

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.290
international economic policy,
the International Monetary

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.920
Fund and the World Bank, these
countries only account for

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.660
11.5% of the voting shares.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.050
They're underrepresented,
relative to their weight in

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.930
the global economy.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:02.230
In contrast, the countries of
the eurozone account for about

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:09.620
24% of global GDP, and have
32% of the votes.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.060
So we have an antiquated
structure that reflects the

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.390
relative importance of these
economies in the immediate

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.170
aftermath of World War II.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.400
The lack of recognition, the
lack of reciprocity, in

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.900
international economic relations
undermines the trust

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.510
of leaders in the emerging
world with leaders in the

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.140
advanced nations.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.760
And very importantly, makes it
very difficult for leaders in

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.730
the developing world to continue
to sell to their

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.130
electorates the need for more
discipline policies.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.860
Because by the way, there's a
lot of work left to be done.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.430
It's not just the advanced
nations--

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.435
and certainly the advanced
nations need to learn the

00:27:58.435 --> 00:28:00.560
Third World lessons for
First World growth--

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.040
but there's a lot of work
that remains to be

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.780
been in emerging nations.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:09.280
And in order for that work to
happen, we're going to need

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.940
cooperation.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:17.010
Leaders in the developing world,
in the emerging world,

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.720
are going to need to be able
to show their citizens that

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.860
the advanced nations of the
world are willing to do as

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.320
they say, not just as they do.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:33.520
So discipline, clarity,
and trust.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.740
Looking at the history of the
Third World's struggle with

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.140
economic reform teaches us
these three things--

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.460
discipline and clarity
which build trust.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.480
In the absence of which,
we get a trust deficit.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.130
These are the key lessons,
whether it's fiscal policy,

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.020
trade policy, policy with
respect to international

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.167
capital flows that are key for
greater shared prosperity in

00:29:00.167 --> 00:29:01.120
the future.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.670
So let me stop there and
take any questions.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.190
AUDIENCE: Given the example
of the prime minister in

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.630
Barbados, are politicians
deincentivized to make

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.053
long-term choices or maybe
incapable, given

00:29:12.053 --> 00:29:13.190
the election cycles?

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.900
And when it comes to public
sector unions dealing with

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.490
elected officials, are they
essentially negotiating with

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.740
themselves?

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:29.250
PETER BLAIR HENRY: I think
it's certainly true that

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:35.470
election cycles in many cases
work against officials making

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.020
long-term decisions.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.870
And the principal motivation,
frankly, for writing the book

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.880
was the desire to raise
expectations on the part of

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.110
the electorate.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:53.110
So I wanted to take these
examples and illustrate to a

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.530
general readership that
discipline is a two-way street

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:58.180
in many respects.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.950
So if we don't hold our leaders
accountable to a

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.650
higher standard, then we
shouldn't expect them to

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.250
behave with long-term vision.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:14.180
So, yes, many of the incentives
go against making

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.300
long-term decisions, but I think
it's incumbent on the

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.600
electorate to actually
hold their

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.580
leaders to a higher standard.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.760
So the key point in
the context of

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.845
unions is the following.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.950
This is not to denigrate
all of the positive

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.410
things that unions do.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.390
But it's a question of benefits
for an inside group

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.670
versus an outside group.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:45.040
So if I could just generalize
the question a little bit, in

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.460
the case of Barbados, had they
not given into the wage cut,

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:56.550
those who had jobs would have
maintained their higher wages,

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.620
but at the cost of greater
unemployment to a larger

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.520
number of people.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.390
And so the question is how
do you bring about shared

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:08.920
sacrifice so that not
only over time--

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.560
and in the case Barbados, you
had higher wages over time by

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.350
tying wage increases
to productivity--

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.890
so how do you not only get
people to have higher wages,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.190
but how do ensure
full employment?

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.830
And that's one of the critical
problems facing Europe right

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:27.800
now is that those who are part
of the inside group, those who

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.570
are employed, are quite happy
with wages that are out of

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.860
line with productivity.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.960
But the youth, in particular,
new entrance in the labor

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.620
force, are locked out.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.420
And so we've got to reconvene
the conversation.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.075
We've got to have a set of
policies that make it, for

00:31:46.075 --> 00:31:48.720
instance, in a European context,
easier to hire and

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.155
fire workers so that companies
will hire more workers.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.610
So again, I think there
has to be give and

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.636
take on both sides.

00:31:58.636 --> 00:32:01.510
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
when you talked about

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:07.360
the Barbados and how the
corporations opened up.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.560
Can you elaborate on what were
the incentives for the

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.010
corporations to do that or how
the government kind of created

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.190
that incentive for them?

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.070
PETER BLAIR HENRY: Sure.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:22.050
So in Barbados, in particular,
the hotel industry was a

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.850
critical industry,
given tourism.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.380
And speaking of incentives, the
owners realized that when

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.790
you've got 30,000 people
marching in the streets, it's

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.960
not good for tourism.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.120
And so in that case, there was
a realization that, OK, gosh,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.320
we have to share in
this pain as well.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.800
This can't just be a matter of
teachers, and firemen, and

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.310
policemen bearing the full
brunt of this adjustment.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.700
We have to make some concessions
as well.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.030
And the reason why I like to use
the Barbados example is it

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.800
shows that social cohesion,
social compact, social

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.050
compromise, is possible.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.660
But again, it takes leadership
to point to people that it is

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.380
in their self-interest
to do these things.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.400
AUDIENCE: So on your first
point, when you mentioned,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.250
basically, the Keynesian
approach is the way to go,

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.890
given the current polarization
in the political systems

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:20.770
across the globe--

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.860
I mean, the US, but also
Italy, France, UK--

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.150
aren't politicians not
incentivized to actually do

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.730
this but make a short-time
decisions that will be better

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:36.260
in the end just for their
political future, instead of

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.340
making long-term goals
that might be

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.590
better for the country?

00:33:42.005 --> 00:33:45.170
PETER BLAIR HENRY: Yeah, I think
it's certainly an issue.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.970
And my hope in writing this book
is to get the discussion

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:56.750
away from polar extremes that
are really rooted in nothing

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.240
more than opinions and to just
bring facts to bear.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.650
And so let me just stress some
facts that I actually think

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:09.920
really highlight why fiscal
austerity is not the right

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.230
approach, for instance.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.850
It's not my view,
these are facts.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:17.820
So what do I mean by that?

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:23.730
So one of the ways in which
I try to understand what

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.705
discipline actually means,
it's not my view of

00:34:25.705 --> 00:34:26.909
what this one is.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:28.310
It's a market view.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.400
So I actually ask the question,
how does the stock

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.330
market, or how did the stock
market, in these emerging

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.670
countries, in these developing
countries, respond when

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.090
governments implement
big policy changes?

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:41.239
You mention, why would you
look to the stock market?

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.969
Why is the stock market a useful
measure of anything?

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:47.400
Well, the stock market doesn't
care about ideology.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.630
Stock market's not Keynesian or

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.520
monetarist or anything else.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.120
Will the policy that's enacted,
on average, create

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.340
economic growth in the
future and reduce

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.770
risk, or increase risk?

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:01.500
And so when the stock market
responds positively what it's

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.160
basically telling you is that
the implemented policy change

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.210
is likely to create a value.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:12.350
And so in the context of fiscal
austerity, what we

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.590
learn is there are 81 episodes
over the course of three and a

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.150
half decades of developing
countries

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.990
implementing fiscal austerity.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:26.510
56 of those episodes turned out
to be implemented during

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.060
what's called moderate
inflation,

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.580
inflation below 40%.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.500
25 of those episodes are
during high inflation.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.760
In the high-inflation episodes,
the stock market

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.340
responds extremely positively.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.170
It goes up by about 60% in real
dollar terms over about a

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:45.420
year in anticipation of
these policy changes.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.050
So austerity's a value-creating
proposition

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:54.700
when inflation is on the order
of 300% per year or more as it

00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:00.300
was in the case of Brazil
or Mexico in the 1980s.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.100
When inflation's below 40%,
the stock market falls by

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.070
about 30%, when governments
implement fiscal austerity.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.530
So what that means for
politicians, to answer your

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.330
question directly in the current
European-US context,

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.560
is that implementing austerity
in a 2% or 3% inflation

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:23.200
environment is not a winning
proposition.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.580
Do politicians have the
incentive to recognize that?

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.150
I think politicians
can at least agree

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.810
that growth is good.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.040
So that's why I wanted to
get this message out.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.960
AUDIENCE: Stock markets are back
to their pre-2008 levels.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.430
That should be--

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.910
PETER BLAIR HENRY: Only if you
don't adjust for inflation.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.700
So in real terms, we're
still below.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.640
And it's a very good point,
because there are a lot of

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.570
reasons why stock markets
have gone up recently.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.830
We've got expansionary
monetary policy.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.740
Corporate profits are high.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.250
And it brings me to the second
point, which is that the stock

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:05.710
market responding positively
to a policy change, again

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.160
going back to the passage that I
read, is a necessary but not

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.560
sufficient condition for
shared prosperity.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.890
In other words, the stock market
responding positively

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:17.930
to a policy change is telling
you, yes, that policy change,

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.610
reducing inflation or austerity
in the midst of high

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.960
inflation does create value.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.180
But that's just the
first step.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:31.970
So in the present context, even
though stock markets are

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.470
rising, there's still a question
of well, what's next?

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.520
What do we have to do to, for
instance, in the United

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.490
States, restore trust between
business and government so

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.850
that firms start to
invest again?

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.950
Investment right now as a
fraction of GDP in the United

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.740
States is down around 15%.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.470
About a decade ago it
was as high as 25%.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.340
That means on average,
corporations, the private

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.070
sector's investing close to $1
trillion dollars a year less

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.270
per year than it was.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.580
And that's one of the reasons
why we haven't seen a really

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.870
robust recovery, a pickup
in jobs and growth.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.330
And so the stock market is a
very helpful place to start a

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.530
conversation and get
away from ideology.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.790
Because you can ask the
question, is this policy

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.550
change likely to create
or destroy value?

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.510
But it's not the place to
end the conversation.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.840
Because stability is a necessary
but not sufficient

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.610
condition for shared
prosperity.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.840
AUDIENCE: Thanks again
for joining us.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.360
My question is around the trust
deficit you mentioned.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.450
And you gave an example between
First and Third World

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.390
country trust issues.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.180
How about the trust deficit with
the US itself and how it

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.450
impacts our innovation
and growth?

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:47.870
I've seen some numbers where
US was behind even China in

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.530
terms of trust.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.860
And so is there anything we
can learn from Third World

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.605
countries to restore trust?

00:38:55.605 --> 00:38:57.410
PETER BLAIR HENRY: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:05.860
So there's a passage in the book
that makes reference to a

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.710
West Indian aphorism that
my dad used to say a lot

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.575
when I was a kid.

00:39:10.575 --> 00:39:14.550
And the aphorism is "Long
road draw sweat.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.890
Shortcut draw blood." It's
almost self-explanatory.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.480
The long road makes you sweat.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.330
There's no easy way to get
to the right place.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:32.760
And we've taken a lot of
shortcuts, whether it be the

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.045
financial markets, and all the
things that went wrong, over

00:39:38.045 --> 00:39:42.170
extension of loans, people who
can afford loans, and all the

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.960
things that went wrong in the
run-up to the financial crisis

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.530
where effectively we undermined
trust in a number

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:56.620
of ways, between consumers,
lenders, investors,

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.120
shareholders of corporations.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.710
So you can't rebuild
that overnight.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:06.370
And I think it's very important
for us remember, as

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:10.690
in many things in life, it takes
a long time to build a

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.940
reputation.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.900
It can be destroyed like that.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.520
So the lesson is, from Third
World nations that have worked

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.170
so hard to get beyond where
they were in the 1970s and

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.140
1980s where there was
a lack of trust--

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.710
as reflected in low stock
prices, and lack of

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.660
investment, and low growth--

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.720
to building that trust, that we
need to take the long road.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:42.040
And we need to do the basic
things that are necessary in

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.860
order rebuild trust.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.250
So there's no easy answer.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.020
We just have to do it.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.010
We just have to do it,
everything from restoring

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:54.550
confidence in lending, to
giving clarity about the

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.520
future so that businesses will
begin to invest again.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.920
And I think we just keep doing
it, get on the right track,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.400
and stay on the right track.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.390
It becomes self-reinforcing.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:10.020
AUDIENCE: It seems like some of
the challenge that people

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.640
are coming up with in the
questions is this problem

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.345
between the short-term
incentives and

00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:16.580
the long-term vision.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.860
PETER BLAIR HENRY: Right.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.470
AUDIENCE: But that also suggests
some amount of

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.080
democratization.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:29.890
So I'm wondering where some of
your takeaways fit within the

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.440
academic tradition that a little
bit of authoritarianism

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.130
is good, what you're trying
to put out here.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.220
PETER BLAIR HENRY: It's
a great question.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:41.880
So it's certainly true that if
you look out in the world,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.540
there are examples of countries
that have been able

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:51.120
to implement long-term policies,
discipline policies,

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.430
throughout their
authoritarianism.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:58.200
But what makes me very hopeful
is that there are also more

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.690
than a few examples of
complicated democracies that

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.380
actually implement long-term
value creating policies.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.230
I think Brazil's an
excellent example.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.823
So Brazil in 1994, under the
leadership of Fernando

00:42:10.823 --> 00:42:14.810
Henrique Cardoso implements the
Real Plan, which basically

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:20.320
cuts off inflation permanently
for the first time.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.470
But what's really important is
that following Cardoso, Lula

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:28.500
da Silva was elected in 1998
and was elected on a policy

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.590
platform that many people
thought that Lula was going to

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:35.190
go back to the policies of old,
printing money to finance

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.280
the deficit, and would drive
inflation back up.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.450
In fact, if you look at
financial markets in the run

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:44.260
up till Lula's election, risk
premium went up and really,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.050
really reflected that.

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.920
But the genius of Lula was he
had broad inclusive language

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.740
but harnessed the market
to deliver those goals.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.940
And Brazil is still a
low-inflation country today.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.060
And it's provided that
stability, plus some--

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.830
more open markets,
market-friendly policy.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:03.110
So there are examples, whether
it be Brazil in 1994, India,

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.740
actually under Rajiv Gandhi as
early as 1986 beginning to

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.280
move in a more market-friendly
direction.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.620
And an even more recent example,
a very fledgling

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:16.980
democracy, Indonesia in 1997,
during the Asian financial

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.420
crisis, was one of the most
hard-hit countries, an

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.550
authoritarian country
that made a

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.550
transition to democracy.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.980
It's still a fledgling
democracy.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.500
There's a way to go.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.840
But it's doing a good job
of managing its natural

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.780
resources, which is typically
a real problem.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.230
And then there are the
democracies like Ghana and

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.830
West Africa.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.140
So I'm hopeful.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.250
I'm hopeful.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.420
But again, I think your question
is an excellent one,

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.200
because I think it points to the
need for us in the First

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.690
World, who've gotten so
paralyzed and divided, to look

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.530
up and look out and say, gee,
there are all these countries

00:43:54.530 --> 00:44:01.240
who, in fact, sometimes we were
teaching what to do in

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.720
order to grow.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.580
They've learned the lessons.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.090
Now maybe we need to sit down
and actually look at them more

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.420
closely and become students
again and figure out how we

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.990
get to yes.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:15.650
AUDIENCE: Hi, yeah, so, just
on the topic of economic

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.930
growth, but then also versus
poverty or reducing poverty, I

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:24.390
guess sort of to the three
points that you spoke to

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.690
improving economic growth, would
you say that those are

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.140
also in line with the idea
of wealth distribution or

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.240
reducing poverty, or not
necessarily that the two go

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.800
hand in hand?

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.630
PETER BLAIR HENRY: So I would
say that growth is a necessary

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.790
but not sufficient condition
for poverty reduction.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:47.630
So if you want to reduce
poverty, you need growth.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.170
You need resources to deal
with the issues.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:55.220
Now is growth alone
sufficient?

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.480
Probably not.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.860
So let me give you a
specific example.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.740
Or is stability alone, which
creates growth, sufficient?

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.670
So if you're a country that
reduces inflation, so let's

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.230
say you're a country
like Brazil.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.500
Stock market goes up
because you stopped

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.550
the inflation problem.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.400
But now the cost of capital's
gone down for corporations.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.370
But if you don't have policies
that make it easy for

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:26.070
companies to hire workers, or
encourage companies to hire

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.650
workers, then you're not going
to see the kinds of employment

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.850
and wage gains that you would
see in an environment where

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.400
you did do that.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.920
And so you need a combination
of policies.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.960
And in that case as well, not
only policies to create more

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.980
employment, but then you
probably also do need policies

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:51.160
to directly address the issues
of poverty, as Brazil did in

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.560
addition to its inflation
stabilization policies.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.980
But importantly, it's the growth
that gives you the

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.680
resources that you need to deal
with whatever range of

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.016
societal problems it is you want
to deal with, whether it

00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:05.360
be poverty or something else.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.940
One of the stories I tell in
chapter two of the book is a

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.840
story of my own native Jamaica
in which a very charismatic

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.710
leader, Michael Manley--

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:17.120
so in some sense very similar
to Lula da Silva in terms of

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.740
just sort of raw charisma--

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:26.550
brilliant man who was
unconstrained by external

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:30.200
reality, an oil shock that hit
in the early 1970s, had a set

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.345
of goals, including poverty
reduction, by being

00:46:34.345 --> 00:46:38.400
unconstrained by what was
happening with oil prices and

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.690
economic reality, really drove
the country into a terrible

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.820
economic place, almost 13
straight years of economic

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:49.480
contraction, which drove
poverty way up.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:56.820
So in many ways, the first rule
of poverty reduction and

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.670
growth is to provide
stability.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:03.090
Because without stability,
there's really nothing else.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:08.355
But stability is a place to
start, not a place to stop.

00:47:08.355 --> 00:47:10.680
MALE SPEAKER: So if I could just
ask one last question as

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.960
we kind of wrap up.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.460
A lot of what you've talked
about is a compelling thesis.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.740
It sort of makes sense.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.640
It hangs together.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.880
It seems premised on cases where
things got really bad

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.700
before the leading figures sort
of said, OK, I need to be

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.270
disciplined.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:27.160
I need to be committed.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.240
I need to establish trust.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.790
In the developing world, these
lessons seem applicable.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.030
Are things bad enough that
people will listen?

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.700
Or do they need to get worse?

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.950
PETER BLAIR HENRY:
I sure hope so.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.960
It's true.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.440
The good news and in some
way the bad news in

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.700
the advanced nations--

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.260
and I think Japan is a great
example-- so Japan has had a

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:58.530
really, by any measure, a
tremendous under performance

00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.520
over the last two decades.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.660
And they've got a new central
bank governor who's going to

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.740
try new approaches to get rid
of deflation and get the

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.110
country going again.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.100
But what makes it so difficult
for advanced nations like

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.990
Japan and the United States to
actually tackle their problems

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.780
is the overall level
is still very high.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.470
And so we become complacent.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:22.560
We become used to gridlock
or under performance.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.600
And so I hope things have
gotten bad enough.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.090
And I hope that, frankly, we can
be motivated just by the

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.590
things which, frankly in this
country, have always been sort

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:37.160
of core values, which is our
commitment to excellence.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.190
We shouldn't be satisfied with
2.2% growth last year and 1.3%

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.320
growth in the advanced
nations.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.420
Those are low expectations.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:51.870
So I'm hopeful that people
will re-turn around and

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:56.000
recognize that there are a lot
of lessons out there that are

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
there for the taking.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.500
And that if we just rededicate
ourselves to excellence,

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.120
there's a much more prosperous
future for all of us.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.280
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you very
much for taking the time and

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.530
sharing your insights with us.
