- [Voiceover] This episode
of CC: Social Scene

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:03.603 align:start size:97% position:3%
is based on your suggestions
for what can go wrong

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.438
on a hike without GPS.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:12.379 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh you guys, what a
beautiful day for a hike.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.514 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah if Dave
doesn't ruin it first.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:15.448
- Yeah Dave.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.384
- Oh my tummy, I'm so sick.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.985
- My appendix burst.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.021
- Oh god I'm gonna die!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.489
(laughter)

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.791
- So according to the GPS the
hike is one hour that way.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.960
- Okay that is enough of that.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.362
Guys, today we are roughing it.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.897
- We're not even
on the trail yet.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:35.068
- Well hiking starts the
second you step out of the,

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:37.937
out of the car.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.205
(sighs)

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.673
Guys, it's summer.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.510 align:start size:97% position:3%
Right, this is our one chance
to connect with nature.

Did Christopher
Columbus have a GPS?

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.379
No!

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.681
He discovered America.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.983
I got it, I got it.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:50.817
America.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.085
How 'bout we vote?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.220
All of those who
want to live free

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
and really connect with
this beautiful Mother Gaea.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:00:59.759
- Yeah.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.560
- Yeah.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.361
- Raise those hands.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.362
- Oh that's a good one.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.196
- Raise them high!

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.597
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.168
- Mother Gaea?

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.904
- Look it up buddy,
it's on the internet.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.672
Well don't 'cause
I took your phone.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.341
(upbeat guitar music)

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.676
(bird screeches)

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.877
- We're lost.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.379 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah we've walked past
that tree four times

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.814
and I'm out of water.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.048 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- I haven't taken a selfie
in like three hours.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.984 line:0%
- Sorry guys, we're
not lost, alright?

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.419 line:0%
- If you look, there's the sun.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.589 align:start size:97% position:3%
So that means our car is
right over, no, okay hold on.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.093
The sun is, it's hard
to, we're not lost.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.129
- Brody can we please
have our phones back?

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.963
- You mean these?

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.431
- Yes.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.265
- What?!

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.368
(screaming)

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.370
- We don't need that stuff guys.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.406
Alright, was that drastic?

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.240
- Yes!

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.074
- Yes.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.142
Was that necessary?

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.376
- No!

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.146 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Maybe, maybe because
we don't need GPS.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.514
We can do this!

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.250
We are young, and we are strong!

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.485
Right, say it!

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.653 align:start size:81% position:19%
- We are young
and we are strong!

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.888
- No no no, enough enough.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:02.722
Alright, let's go.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:03.556
Come on.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.291
(screaming)

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
Okay, don't touch
him, don't touch him.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:08.828
- Why not?

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.865
- I am so hungry.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.501
Do you have anything
in that bag I can eat?

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.102
- You want some beef jerky?

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:16.936 line:0%
- I can't eat that,
I'm a vegetarian.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.771 line:0%
You got anything else?

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.610
- Nope.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.746
- Crap, I'm gonna
die in the woods.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.148
- You're gonna be fine.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.518
We got plenty of sun
and plenty of time.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.287
(bird cooing)

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.755
- Well, we're lost.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.424 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's all thanks to Captain
Throws Phones Over There.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.628 align:start position:0%
- Calm down Dave, you don't
wanna burst your other appendix.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:42.695
- You only have one!

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.530
- Okay.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.364
- One appendix!

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.232
- Everybody relax.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.700
I know where we are.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.869
- Really Brody, where are we?

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.704
- We are in the woods.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.140
- Thanks for--

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.476
(screaming)

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.013
- Stop guys, look at us!

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
If anybody should
be mad here it's me!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.185
I'm the guy who hurt his, ow!

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.352
(screams)

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.620
Oh that was the other one.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.821
Great, okay, just
because we're lost

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.357 align:start size:84% position:16%
doesn't mean we have
to all go crazy.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:16.162
(growling)

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.398
- I did my way, I did my way.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.733
(screaming)

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.103
- I have returned!

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.339
And I bring food!

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.607
- Give me the snail!

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.675
- I want the snail!

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.609
- Earn it.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.511
(shrieking)

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.315
(screaming and animal sounds)

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.853
(snoring)

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.894

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.132
