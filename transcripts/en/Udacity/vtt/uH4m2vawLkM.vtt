00:00:00.072 --> 00:00:02.574
Tell us what you did before you came to NVIDIA.

00:00:02.574 --> 00:00:09.826
For 26 years I was a professor, first at MIT for 11 years, then at Stanford for 15 years.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:14.993
And I taught courses on computer architecture and parallel computing

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:18.857
and led a research group that built a lot of interesting parallel computers

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:22.028
and developed many interesting programming systems for them,

00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:25.659
including some early object-oriented parallel programming systems, concurrent small talk,

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:32.305
concurrent aggregates. some stream programming systems, Dream C, Kernel C, Brooks, and Sequoia.

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:35.840
That sequence of programming systems ultimately led to CUDA,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.189
which ultimately led to CUDA which was done by the same person who had done Brooks,

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.460
a stream programming language we did at Stanford.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.728
During that period of time, I also was a consultant

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:46.962
for industry working for numerous companies, particularly for Cray.

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:51.066
I worked with Cray since the late 1980s into the middle of the 2000s,

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.600
helping them develop interesting parallel computer systems.
