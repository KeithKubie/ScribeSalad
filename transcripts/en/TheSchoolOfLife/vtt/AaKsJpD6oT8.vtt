We expect of course for it to be the other
way around. We teaching him but he has a host

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.870
of important lessons for us too, if we take
care to listen.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.640
It's easy to play it tough

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.240
nowadays, to overdo independence but to have
survived we all needed as he does an extraordinary

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.740
amount of care from those around us. He is
a reminder that no-one makes themselves and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.840
therefore that we're heavily in someone usually
under acknowledged debt and should perhaps

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.540
call, our mother.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.059
As adults we give love chiefly
because of what others can do for us, but

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.719
he doesn't deserve much of anything. He can't
do a thing for anyone. He cries too much and

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.719
is asleep most of the time yet we devote ourselves
to him nevertheless. So he teaches us about

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.730
the truest, purest kind of love. Which means
giving affection without expecting anything

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.860
in return simply because someone needs help
and one happens to be in a position to give it.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.880
He can't of course, tell us what is wrong
with him. We have to guess; but what's striking

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.590
is how generous we are in interpreting what
could be at stake. When he cries we don't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.490
accuse him of being mean. When he hits or
kicks we assume he must be frightened or momentarily

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.610
vexed. We are constantly aware it might just
be hunger, a tricky digestive tract or a lack

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.380
of sleep. How kind we would be if we could
be similarly imaginative around adults.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.260
If we could look beneath their surface behaviour,
the unpleasantness, viciousness and grumpiness...

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.340
and can trust that here too it was probably also
just fear, pain or exhaustion.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300
It's easy to get sickened by our species,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.160
the greed, the status consciousness, the vanity, we should

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.480
hang out with him as a corrective. He doesn't
care what you do or how much you're making.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.480
He cares about laughter, friendship, people
who are nice to him. We were all like this once.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.340
It's society that corrupted us and encouraged
our unhealthier impulses. He's a political

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.990
philosopher, he pointing to how we might all
be if only the world would be

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.390
newly and better arranged.
