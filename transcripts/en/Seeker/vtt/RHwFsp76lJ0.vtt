Tis the season to get sloppy, but does mixing
every kind of alcohol in your house help to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.120
make the season bright or turn you into a
green grinch?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.900
Hi eggnog heads, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.250
If you’re like me you get into the holiday
spirits, if you know what I’m saying.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.960
So we around the office were wondering if
mixing different kinds of alcohols makes you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.369
drunker or more hungover.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.630
Naturally I volunteered to research.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.550
After they told me it was inappropriate to
drink at work and that Discovery had a very

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.889
strict pants policy, I found some studies
on the subject online.

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:37.760
One in the USA looked into the effects of
dark liquors vs light liquors.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.909
Researchers took a group of university students
and gave them either vodka with coke, whiskey

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.129
with coke, or a placebo of tonic water and
coke with a dash of one of the liquors for

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.129
flavor.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.139
After all the students blew .11g of alcohol
per 100ml of breath, they spent the night

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:52.139
at the clinic.

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:55.519
They were woken up at 7, fed breakfast, and
given a series of tests.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.609
Then they were sent on their way with 450
dollars in their pocket.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.539
Talk about the best study ever.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.170
The results are interesting.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.119
The whiskey and vodka drinkers performed equally
well on reaction time tests but the whiskey

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.190
drinkers reported more severe hangovers.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.590
This means that one liquor doesn’t get you
more drunk than another, it’s just the total

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.000
amount of alcohol consumed that’s important.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.159
What does affect hangovers though are the
congeners in the liquor.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.720
Congeners are byproducts of the fermentation
process and include tannins, acetone and acetaldehyde.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.189
Dark liquors have way more congeners, and
the whiskey used in the study had 37 times

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.020
the congeners the vodka had.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.149
What about that old chestnut, “beer before
liquor, never sicker; liquor before beer,

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.149
you’re in the clear?”

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.159
While that may be true, it’s not because
of some magical combination of the two liquors

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.590
inside you that depends on the order they
were mixed.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.960
It really has more to do with misjudging how
much alcohol is in each drink.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.009
Even diluted in a mixed drink, liquor has
two to five times more alcohol by volume than

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.009
beer.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.180
So when people start with a mixed drink and
then switch to beer, in essence they’re

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.590
tapering off and letting their liver catch
up.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.939
Conversely if they start with a beer and switch
to liquor later in the night, they’re stepping

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.220
on the gas without realizing it, since they’re
probably finishing drinks at the same rate.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.909
And because people often attribute the last
thing they drank to doing them in, they think

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.840
it’s the liquor that brought them to worship
at the porcelain altar.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.850
So these holidays if you want to avoid a nasty
hangover and stay off the naughty list, you

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.280
can mix drinks but stick to clear liquors
and watch your overall alcohol intake.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.970
If you’re a super lightweight and light
up like Rudolph’s nose when you drink, you’re

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.970
not alone.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330
Chastity might have some info to comfort you
here.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180
Do you have a favorite holiday cocktail?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.129
I’m trying to perfect my own “nuclear
mistletoe,” which is 4 parts tequila, 1

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.350
part making out, and 1 part regret.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.150
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
