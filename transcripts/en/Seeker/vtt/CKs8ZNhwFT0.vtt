00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.029
Occasionally, NASA makes the news not because
they did something super inspirational or

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.080
fantastic or crazy cool amazing, but because
people just don't get it.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.070
This is one of those times.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.770
Howdy partners, this is DNews, thanks for
coming by!

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.950
I'm Trace Dominguez.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.789
Mercury is the innermost planet in our solar
system, it's both hot and cold, and it's zipping

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.700
around the sun every 88 days -- but to be
honest, we don't know as much about it as

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.700
we'd like.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.399
So NASA launched Messenger in 2004 to explore
it -- it arrived in 2011, and has been orbiting

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.399
ever since.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.640
It's learned about volatile compounds on the
planet, its magnetic field, that there is

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.000
ice in the shadowed craters, and about the
ancient tectonic and volcanic systems that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.660
shaped the planet; among other things.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.460
But now, this week.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.460
TODAY.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.700
About an hour ago, in fact; Messenger crashed
into Mercury.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.810
On purpose.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.110
Messenger hit the planet going 12 times the
speed of sound with the force of a semi-truck

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.219
going 300 mph (483kph), and will leave a crater
the width of a basketball court.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.670
Every month or two, Mercury is hit by a meteor
about the same size as Messenger, going 10

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
times as fast; so it's not going to do real
damage.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.479
Messenger was out of fuel, and was literally
flying on fumes -- compressed helium which

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.329
wasn't designed to alter its course had been
MacGuyvered into the task to extend the science

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.759
just a BIT longer.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.670
But can you really learn something just by
crashing into a thing?

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.100
Apparently, yes!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.450
In this case, we won't know for a bitbut the
crash might provide insight into what's beneath

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.889
the surface of the planet, someday.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.240
This isn't the first probe crash by any means.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.119
Accidents DO happen, like in 1966, when humans
made their first physical contact with another

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.029
planet as Russian probe Venera 3 crashed into
Venus.

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.939
It was supposed to land and measure the atmosphere.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.729
But mostly, crashes are purposeful.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.299
Like when NASA purposely crashed SkyLab in
1979, or in 2003, when Jupiter's Galileo probe

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.179
purposely crashed into our largest planet
after a 14 year mission.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.289
Long before Galileo's crash, it released a
smaller probe which flew into the atmosphere

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.860
to test it for speed, composition, density
and temperature.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.569
When Galileo hit those clouds the friction
burned her up and the gravity and density

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.480
crushed her -- but they did it on purpose.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.200
Galileo had learned there might be underground
salt water oceans on Europa!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.030
And if they simply allowed the spacecraft
to orbit Jupiter, it could crash into those

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.031
oceans, contaminating them with Earth bacteria.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:38.840
That would be horrible, so instead they intentionally
crashed it; and now are designing a potential

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.160
Europa mission to explore those oceans.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.790
In 2005, NASA crashed into comet Tempel 1
with a washing-machine sized probe named Deep

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.790
Impact.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.819
They hit at 37-thousand kilometers per hour
watching from an orbiter nearby to capture

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.629
the science coming out of the probe.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.330
The scientists wanted to get "under the skin"
of a comet and see what they're made of.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.780
The impact was quote "bigger than expected…
it was like a mosquito hitting a 747."

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.560
This whole mission had to be a string of "that's
what she saids."

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.430
They spent months analyzing the data from
the crash, and were able to take pictures

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.370
of the comet as the tiny probe smashed into
its surface.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.720
Missions like this likely informed the Rosetta/Philae
comet mission from last year!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.700
And most recently, LADEE, and GRAIL's Ebb
and Flow have all crashed into the Moon.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.950
While the crashes themselves don't always
teach us much, you can't get data from a dead

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.950
probe, after all.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.370
So why do we crash them?

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.079
We can learn by watching the explosions, studying
the craters and tracking the results.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.939
Physics has rules, and the more controlled
variables we have in a crash the more we can

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:43.939
learn.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.109
Personally, I think there's some theatrical
ovation to crashing a probe.

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.109
Voyager is doomed to fly forever, as a space-borne
time capsule to humanity, but for other, smaller

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.090
probes… crashing is a way of saying, thank
you for the knowledge you've given, now let's

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.249
blow you up in spectacular fashion!

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.310
It seems a fitting and very final end for
any mission.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.310
What do you think?

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.989
Should we make all our space probes crash?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.010
If you could do anything with these multi-million-dollar
science projects, what would you do?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.200
And if you want to know more about expensive
science projects, did you know there have

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.980
been over 90 space telescopes launched!

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980
Why so many?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:22.800
