work on a variety of issues related to
 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.890
work on a variety of issues related to
energy systems and particularly some of

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900
energy systems and particularly some of
 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.779

I run a department at Carnegie Mellon

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490
I run a department at Carnegie Mellon
 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.220
I run a department at Carnegie Mellon
called the department of engineering and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230
called the department of engineering and
 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.530
called the department of engineering and
public policy which in addition to

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540
public policy which in addition to
 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.580
public policy which in addition to
educating undergraduates also has over a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590
educating undergraduates also has over a
 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.310
educating undergraduates also has over a
hundred PhD students all with technical

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320
hundred PhD students all with technical
 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.470
hundred PhD students all with technical
backgrounds who work on policy problems

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480
backgrounds who work on policy problems
 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.330
backgrounds who work on policy problems
where the technical details matter and

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340
where the technical details matter and
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.549
where the technical details matter and
perhaps twenty to thirty percent of them

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559
perhaps twenty to thirty percent of them
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.639
perhaps twenty to thirty percent of them
are working on energy related issues so

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649
are working on energy related issues so
 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.560

University first it's going to work on
 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.500
University first it's going to work on
trying to figure out how to use the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
trying to figure out how to use the
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.630
trying to figure out how to use the
energy we already have far more

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640
energy we already have far more
 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.430
energy we already have far more
efficiently and that will require

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440
efficiently and that will require
 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.160
efficiently and that will require
technology but it also require changes

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170
technology but it also require changes
 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.969
technology but it also require changes
in social behavior and in regulation

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979
in social behavior and in regulation
 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.489
in social behavior and in regulation
second we need to worry about how we

second we need to worry about how we
 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.939
second we need to worry about how we
find significantly additional sources of

find significantly additional sources of
 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.820
find significantly additional sources of
energy and those sources need to be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830
energy and those sources need to be
 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.930
energy and those sources need to be
clean reliable affordable and

Carnegie Mellon is very good at that and
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.860
Carnegie Mellon is very good at that and
we will move the results back out into

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870
we will move the results back out into
 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.500
we will move the results back out into
the real world in addition we will

the real world in addition we will
 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.200
the real world in addition we will
educate a large number of students who

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210
educate a large number of students who
 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.810
educate a large number of students who
can go out into the world and and have

can go out into the world and and have
 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.760
can go out into the world and and have
big impact on the way in which we

big impact on the way in which we
 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.120
big impact on the way in which we
develop and use energy resources we'll

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
develop and use energy resources we'll
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670
develop and use energy resources we'll
do a variety of things in outreach that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680
do a variety of things in outreach that
 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.330
do a variety of things in outreach that
is both for expert decision-makers and
