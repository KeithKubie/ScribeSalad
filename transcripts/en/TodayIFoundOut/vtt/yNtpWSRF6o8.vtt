00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:15.900
Myth: Lemmings commit mass suicide.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.560
So when did this myth get started?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.289
Well, nobody knows exactly, but it was a 1958
documentary by Disney, which won an Academy

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.749
Award, by the way, that appears to have popularized
the myth.

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.710
In the wildlife documentary White Wilderness,
a few dozen lemmings were imported to Alberta,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.500
Canada so that they could be filmed in their
“natural” habitat.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.260
The film makers used close up shots to make
it seem like there were thousands of lemmings

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260
migrating.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.830
They had the lemmings on a snow covered lazy-Susan
style turntable and just filmed them as they

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.830
ran.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.210
They also filmed them crossing a little stream.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.800
Once they got all the shots they needed, they
then used the turntable to launch the lemmings

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.410
over a cliff into a river and filmed this
in the same way, making it seem like a mass

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.840
lemming suicide was taking place.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.550
The next scene was of the dead lemmings floating
in the water.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.650
The theory behind why they would commit this
mass suicide, as explained by narrator Winston

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.840
Hibler, is that they get worked up from the
frenzy of running with all the other thousands

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.260
of lemmings: “A kind of compulsion seizes
each tiny rodent and, carried along by an

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.260
unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step
for a march that will take them to a strange

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.730
destiny.”

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.090
He then proceeds to explain how they are approaching
the sea, which is actually just a river because

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.800
Alberta is landlocked; at which point, driven
by their hysteria, they cast themselves into

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800
the sea.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.600
None of this is true.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.630
Lemmings actually prefer to be on their own,
only getting together to mate when food is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.630
plentiful.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
However, lemmings can literally go from massively
overpopulated in a certain area to near extinction

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.330
within a couple year period and then back
to massively overpopulated very quickly.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.150
This actually happens in a semi-regular cycle
of about three to four years and, to date,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.810
nobody knows exactly why.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.609
The standard theory is that it simply has
to do with available food sources, predators,

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.749
and the harsh environment they live in (often
in extremely cold regions like Northern Alaska

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:10.829
and the like).

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.010
When the lemmings are in the upswing where
they are massively overpopulated, they tend

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.829
to go into a phase where they like to spread
out and disperse to new areas where food is

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.299
more plentiful and there is less competition
for that food.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.269
When this dispersal to new areas happens,
they can sometimes appear to be traveling

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.379
in large groups.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.609
But this is just because there are so many
of them, they aren’t actually traveling

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.609
together.

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.129
It’s a dispersal, not a migration.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.659
When they are dispersing, they often do find
themselves in the water.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.569
But here’s the thing.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.379
Lemmings can swim.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.540
And actually, given their size (about the
size of a mouse or hamster), they can swim

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.299
a pretty incredible distance (about 200 meters
or around 600 feet).

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.900
So in their quest to spread out, they will
occasionally choose to try to swim to another

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.370
place and many die in the attempt, only to
be washed up on shore later.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.709
There are even documented cases of this where
massive numbers of them will drown in the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.439
attempt to reach a shore that was too far
for them or if the water was too choppy, they

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.200
can die from that, even though the distance
wasn’t too far.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.700
When enough of them try to disperse to whatever
far shore and fail, the dead lemmings will

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.749
pile up on the beach, perhaps giving the impression
they committed mass suicide in some sort of

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.019
frenzied group migration.

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.940
In addition, shortly after this population
explosion happens, their population begins

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.150
a very steep decline to near extinction, probably
giving credence to the fact that all the lemmings

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.560
banded together and migrated to their deaths
in the water.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.040
In any event, it is often cited that it was
this Disney documentary that started the myth,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.920
but that is not the case either.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.889
There is a reference to huge numbers of lemmings
jumping off cliffs from a 1954 American Mercury

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.529
article, which is a full four years before
Disney’s documentary came out.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:01.809
On top of that, there was a 1955 comic by
Carl Barks titled “The Lemming with the

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.639
Locket” that portrayed the same type of
thing.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.230
All of that aside, the people working on the
documentary took their job very seriously,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.870
so they wouldn’t have just made something
up like that; they clearly thought it was

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.870
true.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.199
It was very common back then, and to a much
lesser extent today, for people making nature

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.210
documentaries to simulate or force actual
wildlife events like this by making the animals

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.159
do what was needed of them for the shot.

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.159
This was just a case of the film makers thinking
this was true about lemmings, so making it

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.159
happen so they could film it.

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.090
As to how far back the myth goes before the
Disney documentary, nobody knows, but it is

00:04:30.090 --> 00:05:11.930
pretty clear that at least it was around before
this documentary began filming.
