00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.140
David, do you know about
these three animals?

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.019
Were you able to answer this question?

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; So, admittedly, I used Wikipedia
a little bit to find out some of these

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.210
answers, but we know that eagles lay
eggs, bluebirds lay eggs, penguins.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.840
They all lay eggs, and
they all have wings.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.410
Eagles and bluebirds have talons,
whereas penguins kind of more have

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.430
flippers because they swim, so
they don't really have talons.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.990
All right.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.720
Eagles and bluebirds also fly,
whereas penguins don't fly.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.930
None of them have fur and
we might say that eagles and

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.870
penguins are large whereas
bluebirds are not very large.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.275
Our definition of large
is kind of variable,

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:36.220
it's kind of subjective, but if we were
to draw lines somewhere, it's reasonable

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.240
to say that bluebird is definitely
on the smaller end of the spectrum.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.280
&gt;&gt; Good David, you know more
about those animals than I do.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.750
Imagine that the three animals were
given as examples, one after the other.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.726
So, we are back to incremental concept
learning of the previous lesson.

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:54.300
One can use the techniques that
we learned in the previous lesson

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.130
to learn some equivalence class,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.890
learn some concept definition
with the three animals.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.590
But that's not the point here, the point
here is not about the learning of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.319
the concept, the point here is much more
about the nature of the concepts and

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.152
how they get organized
related to each other
