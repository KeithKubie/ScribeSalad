00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:05.366
Sal: In the previous video we
talked about how an ATP molecule

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:09.900
can, in the presence of water,
hydrolysis will take place,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.833
and one of the phosphoryl
groups could be plunked off,

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.567
and how that would release
energy because these electrons

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:18.269
are going to be able to go
into a lower energy state.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.634
You could imagine that this
was already not that stable

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:28.233
of a bond, that all these
negative charges wanted to get

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.766
away from each other, and
once this is plunked off,

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.300
then of course when they get into a more

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.766
comfortable state energy is released.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.100
But you might say, "I want
more. I want to actually see

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.863
"the mechanism by which the
hydrolysis takes place."

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:44.367
That's what I'm going to do in this video.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.833
Let's start with our ATP molecule,

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.867
and let's throw some water in there, H2O.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.801
Let's say this is water right here,

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.033
oxygen with two hydrogens.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.366
I'll do the two pairs
of oxygen that aren't in

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:04.100
bonds right over here,
in the outermost shell.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.469
Actually let me draw one more
water molecule right over here.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.701
There's multiple way that you could

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.200
actually depict this right over here.

00:01:13.384 --> 00:01:16.402
Let's say that one of these,

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:18.300
let's say this water molecule right here,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.967
and obviously no chemical
reaction happens this cleanly.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:24.500
This is showing how it
could happen if they just

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.100
bump into each other
in the exact right way.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.766
This has got this pair of electrons.

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.966
Let's say this pair of
electrons is essentially

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.700
given by this oxygen to
this hydrogen proton.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
We could draw it like this right there.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.433
It nabs just the hydrogen, then
both of these electrons that

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.966
are in this pair, that are
in this bond I should say,

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:50.833
go back to the oxygen to form,
essentially you could think

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:53.900
of this as a pair of electrons
attached to that oxygen.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.367
Then that gives the oxygen
license to allow these

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:04.167
two electrons to form a
bond with the phosphorous.

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:07.233
The phosphorous isn't in
the mood to form six bonds,

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.115
it's already got five, and this is

00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:11.100
a fairly uncomfortable situation for it.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.034
That allows these two electrons
right over here to go,

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:19.866
these two electrons to go to
this oxygen, just like that.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.634
As a result of everything
I've just depicted

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.366
happening, what does it look like?

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.499
Let me draw a little arrow here.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.100
Now you're going to have
your adenosine diphosphate.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.961
Let me put it over here.

00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:40.192
And just to be clear,
this thing has now gained,

00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:43.100
this oxygen right over here,
one way you can think about it,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.033
it was party to a bond so it
was sharing two electrons.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.766
Now it's getting both of the electrons,

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.567
so now it's going to
have a negative charge.

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:55.700
It had half of-- Actually it
had a little bit more than half,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.366
it's more electronegative
than the phosphorous.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.767
Now it's going to get both of them.

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:05.166
Now this is going to
have a negative charge.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:08.033
This is the adenosine diphosphate.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:12.033
This phosphoryl group over
here, let me just redraw it.

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.033
It's going to look like this.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.366
Double bond to that oxygen.

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:22.433
You have this oxygen right
over here. That's there.

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.700
You have that oxygen right over there.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.766
And of course the water, the
water molecule, or I guess

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:33.166
now it's just going to be
an OH group, is going to be,

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:37.701
it has ... Let me see if I can
make the colors interesting.

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:41.966
These two electrons have now
formed a bond and you have

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:46.834
the oxygen and of course
this hydrogen here.

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:49.033
I haven't draw in any other oxygens but

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.767
this thing still has two lone pairs.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.566
And of course you have this character

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:58.766
right over here, who gained a proton.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.033
This one you can depict like this.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.500
It's oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.900
It had one lone pair, but now it gave half

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.233
of this lone pair to form
a bond with that hydrogen,

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:14.300
and hydrogen without an
electron is just a proton.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
Actually let me draw it like
this just so you can see it.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.300
These two are now the
two electrons in this

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.633
bond with this, with this hydrogen proton.

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:31.433
This right over here, this
is a positively charged,

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:35.766
this is a positively charged
molecule right over here.

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:38.100
And you can imagine
maybe this thing breaks

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.900
off and it could be viewed as a proton,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.966
or you could view this as a
positive charged molecule,

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:46.033
but either way this is the
reaction that we just depicted.

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:50.566
You have ATP being,
hydrolysis takes place.

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:55.100
You're left with ADP, you're
left with a phosphate,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.767
a released phosphate molecule,

00:04:57.767 --> 00:04:59.833
and then you're left
with a positive charge.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.500
You could either view this
as kind of a proton or the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.501
proton attaches and forms a
hydronium ion right over here.

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.367
And of course in the process
of doing all of this,

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:14.700
as these electrons got
into a more comfortable

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.300
situation just sitting
right over here and allowing

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.133
this thing to break
off, it releases energy.

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:29.300
It releases, it releases energy,
which is in most biological

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.201
systems the whole point of
having the ATP molecules around.
