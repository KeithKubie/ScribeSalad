00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.600
How can you play a Rubik's Cube?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.226
Not play with it, 
but play it like a piano?

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:15.911
That question doesn't 
make a lot of sense at first,

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:20.640
but an abstract mathematical field
called group theory holds the answer,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.609
if you'll bear with me.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.719
In math, a group is a particular 
collection of elements.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.545
That might be a set of integers,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.473
the face of a Rubik's Cube,

00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:32.075
or anything,

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:36.571
so long as they follow 
four specific rules, or axioms.

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.059
Axiom one:

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.677
all group operations must be closed
or restricted to only group elements.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.601
So in our square, 
for any operation you do,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.748
like turn it one way or the other,

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:52.031
you'll still wind up with 
an element of the group.

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:53.666
Axiom two:

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:57.996
no matter where we put parentheses
when we're doing a single group operation,

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:00.599
we still get the same result.

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:05.040
In other words, if we turn our square
right two times, then right once,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.058
that's the same as once, then twice,

00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:12.586
or for numbers, one plus two 
is the same as two plus one.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:14.254
Axiom three:

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:18.855
for every operation, there's an element
of our group called the identity.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.290
When we apply it 
to any other element in our group,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.449
we still get that element.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:26.857
So for both turning the square
and adding integers,

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.267
our identity here is zero,

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.777
not very exciting.

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:33.225
Axiom four:

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:38.302
every group element has an element 
called its inverse also in the group.

00:01:38.302 --> 00:01:42.253
When the two are brought together
using the group's addition operation,

00:01:42.253 --> 00:01:45.111
they result in the identity element, zero,

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.843
so they can be thought of 
as cancelling each other out.

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:52.439
So that's all well and good,
but what's the point of any of it?

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.303
Well, when we get beyond 
these basic rules,

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:57.842
some interesting properties emerge.

00:01:57.842 --> 00:02:03.041
For example, let's expand our square
back into a full-fledged Rubik's Cube.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.643
This is still a group 
that satisfies all of our axioms,

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:09.821
though now 
with considerably more elements

00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:12.073
and more operations.

00:02:12.073 --> 00:02:16.664
We can turn each row 
and column of each face.

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:19.035
Each position is called a permutation,

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:23.596
and the more elements a group has,
the more possible permutations there are.

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:28.222
A Rubik's Cube has more 
than 43 quintillion permutations,

00:02:28.222 --> 00:02:32.450
so trying to solve it randomly 
isn't going to work so well.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.864
However, using group theory
we can analyze the cube

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:41.004
and determine a sequence of permutations
that will result in a solution.

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.474
And, in fact, that's exactly 
what most solvers do,

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:49.572
even using a group theory notation
indicating turns.

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.601
And it's not just good for puzzle solving.

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:56.575
Group theory is deeply embedded 
in music, as well.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:03:00.977
One way to visualize a chord
is to write out all twelve musical notes

00:03:00.977 --> 00:03:03.642
and draw a square within them.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:08.364
We can start on any note,
but let's use C since it's at the top.

00:03:08.364 --> 00:03:12.605
The resulting chord is called
a diminished seventh chord.

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:17.193
Now this chord is a group
whose elements are these four notes.

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:21.881
The operation we can perform on it
is to shift the bottom note to the top.

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.357
In music that's called an inversion,

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:27.247
and it's the equivalent 
of addition from earlier.

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:30.169
Each inversion changes 
the sound of the chord,

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.899
but it never stops being
a C diminished seventh.

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.661
In other words, it satisfies axiom one.

00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:41.582
Composers use inversions to manipulate
a sequence of chords

00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:51.327
and avoid a blocky, 
awkward sounding progression.

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:54.768
On a musical staff, 
an inversion looks like this.

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:59.986
But we can also overlay it onto our square
and get this.

00:03:59.986 --> 00:04:04.484
So, if you were to cover your entire
Rubik's Cube with notes

00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:09.538
such that every face of the solved cube
is a harmonious chord,

00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:13.098
you could express the solution
as a chord progression

00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:16.949
that gradually moves 
from discordance to harmony

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.581
and play the Rubik's Cube,
if that's your thing.
