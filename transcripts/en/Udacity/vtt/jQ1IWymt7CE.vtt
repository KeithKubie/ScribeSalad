00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.940
In addition to computing a new position to form a piece of the sphere. I want

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.660
you to also set the normal. For a sphere centered at the origin this is

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.460
straight forward. Notice that the normal and the vector to the point both go in

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
the same direction. Take the solution from the previous vertex shading problem

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.330
and now change the shading normal to point in the correct direction. You'll

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.560
have to use a temporary normal just as you had to use a temporary position

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.735
before. I should note you don't have to normalize this shading normal as the

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.559
fragment shader will do that later.
