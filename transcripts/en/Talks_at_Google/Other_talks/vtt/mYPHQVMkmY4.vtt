[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.930
-All big ideas start with
a spark of inspiration.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.070
Add in a dose of imagination
and a story begins to evolve.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.960
As a story develops,
questions naturally

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.230
arise and lead to conversations.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.010
Conversations that
explore, enlighten,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.910
and spawn new experiments
where we ask: What can happen?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.570
What is possible?

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.890
And then share these ideas
through compelling stories

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.920
to generate a new
spark of inspiration

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.800
and the next big idea.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.270
Big ideas.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.500
Real science.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.970
Great stories.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.270
That's Project Hieroglyph.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.220
Read the book.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.620
Join the conversation.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.914
And share your ideas
for a better future

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:53.830
at hieroglyph.asu.edu.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.090
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.590
ED FINN: Today I'm
going to tell you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.760
a little bit about
Project Hieroglyph.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.810
We're going to introduce
some of the collaborators who

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.040
have been working on this
product for the past couple

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.570
of years.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570
We're going to talk a
little bit about the book.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.487
We have stacks of them
somewhere in the back.

00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:13.570
We're going to have time
for question and answers.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.980
The time for
question and answers

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.230
will come before the
time when many of you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.320
will have to leave for
your 2 o'clock meetings.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.230
And we're going end, as we
begin, with an invitation.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.650
Hieroglyph is not
something that's over.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.180
The book does not memorialize a
conversation that has wound up

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.450
and finished.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.460
Hieroglyph is very
much just starting out,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.200
and we frame the book and this
project is an open invitation.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280
So I hope that this will be
the beginning of conversations

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.830
with many of you.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.040
What is Hieroglyph?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.660
Let me start with a
little origin story.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.790
Neal Stephenson, the
science fiction writer

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.330
who's going to be up here
on stage in just a second,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.340
and the president of Arizona
State University, a guy

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.960
named Michael Crow, were at
an event in Washington, DC

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.490
a couple years ago, in 2011.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.259
Like everything else,
this is on YouTube.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.039
And Neil had recently
written an article

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.670
called "Innovation Starvation."

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.240
It was a polemic, an
argument about how

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.490
we seem to have lost our
ambition to do big stuff.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.800
Going from the Apollo program,
grand national infrastructure

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.360
projects, really big thinking
about the world and the future

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.120
to paying other countries
and companies to fly stuff

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.550
into space for us, watching
those same grand national

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.200
infrastructure projects
crumble around us,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.590
and adopting a much more
incremental notion of progress.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.560
Now, I don't blame
you guys for this.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.600
One of the reasons that
I'm excited to be here

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.380
is that I think Google is
perhaps the leading-- or one

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.530
of the most interested
institutions or entities

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.510
thinking about the
future in a more

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.580
creative and ambitious way.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.110
But, by and large,
that's not how

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.330
we've thought about the future
in, say, the past 20, 30 years.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.200
We've become increasingly
dystopian in the stories

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.320
that we tell about the future.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.900
Increasingly cynical
about what we

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.820
can do to change the world
that we're going to live in.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.970
And so Neal was
making this argument

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.980
in the context of innovation,
technological innovation,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.510
the kinds of research
and money that

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.330
gets put into
different problems;

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.540
what problems we
choose to work on.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.690
And Michael Crow, being the
sort of person Michael Crow is,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.855
said well, Neal, maybe
this is all your fault.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:34.230
Maybe the science
fiction writers

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.320
have been letting us
down because now we

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.170
have all of these
dystopian stories,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.330
and if we don't have the right
kind of optimistic visions

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.240
about the future, how are we
going to build a better world?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.390
How are we going to build
more optimistic realities?

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.450
That conversation
struck a spark,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.330
and Neal began speaking to
friends and colleagues--

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.840
science fiction writers,
entrepreneurs, technologists,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.940
creative thinkers of
many different stripes--

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.320
about a direct response.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.700
How would we create a
new kind of conversation?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.970
A new set of stories that
would be techno-optimistic?

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.150
That would take
seriously the challenge

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.570
of envisioning a future-- and
not a distant Star Trek future.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.490
A near future.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.029
An achievable future
that advances some kind

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.340
of hopeful vision of
the world while still

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.850
being technically grounded.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.990
I think Neal's
ground rules were:

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.120
no Holocaust, no
hackers, no hyper-space.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.310
And, at the same time,
Michael Crow came back to ASU

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.044
and we began talking about what
a university response might

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:44.460
be to this challenge; what an
institutional response might

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.960
be.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.070
So the Center for Science
and the Imagination

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.570
is a platform for
this kind of thinking,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.310
and we're the institutional
hosts of Project Hieroglyph.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.790
Neal is its founder.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.380
And over the past
couple of years,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.450
we've been collaborating on
what we think of very much

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.510
as a community
and a conversation

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.070
much more than it
is a book project.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.300
So on the inside, Hieroglyph
is about these collaborations.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.990
It's about creating
a feedback loop

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.120
or-- it's about fostering the
feedback loop that has always

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.030
existed between science
fiction and science.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.580
But it's about putting people
into direct conversation

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.990
and thinking about the outcomes
of this process as big ideas,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.020
science fiction stories,
but also research

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.580
or inflections to
ongoing research,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.430
changing curriculum,
public debate.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.350
And of course for every
new idea, perhaps a hundred

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.440
or a thousand others
that come out of it.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.360
A hundred or a thousand
other questions.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.943
One of the things
we quickly realized:

00:05:49.943 --> 00:05:52.720
When you begin taking the near
future in a science fiction

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.560
story seriously is that you
can't answer it-- you can't you

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.620
can't research that story or
address all of its questions

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.350
by only speaking
to one human being.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.390
Any serious moonshot idea
about the near future

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.960
requires a whole host
of different disciplines

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.610
and a really creative
approach to what

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.710
you're trying to accomplish.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.350
So on the outside,
Hieroglyph is something

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.440
we're describing as, "Big ideas.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.560
Real science.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.670
Great stories."

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.250
Grounded stories.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.680
I often call them "science
fiction of the present."

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.495
So we had guidelines
for our writers,

00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:35.370
because if you know
writers, you don't really

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.140
want to give them rules.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.330
Guidelines are much better.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.690
And one of the guidelines
was to write a story

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.075
that a young scientist or
engineer could read and achieve

00:06:45.075 --> 00:06:46.450
within her
professional lifetime.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.410
And, by and large, people
have followed that.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.430
And our other
rules-- well, excuse

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.290
me-- our other guidelines,
encouraging them

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.740
to step outside of their
comfort zones and share ideas

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.642
before they're ready.

00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:05.850
A traditional approach to
a science fiction anthology

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.630
is to say, hey,
we're writing stories

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.670
about Topic X. Do you have
a story about Topic X?

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.060
Why don't you send it to us?

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.680
And in a certain
sense, the same rules

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.820
apply for scientists
and engineers, who

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.570
are quite happy to talk about
published research things that

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.390
have been brought out
of the lab and vetted,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.460
but it's a lot riskier
to talk about ideas

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.040
that you will have only
explore in the formative stage

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.160
or that you don't know if there
are some big holes in them yet.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.370
Where you're actually taking
a risk just talking about them

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.920
before you've really had a
chance to think them through.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.220
And Hieroglyph is
about trying to create

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.810
a safe place for everybody
to do that together.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.550
For writers, scientists,
and engineers to all

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.210
kick around ideas, brainstorm,
before they're actually

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.040
ready to share those concepts
with the general public,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.170
or perhaps to share them
within a disciplinary or peer

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.980
community.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.630
So not asking writers to write
a story and come back to us

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.320
in six months, but
say, why don't you

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.540
write the story with us?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.780
Why don't you collaborate
with us online?

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.930
And most of it has happened
online, on the Hieroglyph

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.890
website, and that's
where we want

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.200
to continue having these
conversations in the future.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.120
Neal has engaged in some
prior collaborative projects

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.320
like this. "The Mongoliad"
is one well-known one.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.890
And when I asked Neal how he
did the collaborative writing

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.980
for "The Mongoliad"--
which is this big, online,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.420
very community-centric
narrative universe--

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.490
it emerged that there was
a big room with whiteboards

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.351
and swords in it.

00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:35.934
And that's where the
writing happened.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.549
If we did that, I think we would
lose something of this project.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.390
It would no longer be the kind
of broadly public endeavor

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.170
that we want it to be.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.460
ASU is an unusual
university not just

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.110
because it does weird
things like this.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.400
It's most unusual
because it defines itself

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.635
by who it includes rather
than who it excludes.

00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:02.010
And if you think
about it, that's

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.100
probably the single-most
radical thing

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.230
that a higher education
institution in the US

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.509
could do these days.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:11.050
And so if we're
going to follow that,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.930
then we can't depend
on co-location.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.650
We can't depend on
personal invitations.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.220
We can't depend on putting
people into a room together

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.460
who have the time and
the energy to be there.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.780
We need to throw open the
doors in a much more ambitious,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.310
maybe risky way.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.490
For us, for the Center for
Science and the Imagination,

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.062
this is about a lot of
different objectives.

00:09:34.062 --> 00:09:35.770
Getting a book out of
there is one thing,

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.360
but for us, again, it's
really just a beginning.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.110
It's about inspiring
broad public conversation.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.190
It's about understanding
the circulation of ideas

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.790
across very different fields,
very different systems

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.670
of imagination, which is an
ongoing research project.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.950
And it's about
changing the world.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.690
Having an impact with ambitious
projects and inclusive stories.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.220
Stories that don't
depend on a particular

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.580
political or
technological standpoint.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.320
Stories that envision
ambitious, radical change

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.420
in near-Earth orbit on
a voyage to other stars

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.000
but also right here
on planet Earth.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.990
Stories about social change,
cultural change, as well as

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.810
technological and
technical change.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.170
So we have a number of new
projects kicking around

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.270
in Hieroglyph.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.470
We have a collaboration
with the World Bank

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.340
and other major
institutions, called

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.680
EVOKE, which is about
social entrepreneurship

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.680
and getting young people
in the developing world

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.530
to take a stronger
sense of agency,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.510
feel empowered to create a
new story in their own lives.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.620
We have an ongoing effort
around climate futures

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.590
and the imagination,
trying to come up

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.660
with more optimistic, engaging,
exciting, happier visions

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.550
of sustainability and
what the world might

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.650
look like in the near future.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.870
And also, a related project
on science and science

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.710
fiction-- the feedback loop
between popular imagination

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.350
and technical progress.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.500
So for the next
less than an hour,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.170
we will explore a few of
these ideas circulating

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.120
through Hieroglyph, and
I hope engage all of you

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.880
in the conversation.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.420
I'd like to introduce
Neal Stephenson and Keith

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.230
Hjelmstad to talk about
their collaboration

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.320
on "The Tall Tower."

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.230
Neal Stephenson is an author
of historical and science

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.900
fiction, a technology
consultant, and the founder

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.130
and principal provocateur
behind Project Hieroglyph.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.710
He's the author of the
three-volume historical epic,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.770
"The Baroque Cycle" and
the novels "Reamde,"

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.890
"Anathem," "Cryptonomicon,"
"The Diamond Age," "Snow Crash,"

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.620
"Zodiac," and coming
soon, "Seveneves."

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.720
He lives in Seattle, Washington.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.220
Keith Hjelmstad is a professor
of structural engineering

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.360
in the School of
Sustainable Engineering

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.670
and the Built Environment
at Arizona State University.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.470
He is the author of
the book "Fundamentals

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.600
of Structural Mechanics" and
serves as an associate editor

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.100
of the "Journal of
Constructional Steel Research"

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.010
and the "ASCE Journal of
Structural Engineering."

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.400
His research focuses on
computational mechanics,

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.710
earthquake engineering,
stability of structures,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.330
non-destructive evaluation
of large structures--

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.280
which is really less fun
than destructive evaluation

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.400
of large structures--
and numerical simulation

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.810
of complex structures.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.290
Please join me in
welcoming them.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.320
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Given the audience,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.060
I'm eager to get
to the fundamentals

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.360
of structural mechanics
as soon as we can,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.620
so I'll make a
brief introduction.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.010
I actually talked about the
"Tall Tower" idea a year

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.910
and a half ago at
"Solve for X," which

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.970
was the first-- as far as I
know-- the first conference

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:53.680
that I was told about that
was organized by Google X.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.790
And I did that in the world's
slowest after-dinner talk.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.560
It's a talk that,
if you find it,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.100
you should watch with your thumb
on the fast forward button.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.160
Lots of majestic pauses.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.120
I'm going to-- I bolted some
coffee before we started here,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.730
and I'm going to try to get
through this a little faster.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:21.970
"The Tall Tower" is both a real
idea and a kind of meta-idea.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.250
It's sort of the first idea
we wanted to talk about

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.790
with Hieroglyph because it's
an example of the kind of thing

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.960
that makes a good choice.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.670
It's very easy to
explain, simply,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.650
"Let's build something
really tall."

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.030
It's an old idea.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.350
It's not my idea.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.110
It's something very visible
that anyone can kind of see in

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.120
their minds eye and
start thinking about.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.840
For me, it emerged from some
papers written about 10 years

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.920
ago by Jeff Landis, in
which he pointed out

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.810
that is should be
possible to build really

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.890
tall structures out
of plain old steel.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.360
And by "plain old," I
don't mean, necessarily,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.550
hardware store steel.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.920
But I mean relatively
high-quality steel

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.700
that is obtainable today.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.330
Not super-fancy new materials.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.030
And so I began doing
some work on that,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.360
sort of performing some
simple calculations that

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.770
were kind of within
my comfort zone,

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.830
and rapidly reached the limits
of what I could really do.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.350
Because when you
begin to figure out

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.840
the stresses that are involved
in a structure of that type,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.280
it rapidly becomes
obvious that it has a lot

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.590
to do with wind loading
and other things that

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.600
go beyond my freshman
physics level of competency.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.820
So through the good
offices of Michael Crow,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.830
I was able to get in
touch with Keith Hjelmstad

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.550
here, and begin a conversation
about actually making

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.340
some more legit calculations
about what this thing would

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.800
have to look like structurally.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.570
So that was probably a
couple of years ago now.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.630
Probably exactly a
couple of years ago.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:14.780
And so Keith began with
sort of a-- well, maybe

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.160
I should-- since I'm starting
to falter and stagger around,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.370
maybe I should let Keith
take over for a second

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.746
and talk a bit
about what he did.

00:15:23.746 --> 00:15:25.120
KEITH HJELMSTAD:
Yeah, so there I

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.810
was, minding in my own
business, and I get this call

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.440
from Neal Stephenson asking
about a 20-kilometer tower.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.710
Actually, I think he
was worried about the 20

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.120
and he asked about
a 15-kilometer tower

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.320
as if that was going
to calm me down at all.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.900
But I've been a
structural engineer now

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.440
for about 40 years,
and frankly, I really

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.330
hadn't given a lot of thought
to "How tall could we go?"

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.400
And I was immediately kind
of struck by the idea.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.670
I'm not a real engineer.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.470
I'm an engineering professor.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.690
And so I think that gives
me a little bit more freedom

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.590
and license to
explore crazy ideas.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.970
That's why I didn't hang
up on you the first call.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.590
But I started out with
a pretty simple model.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.950
At that time, I
did not really know

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.890
whether this was even possible.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.500
So we've got a pretty
hefty gravity well here,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.870
and I looked over the
papers-- the Landis papers--

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:30.480
that he sent me, and tried
to replicate that calculation

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.210
but noticed that the main
thing that there was missing

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.380
from that calculation
was the stability thing.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.000
You can't just make a really,
really long, skinny thing

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.821
and expect it to stand up.

00:16:41.821 --> 00:16:43.070
It's probably going to buckle.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:48.270
But if you give it some width,
then maybe it will stand up.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:53.650
And so I started out with some
pretty simple calculations.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.150
Got

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.230
To a certain point
where I think I

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.910
was convinced that
it was possible.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:04.380
And really it needed
more detail to it.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.000
When you get into a
structure like that,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.847
there's no precedent.

00:17:08.847 --> 00:17:10.430
In fact, that's one
of the things that

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.210
was quite attractive
to me, because

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:18.319
in structural engineering we
live in a world of regulation

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.504
and building codes.

00:17:19.504 --> 00:17:24.030
And in my view,
they've all but killed

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.960
the creativity in structures.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.490
And here was something
that just wasn't

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.880
covered by any of those things.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.660
In fact, there
isn't even a chapter

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.450
in "Fundamentals of Structural
Mechanics" that covers this.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.970
It was sort of new ground.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.490
But then I developed
a few more models,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.450
some more advanced,
detailed models.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.910
We ran into the problem of wind.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:55.940
For those of you who are
structural engineering

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.800
interested-- around
here, earthquakes

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.330
are a pretty big deal.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.340
But when you build high
enough, earthquakes

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.240
aren't really that
much big of a deal.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.410
The wind is really
the main thing.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.380
And if you build
20 kilometers high,

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.420
you poke up into the
jet stream, and the wind

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.610
gets pretty intense up there.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.730
We don't know very
much about it.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.520
And back to the comment about
how one person can't do it--

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.550
that's where I got
a little bit thin.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.810
Even though in structural
engineering for things

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.840
that are fairly low, we
have mapped the whole world

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.870
and we can tell you how
hard the wind's going

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.286
to blow, or the
worst thing we can

00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.120
happen in the region,
and things like that.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.940
Nobody knows,
really, what's going

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.240
to happen in the jet stream.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.560
And so that was kind
of the main thing,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.470
and sort of where
we've gotten to.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.410
We did have a model
of it, and the designs

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.250
were predicated on that basis.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.592
But it's a pretty limited model.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.800
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah,
there's an interesting problem

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.740
you get into with-- what's
the granularity away

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.530
at which you're
sampling the winds.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:10.420
The data that you can get
tends to average over both time

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.270
and space, and so you
can find a data point

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.230
saying that the maximum
wind at a certain height

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.590
at a certain time of year
is such-and-such meters

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.230
per second.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.920
But that doesn't
tell you anything

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.600
about bursts that may occur
over a short span of time;

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.410
about how it may change
dynamically and perhaps get

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.060
oscillations happening
within the structure.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.110
It tends not to cover
vertical movement at all.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:52.820
And it doesn't cover small cells
within the larger structure,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.760
where you may have kind
of anomalous conditions.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.100
So the problem begins to turn
into a really interesting

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.780
problem of: how do
you-- first of all,

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.290
just how do you get the data?

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.970
What would you
have to do in order

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.660
to obtain enough
data about the wind,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.250
to find enough level of spatial
and temporal granularity,

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.190
to actually be able
to build a legit model

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.600
of a tower this tall.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.960
And it turns out that
we're nowhere near

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.430
having the kind of data that
we really need for that.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.270
So that's kind of an
interesting problem

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.160
for potential
future exploration.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.810
You can imagine
sending up-- you can

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.170
imagine sending up small
gliders that would just

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.680
fly around and gather data.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.930
You can imagine a
program using balloons.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.190
Right now, the way we do it
is that in about 100 places

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.850
in the country,
twice a day, they

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.610
send up a helium balloon
with a sonde on it,

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.140
and it records some
data as it goes up

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.500
and then it falls down again.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.660
So that's the granularity
we've got now.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.760
And you can imagine
how far that is

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.300
from what we would need
to actually model this.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.170
So one of the
directions that we went

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.360
was to think in terms
of actually using

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.220
the forces of aerodynamic
lift in our favor.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.540
The idea being that
if all you're doing

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.510
is pushing back against the
wind with the downwind leg

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.090
of the structure, then it
gets very heavy, very fast.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.875
And so why not have some
lift-generating surfaces

00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:25.900
that you could deploy on
whichever side happens

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.680
to be downwind at
the moment that

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.080
would use the force of the
wind that's trying to knock

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.600
the tower over to
lift up on that side.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.700
And then of course you get
into further discussions of how

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.830
quick would that
control service have

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.880
to respond to changes
in the weather,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.620
and so on and so forth.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.310
KEITH HJELMSTAD: And
that was actually

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.290
kind of a new idea in my field
of structural engineering.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.190
Because ordinarily we
don't build high enough

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.260
and you couldn't
make enough use of it

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.840
where that would be a factor.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.330
And so this is kind of
a-- it's a new concept.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.570
Whether this actually
would work or not.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.250
Probably we need to sharpen
our pencils a little bit

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.840
and figure out a
few more things.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:15.150
But one of the things that's
true about the tower-- it's

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.090
infrastructure in
search of a place to be.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.700
And one of the things that
we talked about a fair amount

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.070
was where should you site it?

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.110
Could you get it out of
the path of the jet stream?

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.600
And if you did,
would you wind up

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.970
in a politically unstable
part of the world,

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.070
like the equatorial regions
and things like that?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.800
The other part, which
I think is harder

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.100
to wrap your mind around,
is if you build such a thing

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.290
it's going to be there for
a very, very long time.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.740
And it has to stand up to
absolutely everything that

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.800
comes its way for
all of that time.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.150
You can't have a burst,
then it's like, oh,

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.930
we dodged that one.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.120
Mother Nature doesn't ever
let you dodge any hazard.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.800
And so thinking about how
many years-- a hundred years,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.990
a thousand years-- it's
a pretty big investment.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.634
And so it's got to
endure all of that.

00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:04.550
NEAL STEPHENSON: You
want to talk a little bit

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.760
about the sort of genetic
algorithm stuff you've

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.630
got running now, and some
of the counter-intuitive

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.160
results that you've
been seeing from that?

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.800
KEITH HJELMSTAD: Yeah,
so the design problem

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.250
is kind of unprecedented.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.280
And then the question
comes up, "What

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.150
shape should the tower be?

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.640
What should it look like?"

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.510
And this was kind of an
intriguing thing for me

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.880
as well, because we do
we train new engineers

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.370
but we kind of
train them to fall

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.970
in the footsteps of
everything that's been done.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.410
And the creative process
needs to come out somewhere.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.940
And here's a case
where we actually

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.540
don't know what would be the
best shape of this thing.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.390
And it's one of
very few structures

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.520
that we're really worried
about keeping the weight down.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.100
Usually you welcome more weight,
because it anchors things.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.710
But this is-- weight's
quite a premium.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.290
And so my initial thoughts
were: You make it tapered

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.850
so it's narrow in the jet
stream and broad at the bottom

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.020
so it's stable and
doesn't want to tip over.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.350
But we've recently done
some modeling with shape

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.880
optimization, using
genetic algorithms,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.120
and we're getting some
very interesting results.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.615
Because of that, we envision
the design of the tower

00:24:19.615 --> 00:24:24.990
as being in sort of this
hyperbolic paraboloid shape.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.300
But in order to tie
all of that together,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.730
this thing covers
about 11 square miles.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.760
All the members have
to work together,

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.370
so you tie it together with
big ring-like structures

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.040
at the bottom because
the angle of the legs

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.280
are starting to splay
out a little bit.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.190
They put pretty intense
compression into the ring,

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.040
and that's unfavorable from a
structural engineering design

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.630
point of view.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.640
And so the genetic
algorithm is starting

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.060
to tell us that
wouldn't actually

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.660
be the best shape, in that it's
trying to find a shape that

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.890
doesn't cause that
unfavorable compression,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.220
working a little bit more
toward a tension structure.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.282
And I, frankly, I did
not see that coming.

00:25:07.282 --> 00:25:08.740
And I have a graduate
student who's

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.630
been trying to convince
me of this for some time,

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.824
and the arguments are
getting better and better.

00:25:13.824 --> 00:25:15.490
ED FINN: So, I think,
Keith, you already

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.760
answered my next
question, which is,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.560
what has this
collaboration changed

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.460
for you in your own
professional practice?

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.900
And we've already heard a
little bit about your students

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.810
and how radically
different this problem is

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.610
from other problems that are
set for undergrad and graduate

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.674
engineers.

00:25:31.674 --> 00:25:34.090
But Neal, do you want to talk
for just a minute as we wrap

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.130
up about what was different
about this from a writing

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.931
perspective, from other
projects that you've done?

00:25:39.931 --> 00:25:41.430
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Well, just whenever

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:46.830
you're writing hard SF, you're
typically kind of on your own

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:52.450
in terms of trying to sweat
the technical details.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.980
And so sometimes
you've got people

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:00.810
you can reach out to who can
give advice on that front,

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.670
but it frequently is
somewhat elicit-- a back room

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.680
kind of process.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.580
Because it's, in a sense--
and Kathryn can actually

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.940
speak to this a little
bit-- it's risky.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.560
It's a career risk to be, say,
a junior faculty member who

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.605
gets cited by a
science fiction writer.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.760
And so here was a case
where I had access

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.160
to Keith, who was
exactly the right guide

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.620
to be thinking about this.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.140
And it was OK for him to do it.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.436
It was being directly
encouraged by the president

00:26:36.436 --> 00:26:37.185
of the university.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:44.930
And so as you'll see if
you read the anthology,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.770
that's a pattern
that we tried-- not

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.710
"we," but the
people that actually

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.040
put the book together-- tried
to replicate in giving some

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.900
of the other writers access as
they needed it to people who

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.240
could help them with
the technical content

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.090
of their stories.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.430
So I think that's kind
of a new and good thing,

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:12.450
and something that may yield
interesting results if we

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.890
can keep it going in the future.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.020
ED FINN: So thank you both.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.130
I'm sorry that we have to
keep things so short today.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.070
But let me turn things over to
my co-editor for the volume,

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.390
Kathryn Cramer, and
she'll talk a little bit

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:29.792
about this from a science
fiction perspective.

00:27:29.792 --> 00:27:32.250
And then we'll have a couple
of other collaborators come up

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.220
to speak as well.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.290
KATHRYN CRAMER: In
July of 2011, Neal

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.370
asked me whether I was
interested in editing

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.130
a book like this.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.640
And so here we are
three years later.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.630
It took us only three
years to do this.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.560
So what Ed asked me to do
was to talk about, "Why

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.140
optimistic science fiction?"

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.120
And this sort of got-- as I was
working on it in the wee hours

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.370
last night-- it also got
a different title, which

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.320
is "Why Hieroglyph Is A Verb."

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.390
In the 1920s, Hugo Gernsback
named our genre "science

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.160
fiction."

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.930
And he described it as
an engaging narrative

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:19.970
that had science and
scientific content, and also

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.230
visionary prophecies.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.480
And ever since he
named it-- in fact,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.310
about the whole time
since he named it--

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.850
there has been, to some
extent, a debate over optimism

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.070
versus pessimism
in science fiction.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.520
And over that time, many
different binary oppositions

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.370
have come into play
in the discussion.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.710
And I made a list
of a bunch of them:

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.020
Golden Age SF
versus the New Wave.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.690
American SF versus British SF.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.930
Science fiction versus
speculative fiction.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.380
Cynics versus Pollyannas--
which comes up

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.620
a lot when we talk about
the concept of Hieroglyph,

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.650
by the way.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.680
Happy endings versus downers.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.180
Sympathetic characters
versus unsympathetic.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.350
Ideas-driven stories
versus character-driven.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.580
Clear journalistic
prose as opposed

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.240
to stylistic sophistication.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.060
Populism versus the literary.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.320
Realism versus the fantastic.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.670
And Benford's phrase,
"Playing with the net up,"

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.720
rather than fanciful fabulation.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.160
Free will versus predestination.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.490
Militarism versus pacifism--
which specifically

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.345
comes to bear on the
Star Wars defense system;

00:29:27.345 --> 00:29:29.470
there was a group of science
fiction editors-- hard

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.382
SF writers-- who
were in favor of it,

00:29:32.382 --> 00:29:34.090
and then another group
of hard SF writers

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.840
that were opposed to it.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.730
Utopia versus dystopia.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.200
Activism vs learned
helplessness.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.840
The influence of Henry
James versus the influence

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.900
of H.G. Wells.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.710
Genre fiction versus
stuff supposedly so good

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.650
that it's not SF.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.420
What is, contrasted
to what could be.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.020
Now that last pair
is the one that's

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.270
most important to
Hieroglyph A lot of them

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.432
bear, in one way or another,
on the specific stories

00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:09.140
in the book, and
there's a lot of stories

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.580
where you could say,
"Well, this is hard SF,"

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.579
or, "This belongs in
Hieroglyph because of this,

00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:14.170
but doesn't meet that criteria."

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.820
But where we really
live with Hieroglyph

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:22.480
is in the gap between
what is and what could be.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.000
Our future is full
of possibilities,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.660
and Hieroglyph invites
you to explore them.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.810
While as editors,
Ed and I want you

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.300
to have the best possible
time reading our book

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.690
and it really enjoy your reading
experience, what we really

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:41.130
care about is not so much
how you feel as what you do.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.830
In the Gernsback tradition--
in the Gernsbackian tradition,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.530
Hieroglyph is a visionary book.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.610
But Hieroglyph's goal is not
so much to predict the future

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:50.750
as to inspire.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.830
To engage writers
and scientists,

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.880
engineers, and other
creative thinkers,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.460
with science and technology's
utopian potential.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.640
The future doesn't just happen.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.450
Moment by moment, we invent it.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.340
Some of us invent
futures for a living.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.181
And I think it's--
on the one hand,

00:31:11.181 --> 00:31:12.930
there's us from the
science fiction field,

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.590
and those of you from Google
who are inventing the future

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.500
and a whole different
way, which--

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.240
I kind of enjoy that
moment right now.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.830
But if we don't
invent the futures

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.400
we want to live in,
who will do it for us?

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.930
Ursula Le Guin said, "Great
artists make the roads."

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.680
There are precursors
to Hieroglyph

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.020
that I feel we
should acknowledge.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.730
And this also, by the
way, could function

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.752
as a recommended reading
list for what else

00:31:42.752 --> 00:31:44.460
to read other than
our lovely book that's

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.010
in the back of the room.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.567
Geoff Ryman's anthology,
"When It Changed."

00:31:48.567 --> 00:31:50.650
Ryman believes that science
fiction writers should

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.180
rely less on what's
called "rubber science"

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.450
and he put scientists
together with his writers.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.680
Jetse de Vries did an anthology
of optimistic science fiction

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.320
called "Shine" in 2010.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.630
And then, I'm not
sure if you guys

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.330
have a subscription to "Nature"
here, but now the futures

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.032
column in "Nature,"
founded by Henry Gee.

00:32:12.032 --> 00:32:13.490
I've published
three stories in it,

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.160
and in general it's
a terrific series.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.870
And just by coincidence,
"Natures 2,"

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.780
their second collection, also
came out yesterday, in addition

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.270
to Hieroglyph.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.460
And then MIT's
"Technology Review"

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.130
occasionally publishes SF.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.795
And then there's SF short
stories sponsored by Intel,

00:32:35.795 --> 00:32:38.860
and a program run by
Brian David Johnson.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.700
And another precursor
to Hieroglyph

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.020
is the design fiction
movement with which

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.440
Bruce Sterling is associated.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.980
And while we were
doing this anthology,

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.750
Gregory Benford,
who's in our book,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.370
was also doing an anthology
called "Starship Century,"

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.720
which focused on space travel.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.480
That was sort of
edited in parallel,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.870
and there is a certain
amount of overlap and content

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:05.170
in both stories and, I think,
at least one illustration.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.840
And then there is the discipline
of Foresight Studies, which

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.440
both Madeline Ashby and
Karl Schroeder studied

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.260
in graduate school.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.030
And then of course there
are the individual authors,

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.950
such as Kim Stanley
Robinson, who've

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.190
been writing this way all
along, without needing

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.485
us to tell them to do it.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.280
In 1978, when I was in high
school, my father, John Cramer,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.770
became a science columnist for
his favorite science fiction

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.870
magazine, "Analog," which was
formally known as "Astounding"

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.280
when it was edited
by John W. Campbell.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.680
"Astounding" was the flagship
magazine of Golden Age science

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.480
fiction.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.730
And by the way, when Neal
was invoking Heinlein, Clark,

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.380
and Asimov-- the sort of
Holy Trinity of hard SF,

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.020
we're talking Golden Age AF.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.910
When my dad was an
undergraduate at Rice,

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.000
he submitted his first attempt
at stories to Campbell.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.560
And this was very
meaningful to him

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.010
later, when he was nominated
for a John W. Campbell

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.840
Award for his hard science
fiction novel, "Twistor."

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.670
And when I became a science
fiction editor in the 1980s,

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.690
that was the job I wanted.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.870
But unfortunately
for me, Stan Schmidt

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:16.600
retained that job from the
1970s up until two years ago.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.120
He only just retired.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.830
So instead, I edited
about 30 anthologies,

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.179
including two hard
SF anthologies,

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:27.830
"The Ascent of Wonder" and
"The Hard SF Renaissance."

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:32.500
In August of 1967, my parents
through a farewell party

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.969
for a man who was leaving
Seattle to go to Mars.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.320
Yes, Mars.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.770
I remember the condensation on
the glasses of the adults' gin

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:47.510
and tonics, how the
condensation bent the light.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.590
And him leaning
against the dishwasher,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:52.790
talking about training
to become an astronaut.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.670
I was five years old.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.310
Joe Allen was leaving the
University of Washington

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.410
nuclear physics
laboratory, where

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.900
he was a postdoc, to join NASA
as one of the first scientist

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.650
astronauts.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.450
There would be Apollo
missions, which

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.430
would be followed by
laboratories on the moon,

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:14.094
and then there was to
be a mission to Mars.

00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:17.800
You know he never got there.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.100
Nor did he get his
lunar laboratories.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.280
But he did get to space.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.510
We are asking science
fiction to change.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.080
We are asking for a
science fiction that

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.770
won't hang back
and talk to itself,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.170
but instead will leap
at the opportunity

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.090
to change the world
in the future.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.390
Like all writers who come here,
we want you to read our book,

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.670
and we want you to tell your
friends and even your enemies.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.640
But we also want more of you.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.830
We want you to participate
in the Hieroglyph community

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.250
and imagine better futures.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.042
We want you to think
about infrastructure.

00:35:56.042 --> 00:35:57.500
Which is, I think,
by the way, what

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.560
this book is
fundamentally about.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.750
Hal Clement, when asked why
his stories lacked villains,

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:09.430
replied that the Universe
was antagonist enough.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.690
Think long term.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.510
Think survival, not just
for us as individuals,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.060
but for humanity as a species
and for the species that

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.370
are on this Earth with us.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.800
We are on the surface
of a planet right now.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.760
And astronomy teaches
us how rare and precious

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.200
is this Earth.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.250
Let us learn how to remain.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.600
Our book is the beginning
of a project, not the end.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.560
We want to do more
books, but also we

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.560
aim to broaden the project
to reach many more people.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.370
We would like to work
further with NASA.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.080
We would like to work on
subject areas such as climate

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.130
change, sustainability,
genomics.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.500
We would like to expand to
novels, graphic novels, TV

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.600
and film, while at the same
time producing tangible research

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.340
results.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:04.100
We hope for your help
and your support.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.510
Hieroglyph isn't just
a book; it's a project.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.360
It's not just a
project; it's a process.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.720
And I will go so far
as to say, for me,

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.240
Hieroglyph has become a verb.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.090
"To hieroglyph": to
refine an idea such that

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.060
it becomes an icon in a language
for solving problems most

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.810
in need of solutions.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.710
And I'll repeat that, since
it's a little complicated.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.550
To refine an idea
such that it becomes

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.050
an icon in a language
for solving problems most

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.970
in need of solutions.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.310
This is what Neal Stephenson
does exceptionally well.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:41.200
It's why you all came here.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.440
You can do it too.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.990
Let us all go forth
and hieroglyph.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.490
Thank you.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.960
And now, I will introduce
two of our authors.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.890
Rudy Rucker here [AUDIO OUT]
short story in 1987.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:04.217
He's a science fiction, author,
philosopher, mathematician,

00:38:04.217 --> 00:38:05.800
one of the founders
of the cyberpunk--

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.580
this is dropping in and out.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.830
Is it going to stay if I talk?

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:12.200
OK-- one of the founders
of the cyberpunk movement.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.910
He worked for 20 years as a
computer science professor

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.920
at San Jose State
University and has

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.380
published a number
of software packages.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.660
His novels include
"Turing and Burroughs,"

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.470
"Jim and the Flims,"
and "The Big AHA,"

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.150
as well as "The
Wetware Tetralogy"

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:31.020
and a four-book cyberpunk series
that won two Philip K. Dick

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.270
Awards.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.300
Our other author
who's going to join us

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.740
is Annalee Newitz, who
writes about science,

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.820
pop culture, and the future.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.780
She is the editor-in-chief
of "io9," a publication which

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.050
covers science and
science fiction.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.539
She is the author of the book
"Scatter, Adapt, and Remember."

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:51.830
Is that one book or two?
"Scatter, Adapt, and Remember"

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:52.190
is one book?

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.870
ANNALEE NEWITZ: All one book.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.994
KATHRYN CRAMER: It's all
one book, "Scatter, Adapt,

00:38:54.994 --> 00:38:57.920
and Remember: How Humans Will
Survive a Mass Extinction

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.110
and Pretend We're Dead."

00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.667
Oh, no!

00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:02.000
ANNALEE NEWITZ: "Pretend We're
Dead" is a separate book.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.499
KATHRYN CRAMER:
It's not quite all--

00:39:03.499 --> 00:39:06.810
there's one-- there's an
"and" that's not in italics.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.820
I You fooled me!

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.976
ANNALEE NEWITZ: One's about
surviving, one's about dying.

00:39:12.976 --> 00:39:15.350
KATHRYN CRAMER: OK the other
book is "Pretend We're Dead:

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:18.700
Capitalist Monsters in
American Pop Culture."

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.760
And she's the co-editor
of "She's Such a Geek."

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.980
Formerly, she was a policy
analyst for the Electronic

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.610
Frontier Foundation
and a lecturer

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.770
at the University of
California-Berkeley,

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:32.710
where she received a Ph.D. in
English and American Studies.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.400
RUDY RUCKER: Hi.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.100
I recently was reading a
novel by Charles Stross,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.800
he's one of my favorite
science fiction writers,

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.560
and he was talking
about a guy who

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.950
says he has Impostor Syndrome.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.430
And I'd never heard that phrase
before, and I looked it up.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:51.110
And it's something that
some well-known people have.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.800
They feel like they're faking.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.220
So I taught software engineering
at San Jose State for 20 years

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.550
and I don't know anything
about programming.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.260
I was faking.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.150
And I've published 20 novels,
and I don't know how to write.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.740
I've been faking.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.680
And I'm in the
Hieroglyph anthology,

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.450
and I'm faking
because I'm not making

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.365
any constructive suggestions
about the future.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.720
I thought I would come
up with one specific idea

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.780
that, actually,
you could implement

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.330
using Google's technology.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.900
It would be pretty easy.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.380
It's something I
call the lifebox.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.480
And this is an idea
I've been talking

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.870
about for 20 or 30 years.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.670
Recently some people have
tried to commercialize it.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.090
And the idea is fairly simple.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:42.990
You'd like to have something
like a website that

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.710
would simulate you,
sort of like something

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.190
that passes the Turing Test.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.660
So if somebody wanted to talk
to me, they'd go to this site

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.770
and they would ask questions and
the program would answer them.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:59.500
And it would basically feel
as if they were talking to me.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.340
And I realize there's a
pretty easy way to fake it.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.270
I have a page called
"Rudy's Lifebox."

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.800
If you root around on my
blog, you can find it:

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.340
rudyrucker.com/blog.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.300
And then there's
Rudy's hyphen lifebox.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.350
And you can restrict
Google Search so it only

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:23.375
searches one website, so it
just searches all the files

00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:24.500
that are on rudyrucker.com.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.220
And I have a lot
of things up there.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.230
I posted a lot of
books, a lot of notes.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.920
And one thing I found with the
links that you get from that,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.790
if you put up a PDF,
it isn't really good,

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:42.300
because-- I don't know why
it is, something about Google

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.480
versus Adobe or something-- when
they return you a link to a PDF

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.760
document, it's just a
link to the document

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.730
and it's not a link down into
the site in the document.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.850
So it's slow.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.690
It's not a good interface.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:57.510
So because of that
I've been going

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.890
to the trouble of posting
things like-- whenever I write

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.729
a novel, I post a
book-length bunch

00:42:03.729 --> 00:42:05.270
of notes about how
I wrote the novel.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.960
While I'm writing a
novel, I write the notes

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.420
so then when I don't want to
write, I can write the notes.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.480
And then when I'm done,
I put the notes up,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.630
and nowadays I put them
up as big web pages

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.850
so that you can
search into them.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.840
And so that's-- really,
you don't need the AI.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.350
You can fake AI if
you have enough data.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.530
That's the whole thing.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:31.880
If you have maybe 10,000
pages that somebody's written,

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.380
you can always find the
right thing in there.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.000
I think they tried doing this
with the fake Phil Dick head

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.630
that they made, that they
lost on the airplane.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.170
And they had-- it would
search through his works

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.330
and find phrases.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.920
And I think this could
work pretty well.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.930
It'd be a good product.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.000
People would like it.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.430
And there are some
sleazebags trying

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.732
to monetize this product.

00:42:55.732 --> 00:42:57.190
I call them sleazebags
because they

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.850
don't mention that I
had the idea first.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:04.280
But I don't care enough about
it to try to monetize it,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.790
so I'm giving you this.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:10.662
OK, so that's all I
have for right now.

00:43:10.662 --> 00:43:12.470
KATHRYN CRAMER: Annalee?

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.970
ANNALEE NEWITZ: OK, so, I
have some biotechnology here,

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:16.540
by the way.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.880
This is not actually
not technology.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.260
I just want to note
that about paper.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.540
So my idea for the
book, for Hieroglyph,

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.850
came out of the book that
I published last year,

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.430
"Scatter, Adapt, and Remember,"
which is pretty optimistic

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.060
because I talk about humans
surviving a mass extinction,

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.650
which people seemed to think
was radically optimistic

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.320
that we would make it through.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.935
And one of the solutions
that I proposed,

00:43:40.935 --> 00:43:42.994
and that lots of the
scientists and engineers I

00:43:42.994 --> 00:43:44.410
talked to proposed,
was that we'll

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.950
survive by creating
more sustainable cities.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.020
Bigger, more high-tech,
but more sustainable.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.306
So the interesting
thing about thinking

00:43:52.306 --> 00:43:54.430
about these future cities
that would be sustainable

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:57.250
is that, I think when
most of us imagine

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.270
awesome cities of the
future, we picture something

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.830
like a city that's like an
Apple watch or something

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.700
out of Tron Legacy.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.200
Right?

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.440
Like curves, and shiny
and clean and chrome.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.380
Something with soaring towers.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.570
I actually think
that's possible.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:18.720
But it's also possible that
a city of the future that

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.610
was sustainable would look
like a very ancient city.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:24.930
So let me give you an example.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.091
Let's talk about St.
Louis, because St. Louis

00:44:27.091 --> 00:44:28.590
is interesting for
a lot of reasons.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.320
For one, its
industries are highly

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.590
dependent on fossil fuel.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.940
It's a coal-based economy there.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.300
And also, St. Louis is
located right across the river

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.940
from an ancient city.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.290
It's about 1,000 years old.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:46.020
It had about 30,000
people that live there

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.100
for several hundred years.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.470
And what dominated the
horizon of the city-- which

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.440
is called Cahokia now,
and you can actually

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.620
see some of the
remains of that city

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:58.310
that weren't knocked down for
the freeway-- the city was

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:01.300
dominated by these
huge earthen pyramids.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.230
Enormous!

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.330
Basically like the
pyramids in Egypt,

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.540
but made from hard-packed earth.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.350
And so it's my
proposal that we think

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.607
about that as a kind
of a model for how

00:45:13.607 --> 00:45:14.940
a city might look in the future.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.350
And I have one
magic word for you

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.320
about how it's all
going to happen.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.540
And that word is
"cyanobacteria."

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.347
So if you're a scientist,
you might call a cyano

00:45:26.347 --> 00:45:27.430
if you're working with it.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.850
You might know it
as blue-green algae,

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.020
and you've seen it
all over the place.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.200
It's a model organism that's
used a lot in synthetic biology

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.260
because we understand a lot
of the metabolic pathways.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.530
We understand a lot of the
genetic pathways that run it.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.390
And there's actually a
lab in St. Louis, run

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.980
by a guy named Himadi
Pakrasi, that's figured out

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:52.170
a way to tweak the genome
of a certain strain of cyano

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:56.470
to produce a lot more
hydrogen than it had been.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.910
And this could be used,
putatively, for hydrogen fuel.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.920
And so I think that a future
that's-- I think that we could

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.070
start thinking about a future
where instead of investing

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.990
in new ways to suck fossil
fuels out of the planet,

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.250
we start thinking about ways
we could use synthetic biology

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.400
to alter microorganisms
to produce fuel.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.749
And I think that might be--
that killer app, killer

00:46:21.749 --> 00:46:24.040
biological app-- might be
the way we'd kind of get over

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.180
the hump in terms of
bringing synthetic biology

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.020
into our cities as
something that we could

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.130
use not just for making
fuel, which is awesome,

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.340
but also for building with.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.140
So instead of living
in houses and buildings

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.440
that are made of dead
materials like dead trees;

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.502
if you're building
anything with calcium,

00:46:44.502 --> 00:46:45.960
calcium carbonate
in it, of course,

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.020
you're building
with dead bodies.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.321
And so these are
dead structures.

00:46:51.321 --> 00:46:53.570
But what if we were building
out of living structures?

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:58.250
What if we altered plants to
do things like filter our air?

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.910
Filter our water?

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:04.270
What if we grew cyano not
just for energy production,

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.354
but to produce other kinds
of chemicals as well.

00:47:07.354 --> 00:47:09.770
And of course there's all kinds
of labs around the country

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.005
right now where this
stuff is going on.

00:47:12.005 --> 00:47:16.410
Where we're altering things like
yeast and other microorganisms

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.850
to produce chemicals
that now are

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.160
produced through messy
industrial processes.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.530
So the synthetic biology city.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.049
Let's just imagine
for minute that mound

00:47:27.049 --> 00:47:28.090
that I was talking about.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:31.170
So you're going into St. Louis.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.130
You're going to work at Google
St. Louis let's pretend that

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.630
exists.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.609
Does that exist?

00:47:35.609 --> 00:47:36.150
I don't know.

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:40.160
Anyway, so, you see
this huge mound,

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.990
which is basically
the equivalent

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.910
of a skyscraper in the city.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.200
So first of all, because it's
this mound and you've got,

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.140
say, shops in it, you have
offices, you have living areas.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.230
So it's already well
insulated, right?

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.320
Because you've got the
perfect earthen mound,

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.990
so it's going to be cool
in the summer and warmer

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.190
in the winter.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.540
It's shot through with
all kinds of tunnels

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.230
that are for bringing in fresh
air, which of course is being

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:08.540
filtered by microorganisms.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.840
You've got ways of bringing
water into the structure

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.197
so that you don't have this
problem where you're keeping

00:48:15.197 --> 00:48:17.030
water out of the structure
and therefore you

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.660
get all this water
runoff, which is

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.870
one of our big problems
with ocean acidification,

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.630
among other things.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.210
And this mound is
covered in plants.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.640
All these biologically
altered plants

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.110
that might be part of the
building's filtration systems

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.470
and part of its metabolism.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.420
And so part of what
we're thinking about here

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.420
is: What would a city be
like if it functioned exactly

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.050
like, or very similar to,
the ecosystem around the city

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:43.550
itself?

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.750
The city is becoming
its own ecosystem.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.500
A genetically
modified ecosystem,

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.570
but one that's
diverse and in balance

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.720
with the life around it.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.250
So say you're coming into work
and you see this building.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:00.930
One of the other things
you might see on this mound

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.307
is that it's not smooth.

00:49:02.307 --> 00:49:04.390
I mean, we've already said
it's covered in plants,

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.300
it's covered in some grasses
that help with water runoff.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.520
But it's also covered in a
lot of pock marks and scars.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.380
This doesn't look like the
shiny Tron Legacy future

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.369
that you might imagine.

00:49:16.369 --> 00:49:17.910
And the reason why
it looks like that

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.520
is because this is
a structure that's

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.710
being repaired constantly,
using bacteria.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.680
So say it develops
a crack, or there's

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.480
some kind of other
structural damage.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.130
You might use a form of
bacteria to repair that crack.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.370
The bacteria would
go in, replicate,

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:39.130
extrude some kind of glue,
and harden into concrete.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.870
And if you sat down at your
computer in this building,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.600
which would probably be made
with virus shells-- modified

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.590
viruses producing shells
that produce a computer

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.920
monitor for you-- that's, by the
way, being done in a lab right

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:57.040
now at MIT-- you might look out
the window of your nice office

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.900
in this mound, and see
something really extraordinary.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.700
Somebody in that future, in
this synthetic biology future,

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.830
will have taken
Stewart Brand's advice

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.870
and de-extincted mastodons.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.900
To bring them in to eat grass
and to stomp on the roads

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.890
to keep the dust down,
and maybe trim the bushes.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:17.420
And all of that,
this future where

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.570
you have a sustainable
building that functions

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:25.000
like an ecosystem, and mastodons
outside, will come from a world

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.950
where a simple tweak
to cyanobacteria

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:31.210
might usher in a future
shaped by synthetic biology.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:32.437
Thanks.

00:50:32.437 --> 00:50:34.020
AUDIENCE: So this
is great, and thanks

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.370
for doing this and coming here.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.420
Imma let you finish
and all, but I just

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.980
wanted to say in
a contrary vein,

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.930
as a field don't stop doing
the pessimistic stuff.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:50.680
Because I think as
engineers our failure mode

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.760
is we're too optimistic,
and we need somebody

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.731
to write the unit tests
that we have to pass.

00:50:57.731 --> 00:50:58.230
Right?

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:01.196
So I want to know if I'm
making a program, what

00:51:01.196 --> 00:51:02.570
are all the ways
it can go wrong?

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.695
I'm not good at thinking
of them, but you guys are.

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:06.380
So keep doing that too.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.876
NEAL STEPHENSON: Thanks.

00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:10.320
Thanks, Peter.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.640
Kathryn can actually talk
to this a little bit,

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.660
but I'll say that
there's more-- but when

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.230
I saw the stories
they came out I

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:20.660
was pleased by how
much bad was in them.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.160
People didn't go too far in
the optimistic direction.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:32.780
And indeed, my story
about the tower enlivened

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:36.470
by a giant lightning
bolt strike from a thing

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:40.740
called an upward super-bolt
that kills somebody.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:47.720
So I think the dystopian thing
has gone too deep into our DNA

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.185
at this point ever to go away.

00:51:50.185 --> 00:51:51.060
KATHRYN CRAMER: Yeah.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.710
A touchstone phrase of mine
when we were editing the book

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.080
is that one wouldn't want
to write in an airplane that

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.460
had been designed by somebody
who had never thought

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.245
of the possibility
that planes crash.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.740
So I had a question.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.110
You were talking about a
very biosynthetic future.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:13.290
Have you heard
anything more recent

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.380
about, say, cultured
meat, or anything?

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:21.390
Does that come through any
of the stories in Hieroglyph?

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:23.810
ANNALEE NEWITZ: I can't
speak to other stories.

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.540
NEAL STEPHENSON: I don't think
we have any meat stories.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.873
ANNALEE NEWITZ: No meat stories.

00:52:27.873 --> 00:52:31.350
We also don't have an artificial
womb so, what the hell?

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:34.520
But what I will
say is that I think

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.350
any kind of utopian vision that
includes synthetic biology has

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:42.430
to include some kind
of synthetic meat.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:43.990
Tissue-engineered meat.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.500
I love to think about it.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.760
In my story I do talk
about a warehouse

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.320
where they're growing
sort of sheets of meat.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.270
And I think that's-- I
mean, it's not just humane,

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:59.336
but it's also a better way to
not perturb the carbon cycle.

00:52:59.336 --> 00:53:00.710
Because, I mean,
frankly, there's

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.480
less farting if you
have sheets of meat.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:02.980
Right?

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.060
Like it's going to be a better,
more sustainable system.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no,
I definitely really

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.630
like those properties of it.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:11.980
It's not cruel.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.850
It's not--

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:16.066
ANNALEE NEWITZ: One
day it will be tasty.

00:53:16.066 --> 00:53:17.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:18.710
AUDIENCE: But then
you start getting

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.920
into problems where
it's a monoculture.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.410
You've got this whole
sheet, but it's all

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:29.630
weak to the same
bacteria or virus.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.410
RUDY RUCKER: I have quite a
bit about artificial biology

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.480
in my story in there,
"Quantum Telepathy."

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.690
And that's something that's
always interested me.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:40.600
That we could eventually
get rid of all the machines

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.230
that we have.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.840
I mean, it would be more natural
to have everything be alive.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.930
We used to talk about
nanotechnology a lot,

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.180
and really biology
is the nanotechnology

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.170
we've already got.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.860
We've really just
haven't even scratched

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.510
the surface of what we can do.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:01.390
Speaking of cultured meat,
in my novel "Freeward,"

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:06.180
there's a woman-- and I
think she's a senator--

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.480
and she produces meat
made from her own cells.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.010
It's called "Wendy meat."

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:14.600
She's very popular.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.887
ANNALEE NEWITZ: But I just want
to add that I think that as we

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:20.470
think about these features we
do have to think about how do we

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:23.790
introduce diversity
into our manufactured .

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:27.010
Biology because diversity is
what's key to any ecosystem,

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:30.010
so ecosystem engineering has
to include a focus on that.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:32.800
So that you won't have all your
meat getting the same disease,

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.654
or all your cyanobacteria coming
down with some kind of rot.

00:54:36.654 --> 00:54:38.320
ED FINN: And of course
this is a problem

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.460
with industrial
agriculture now, right?

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:45.090
We have fewer and fewer species
of that plants and animals

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:47.910
that we're relying on
to mass produce things.

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:50.940
KATHRYN CRAMER: Actually, I
want to point your attention

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.200
towards an essay that was
posted on the Hieroglyph website

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.962
a couple of days ago.

00:54:56.962 --> 00:54:58.670
I don't remember
exactly the title of it,

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.240
but it was the
solar punk manifesto

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.620
that dealt was the some
of the issues in terms

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.890
of small-scale infrastructure
as a form of resistance

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.220
to large-scale infrastructure.

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.030
And I think in that framework,
diversity in biology

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.800
is a key issue.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.070
AUDIENCE: So I was curious about
the genesis of the project.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:22.730
You mentioned that there
was a conversation about us

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.180
as a society not
thinking big anymore.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:30.912
And it made me think that I
feel like around here there

00:55:30.912 --> 00:55:32.620
are a lot of people
who are thinking big,

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.390
but our society has sort of--
we've sort of tied ourselves up

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:37.000
in knots.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.300
So, like, your super-tall
tower idea sounds amazing,

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:46.620
but around here it's illegal
to build tall buildings.

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.980
We have the anti-invention of
the high limit to deal with.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:54.280
So I'm curious why you think
the problem is that nobody

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.470
has designed the 20-kilometer
tower yet, when we can't even

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:01.170
build a 100-story
building around here.

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.430
NEAL STEPHENSON: I actually
don't think that anymore.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:06.670
I actually-- since we
started this project,

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:09.480
my thinking has been going
in the direction of, "What

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.550
actually is the
scarce resource?"

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:17.490
And my first inclination
was to believe

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.340
that the scarce resource was
clever ideas, because I think

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.510
of myself as a clever
idea kind of guy,

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.310
and how flattering
it is to think

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:27.770
that I'm what the world needs.

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.530
But it turns out that just
probably within this room,

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:36.360
there's enough clever
ideas to absorb

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.070
the gross national product
of the United States

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:42.925
for a number of years in R&amp;D.

00:56:42.925 --> 00:56:45.950
So the scarce resource
turns out to be

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:52.930
the sort of intangible things
that we need within a society

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.090
to mobilize capital
and to get these things

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:57.900
actually moving forward.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:02.460
And that then turns into an
interesting conversation about,

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.510
is it regulation?

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:07.010
Is it the legal environment?

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:11.030
Is it something to do
with how capitalists

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:14.100
assess risk versus reward?

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.820
I wish I could give
you a pat answer,

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.800
but I bet Rudy's got one.

00:57:26.217 --> 00:57:27.300
RUDY RUCKER: Well, nature.

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.966
You can always look
at what nature does.

00:57:28.966 --> 00:57:30.790
There's lots of
things competing.

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.690
And I certainly agree that
we don't want monoculture

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:35.160
with crops.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.134
It's just lots of
seething things.

00:57:39.134 --> 00:57:41.050
And people worry if you
do artificial biology,

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.580
there will be some
creature you make

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.190
that's going to be
like this super,

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:47.820
super-slime that's
going to eat everything.

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.000
But you need to keep in
mind that every living

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.990
creature on earth
has been working

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:56.650
to the very limits of its
capability for a billion years

00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:58.490
to try to dominate earth.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.720
So it's not that they are
not already trying to do it,

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.110
but they keep each
other in check.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.190
It's not like we're going
to do something better

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.020
just because we're scientists.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.560
We'll work on
something for a week

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.420
and we're not going
to-- so I think

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.300
that we can count on
the evolution of nature,

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.216
but how to take over
politics, I don't know.

00:58:19.216 --> 00:58:21.340
I have to ask, as long as
I'm here, how many of you

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.066
have read "The Circle,"
by David Eggers?

00:58:24.066 --> 00:58:26.480
Not too many people, yeah.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.810
It's sort of a "1984"
take on Google.

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:32.300
It's a real page-turner.

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.950
Makes you think twice.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.761
But enough said.

00:58:36.761 --> 00:58:39.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:39.252 --> 00:58:40.710
NEAL STEPHENSON:
One of the stories

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:44.340
in Hieroglyph, by
Karl Schroeder,

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.050
actually is about politics.

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:50.710
So he actually went there
and addressed the topic

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:54.350
of how might the way that
we prosecute politics

00:58:54.350 --> 00:59:00.390
change in the future, as
a way of actually enabling

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:03.580
it to get things done that
we're not getting done now.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.180
ED FINN: Yeah.

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.040
Another way of addressing what
you guys are talking about

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.730
is that this is about
frame narratives.

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:09.300
Right?

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.500
You can spend all the
time in the world having

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.330
the battle with the City
Council about how tall you

00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:16.110
can build stuff.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.690
But if you can come up with a
new story that's compelling,

00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:22.931
and if the people have a
different understanding of what

00:59:22.931 --> 00:59:24.680
a building is or what
we might do with it.

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.888
What if a building is a city?

00:59:25.888 --> 00:59:29.220
What if a building is
an elevator into space?

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:29.840
Right?

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.150
ANNALEE NEWITZ: What if
it's a living organism?

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:32.420
ED FINN: What if it's alive?

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:32.920
Yeah.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.680
Well, what if it's a kite?

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.720
Then that changes--
you know, learning

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.720
to see the frame narrative
and figuring out ways

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.760
you can change that
framing narrative,

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.530
that's how you overcome
these other problems.

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:50.280
It's a little bit like getting
a job in a very specific field.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.430
If you if you keep playing
the game by the rules,

00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:53.888
you're never going
to win the game.

00:59:53.888 --> 00:59:56.280
You have to learn how
to move the goalposts.

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.230
ANNALEE NEWITZ: The good news
is politics are always changing.

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:02.230
We think that there's this
sort of static narrative

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:05.400
of the bad guys always win,
or the powerful people always

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.670
crush the powerless people.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:08.600
But it's not always true.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.680
Things change a lot.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.500
Things have changed a lot
just in the past 10 years

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.370
that we've seen.

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:17.790
So we can intervene,
and things will change.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.030
And so maybe one
day, San Francisco

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.100
will be a high-density
city with tall buildings.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.370
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.620
KATHRYN CRAMER: And I
should say, on our way here

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:31.900
we saw several large signs that
said "Neal for City Council."

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.252
So maybe he'll change things.

01:00:34.252 --> 01:00:37.550
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:41.490
AUDIENCE: As kind of a follow
up to the last question,

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:44.960
the sort of canonical example
of the last really big, crazy

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.330
thing we did was
the Apollo program.

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.010
That kind of the
early '70s, which

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.750
coincides with the beginning
of the great divergence

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:57.300
and the beginning of the
fall of the public's trust

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.410
in government.

01:00:58.410 --> 01:00:59.480
NEAL STEPHENSON: What's
the great divergence?

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.480
AUDIENCE: Oh, pardon me.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.490
Between around-- from about
the time of the New Deal

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:09.677
until around the 1970s, rising
tide really did lift all boats.

01:01:09.677 --> 01:01:11.260
Everyone's incomes
kind of got closer.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.940
Poor people were better off.

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.084
After the 1970s, the gains
accrued to the very, very few.

01:01:18.084 --> 01:01:19.500
Including the
people in this room,

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.790
but not very much below here.

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.960
So do you see the
causality going--

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.340
the being interested in
doing big things going hand

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.940
in hand with her failures
a policy and loss of faith?

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.960
Which direction you see
the causality going in?

01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:37.220
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Well that's kind

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.040
of how this the
conversation started,

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.345
as a sort of
conversation between me

01:01:44.345 --> 01:01:49.060
and Crow about which direction
the causality arrow pointed.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:55.250
So I'm not going to tell you
that I know what the answer is.

01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:00.880
This is one of those
"when you have a hammer,

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.670
everything looks like a
nail" kind of conversations.

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:07.370
So the thing that I've
been kind of officially

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:11.150
certified by my civilization
as being qualified to do

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.420
is to write science fiction.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:22.580
And so if I'm given an
opportunity to do that,

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.990
and a university
president is telling me

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:29.950
that maybe it'll
help, then I'm there.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.200
I'm a happy guy.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.810
I don't know whether--
so, part of what

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:40.660
we're trying to figure out
is whether that actually

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:44.897
does have any useful
causal effect.

01:02:44.897 --> 01:02:47.230
KATHRYN CRAMER: One thing
that was interesting about how

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.040
the book turned out
is-- I mean, there's

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.770
the themes we
asked for, and then

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.820
there was what's
common in the stories

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.300
we're actually publishing.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.410
And one of the surprise
themes of the book is empathy.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.840
There's a lot of stories that
are engaged with empathy,

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.040
both just sort of thematically,
but also in some ways

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.370
as a technological problem.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.530
ANNALEE NEWITZ: But also, I just
want to add in direct response

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:16.000
to that question, what happens
when you have extreme class

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.489
divisions in a culture and the
middle class is disappearing?

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:24.780
Which has already happened
in other parts of the world.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.500
So we're just-- the US
is kind of catching up.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.990
That means that fewer and
fewer people are allowed

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:36.470
to be authorized, like Neal,
to have ideas and participate

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:42.090
in making decisions about
what a nation will do next,

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:44.730
or what a university
will fund next,

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:47.060
or what a pharmaceutical
company will fund next.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.350
And the more homogeneous
that group gets,

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.620
and the more we
exclude people from it,

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.260
the fewer and
fewer ideas we get.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.010
Because of course,
ideas-- we were just

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:56.620
talking about
diversity in nature,

01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:01.110
and I think the best ideas come
from diversity in humans too.

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:02.950
It's just good sense.

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:05.650
And so I think if
there is-- I also

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:07.494
think there's no simple
causal explanation.

01:04:07.494 --> 01:04:08.660
I think that would be silly.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.080
I wish there were.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.140
But I do think that
there's a correlation

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.780
between a difficulty
in coming up

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.250
with big ideas and a culture
that's strongly class-divided.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:22.780
RUDY RUCKER: I have one more
thing to say about that.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.240
One of the other paradigms,
besides getting the public

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.390
to chip in a very large amount
of money to make a giant tower,

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:38.780
or to map the genome, or
to build a highway network,

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.710
is more of the indie,
do-it-yourself ethic.

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:46.770
It's the old punk thing
of turning your back

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:48.580
on the authorities
and doing it yourself.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.210
And that was sort
of-- that was one

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:53.960
of the elements of
cyberpunk, is the concept

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.390
that you can have these
off-the-grid sorts of people.

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:01.610
Like Blank Reg in
"Max Headroom."

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:05.474
And they're doing it and make
it happen in their own ways.

01:05:05.474 --> 01:05:06.890
That's something
Cory Doctorow has

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:12.620
been writing a lot in his recent
books, like "Pirate Cinema."

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:17.240
And I think there's
some hope with that.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:24.970
This said, to make a really
massive, key technical

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.580
scientific breakthrough,
it's not clear

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:32.461
that Santa Cruz stoners can
do that in their kitchen.

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:36.800
[LAUGHTER] Maybe they can.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.670
Let them try.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.620
NEAL STEPHENSON:
So I'll just try

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:46.900
to quickly say there's sort of
three general ways-- paradigms

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.010
for organizing a bunch of
geeks-- that I think of.

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:56.200
And one is the hacker,
edge-dwelling kind of people,

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.340
exemplified maybe by Linux.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.480
One is the kind of Stalinist
government-funded program.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:07.430
And one is the big
company doing it.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.980
One of the interesting
things, to me,

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.870
about the results of the
Hieroglyph experiment

01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:14.527
was that there wasn't a
lot of the third thing.

01:06:14.527 --> 01:06:16.360
There wasn't even a lot
of the second thing.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.420
So there was a still a pretty
strong reliance on the outsider

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.380
hacker-type self-organizing
to make stuff.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.750
I thought it was
interesting that it seemed

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.930
to reflect a kind
of lack of vision,

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:31.400
or lack of faith in the
ability of big institutions--

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.970
be they governments or
companies-- to actually

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.700
mobilize engineers
and get things done.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.830
Which I think is funny,
because that's actually

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:46.210
where engineers are
employed and do things.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.300
But seen from the
outside, there seems

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.890
to be a lack of
faith or optimism

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:53.694
about the ability of big
companies to do stuff.

01:06:53.694 --> 01:06:55.860
ANNALEE NEWITZ: I have lots
of municipal governments

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.073
in my story.

01:06:57.073 --> 01:06:58.530
NEAL STEPHENSON: There you go.

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:02.550
ANNALEE NEWITZ: I have faith
in the municipal government.

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.900
Actually, I want to kind of--
it's rather a specific question

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.380
about the tall tower idea.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.260
I mean, in software
we kind of are

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:16.050
taught to write code that
kind of fails graciously.

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:19.420
So the question would be:
How would the tall tower

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.255
fall graciously?

01:07:21.255 --> 01:07:22.880
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Keith's all over that!

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.088
KEITH HJELMSTAD: It wouldn't.

01:07:24.088 --> 01:07:25.677
There would be a
massive catastrophe.

01:07:25.677 --> 01:07:28.260
There's no such thing as a large
structure falling gracefully.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.385
AUDIENCE: That's an excuse.

01:07:29.385 --> 01:07:30.920
You know that, right?

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.780
It will fall.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.406
But how do you make
it fall graciously?

01:07:33.406 --> 01:07:34.696
KEITH HJELMSTAD: It won't fall.

01:07:34.696 --> 01:07:35.270
Ever.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:40.860
[LAUGHTER] After the Earth
has banished all species,

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.792
there it will be standing.

01:07:43.792 --> 01:07:45.250
NEAL STEPHENSON:
In the story, just

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:51.110
to avoid worrying about it, I
stipulate that downwind of it

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:53.090
there's a big thing
that's literally

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:56.820
called "the swath," which-- the
billionaire who makes it just

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.970
buys all of that land.

01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:00.710
And so the way he
shuts people up

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.780
when they're worrying that the
tower's going to fall over,

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.170
is that he says, "If
it starts to fall,

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.920
we'll just dynamite all
of the legs on that side,

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.830
and the entire tower will
just fall like a tree

01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:13.700
down the swath, and
we'll keep the swath

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:19.550
empty in the meantime,
to minimize the fallout."

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:20.240
But that's me.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.305
That's not a legitimate
engineering contribution.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:28.850
AUDIENCE: One
thing I've enjoyed,

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:31.149
slash, struggled with
in Neal's writing

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:37.130
a lot is that it's really hard
to remember what he's making up

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.800
and what is factual.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.910
And that delight
and frustrates me.

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:44.270
And I'm wondering,
how in this anthology

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:47.540
did you-- did the writers
manage to walk that line so

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.729
closely, where you have
to keep track-- wait!

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:54.193
Did I read about that in a
novel or a science journal?

01:08:54.193 --> 01:08:55.609
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Well, that sounds

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.970
like what Rudy's been
working on with his notes,

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:04.166
his ongoing note-keeping system.

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.760
I'm terrible at that.

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:12.170
RUDY RUCKER: I do like to
have a coherent theory.

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:13.950
That's one sort
of-- you might say

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:17.090
that's one difference between
science fiction and fantasy,

01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:20.720
is fantasy you're not required
to have a coherent underlying

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.019
theory of why the
events happened.

01:09:23.019 --> 01:09:24.210
They're just there.

01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:26.830
It's sort of like X-Files.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.630
It's strange!

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:29.810
What if?!

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:33.330
But if you're writing something
that's more like hard science

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:37.870
fiction, then you make
up-- like, somebody

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:40.300
use the word, "rubber
science," or-- that's

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.200
a bit denigrating--
nonstandard science.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.540
You add on some
extra principles.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.979
I got my Ph.D. in mathematical
logics, and as I said,

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:55.050
I taught programming
for 20 years.

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:57.250
So I like the idea of
having a logical system

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.130
and either deducing
things or-- it's

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:01.520
like if you have a program,
you look at the outputs.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.960
So I like whatever
I'm doing in the story

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.330
to have an underlying theory.

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:09.580
And I don't actually start
with a theory and work out.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.880
I start with the
effects I want to see.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.180
I want to see something
really cool, like a tower.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.440
And then I want to
see people flying.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.125
And I want people to have
telepathy with each other.

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:23.250
Then I say, OK, so how are
we going to make this happen?

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:27.100
And that's-- the technical term
for what you're looking for is

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.700
what's called a
"bogosity generator."

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.810
So you get your bogosity
generator, but you make logic.

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:34.880
You build it solid.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.450
You don't just throw
together some woo-woo crap.

01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:41.950
You've got something--
you make up whatever.

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:44.583
Dark energy is great. you know?

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:48.580
[LAUGHTER] 90% of the
universe is dark energy.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.860
That sort of tells you
something, doesn't it?

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.800
90% of the universe is bullshit!

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.421
So it's all about
keeping a straight face

01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:57.670
when you're writing the story.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.730
You just pile it on and
you keep a straight face.

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:04.760
ED FINN: One of the fun things
about-- That was a good answer!

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.720
But one of the fun
things about this project

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.760
is that it's not entirely clear
whether some of these stories

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.640
are really science
fiction at all anymore.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.430
There's a story called, "Johnny
Appledrone vs. the FAA,"

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:21.230
which is about the
near future of drones.

01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:25.020
And it's not-- there's
really nothing,

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.190
I think, in the story that's
technically impossible now.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.760
And obviously,
certain people seem

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.150
to be quite
interested in drones.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.010
And Cory Doctorow's
story for the anthology

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:40.610
also involves an
area of research

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:43.740
that NASA and the European Space
Agency has funded for, I think,

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:48.480
for several years on what
I've recently learned

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.505
is called "in situ
resource utilization."

01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:52.130
What if, instead of
carrying everything

01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:55.140
you need to the moon, you
can use all the resources

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.420
on the moon or on Mars?

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.390
Other destinations?

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:02.500
To 3D print, or otherwise
fabricate the materials

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.160
that you need.

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:08.230
The most implausible
stuff in Cory's story

01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:10.140
is not that, I think.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:17.110
It's about other social features
of the near future society

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:20.200
and economic predictions
about how expensive

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.191
it will be to launch
stuff into space.

01:12:23.191 --> 01:12:25.190
KATHRYN CRAMER: One thing
about the organization

01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:27.610
of Hieroglyph as
a book, is there's

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.440
a lot more "showing
your work" in it.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.980
We have the authors
write stuff about where

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.170
they got their ideas and how
they work them out, and so on.

01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:38.800
So in a usual science
fiction anthology,

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.550
we try to hide all that stuff
so that you just believe as much

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:43.390
of it as possible.

01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:45.050
But because of the
nature of this book,

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:48.470
we exposed a lot more than
we otherwise would have.

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:51.705
NEAL STEPHENSON: That's
actually sort of a Cramer family

01:12:51.705 --> 01:12:52.205
tradition.

01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:53.038
KATHRYN CRAMER: Yes!

01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:58.200
NEAL STEPHENSON: In
"Twistor," at the end,

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.170
he adds a little
technical appendix

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.135
explaining the bogosity part.

01:13:05.135 --> 01:13:09.740
He says, well, OK, it's
all true up to page 93,

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.500
and then he gives a
complete sort of physics

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:17.290
explanation of where he departed
from something you could

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:19.439
put into a
peer-reviewed journal.

01:13:19.439 --> 01:13:20.730
MODERATOR: Last quick question.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.490
NEAL STEPHENSON: OK.

01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:23.739
AUDIENCE: So I've been told
I need to keep this quick.

01:13:23.739 --> 01:13:28.270
The thing most like near sci-fi
that I've heard of recently

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:29.020
is Bitcoin.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.360
It's kind of crazy.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.680
And I was just hoping
that you guys might

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.120
give an idea of-- is this a
step on the way towards utopia

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:37.990
or dystopia?

01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:39.627
Like, I can't--

01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:40.960
RUDY RUCKER: Neal has a Bitcoin.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.536
He showed it to me at lunch.

01:13:42.536 --> 01:13:44.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.440
NEAL STEPHENSON: Someone
gave me a Bitcoin.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.770
ED FINN: Let me channel
Karl Schroeder for a second,

01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:51.009
since his story-- he
actually got in touch with us

01:13:51.009 --> 01:13:52.550
in the middle of
production and said,

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:55.680
"I have to revise my story to
include the block chain, which

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.150
is the central
technology of Bitcoin.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:01.410
It's something I've become
quite interested in recently."

01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:04.870
But basically, Karl
is taking the lead

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:07.250
of people who are saying
Bitcoin-- don't think

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:10.240
about Bitcoin as a
system for currency.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.810
Think about it as a system for
democracy and authenticating

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:16.450
stuff through a
peer-to-peer network.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:19.900
And so he-- Neal
already mentioned

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.730
that his narrative is about the
political, potential political

01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:23.650
impact of technology.

01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:27.670
Could you solve
consensus-based decision-making

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:30.900
if you just had better
Wi-Fi and better interface

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.270
tools for getting people to
understand issues and make

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:34.580
decisions about them?

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.400
And so he really wanted to make
sure the block chain was part

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.110
of that, as another
tool that you

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:44.560
would use to authenticate a
consensus-based decision model.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.490
So I'm not so sure, but
Karl thinks it's utopian.

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.810
Thank you so much.

01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:53.010
This was great.

01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:56.060
