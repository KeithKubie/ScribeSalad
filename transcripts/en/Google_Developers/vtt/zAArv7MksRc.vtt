came out with this year?

00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:41.776
SPEAKER: Flutter.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:42.348
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:43.140
SPEAKER: Assistant.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.720
Everything about the Assistant.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.200
The updates are fantastic.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.158
MEGHAN MEHTA: What's your

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:49.414

00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:58.400

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.610
They were so funny.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.077
SPEAKER: With us, anything
with Google Photos as well.

00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:03.910
SPEAKER: Yeah, for me,
it's the environment.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.230
All the people or the
people just working

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.580
on something great
that's with technology.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.970
MEGHAN MEHTA: What is the
craziest thing you've ever

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.180

a ton of men around here.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.410
SPEAKER: It's true.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.930
SPEAKER: So I have a
five-year-old niece.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690
And she loves
having conversations

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.290
with the voice and stuff.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.850
It's just like, what's
your favorite color?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.040
And do you want to go
to the moon with me?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.460
MEGHAN MEHTA: Next I/O--

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.127
SPEAKER: Mm-hmm?

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:46.150
MEGHAN MEHTA: --if
Google could do anything,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.756
what would you want
to see next year?

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:48.382
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:49.090
"Smell-a-vision."

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.400
MEGHAN MEHTA: I love it.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.795
I want smell-a-vision.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:52.630
SPEAKER: So you can see
everything and let's

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.670
be able to smell it now.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.990
SPEAKER: How about
the car that hovers?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.590
MEGHAN MEHTA: I love it.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200
SPEAKER: Well, and
drives itself as well.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.110
SPEAKER: Yeah, and
hovers at the same time.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.443
SPEAKER: Self-driving hover car.

00:01:59.443 --> 00:02:02.520
SPEAKER: I would like to see
more integration towards humans

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.830
and artificial
intelligence, so it's

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.980
not about artificial
intelligence only.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.100
But I think the future that
Google is trying to build,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.940
or should build,
is a combination

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.040
of artificial
intelligence with humans.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.213
SPEAKER: Google Barber.

00:02:15.213 --> 00:02:16.380
MEGHAN MEHTA: Google Barber?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.408
What is that?

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:18.700
SPEAKER: So think of it, right?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.075
Like, each time
I go to the salon

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:23.120
I want to [INAUDIBLE]
exactly which haircut I want.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.235
So based on my
activities or my actions,

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:27.360
and my previous haircut
history, it could basically

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.567
tell me what exactly I want.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.400
SPEAKER: If they can
do the Google Assistant

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.220
in Ampari, our local language.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.849
If they could support Google in
Ampari, that would be awesome.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.266
MEGHAN MEHTA: That
would be great.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:37.620
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.620
MEGHAN MEHTA: What do you
want to see next year?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.200
SPEAKER: AR dog
walking, fox to trot.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.630
MEGHAN MEHTA: AR dog walking.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.060
You heard it here first.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.860
It's our next trend.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.910
