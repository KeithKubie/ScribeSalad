00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:03.108
(birds chirping)

00:00:07.885 --> 00:00:09.608
- [Daren] There is a
growing movement of people

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:12.548
that are really interested
in recontextualizing

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:15.167
education in our country
with social and emotional

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:17.435
and academic development.

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:19.832
Some of the core elements
that we have here at Valor

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:23.485
are practices that push and
develop all of us to grow.

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:27.400
So Compass Camp is an
evolution of Valor's goal

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.900
to really share the work that we're doing.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:40.395
- At Valor, we focus on a social
emotional learning program

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:44.393
that gives our kids the
necessary character strengths.

00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:46.869
(students talking)

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.605
We use a model called the Compass.

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:52.846
The Compass has different dimensions:

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:57.846
sharp mind, big heart, noble
purpose, and aligned actions.

00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:01.122
Essentially, we are working to develop

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:05.210
all of those dimensions in
our kids and in our adults.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.136
- It starts with the
basic understanding that

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.871
we all as humans have a lot of social

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.784
and emotional growth to do.

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:14.788
By doing a lot of this
work, we believe that

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:19.389
that's gonna drive them to
incredible academic success.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.301
- Hi, welcome.
- Hi, how are you?

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:23.344
- [Daren] So Compass
Camp is an opportunity

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:26.119
to share the work that we're doing.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.258
- Today I'm in Tennessee
to learn a lot more

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:29.941
about social emotional learning.

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:32.677
The activation and the full
implementation of circles

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:34.884
with adults and kids alike.

00:01:34.884 --> 00:01:36.617
- This year, we got some feedback

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:38.860
where students really
felt like they didn't

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.221
build relationships with
their teachers as much.

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.099
And so we had come here
today to think about

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.932
how we could restructure
our advisory program.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.963
- So our Valor Compass is
our primary guiding metaphor.

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:57.273
Today we have leaders from
14 different school networks

00:01:57.273 --> 00:02:01.453
across the country and we
are going to introduce them

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.447
to our Compass framework, our phase work,

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:07.177
and our circle process with the hope that

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:09.974
we can spread the practice
in a meaningful way.

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:13.101
So we chose the metaphor of the compass

00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.944
because we really liked the concept that

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:18.462
it's a way of finding
your way in the world.

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:20.944
Our participants get a
brief overview of our model.

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:23.278
In what we call compass discipline.

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:24.728
Working the compass really means

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:26.507
pursuit of excellence in every dimension.

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:27.866
That's something we hold ourselves to,

00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.624
that's something to hold our kids to.

00:02:29.624 --> 00:02:31.977
- Naye, would you tell us a
little bit about your business?

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:32.810
- [Naye] Yeah--

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.834
And then, we have them observe
one of our faculty circles.

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:37.908
- I just wanna appreciate
you for the work that you do,

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:39.378
oftentimes behind the scenes.

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:42.252
- So they feel the emotional
vulnerability that's required

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:44.635
and the level of trust and
the types of relationships

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:49.635
that have developed here as
a result of that practice.

00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:52.859
In your packet, we actually want you to do

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.606
some circle phase work.

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.441
(teachers talking)

00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.385
We then send them home
with the type of phase work

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:01.363
that both our scholars
do and our adults do.

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:02.518
- [Melissa] And so in the packets,

00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:05.732
there's reflections and guided questions.

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:09.030
- One example is an exercise
called If You Really Knew Me.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.705
That's a sentence starter and
you're really gonna fill in

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:14.061
as much as you're comfortable sharing

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.720
who you are with the circle.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.470
(birds chirping)

00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:22.595
In the morning, we tour scholar circles.

00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:26.186
So they observe boys
circle and a girls circle.

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:28.711
- I wanna appreciate you because
you show a lot of kindness

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.576
and you have a really big heart.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.959
- [Daren] And then they
officially participate

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.051
in a circle themselves.

00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:36.101
- Just take a few moments to concentrate

00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.826
and connect with your breath.

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:38.969
- [Daren] Every circle will start

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.735
with a mindfulness-based practice

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:44.340
for everybody in the circle to
really focus their attention.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.078
And then it moves into a check-in.

00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:48.811
- So I'm gonna ask you to
think of one feeling word.

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:50.410
- Which is a ritualized process.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.366
We're getting everybody's
voice in the room.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:53.832
- I'm feeling elated.

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:56.326
- I'm feeling grateful today.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:58.860
- I'm feeling relaxed.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.860
- And then some brave souls
will do some work in the circle

00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:06.820
and get to experience it firsthand.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.068
- [Woman] Ezzie, what are you proud of?

00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:12.629
- Circle today was a
little bit intimidating.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.796
I'm proud of the type of
work that I do with kids.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.793
I participated in the exercise
called A Thousand Questions.

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:25.060
I'm proud of my two little girls.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.214
No matter how much time it
took you, you are on the spot

00:04:27.214 --> 00:04:29.119
and you needed to think
of what you were proud of.

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:32.711
It really made you dig deep,
and it was a cool experience

00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.563
to think about what I was proud of.

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:37.361
- So we'll move into appreciations next.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.900
This is one of the final parts of circle.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.207
- And then we always
end with appreciations.

00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:45.561
- I really appreciate
the work that you do.

00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:48.297
- I appreciated your words of gratitude.

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:50.117
- I really appreciate your energy

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:53.963
and the positive vibes
that you gave to me today.

00:04:53.963 --> 00:04:55.242
- You're very kind.

00:04:55.242 --> 00:04:56.777
- I'm definitely hoping to bring back,

00:04:56.777 --> 00:04:59.814
"Here's a structure for
how to do a great circle.

00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:03.228
What will it do for our kids overall?"

00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:05.183
- After learning about
circles and learning

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:08.835
about the program, I strongly
believe that it will provide

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.234
that sense of community
that we're looking for

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:14.444
and allow students to
have a really positive,

00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:17.618
deep relationship with
an adult in the school.

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:19.788
- I'm deeply grateful and
humbled that you all came

00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:22.099
from all over the country to be here.

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.195
I think my biggest hope
is that people recognize

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:28.295
the value of relationships and growth.

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.017
This needs to start with us,
the adults in the building.

00:05:31.017 --> 00:05:33.660
Then we as a country
actually need to be relating

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.566
with each other in different ways

00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:37.899
if we want to lead our kids.
