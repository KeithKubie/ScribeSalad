00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.300
Before we start converting
fractions to decimals,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.080
let's think about what a fraction is.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.265
If I write one-fourth,
what am I really doing?

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.920
One-fourth is the same as 1 times 4,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.380
1 divided by 4, 1 plus 4, or 1 minus 4?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.710
Please pick one.
