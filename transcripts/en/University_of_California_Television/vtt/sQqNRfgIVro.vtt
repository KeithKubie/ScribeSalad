(light music)

00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:48.820
- Welcome to a conversation
with history, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.190
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.700
Our guest today is Professor
Kwame Anthony Appiah

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.670
who is Professor of Philosophy
in Law at New York University

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.410
and lectures frequently
throughout the world.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.710
A leading moral and political
philosopher, professor.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.540
Appiah is a prolific writer.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.440
Whose publications both
academic and popular span

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.000
a variety of disciplines.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.780
He also has published widely
on the topics of African

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.590
an African American literary
and cultural studies.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.930
In 2012 he was awarded a
National Humanities medal

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.390
by President Obama.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.400
He is visiting the Berkeley
campus under the auspices

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.560
of the graduate lecture series

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.560
to deliver the Howitzson
lecture in philosophy.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.470
Professor Appiah, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.113
Where were you born and raised?

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.397
- I wish the answer to that was one place.

00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:46.640
But I was born in one place
and raised in another.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.280
I was born in London where my father

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.440
was a law student at the time

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.940
and that's where he met
my mother who was English.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.910
And then by the time I was
about one we were in Ghana

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.660
and I basically grew up
there in the town Kumasi

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.120
which is the capital of
an old empire, Ashanti

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.229
which is now part of modern Ghana.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.229
- And looking back how did your parents

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.310
shape your thinking about the world?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.050
And this is a very complex story

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.020
so we're gonna take a little
time talking about it.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.740
- So my parents met in London.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.810
My father was a law student
but also he was president

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.340
of something called the
West African Students Union

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.313
which was an organization of
colonial students from Africa.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.780
This is in the late 40s early 50s.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.460
My mother was working for an organization

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.790
it was actually called Racial Unity

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.640
which was run by the
anthropologist Colin Turnbull.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.409
And they were working
with colonial students.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.240
Looking after their welfare in London.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.963
And so that's how they met.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.750
Well, I think the very fact that my mother

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.130
is a sort of upper middle
class English woman

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.630
was working on racial harmony in Britain

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.210
in the 1950s made her a bit unusual

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.333
because it was still a
somewhat, I don't want to say.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.390
I don't know what the right word is.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.730
Racist is the wrong word
but moderately condescending

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.399
towards foreigners,
let me put it that way.

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:17.860
It was the sort of standard attitude.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.610
And she, her father was
the finance minister

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.360
of the chancellor of the
Ex-Chair-Co so she came

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.130
from a respectable family
and as did my father.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.110
Who's father was the brother-in-law

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.150
of the King of Ashanti,
lets put it that way.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.600
So they came from these,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.400
in their each place, elite families.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.730
Both of them places where
there was a long tradition

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.120
of sort of proud independence, I suppose.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.100
And so each of them made a decision

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.563
as it were to extend out.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.600
And when they were married, you know

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.253
it was sort of big deal in both societies.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.710
So the fact that they set
off on this enterprise

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.240
of what was a relatively
rare thing at that point

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.733
which was a so called
interracial marriage,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.370
was a reflection I think of
values that they both had.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.750
They were both very open people.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.810
My father had obviously
traveled from Africa

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.910
to Europe to be a student.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.690
He came to Europe by way of Sierra Leon,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.740
he was born in Ghana.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.170
And he many friends not just
from Africa and from Ghana

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.770
but from South Asia and the Caribbean

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.600
and other parts of the British empire,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.163
what was going to turn into
the British Commonwealth.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.920
My mother had traveled a fair amount.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.410
Her father had been the
British Ambassador in Moscow

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.363
in the 40s so she'd lived in Moscow.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.430
Her mother had been
involved in raising money

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.910
for Chinese relief in the late 40s

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.510
and so she had visited China.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.960
My grandmother is one of
the few people who knew,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.710
not very well, but knew
slightly both Chiang Kai-Shek

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.150
and Mao Zedong and my mother
was with her on that trip.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.140
So she traveled a bit.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.690
She'd worked in Persia during the war.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.670
She was, you know, widely traveled.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.220
And as she told me much later

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.663
in life, actually happier out of England.

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:13.630
She'd never felt, despite
the fact that she was born

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.830
in the country in England to a very sort

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.847
of normal family as it were.

00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:19.900
She said that when she first

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.400
got to Ghana she thought, okay I'm home.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.770
This is where I was
supposed to be all along.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.310
So they were a bit unusual, each

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.657
of them in their own societies.

00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:32.250
But they came from families
that were open to the world.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.210
- So both came from established families

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.210
in their national setting
but as you describe

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.280
it were really citizens of the world

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.540
or became that even early in their life

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.180
and then later of course.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.510
- Yes, no very much so.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.320
You know for my father
the intellectual framing

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.810
of this came out of one of
those great 20th century

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.810
movements, pan-Africanism
which was very much

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.730
a movement about working
together across nationalities.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.200
It was about bringing together people

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.860
of African descent from
the Caribbean and Africa.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.720
And elsewhere people who
were in other places.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.810
And allowing them to build
together a new future

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.570
for black people in the world.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.570
But that was not a vision of the life

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.320
of the Africa diaspora
as kind of excluding

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.050
its neighbors, excluding other people.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.853
My father followed
closely politics in Asia,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.150
in India and so on.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.610
He had a lot of Indian friends in London

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.690
in the 40s and 50s and
actually my mother's family

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.750
had a lot of Indian connections

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.190
because my mother's
father had been involved

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.210
as a friend of Nehru's in negotiating

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.000
the terms of Indian
independence from Britain.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So they were both sort of
embedded through family life

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.840
and through their many
friendships in a world

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.560
that was very much a world of people

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.470
from all around the world.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.000
And they enjoyed that
even though I would say

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.360
they were both interestingly

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.360
in their own ways intensely
loyal to a very local identity.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.160
My father was, lived in the
city that he'd grown up in.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.293
Even thought he'd been in
many other cities on the way.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.740
And he loved the city,
he loved the traditions.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.570
He was a loyal servant of the king who

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.020
was my great uncle when I was a child

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.523
and then, his brother-in-law.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:42.457
And yet he was also a very
active patriotic Ghanaian.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.650
Very active in the African
Unity organization.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.140
And for a while at the UN
as a delegate from Ghana.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.180
Very active in global politics.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.410
And he regarded all of these things

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.240
as completely consistent with one another.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.130
Just as my mother's deep attachments

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.870
to Ghana never stopped
her having a deep sense

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.504
that she was also a woman who'd grown up

00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:06.970
in the west of England and who loved

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.220
the English countryside and
Wordsworth and English poetry.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.030
- What do you attribute
their self confidence

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.310
and ability to be flexible in dealing

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.760
with these multiple identities?

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.610
- So I think its different things.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.760
In my father's case I think it was coming

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.890
from this old imperial center.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.410
So the people in my home
town, in Kumasi, despite

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.880
the fact that they were
defeated eventually

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.930
by the British in the early 20th century,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.990
had a sense of themselves as people

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.570
in the world who were entitled

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.387
to the respect of the rest of the world.

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:43.970
And they had done things.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.500
They had created a powerful culture,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.533
and tradition, and empire.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.360
They regarded, I think the British,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.500
as people who'd beaten
them fair and square

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.163
in warfare but still not
really their superiors.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.810
And after all we only had
a period of colonial rule

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.340
that lasted, my
grandfather was born before

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.597
the colonial period and
died after an independence.

00:09:10.597 --> 00:09:15.597
So not many people lived
just in the colonial period.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.460
It was a very short period
in historical terms.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.920
So we hadn't been sort of
bullied or pushed about too much.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.290
So I think that, and
the town itself was full

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.820
of people from everyone because it was

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.710
a major trading center
in the mid 20th century

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.520
it was the largest market in west Africa.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.700
And it had people not
just from all over Africa

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.040
but it had Indians, people
from the middle east, Lebanese,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.623
Syrian traders and so on.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.540
Greek timber merchants, all
kinds of people from all over

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.300
and they all lived
perfectly happily together.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.710
In a framework set by
the culture of Ashanti.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.710
So I think for him, he
grew up around people

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.349
from all over and he
was curious about them

00:10:03.349 --> 00:10:05.450
and that's a temperamental
thing as a matter

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.430
of intellectual temperament.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.333
And so he very, and he was educated,

00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:16.980
actually by Irish teachers mostly.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.170
Irish and Ghanaian teachers.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.330
And he acquired from that education

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.030
a great interest in European culture.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.820
There were two books, three books actually

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.040
on my father's bedside table.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.140
One was the Bible, another
was the meditations

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.240
of Marcus Aurelius, and a
third was something by Cicero.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.780
It wasn't always the same thing.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.110
He loved Cicero, he loved Marcus Aurelius,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.810
he loved his Bible.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.510
He thought of Kumasi as
being in many ways like Rome.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.610
He used to say that like Rome, Kumasi

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.133
is built on seven hills.

00:10:54.243 --> 00:10:57.430
And he used to refer, when you grow up

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.800
in Ashanti at a certain age you're allowed

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.560
to wear a full, its called
a cloth which is like

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.270
a large piece of beautiful fabric

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.970
which you wrap over your left shoulder.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.133
And he used to refer to it as our toga.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.730
And so when I was first
given one of these he said

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.030
to me this is your toga virilis

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.480
which is the Latin expression
for the toga of a man.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.840
So he very much sort of
thought about Ashanti

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.260
in terms derived from
a classical education.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.160
- So he embraced the world while

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.962
retaining closely his local identity?

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:37.730
- Yes, I mean I've always thought

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.730
that the great, the most misunderstanding

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.750
of the slanders against cosmopolitans

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.750
is that cosmopolitans are people
who have lost their roots.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.380
And I think the best
remark about this was made

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:02.090
by Gertrude Stein who said, what's the use

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.140
of roots if you can't take them with you?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.107
So she was a Californian
lady who undermined

00:12:09.107 --> 00:12:11.853
the metaphor of roots
but in the right way.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.200
My father never lost his sense of himself

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.200
and he loved, he spoke the
language, you know happily

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.940
with his friends and he was
very good at speaking in it.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.190
He knew many proverbs
so he could talk like

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.430
a traditional Ashanti speaker

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.380
but he would also quote,
you know as I say Cicero

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.623
or Horus to you, or English
poetry that he loved as well.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.180
Though not as much as my mother did.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.180
And he was, I think his openness

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:46.010
to the world was rooted in
his strong and confident sense

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.960
that he knew where he came from

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.680
and he was happy that was
where he did come from.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.720
- And what about your mother's profile?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.050
Was it a different trajectory

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.100
but in a way ending up in the same way?

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.560
- Well yes, so I think you know, I say

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.570
that part of my father's
openness came from

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.870
the city that he grew up in.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.450
My mother grew up in a tiny village

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.020
in Oxfordshire so you couldn't say that.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.500
And a very nice place.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.550
I spent much of my childhood visiting it

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.310
and they're very nice people

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.933
but they were not cosmopolitan at all.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.050
Her parents were, though, her family was.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.950
She knew her parents, when my grandfather

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.110
was in the mid 30s thrown out
of the British Labor Party

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.620
for being too left wing
one of the things he did

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.580
was travel around the world.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.400
So he was involved, for
example, in the creation

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.710
of the Jamaican Labor Party
and by the time he came

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.010
to be involved as a member
of the British cabinet

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.580
in dealing with Indian
independence he had known Nehru

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.010
for a long time just as a friend.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.670
Indira Gandhi and my
mother knew each other

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.420
when they were you know,
10, and 11, and 12.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.520
I mean they were kids.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.560
So his my mother's family was
by British standards quite,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.510
I would say sort of non-racist.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.256
I mean they had genuine friendships

00:14:08.256 --> 00:14:12.160
at a time with people who
were not English or white,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.703
at a time when that
wasn't terribly common.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:17.664
And as I said she was,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.810
because of my grandparents involvement

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.620
in Russia and China and
so on, that she had spent

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.090
a fair amount of her childhood,
and Jamaica for that matter.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.940
She'd spent a certain amount of time

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.884
in Jamaica, in Moscow,
traveling around in China.

00:14:35.884 --> 00:14:39.700
And she worked for a
while in Persia, in Iran.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.250
So she had, was exposed as
a child and as a young woman

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.180
to a wide variety of cultural experiences.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.930
I'm leaving out the fact
that they spent time

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.710
in Germany, and Italy,
and Switzerland in Europe.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.750
- And so now let's go back to your story.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.230
You were born in England did you say,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.320
and then so where were you raised?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.213
Did you move from one of your
parents home to the other?

00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:09.230
- So my parents were both
in England when I was born

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.020
and when I went to Ghana I went with both

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.920
of them around about the age of one.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.780
And so our home from then on until

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.769
I left college was in Ghana.

00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:22.033
They built a house.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.060
We lived somewhere else before

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.280
that but the first place I remember

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.393
is this house that was still have.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:35.080
So they were, and at that point my father

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.740
was in Parliament, in the first Parliament

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.430
after independence in the
opposition to Nkrumah,

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.550
the first president.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.300
Who had been a very close
friend of his in London

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.460
but they had disagreed
about political questions

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.620
and when my father came
home he didn't join

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.160
the government party he
joined the opposition party.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.160
And this led pretty
swiftly to a serious break

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.970
with Nkrumah and by
the early 60s my father

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.660
had been, was a political prisoner.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.940
He'd been locked up.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.580
In fact, my father had the good fortune

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.980
to be put in, well it wasn't good fortune

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.880
to be put in prison, but
it was a good fortune

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.380
that when he was put in
prison Amnesty International

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.930
had just been founded that year.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.430
And Amnesty, people don't remember this,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.147
Amnesty's first international
trip was to Ghana

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.380
and so my father was one

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.290
of the first prisoners of conscience.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.930
He was one of the first
people Amnesty helped

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.980
to get out of prison.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.450
Because he was in for a year and a half.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.530
So he was very much involved
in the political life

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.530
of the country and at
that point because he was

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.919
and because my father
was in prison they tried

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:43.370
to deport his wife and children

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.913
just as a kind of harassment.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.290
My mother wasn't going to leave

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.220
the country that her
husband was imprisoned in,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.840
so she told them that they could try

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.330
and get rid of her but
they'd have to carry her

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.210
to the airport and that 150 miles away

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.490
and they didn't like the idea of carrying

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.890
an English woman 150 miles
so they didn't do it.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.760
I was ill at the time and, quite ill,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.480
and just by chance during the course

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.330
of my recovery I was in a hospital bed

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.610
that the Queen of England
walked by on her first visit

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.410
to Ghana as a foreign head of state.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.200
And unfortunately her
husband the Duke of Edinburgh

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.350
had been in Kumasi before
and had met my mother.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.430
So when he looked back and saw the picture

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.990
of my mother on the bedside table,

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.263
he said oh give my regards to your mother.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.040
The president now knew that he was walking

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.510
with a foreign head of state who knew

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.050
that she had just talked to the child

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.733
of a political prisoner
and he was really upset.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.390
And my doctor was fired and
various other things happened.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.693
And at that point my mother thought,

00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:49.677
and it was all over the
papers in Britain and Ghana.

00:17:49.677 --> 00:17:51.910
And at that point my
mother thought, better put

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.290
this child somewhere out of the way.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.330
Because its hard enough dealing

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.530
with your husband in prison
and being followed around

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.650
by the security police so I was sent

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.930
to my English grandmother and put

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.840
in a school near her house just

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.550
to allow things to calm down.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.240
And I was eight.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.610
So from the age of eight I was
in English boarding schools

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.670
with a home in my grandmother's house

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.450
but going home when my father
was released eventually,

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.970
going home for the vacations to Ghana.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.150
So I lived from then
on at school in England

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.133
and at home in Ghana mostly.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.040
- As a young person growing
up how, what was it like

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.500
to experience these different worlds

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.890
but be comfortable in them?

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.020
- Many people in England found my parents

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.810
marriage unintelligible,
they couldn't understand

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.320
how two people from what they regarded

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.380
as such remote civilizations
could possibly get on.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.330
And every time my mother went to England

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.607
the journalists would say,
oh so have you left him?

00:18:53.607 --> 00:18:56.220
And she would say, no I'm
just visiting my mother.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.330
And you know, and they stayed together

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.800
until my father's death
and then my mother lived

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.651
on in Ghana and died there.

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:07.651
So I, the answer is I think
that its, if you are embedded

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.550
in two extended loving families

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.363
it doesn't matter where they are.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.800
So we were very much at home in England.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.360
My sisters didn't spend as much time

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.170
because they didn't have to.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.145
- [Harry] You have three sisters?

00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:27.150
- I have three sisters and
they're younger than I am.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.250
And they had the good
fortune not to be ill

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.010
and be visited by the Queen of England

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.500
so they didn't have to go
through what I went through.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.990
But we went often to see my grandmother.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.988
My mother obviously loved her
mother and liked to visit her

00:19:40.988 --> 00:19:43.410
and my English grandmother,
by the way visited us

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.120
and knew Ghana quite well.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.530
So and the house, my grandmother's house

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.110
was next to the house, it
was very, it was in a village

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.400
but the house next door
was my uncle Robert

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.780
and my aunt Theresa.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.080
My aunt Theresa had been
born in this village.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.350
We were, everybody in the
village knew who we were.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.350
If I went into a store people said hello.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.180
It was a very friendly place.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.380
No doubt because it was a
normal English community

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.150
there were some people
who didn't like brown

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.833
and black people but they
wouldn't have said so.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.300
So we were very comfortable
there and in the village

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.440
that my mother grew up in,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.660
which was you know 30, 40 miles away.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.460
Where we spent Christmas very often.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.750
And my mother's family with one exception

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.070
and he was somebody I never
met, were enormously welcoming.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.070
She did have one uncle who
didn't come to the wedding

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.940
but you'll see why if I
tell you that he emigrated

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.273
to South Africa in 1950s.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.603
He had a very different
politics from the rest of us.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.720
So, but the rest of the family some

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.310
of whom were quite socially conservative

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.160
were nevertheless, they weren't bigots.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.560
They were not racists and once you're

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.250
in the family you're in the family.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.583
And the schools I went to.

00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:10.753
I was the head boy of one of
my English boarding schools.

00:21:11.877 --> 00:21:16.340
And I was protected as one
is by the fact that my,

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.240
though my grandfather
was dead, my grandmother

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.730
was the widow of a prominent statesman

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.330
and I discovered after she died that she

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.270
had written very stern
letters to the headmasters

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.140
of these various schools
saying if anything ever happens

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.540
to my grandchild you'll hear from me.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.923
So I was sort of protected in a way.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.240
In a way that everybody can understand

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.370
by the fact that, well by I
suppose you could say by class

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.730
to a certain extent in England.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.780
So really it was not difficult.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.083
We were bilingual.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.690
We, my parents were both devout Christians

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.070
so there wasn't a sort of religious issue.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:04.070
And I just never remember
finding it at all difficult.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.720
The only thing I found
difficult about England

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.590
and I can remember this to this day

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.550
is that when I first arrived there when I

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.370
was sort of eight or
nine, it was in the middle

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.880
of the winter and they opened the door

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.420
of the plane and I got
out and it was so cold.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.330
And I remember thinking,
maybe this is a mistake.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.610
I can't believe how cold it is.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.290
So the weather was a problem to begin

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.983
with but I adjusted to that.

00:22:31.334 --> 00:22:35.143
- When one reads your
many books, in addition

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.560
to being very lucid they
have narrative quality

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.000
that really brings the reader in.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Did this ability to tell
stories, to give us narrations

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.903
that explicate complex
philosophical problems,

00:22:52.903 --> 00:22:54.700
did that come from your parents?

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.520
I get the sense that both
in way, were story tellers.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.850
- Yes, my father was a famous
oral teller of stories.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.010
He wrote an autobiography,
which is quite a good book

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.220
but that was his only big book project.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.870
But he, people loved just to come listen

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:11.703
to him tell stories.

00:23:11.703 --> 00:23:13.210
And he told wonderful stories
about his time in prison.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.260
Which you would have thought
is the most wonderful place

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.702
in the world from the way
he told stories about it.

00:23:17.702 --> 00:23:19.730
He apparently had great fun there.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.480
In part because he enjoyed telling stories

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.140
to the other prisoners.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.290
He was a great narrator
and we would love listening

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.440
to him when we were children
and the first fiction book

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.440
that my mother published
and she became quite

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.300
a well known writer of children's books

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.193
and then adult novels, in Ghana.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.770
The first book she published
which Pantheon published

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.130
in New York, was Tales
of an Ashanti Father.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.440
So it was re-tellings
of Ghanaian folks tales

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.060
that she had heard my father tell us.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.140
And then she collected more beyond

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.340
that and she published
a whole series of them.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.120
So my father was this
great teller of tales

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.763
and my mother was a novelist
and a children's book writer.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.470
And more important perhaps
than either of those,

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.470
my mother was a great teacher of reading.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.390
Every time I came home from school

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.330
on my bedside table she'd
selected some novels

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.370
that she really loved for me to read.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.143
It might be Tolstoy, it
might be D.H. Lawrence,

00:24:25.147 --> 00:24:29.187
it might be Dickens and
we were a bookish family.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.080
We had more books in our house

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.170
than probably anybody else in our town.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.960
And many of the kids in
the neighborhood would come

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.380
and sit on the veranda and read.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.540
'Cause we were a kind of lending library

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.440
because there wasn't a
proper library nearby.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.610
And so it was a bookish
place and we read a lot.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.441
And I think, you know when
my students ask me how

00:24:55.441 --> 00:24:59.020
to improve their writing I say, read more.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.160
Read good writers,
that's the way you learn.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.160
You learn not by sort
drawing abstract principles

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.017
but by learning the feel
of a style of writing

00:25:13.063 --> 00:25:15.513
and then you have to
develop a style of your own.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.180
And if you read a lot
and think a lot you will.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.830
So I think I was lucky to be
raised, we were allowed during

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.400
the summer vacations,
I was allowed to retire

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.900
to my room and read all
day and there'd be knocks

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.180
on the door occasionally to remind me

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.700
that I was due for a meal.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.710
But if I wanted to read that was okay

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.980
and then I would be asked
what I'd been reading.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.250
So I think it was a mixture
of living among people

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.470
who cared about narrative and also

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.230
being exposed very
extensively to narrative.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.540
- Before we talk about your
formal education I wanna,

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.300
in your book, In My Father's
House you end the book

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.770
with his funeral and in a way that funeral

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.670
is a summation of all
we've been talking about

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.120
in the sense of the people who came,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.120
the traditions that were
deployed in the undertaking

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:13.030
of the funeral, even the internal conflict

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.403
within the family.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.493
So touch on that a minute
because in a way the very act

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.990
of the funeral summed up all
that we've just talked about.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.540
- Yes, I mean I was
writing this book anyway

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.390
as my father was dying
and so, and then he died

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.860
and I hadn't finished it
and I went home obviously

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.860
and these things happened
which seemed so much

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.053
to be a way of talking
about the various issues

00:26:45.053 --> 00:26:46.910
that were at the heart of the book.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.490
So its a very complicated
story but basically my father,

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.070
so my father was head of his family.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.830
In Ghana that means that he was head

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.070
of a group defined by shared
descent not from a man

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.210
but from a woman so all all his family,

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.440
the word is (speaking
in foreign language).

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.010
His family is all the
descendants of his grandmother.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:05.850
- So it was matriarchal?

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.400
- This is a matrilineal family.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.240
He was having a row at the
time he died whose content

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.180
I never discovered with
his favorite sister.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.450
A woman I'd grown up
with as someone I went

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.283
to see all the time.

00:27:19.283 --> 00:27:21.310
And who looked after me and
fed me when I went to see her

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.430
and gave me gifts, and whom I loved.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.800
But they were not speaking.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.700
And she didn't come to
see him while he was dying

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.000
and I think that was both a sign

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.950
of how deep the rift was and something

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.670
that made him unhappy.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.790
So he wrote a will, a
codicil to his will close

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.090
to his death saying I want my funeral

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.550
to be conducted by my children.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:47.090
Now in a matrilineal
system a man's children

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.730
don't belong to him.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.340
He doesn't belong to
them and the right people

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.900
to conduct the funeral
are his matrilineal kin.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.950
So this sister would have
been the lead person.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.950
So he was sort of repudiating them.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.230
So I arrived back and I
thought, I've got to do,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.890
my father instructed us to do this.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.070
He's my father, I'm
gonna do what he wanted.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.710
I don't know whether
its a good idea or not

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.740
but he's my father and its his burial.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.610
And so it was very complicated
to do that, to get it done.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:21.610
Because my sister, my aunt,
his sister obviously took

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.870
this to be a public repudiation.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.740
She was the wife of the King of Ashanti

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.200
so it was to some extent a repudiation

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.960
of the whole royal elite and so on.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.100
And just as it were, getting
his body, making sure

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.800
that his body wasn't
literally taken away by them

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.240
involved keeping it in a secret place

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.120
and flying it up on a plane
without telling anybody

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.690
where we were going and so on.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.970
Anyway, we succeeded
in organizing a funeral

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.890
and he had, another thing
was he had been President

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.100
of the Bar Association
and the Bar Association

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.030
by tradition buys a coffin for presidents

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.170
of the Bar Association who die.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.450
And he had said to us,
I want a simple coffin.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.780
Well the Bar Association didn't want

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.132
to buy a simple coffin for the President.

00:29:09.132 --> 00:29:10.870
So we had another fight
with the Bar Association.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.780
We said look, we're sorry
but this is what he said

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.520
and its kind of you to buy the coffin

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.670
but we want to buy the coffin
that he wants to be buried in.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:20.834
So there were various things,

00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:24.210
it was as if he'd set us a bunch of tests.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.820
- Right which, and actually as
you resolve these one by one

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.070
its almost a test of your theory.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:37.070
That is even when you're
overruling tradition you

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.827
are respectful of the tradition.

00:29:38.827 --> 00:29:42.206
- Was as respectful as we can
be and we're trying very hard.

00:29:42.206 --> 00:29:45.080
We're polite, even my aunt's eldest son

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.320
who's now a very
important chief in Ashanti

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.510
was astonished by the way
in which my aunt spoke

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.320
to me when I first came to her

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.923
as I was duty bound to do, to tell her

00:29:57.923 --> 00:30:00.000
that her brother had died.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.820
Instead of you know, consoling
one another she gave me

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.743
a great lecture about
bad things he had done.

00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:08.700
About which I knew absolutely nothing.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.830
- This is just family everywhere.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.920
- This is just normal family behavior.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.640
But it was embedded in this context

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.280
and everybody in town, of
course because she was married

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.800
to the King was gossiping
about it, and so on.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.480
So we tried very much to do,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.710
on the one hand we hung together.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.573
My sisters and my mother and I.

00:30:26.468 --> 00:30:29.700
We were a matrilineal group.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.540
A little matrilineal group.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.860
On the other hand we had many
friends who stuck with us.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.490
Including my mother's church, for example.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.370
And in the end we were able to conduct

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.170
a respectful funeral for my father

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.220
which was attended by the King

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.363
and by the President and so on.

00:30:46.202 --> 00:30:49.958
And in the course of it
I learned a great deal

00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:53.800
about, I'd never done
anything as an adult, really.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.100
Anything important in the family context.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.070
Now it was a baptism of fire.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.560
And by the time my mother
died many, many years later

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.300
we knew how to do it and also there wasn't

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.460
a conflict going on.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.460
So my mother's funeral was calmer

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.540
but also a respectful affair and she had

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.110
the privilege also of having a funeral

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.520
where both the King and
the President visited.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.083
- Now the other part of
your work demonstrates

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.710
the rigor of analysis that
you learn in philosophy.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.100
You got a PhD in philosophy at Cambridge.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.430
What was your work on in the beginning?

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.270
- Well in the 70s in England
both, I was gonna say

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.120
both in Oxford and Cambridge,
that's a terrible way

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.150
of putting it 'cause that suggests

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.387
that there's nothing
else going on in England

00:31:40.387 --> 00:31:42.490
but in philosophy those are the two main,

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.230
those were at that point
the two main departments.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.583
And Oxford was much bigger.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.573
The central topics, the things as it were

00:31:50.573 --> 00:31:52.680
that the smart students
were working on were

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.820
in the philosophy of language.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.010
And I was interested in this anyway.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.520
I started reading philosophy
of language in high school.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.750
We didn't have classes so I just read

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.250
it with friends and on my own.

00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:09.548
And I ended up writing a dissertation

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.060
that was about a set
of connected questions

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.980
of the philosophy of language
which I thought you could

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:20.900
illuminate by applying
the mathematical theory

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.860
of probability to thinking
about questions in semantics.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.860
So the technical word for what
the sort of technical part

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.480
of it was that it was
probabilistic semantics.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.313
Which was a somewhat
nascent field at that point.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.590
That was also drawing on tradition

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.300
because Cambridge has
the distinction of being

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.890
the place where the major
work in the philosophy

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:49.010
of probability in England had
been done in the 20th century.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.570
John Maynard Keynes wrote
a treatise on probability

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.920
which is an important work.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.490
Frank Ramsey his friend and
colleague who died young

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.840
wrote probably one of
the most important papers

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.970
on the philosophy of
probability in Cambridge.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.190
Ian Hacking who's a Canadian but studied

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.692
at Cambridge and who was
one of my teachers wrote

00:33:09.692 --> 00:33:14.050
a book, well more than, at
least two really important books

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.640
on the philosophy of probability

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.700
and my own dissertation
adviser had written

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.400
a wonderful book called
the Matter of Chance

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.420
which was about the roll
of probability in physics.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.290
So I was well trained to
think about probability

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:28.910
and I was applying it to
questions that my teachers

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.250
hadn't applied it to, but
where I thought it was useful.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.079
So that was sort of technical work,

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:39.010
but the driving set of
issues were not technical.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.810
They were issues to do with thinking about

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.580
how you can understand the relationship

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.690
between mental representation,
the way we form

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.930
and develop beliefs and
how we express them.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.680
What is the relationship
between language and thought?

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.120
Which is one of the old
questions in philosophy.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.380
But applying these sorts
rigorous technical methods

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.850
to thinking about it.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.150
In the course of doing
that I became convinced

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.640
that there was something
I could say about one

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.260
of the big disputes that was going

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.810
on in the field at the moment,

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:15.850
which was between two broadly
contradictory approaches

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.423
to thinking about meaning.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.360
One of which derived from the thought

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.820
that to explain what a sentence means

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.090
is to say what the world has
to be like for it to be true.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.470
And another had to do with saying

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.220
that what's really important
is, in understanding

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.220
a meaning of a sentence,

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.130
is figuring out under what conditions

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.600
its appropriate to utter it.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.433
And those are different approaches.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.670
I guess its typical of
me that what I argued

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.950
was that there was truth
in both of the approaches

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:51.970
and that the right way to understand

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.650
the approach that dealt in terms

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.240
of what conditions made it appropriate

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.580
to utter sentences was to see

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.490
that the task of sentence
utterance is to say what's true.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.367
So the stuff about the world is important

00:35:06.367 --> 00:35:08.600
and the stuff about
the mental is important

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.670
then you have to figure out
the relations between them.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.320
That was a big dispute between

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.350
so called realists and anti-realists.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.433
Its still going on.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.500
And I wrote about the major figure

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.550
on the anti-realist side, Michael Dummett

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.570
in my second book and
argued that he was wrong

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.950
to reject the basic insights of realism.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.570
In the course of doing all
this work I learned something,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.350
I think, about how to do
philosophy implicitly.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.150
Though I didn't make it explicit
to myself until much later.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.920
Which was that my method,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.330
which I developed in doing this work,

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.270
which derives from
something that Frank Ramsey,

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.190
whom I mentioned the great philosopher

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.673
of probability had done.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:55.150
My method was to when I was thinking about

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.290
an important concept was
to ask three questions.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.390
Which he always asked.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.023
When do we apply the concept?

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.260
Having committed ourself
to it's applicability

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.560
what does that make us do?

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.670
And how does it interact
with other concepts?

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.090
Those are the three interesting questions

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.070
I think about a concept.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.430
And basically since then
whatever I've worked

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.772
on I've tried, when I'm
thinking about identity

00:36:17.772 --> 00:36:22.772
or race, or gender,
nationality, cosmopolitanism,

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.220
I'm asking these questions about when

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.640
do we apply the concept?

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.750
If we apply it what does
that make us want to do?

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.370
And how does it interact
with other concepts?

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.950
- I often like to ask
my guests what skills

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.407
are involved in what they do

00:36:37.407 --> 00:36:38.900
and what is the temperament?

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.530
As they offer offer advice to students.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.750
I think you've given us
an idea of the skills.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.420
The temperament must be one of patience

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.330
and flexibility, and
confronting what you thought

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.140
were truths which aren't truths.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.040
- Yes, I think you've
gotta eventually be willing

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.580
to give up the things you started with.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.940
You know, I have a sort of joke

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.050
that people on airplanes
if you sit next to them

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.700
and you say what you do
and you're foolish enough

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.400
to tell them that you're
a philosopher they ask you

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.233
what your philosophy is.

00:37:10.233 --> 00:37:12.296
Well I used to say well that's not how,

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.990
that's not what philosophers are.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.700
They aren't people with a philosophy

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.757
but now I say, I do have a
philosophy and my philosophy

00:37:19.757 --> 00:37:22.323
is everything is more
complicated than you thought.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.900
And I think that you,
and that requires sort

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.100
of both patience and
willingness to change your mind.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.410
Because whatever question you start

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.360
with you have some initial
intuition about it.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.100
And it may turn out to be wildly wrong

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.263
and you've gotta be willing
to face that discovery.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.600
But I should say that I think
one of the powerful resources

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.730
of the modern community of
philosophy is that its composed

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.560
of people with many, many different styles

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.900
of mind and many, many
different temperaments.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.370
And that its the
interaction of people coming

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.400
at things from many different angles

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.794
that I think has sort of
produced the modern efflorescence

00:38:03.794 --> 00:38:06.010
of interesting philosophical work.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.750
So for example, I am really interested

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:13.090
in taking things that I've learned

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.780
in my discussions with other philosophers,

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.573
including philosophers I read,

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.000
and trying to make them available

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.280
to a wider world of people who

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.130
are not reading technical philosophy.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.050
And that I think is a
really important role

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.190
but I don't think everybody
needs to be doing that.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.820
And I think that if there
weren't people doing

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.900
the stuff that I read that isn't

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.780
for the general public,
I couldn't do what I do

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.900
because they're making progress in a way

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.210
that depends upon
preceding with technicality

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.160
and precision in way that's just boring

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.310
for most people who don't have

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.330
a philosophical training and temperament.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.240
Nevertheless their work
can feed into the work

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.653
of someone like me who is interested in.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.610
There's so much in the world

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.410
that I think profits from philosophers

00:39:06.524 --> 00:39:10.100
helping the society to
try and understand things.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.530
I don't think the job of philosophers

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.130
is to tell people what to think.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.840
But I do think the job of philosophers

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.730
is to give, provide for the society

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.640
a richer, and clearer
vocabulary of concepts

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.620
for thinking about things.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.840
I don't care whether my
students end up believing

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.170
as I do, in the powerful
value of liberalism.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.230
But I do want to know, I
do want them to understand

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.460
that liberalism is not the
thing that gets talked about

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.880
on the television, that there

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.090
is a powerful intellectual tradition

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.860
and I want them to know what it is.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.520
I want them also to know
what the critiques of it are,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.500
and I want them to know that there

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.540
are other powerful intellectual traditions

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.880
and that they have to
make their own choices.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.610
In more, at a less
abstract level when people

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.450
are thinking about things
like racial justice,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.950
again I think we need to have a society

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.900
in which more people
have a clearer picture

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.343
of what we mean by race.

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:10.890
What racism is, what's wrong with it?

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.210
I think most people on
the street in our society

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.660
think that racism is wrong

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.360
but they couldn't give
you a sensible answer

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.010
to the question either what
it is or why its wrong?

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.416
Well we can't make progress
in deciding whether

00:40:22.416 --> 00:40:24.930
a policy is racist if
we can't tell each other

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.750
a good story about what racism is.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.020
And the same thing when we're thinking

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.720
about international questions.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.760
What obligations do I as
an American citizen have

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.100
for thinking about the welfare of people

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.580
in Angola or in Bangladesh or in Russia

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.370
or in Brazil, or in China?

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.410
Well, you need tools
for thinking about that.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.570
Its not something you're
gonna have a sensible line

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:52.360
of thought about if you
just take that question

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.370
and don't have any framework
for thinking about it.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.650
I think philosophers can
provide the rest of society

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.650
with useful ways of framing
and thinking about concepts.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.000
But its not my job to
tell people what to do.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
- You've written, one piece
of your work is writings

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.420
on identity and writing on cosmopolitanism

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.990
and talking about the
interface between the two.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:19.670
For you and we've actually picked that up

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.970
in the conversation about
your own background.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:28.180
Identity is based in the local, basically.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.770
And even when one thinks one knows what

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.750
the local means, you
really have to reflect

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.833
on what those terms mean.

00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:43.560
- Yes, yes look everybody has

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.690
the privilege of being born
into at least one place.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.500
Some of us like my family and I were

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.550
to some extent born into two places, but.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:56.750
And without doing any work
as a normal human being

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:01.670
you're gonna grow up with a strong sense

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.790
of that place as part of who you are.

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.160
You're gonna know your way
around a certain geography.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.840
You're gonna know how to say
hello to people in the place.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.510
You're gonna know how to
tell when someone's hostile

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.940
and when someone's friendly.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:17.940
You're gonna know that everybody
around here likes skim milk

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.460
and everybody over their likes
their milk full of cream.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.410
I mean, you're gonna know
weird stuff about the local

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:30.050
and that's, you're sort of
embedding in that locality

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.330
as part of what the first way you learn

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.820
to be at home in the world.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.420
So that's going to be for most people

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.020
the start of who they are.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.990
But as my parents showed,
you can have that deep sense

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.640
of a place, which
neither of them ever lost

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.690
and still go somewhere
else for long periods,

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.960
as my father did or for the rest

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.430
of your life as my mother did.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.710
And build a life that
starts with those roots

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.600
but then connects with
another place or other places.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.980
And on the way you'll get
connected with identities

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.160
that are not geographical.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.940
My identity as a philosopher
isn't a geographical identity

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.710
it means that I can parachute into Tehran

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:10.930
and find people to talk to who
know what I'm talking about,

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:13.430
its a terrific privilege.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.680
You know, when I go to
Hong Kong, or Sao Paulo,

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.020
or Paris, or I'm just
thinking of places I've been

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.650
to recently, or Abu Dhabi,
in all of these places

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.470
it turns out all around the world there

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.130
are people who have
this sense of themselves

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:33.310
as philosophers engaged in a
massive longstanding global

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.638
conversation about important questions.

00:43:35.638 --> 00:43:38.640
- When you talk about cosmopolitanism

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.446
and you apply this rigorous analysis

00:43:42.446 --> 00:43:45.570
to what that means you're really coming up

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:47.750
with two propositions.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:52.580
One is that you have to care
about the other no matter what

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.270
the national boundaries are
but on the other hand you have

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:01.270
to respect what they are and the challenge

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:06.530
then becomes negotiating
that for you and for them.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:11.790
And I think you say, you
use the term conversation

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:16.040
in the sense of identifying with coming

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.770
to understand the experience of the other

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:23.370
so then there can be
conversation about where there

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.010
is disagreement and how we might agree.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:27.600
- Look I think the key insight

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.810
of the cosmopolitan tradition,
going back a very long way.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.000
Going back essentially to the beginnings

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.900
with you know, Dah-Jah-Knees
in the fourth century

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.400
before the common era, is that ache,

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.300
the obligation, the
fundamental moral obligation

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.530
to understand that we must
each do our fair share

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.670
to make sure every human
being has a possibility

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.740
of a decent life so we
care about everybody.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.580
Has to be combined with the recognition

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.660
that people are different
and that therefore what

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.910
the good life for them is different

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.090
and that to the greatest extent possible

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.160
we should allow people and communities

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.450
to figure this out for themselves.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:09.450
Now someone of a cosmopolitan,
that's the sort of theory,

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.620
but if you have a
cosmopolitan temperament you

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.760
are interested in how the other
people are working it out.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.590
You don't, I can't be a muslim

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.910
because that requires beliefs

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.690
that I don't find myself having

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.510
but I'm interested in how
muslims are handling the world.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.030
And I'm interested in recognizing

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.680
that there are many, many
different kinds of muslims

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.720
from Morocco to Indonesia
in the old muslim states

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.610
and many of course, muslims now

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.163
in Europe and North
America and Latin America.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.320
And they're engaged as I am,
in an experiment in living

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.630
as John Stuart Mill again said.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.670
They're trying to figure out
a way to live in the world.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.120
They have beliefs, they have practices,

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.220
they have ideas about how to live.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.580
They produce art, they produce literature,

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.910
they produce wonderful
poetry in the case of Islam.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.670
Things that I can, that I
value and can profit from.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.200
They also do things that
don't make sense to me.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.950
I don't understand everything about every,

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.200
I couldn't understand everything

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.860
about every muslim
tradition and they are many

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.660
of them committed to things
that I am deeply opposed to.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.180
If I'm in a conversation with people from

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.710
a muslim society about
with whom I disagree

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.170
about some important things

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.220
but with whom I can share my admiration

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.090
for Rumi as a poet or for Un-Kel-Tung

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:33.563
as a singer or whatever.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:38.220
And also our shared interest in soccer,

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:43.220
or tennis, or Hollywood
movies, or Hong Kong movies,

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.973
or Turkish movies.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.730
Against the background of
that shared conversation

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.330
we can then come upon the
things we disagree about

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.500
and handle them more effectively.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.320
I think we can agree to disagree.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.070
We can find practical points of compromise

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.840
without agreeing in theory.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.240
So one of my favorite
examples from this comes

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:13.240
from a British television
program about teenagers.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.270
And I'm not going to remember its name

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.053
but in which there's a young man

00:47:18.053 --> 00:47:23.053
of Pakistani origin, a
British Pakistani who

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.380
has a good friend of
his own age who he goes

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.570
to school with who's
English and white and gay.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:32.020
And the Pakistani boy's
father is a very devout muslim

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.940
and he won't tell his
father, he's straight,

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.200
but he won't tell his father
that his best friend is gay.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.500
And they're waiting
outside a birthday party

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.083
and the young gay boy won't come in.

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:46.380
And the friend comes out and says,

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.454
why are you standing outside?

00:47:47.454 --> 00:47:48.840
He said, because you
promised to tell your father

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.190
that I was gay and you haven't told him.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:52.470
So the father comes out at this point

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:54.565
and he says what are you doing outside?

00:47:54.565 --> 00:47:59.093
You know, my wife has made
your favorite Indian dishes.

00:48:00.071 --> 00:48:01.480
He says well because your son hasn't

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.865
told you something I
asked him to tell you.

00:48:02.865 --> 00:48:03.698
He said, well why don't you tell me?

00:48:03.698 --> 00:48:04.531
He says well I'm gay.

00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:05.510
And the father looks at him and he says,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.370
you know what Islam is
really important to me.

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:10.320
I love my time in the Mosque on Fridays.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.390
But I don't know everything.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:12.710
And here's something I do know.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.243
You are my son's best friend.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.710
That's not a concession
about the wrongness

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.040
or the rightness of homosexuality.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.100
That's saying, look we live together

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.420
in a world of people
who have different ways

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.410
of doing things and I
don't know everything

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:31.280
so I can accept and love
you as my son's friend

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.590
without our settling between
us some, from my point

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:37.390
of view, theoretical moral question.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.390
Conversable people, people
that are in conversation

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:42.350
with each other can do that.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:45.990
They can continue to respect
one another while disagreeing

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:48.853
about something important,
important to both of them.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:53.020
And I think that is sort of a model

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.390
for how we can live in the world knowing

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:59.290
that we won't agree about
really important things.

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.250
He's not asking the young man

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:05.290
to accept that he's a sinner or whatever.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:08.000
He's just asking him to
bracket it for the moment

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.561
and accept that what's going on here

00:49:09.561 --> 00:49:12.130
is a birthday party at which family

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:12.963
and friends are gathered together.

00:49:12.963 --> 00:49:15.653
And I think that's sort of a model.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.500
You know philosophers often, one

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.883
of the jokes about
philosophers is that we say,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.450
that works all very well in practice

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.070
but does it work in theory?

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:32.640
But in many contexts what matters
is what works in practice.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.170
So its the philosophers
who think that, as it were.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.910
Its fine to pursue the
theoretical question

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:38.510
but at a certain point cohabitation

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:41.800
is not a theoretical matter,
its a practical matter.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.660
And I'm just recommending
that as one element

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:49.660
of our armaments in the
struggle to cohabit peacefully

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.490
is to say lets just talk to one another.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.040
Not most of the time about
the things we disagree about.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.080
Lets talk most of the time about soccer,

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:02.340
and music, and art, and science,

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.560
and the things that are interesting to us.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.230
Lets go fishing together.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.220
Lets go mountain hiking together.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.050
Lets do things together, lets
be together in the world.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:17.050
Lets work together to improve
our children's schools, right.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.120
Understanding that we
won't always agree about

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.210
what they should be taught.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.300
Lets do all these things together

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.390
and then against that
background when I say

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:30.390
to you, you know what I think its not good

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.150
that you keep assuming its more important

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.500
for your son to get
educated than your daughter

00:50:39.262 --> 00:50:44.040
you don't think I'm some
hoity-toity condescending stranger.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.030
I'm a friend of yours who's
just expressing his view out

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:49.600
of love for you and your children.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.473
And that's more, that's
something you can accept.

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:56.230
And by the way, of course, if you say

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.340
that to someone you should expect them

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.030
to feel free then to say,
well okay since we're talking

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.210
about our children, do you really think

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:10.780
its okay that you're daughter's
dresses are so short?

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.100
Don't you think there's
an ideal of modesty

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.420
that's appropriate to women
and to girls and so on.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.490
So the conversation, its not just about

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:21.323
finally getting to the point

00:51:21.323 --> 00:51:22.860
where you can tell somebody off.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.143
Its about having a constant dialogue.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.180
- As I think back about your life

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.080
and try to relate it to your research.

00:51:30.919 --> 00:51:35.919
What just struck me was
that you were privileged

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.346
to experience this
cosmopolitanism, lets call it.

00:51:41.346 --> 00:51:43.600
And it just came to you naturally.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.177
And that what you're
helping to do in your work

00:51:47.177 --> 00:51:51.760
is understand the
complexity of these issues

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.350
because many people weren't blessed

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.440
with the same background and we have

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.270
to work at it through thinking
and analyzing and so on.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.570
And coming to a respect for the other.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.403
Is that fair?

00:52:05.403 --> 00:52:10.360
- No, no I think, I do feel
that I've had a blessed life.

00:52:11.537 --> 00:52:13.360
I mean I was incredibly lucky

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.550
in my family and our circumstances.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.533
And I say this despite the fact

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.369
that my father was imprisoned three times

00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:21.370
as a political prisoner, you know, lots

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:23.110
of bad things happened on the way.

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:27.770
But the basic thing was we
grew up in a loving family

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.250
that was in many places.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.020
And you know you my sisters now live

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.150
in three different countries

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.570
and none of them is the United States.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:36.470
So together we live in four countries.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.600
So yes, I think, and
their children you know,

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:46.740
I have nephews who speak
Norwegian and English

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.690
and German and Portuguese.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:51.520
I mean one set of nephews.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.520
Not a lot speak English in the Or-Oo-Bah.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.290
So they have too this wonderful privilege

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:58.940
and I do think its a privilege.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.610
And I think that the main thing that those

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.460
of us who've had the privilege can do

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:08.540
is to disabuse people of
the idea that its difficult

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.850
because against a background

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:14.700
of a loving family its not difficult.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.150
And to disabuse people of the idea

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:21.750
that there sort of terrible
intellectual challenges.

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.820
No, there are wonderful
intellectual resources, I think

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.480
that one derives from these things.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.890
Now I mentioned the Amish earlier.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.490
I'm not saying that I have the, I think

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:34.023
of my life as in these
respects privileged.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.540
I understand that there are people.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.920
People have different
temperaments, who want

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.920
to live a more monocultural life.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.560
I understand that there
are people who want

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.830
to retire into a Trappist monastery

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.980
and live a simple life as a monk.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.160
Or a Buddhist monastery, or a nunnery.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.620
I understand that there are
people who feel threatened

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.180
in their religions in
Switzerland when somebody says

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.700
they're going to build a
mosque, 'cause they like

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.533
it the way it is.

00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:09.015
They like the church of
the one denomination.

00:54:09.015 --> 00:54:11.694
They like the view of mountains and so on.

00:54:11.694 --> 00:54:14.270
I'm not denying that any of that is real

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:17.433
or that it should be wiped out.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.590
But I would like to
talk, if they invited me

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:24.150
to the village in Switzerland

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.040
to talk I would tell them about

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.210
the pleasures of a different
way of living in the world.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.220
A way of living in the world
that I think works better

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.453
now given the way that the world is.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:37.990
Look one of the things
that's happening in the world

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:42.890
is that because of these now
massive global conversations

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.490
though people remain incredibly
different from one another

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:50.980
there are many points
of convergence, right.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.060
So the people who were horrified

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:58.800
by the treatment of that Jordanian pilot

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.420
were not all in one place.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.410
They weren't all Jordanians.

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:05.730
They weren't all English
or American or Chinese.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.560
All around the world we
have a shared sense now

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.450
that which was the sort of thing

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.380
that in this country crowds gathered

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.370
to watch when they watched
lynchings 100 years ago, right.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:19.356
Its not so long ago that we
stopped doing things like that.

00:55:19.356 --> 00:55:22.080
There's just a developing global concerns.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.330
Its the same thing around
questions of women's rights.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.670
You know even in Saudi Arabia
which doesn't allow women

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:30.430
to drive there's a growing recognition

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.210
that there's a point to the thought

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.320
that the lives of women like the lives

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.700
of men require large areas of freedom

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.780
that women are entitled to, and so on.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.780
So the world is very diverse
and its growing more diverse

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.610
in someways, there are
new forms of diversity.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:52.870
But around certain important
ideas we're moving slowly

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.290
and with great difficulty
towards consensus.

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:57.010
And that's the great achievement I think

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:58.620
of the kind of human rights revolution

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.350
is to say look, we can
all live in our own ways.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.220
We don't all want to
live in the same society.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.670
We want to have different
countries, different nations,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.320
different political systems.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.690
But there are certain basic
background assumptions about

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.600
what human beings need to flourish

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.450
that should be guaranteed everywhere.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.640
We can disagree about the boundaries

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.180
of freedom of expression.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:23.610
In Germany you cannot publish
a copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf.

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:24.930
Its against the law.

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:26.850
In the United States
that would be an offense

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:28.413
against the first amendment.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.722
But Germany's history's
different from ours.

00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:35.590
We didn't build any death camps inspired

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:37.300
by Mein Kampf, right.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.540
So you can sort of see even if you're

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.360
a first amendment
fundamentalist you can see why

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.550
in Germany this might be, but the thought

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.050
that in Germany they should
stop people discussing

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.320
issues about the citizenship of muslims,

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.200
which they wouldn't do.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.780
Well of course they shouldn't do that.

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.180
So, and we wouldn't think they should

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.860
and we wouldn't want people to not be able

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.800
to discuss that here.

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:02.160
So there are local contours I
think, to these global values

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.570
but we're coming to a consensus

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:07.210
that the core of these things,
these values are there.

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.930
Even in China where there's a problem now

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.360
because they're increasingly making

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.860
it difficult for people to
express themselves freely,

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.120
even in China their constitution

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.760
guarantees freedom of expression.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.860
Now they interpret it in a way

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.690
that I can't make much sense of.

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.160
But we can appeal to them
to live up to this value

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.800
because its their value as well.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.890
I'm not telling them, oh you
should live up to this value

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.380
because its in the UN declaration

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.370
or because its in the
United States Constitution.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:36.970
I'm reading an article of
the Chinese constitution

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.720
that says that people in China are allowed

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.500
to talk to the government about
what they do and don't like.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.700
That guarantees them
freedom of expression.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.610
I'm saying, we agree with you about that

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:46.830
so lets see if we can do it.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:50.150
And if you wanna criticize us for failure

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:52.223
to live up to this standard, go ahead.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.740
Because I'll probably join you.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.570
I don't think the United States
is perfect in this respect.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:57:59.600
And if you want to criticize us

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.453
about other things, go ahead.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:06.560
If you wanna help improve
the United States remind us

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.620
that we call ourselves the home

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.590
of the free and we have a quarter

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:12.512
of the world's prisoners.

00:58:12.512 --> 00:58:13.860
A quarter of the world's
incarcerated people

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.670
are in the United States
and we only have 4%

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:16.970
of the world's population.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.340
Anybody, anywhere in the world looking

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:22.650
at us with our claims of freedom ought

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.730
to be saying to us, we ought to be saying

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:28.960
to ourselves, how did that happen?

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.386
How did the home of the free become

00:58:30.386 --> 00:58:32.793
the home of the massively incarcerated?

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:37.070
I think that people from
other countries looking

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:38.957
at us and asking in us,
not in a hostile way

00:58:38.957 --> 00:58:40.040
but just in a friendly way.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.440
We admire America, but
we don't understand this.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:47.230
Is helpful to us and we
should be helping other people

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.373
by asking similar questions about them.

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.760
- Professor Appiah, I
wanna thank you very much

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.576
for being on our program
and helping us understand

00:58:55.576 --> 00:59:00.576
these complex concepts that
can be seen as very simple.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.400
Once we actually analyze them.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.260
Thank you very much.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.093
- Thank you.

00:59:07.093 --> 00:59:08.660
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.577
for this conversation with history.

00:59:11.577 --> 00:59:14.077
