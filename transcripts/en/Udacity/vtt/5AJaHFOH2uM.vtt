00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.240
Let's imagine I have 20 of these games. Okay?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.890
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.438
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to play these games 20 times in

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:07.980
a row. Now what you've been doing is you've been

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.990
going forward. You've said, well, if I can get us

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.310
the right thing or if I can basically threaten you and

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.430
say. If you screw me over this time, I'll screw

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.080
you over from now on. Then maybe I can get you

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.800
to do the right thing and vice versa, since it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.410
a symmetric game. And then we'll end up doing the right

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.440
thing all along. And that makes a lot of sense, right?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.160
&gt;&gt; If you're going forward. But what

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.694
if you're going backward, Michael? Let's imagine

00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:37.480
we are doing [CROSSTALK]. What is amazing

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.280
to me is that is exactly backwards what

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.160
you just said. So, let's imagine we are doing these 20 dot dot dot dot,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.280
and now I'm on the 20th game, okay? What's going to happen on the 20th game?

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.490
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I guess I could have built up

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.440
trust in you from the previous games and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.800
think that you're going to cooperate with me, because we've

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.670
been cooperating together. And then that would be

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.540
the perfect time to drop a dime on you.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.882
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, if this is the 20th game and we're

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:03.834
in this situation, remember whatever value we've been adding up along

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:11.526
the way, that's sunk cost. Right. The

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:15.690
only thing that's left is the final game. And the final game looks like this,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.020
which means we're going to end up here.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.760
But guess what, Michael? The final one is

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.460
determined. So since we already know the outcome

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.970
of the final game, the only one that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.920
we, the next one that we can look at is the 19th game. Well, we already

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.310
know what the outcome of the final game

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.550
is. So this is effectively the last game.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.580
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
&gt;&gt; And what is the outcome of that

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.620
going to be? It's going to be this and backwards,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.770
backwards, backwards, backwards proof by induction because

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.340
the only that proves computer scientists know

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.920
how to do is proof by induction. It turns out that we will always defect

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.040
&gt;&gt; For what it's worth, those are the only proofs worth doing. But, okay.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.001
&gt;&gt; That's true. It's a fine point. Truth by induction and

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.890
perhaps by conduction [LAUGH]. So, there you go Michael, even if I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.600
can play multiple, multiple games to try to build up trust,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.650
the truth is the Nash equilibrium, if I filled out that eight

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.360
by eight matrix you wanted me to fill out. I would still

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.750
end up in the same place where I would defect both times.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.260
&gt;&gt; Certainly if, yeah okay, so if you're going to be a jerk then, then I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.410
have to be a jerk, but yeah, I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.610
guess that's right. That's, that seems pretty horrible.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.470
&gt;&gt; It is. And by the way this is not

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.840
just something I'm making up. This is another theorem that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.570
comes out of Nash equilibrium. That if you have an

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.890
n repeated game then the solution is n repeated, Nash

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.300
equilibrium. So whatever the Nash equilibrium is

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.540
for the first game, the one version

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.220
of the game, is the repeated Nash equilibrium for all versions of that game.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, wait a, hang on, hang on. So I. Okay, I buy that.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.320
&gt;&gt; But couldn't you, well so, in a game that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.680
has more than one Nash equilibrium, couldn't we like, al, alternate?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.500
&gt;&gt; We could, and in fact you'll notice that in so far,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.320
I have not talked about the case where you have multiple Nash equilibrium.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.500
Because in fact, that's it's own problem. If I have one

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.960
Nash equilibrium, then we know what's going to happen. If I have two

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.870
Nash equilibria, which one do we choose? Now, what's important to know

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.510
here, is that if we have two Nash Equilibria then that means

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.110
that if you're in any one of them, you won't leave

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.590
it. So it's not like you'll move from one Nash Equilibrium to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.900
another, sort of in the general case. Because the fact that it's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.370
an equilibrium means that if everyone else is fixed except one person,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.690
that person won't choose to move. But. I haven't said anything about how you

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.320
would choose among multiple Nash equilibria. And

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.260
that's beyond the scope of this class.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.290
&gt;&gt; But it is an active researcher and in fact

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.360
some of my own students have done some work in

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.280
thinking about. What it would mean to choose and actually

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.590
the answer always boils down to, let's not worry about that.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.460
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right. But I'm still kind of disturbed

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.040
by this, right? So it seems like it's sort of saying, is if we

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.380
knew the world was going to end tomorrow then we might as well be greedy

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.440
bastards. And, in fact, if we know that the world is going to end at

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.560
any particular time, which of course it

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.785
will. We might as well be greedy bastards.

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:03.870
&gt;&gt; That's right. So, be greedy bastards.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, no!

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.665
&gt;&gt; Or at least, or at least be you know, Nash bastards.

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:11.525
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll, the Nash is kind of greedy right, it's like I'm always

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:14.631
taking an action that's always best for me.

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:15.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, you are.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.930
&gt;&gt; No.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.310
&gt;&gt; Every single thing we've talked about today. Has always

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.040
assumed that you're always doing what's best for you. The fact

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.330
that it might also be best for someone else is

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.840
neither here nor there, you're always doing what's best for you.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.600
&gt;&gt; Right, I get, I get that, but it's, it sounds like this argument is saying

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.300
that we might as well be like that, like all the time and never really form,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.470
like never, never self-sacrifice even a little

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.150
bit for greater advantage even to yourself.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.830
&gt;&gt; Well, that's not true. This, it's just

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.274
all hidden in the utilities, once you've gone through

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:48.938
all the what I'm going to do today, what

00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:50.810
I'm going to do tomorrow, you add it all up,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.590
whatever the right strategy is to take. That's

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.000
the strategy that you take because it's already accounted

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.940
for all the self-sacrfice you might do that then

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.430
leads to later good deeds or later good outcome.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.970
So the wonderful thing about all of this, is that this

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.610
matrix is everything you need to know. It captures the future, past

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.960
and everything else, so everything you need to know is right

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.360
here. And it's all been reduced to a bunch of pairs of

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.170
numbers. But you did say something kind of interesting though, Michael,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.290
which I think is worth pointing out, which is that everything you

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.060
say requires knowing when, at least in this sort of iterated version,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.540
requires knowing when the world is going to end. So an interesting question

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.960
to ask would be, what would happen if I knew the world

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.360
was going to end but I didn't know when. Would that change my behavior.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.290
&gt;&gt; It, it doesn't seem like that

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.620
should make any difference because it's still

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.895
going to end. If not today then tomorrow. Or if not tomorrow then the next day.

00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:43.560
&gt;&gt; True. But I bet yeah it does make a difference.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.890
&gt;&gt; I'm willing to go and think about that.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, why don't you go think about it and let me know.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.370
&gt;&gt; Alright. I'll, I'll tell you about it in the next lecture then.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that. Excellent. Okay, cool. So,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.120
let's move on.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.530
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, fair enough.
