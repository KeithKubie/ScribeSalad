yeah<00:22:18.170><c> strangely</c><00:22:19.130><c> enough</c><00:22:19.310><c> and</c><00:22:20.210><c> maybe</c><00:22:20.390><c> it's</c><00:22:20.510><c> cuz</c>

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:20.660 align:start position:0%
yeah strangely enough and maybe it's cuz
 

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
the plot to this one I think is a weaker
it's<00:22:22.370><c> definitely</c><00:22:22.640><c> more</c><00:22:22.730><c> character-driven</c>

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.210 align:start position:0%
it's definitely more character-driven
