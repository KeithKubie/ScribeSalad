00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.450


00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.226
&gt;&gt; Good morning and
happy anniversary.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.546
This is the 10th year.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.580
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.433
&gt;&gt; The 10th year of the National
Book Festival and it is people

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.673
like you, book lovers and people who
love to come and meet authors who--

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.123
and aren't afraid to show it,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.856
who make this great
institution possible.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.790
Before we begin, I
want to inform you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.113
that the pavilion's presentations
are being filmed for the Library

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.450
of Congress, for the website
and for their archives.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.576
So, if you step up
and ask a question,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900
you are going down in history.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.343
I want you to be aware
of that [laughter].

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.856
And please don't sit
on the camera risers

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.443
and turn off your cellphones
if you would.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.510
Thank you.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.643
I am Marie Arana.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.376
I am a writer at large for The
Washington Post and I'm here

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.376
to introduce your host,
Dr. James Billington

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.970
who has been the United
States Librarian of Congress

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.970
for 23 marvelously productive years.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.346
&gt;&gt; He is only the 13th
person to hold the position

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.603
since the library was
established 210 years ago.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.833
Think about that.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.846
There have been 43 presidents
from John Adams to Barrack Obama

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.086
but there have only
been 13 librarians

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.163
of Congress during that time.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.500
Dr. Billington's accomplishments
are legend and legendary.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.433
Allow me to mention a few.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.643
He is the force behind the Librarian
National Digital Library Program

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.623
which makes available
online, millions and millions

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.380
of publications from the
Library of Congress as well

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.120
as from other libraries and research
institutions around the globe.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.270
He created the James Madison
Council whose members helped govern

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.643
and shape the important
work that the library does.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.000
He is the founder of the John W.
Kluge Center, a haven for scholars

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.633
around the world who
produce a wider array

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.886
of ground-breaking scholarship.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.963
He's established unprecedented
exchange programs with Russia

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.050
which is in fact, his
personal field of scholarship.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.490
But in truth, he's built bridges
with regions all around the world.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.766
Perhaps, most important at least
today on the 10th anniversary

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.773
of this magnificent
living institution,

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.413
Dr. Billington is the mastermind
behind the National Book Festival

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.873
along with Laura Bush and this
festival as you well know,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.703
is one the great public
celebrations of books

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.936
and reading in this country.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.470
It's a great honor to
introduce a national treasure,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.503
the director of the National Book
Festival and the US Librarian

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.876
of Congress, Dr. James Billington.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.110
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.266
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
Marie and welcome.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.666
Welcome to you all for this 10th
Annual National Book Festival

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.176
for our opening ceremonies and
this is a milestone anniversary

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.710
of what we have been calling a
decade of words and wonder dedicated

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.003
to the celebration of books,
reading to literacy and libraries,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.946
and above all, to the wonderful
experience of one author speaking

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.310
to one individual,
individuals of all ages.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.043
We thank you for being here and let
me just say a word of special thanks

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.703
to Marie Arana who does

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.523
such a wonderful special
job of introducing--

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.590
[ Applause ]

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.026
&gt;&gt; Supported by our honorary chairs,
President Obama and Michelle Obama

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.576
and organized by the
library, the wonderful staff,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.296
all these shirts you see
with National Book Festival,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.006
these are Library of Congress
volunteers of their own time.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.636
They're not getting overtime for
this but they want to be here

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920
because this is a corporate
expression of your library,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.766
The National Library, a
commitment to all of these

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.316
and libraries everywhere.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.450
As we bring up the curtain.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.150
[ Applause ]

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.910
&gt;. As we bring up the curtain
on this very happy occasion,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.470
we realize that there will be you
adults here in this very audience

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.356
and throughout the day
who have virtually grown

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.580
up with the National Books Festival.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.000
The offerings here are so varied.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.026
Our authors so diverse and skilled
that it's possible to come back year

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.713
after a year, not only not
have the same experience twice

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.770
but to find some new forum
of enrichment as well as fun

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.083
because this is an
enjoyable festive atmosphere.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.753
It's a festival not a grim
duty and it's just great

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.183
to see you all here on a clear day.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.486
We've welcomed so far over the
decade about a million book lovers

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.026
of all ages to the National
Book Festival and this year,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.956
the festival has a
particularly international flavor.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.103
On our stages today, we have
several authors from variety

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.526
of nations who've won prestigious
international awards including the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.273
Noble Prize for literature, we
welcome them all and we await

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.623
to hear their stories
with great interest.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.603
Everybody loves a good
story, stories unify people,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.273
theories tend to divide them.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.783
America's a pretty great
story composed of a lot

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.830
of individual stories and our
authors today span the globe

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.383
as well as our own nation.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.716
So, it's a distinct privilege
to introduce our opening author,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.250
Isabel Allende who is
known throughout the world,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.163
is a best selling Chilean-American
writer,

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.980
born in Lima where her father
was a Chilean Ambassador.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.790
Her uncle is Chilean
President, Salvador Allende,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.783
who was assassinated in
a military coup in 1973.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.743
Believing it unsafe to remain in
Chile, under those conditions,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.970
Isabel and her husband and two
children fled to Venezuela.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.156
While in exile, she wrote her first
novel, The House of the Spirits,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.023
which was made into a film in 1994.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.583
Her works weave wonderful elements
of that special quality of writers

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.080
in our neighbors to the South.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.973
In this hemisphere,
the magical-realism

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.503
which she's helped bring to us
and which often depicts women

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.453
and their struggles with
particular sensitivity.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.336
She has written many
novels and other works,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.810
such as plays and children's
stories.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.466
Her most recent novel is The Island
Beneath the Sea, Harper Collins.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.236
Following this morning's
presentation,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.720
she will receive this year's Library

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.206
of Congress National Book Festival
Creative Achievement Award.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.893
Sorry, that's a lot of words.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.510
[ Applause ]

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.296
&gt;&gt; That's a lot of words but
she has such a universal range

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.766
and such wonderful sense of humor
and humanity that we wouldn't work

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.446
on reducing the name of that
prize in her honor to an acronym.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.680
Ladies and gentlemen, Isabel Allende
who will be interviewed this morning

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.783
by author and Washington
Post writer Marie Arana

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.083
and then she will be
followed by Dr. Deanna Marcum,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.890
the head of this year's Library of
Congress Team for the Book Festival

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.723
who will present this special
non-acronym even if a little long

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.763
in truth but short in wonderful
expression of direct feeling

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:07.643
of gratitude for her giving
this international flavor.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.623
She is an American citizen who
we're very proud of and proud

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.116
to give this award to and
once again, welcome to you all

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.320
and welcome to your families,
your friends, and everyone else

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.430
that can help make this
a really festive evening.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.396
Ladies and gentlemen, now, Marie--

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.863
and no, one last word
[audience laughter].

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.530
This is not just the
10th anniversary

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:30.853
of what we've already
done but we have,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.226
thanks to a very special
donor the assurance

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.196
of another five years
not just next year.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.530
[ Applause ]

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.516
&gt;&gt; So. So, please give a
special round of applause

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.346
to our special donor, a great
friend of things in this city

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:55.860
that are important to the country
as a whole, David Robinson.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.153
Please take a bow, sir.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
[ Applause ]

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.833
&gt;&gt; And now, that wonderful

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.366
and amazing spirit Marie
Arana and Isabel Allende.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.753
Thank you very much.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920
[ Applause ]

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.286
&gt;&gt; Is this thing working?

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.620
&gt;&gt; Oh good.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.983
Okay. Well, Isabel Allende is
obviously very well known to you.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:35.523
And she has been beloved to you.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.523
She's been translated into 30
languages, sold 60 million copies

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.420
of her books around the world.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.306
&gt;&gt; Where is the money?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000


00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.730
[ Laughter ]

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.133
&gt;&gt; She is read everywhere
from Rio de Janeiro to Tokyo

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.413
and what people don't know is
what you are going to discover

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.106
as I've discovered over these
15 years of knowing Isabel is

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.553
that she is apart from being
this unbelievable work horse

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.190
who works 10 hours a day and gets
up at 6:15, works 10 hours a day.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.906
Starts every book on
January 8th [laughter].

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.466
Works round the clock.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.733
Apart from that, she is a remarkably
warm wonderful human being and I am

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.666
so glad to have her here.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.533
Thank you for coming to the
festival right at the top.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Thank you.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000


00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300
[ Applause ]

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:33.973
&gt;&gt; Okay. Let's start
with present history.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.760
The Island Beneath the Sea.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.126
You've written a very stirring
book about Haitian woman,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.730
a slave mulatto, who survives the
violent Haitian revolution barely

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.143
and comes to New Orleans at the
turn of the century, 19th century.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.896
Clearly, you chose the subject
before Haitian earthquake happened

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.166
possibly before hurricane Katrina.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.576
What led you to it?

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.576
Tell us about that.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.396
&gt;&gt; Well actually, I wasn't
planning to write about a slave.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.803
I was planning to write
about New Orleans,

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.340
the city that is just
fascinating, very different

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.773
from all the other
cities in this country.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.120
And probably unique in the world
and much of its flavor comes

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.353
from 10,000 French white colonizers

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.943
that escaped the slave revolt
in what is today, Haiti.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:27.673
And they went to New Orleans
where they bought land

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.063
and they established themselves.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.323
They came with their
white families of course

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.510
but they also brought some
domestic slaves that they trusted.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.876
Slavery was not abolished
at that time

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.753
in the United States but trade was.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.713
So, you couldn't bring slaves
from abroad but the pirates

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:49.860
of the Caribbean were
selling slaves.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.046
So, this input of Africans into
the country was very important

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.350
in this city and there was a
large population of free people,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.180
of color with their own
culture, with their cuisine,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.426
with their music, and that's what
has given that city its flavor.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:12.410
&gt;&gt; Now it's a very intriguing
title which I'm not sure.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.383
I've read the book
but I don't remember

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.050
that you actually really explicitly
explained the island beneath

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.860
the sea.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.126
Tell us about that.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.060
That's a marvelous lyrical title?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.750
&gt;&gt; Well, the slaves that we're
kidnapped and sold in Africa came

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:34.303
from different places in Africa.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.246
They had different
religions, different languages,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.093
and different ethnicities.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.473
They we're not homogenous
at all and one of the things

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:44.920
that the slave traders
did was separate people

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.240
from the same village
or the same family

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.030
because when people are
together, they are empowered

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.053
and so they would separate
them and sell them separately.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.926
However, in Haiti, they developed
a sort of bastardized French mixed

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.083
with African words that became
Creole, the language they spoke.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.053
They communicated with
the drums and they had

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.100
in common a spiritual
belief that we call voodoo.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.076
And it is a mixture of, there
were many Muslims also that came

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.510
as slaves and animists
and different religions

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.363
and they created this religion
that was extraordinary.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.010
They believed in one god only.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.253
You cannot reach that god.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.050
It's too far away but
there are the loas who--

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.610
who are like the saints
in the Catholic Church

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.140
and the loas have different
functions in the spiritual world.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.253
There's one for day,
one for love, et cetera.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.100
And during the ceremonies in trance,
the practitioner would be mounted

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.943
by the Loa and become the
Loa and they would have--

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.210
these people who had no power,
no control of their lives at all.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.393
They would have the
experience of the divine.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.163
The experience and the
power of the divine

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.910
and that empowerment allowed them
to face the troops of Napoleon

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.216
which where the best trained
troops in Europe and defeat them.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.643
They believed that for every
man or woman that was fighting,

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.323
10,000 souls had risen from
the island beneath the sea

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.746
to fight with them.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.946
The island beneath the sea
was paradise, [inaudible],

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.346
the place where your
soul went when you died

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:35.260
and so that's the title of the book.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.146
&gt;&gt; Now, a few people realize
as Isabel so clearly describes

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.973
in this book the incredibly
bloody revolution

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.250
at the Haitian revolution was.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.716
It was a roiling time.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.916
Everything was burned to the
ground and for a long time,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.556
Haiti was ignored by the world.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.683
This is a really quite amazing
bit of history which affected

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.963
of course Louisiana and New
Orleans because in the way

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.963
that Cubans have created and defined
Miami, the French from Haiti,

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.930
the white overlords and the
black slaves define Louisiana.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.620
Tell us about your
research for this.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.640
How did that started?

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.773
How did you conduct it?

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.843
&gt;&gt; Well, first, I want to say
that this is a book about a slave

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:34.103
and the subject of slavery is of
course very important in the book

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.230
but it's really a human story.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.830
It is not awful to read.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.346
It's actually, I think,
very entertaining

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.896
so please buy it [laughter].

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.563
Yeah. What was the
question [laughter]?

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.960
&gt;&gt; How did you research
this incredibly entertaining

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.193
novel [laughter]?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.126
&gt;&gt; Well, plagiarizing of course

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.433
because that's what you
do when you research.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.360
First, you read the history books
but the history books are written

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.466
by the white men and they're
always written by the winners.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.840
You never hear the voices
of the people of color,

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.513
the losers, the victims, the women.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.483
You never know how people really
lived and so then there is,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.350
correspondence, memoirs,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.600
the libraries who can provide
wonderful stuff of course

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.673
and the rest also is a
little bit of imagination

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560
because once you have the time

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:33.646
and the place researched
then you write about people.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.740
It's their stories and
people are the same.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.693
We tend to think that people who had
lived before us were simple minded.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.230
No they didn't have the technology
maybe but they were just as complex

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.596
and if you read any of the letters
or the documents at that time,

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.410
even written by slaves
like [inaudible].

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.360
They're extraordinary
pieces of literature.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.266
People had really a very
sophisticated way of writing

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.713
and thinking and living and so
just imagining how they would

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.930
behave today.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.226
I can write about what happened
then because people are the same.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.566
We all feel the same
and we felt the same

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.923
and we felt the same 200 years ago.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.206
&gt;&gt; There's nobody who makes
that point I think better

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.683
than Isabel Allende in
her historical novels.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.156
She has written quite a few.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.023
Since the House of the Spirits, it's
been 28 years since that book and--

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.346
&gt;&gt; Oh my God, am I old [laughter]?

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.146
&gt;&gt; No. You've written 16 books.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.370
All of them--

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.370
&gt;&gt; No 18.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.370
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.303
&gt;&gt; 18 books, 17 since
that first one and boy,

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.486
I've gotta be really sharp
I'm coming [inaudible].

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.686
And every single one of
those books was different.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.526
It seems to me from Eva Luna right
through to Paula, Ines of My Soul

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.896
to This Island Beneath the Sea.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.030
Each one is very, very different.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.493
What makes you want to experiment
as you do because every single book

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:15.166
to me is a different experience,
another Isabel Allende is.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:18.900
&gt;&gt; Well, I wish one
could do the same

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.873
with husbands, you know [laughter].

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.466
Keep experiencing new husbands
that would be wonderful but,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.230
so I live in my books all the stuff
that I can't live in my real life.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.970
Once I was in a meeting
with librarians.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.793
It was a huge conference
of librarians.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:41.616
It was mainly middle aged women
with glasses and a little overweight

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.603
and one person in the audience
said, the first question was,

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.020
are the sex scenes in your books
from real experience [laughter]

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600


00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.656
and I looked at the audience
and realized I couldn't lie

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.496
so I said I wish [laughter].

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.096
&gt;&gt; It's just research
and imagination.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:08.760
So it's the same for the
subject of the books.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.733
I don't know why.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.806
Every story is like a seed inside
and some seeds start to grow

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.093
and grow and I think that it's
always related with something

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:22.943
that is really important for me.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.056
It's either a cause or
an idea or an experience

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.663
that has a very personal
meaning and then I start writing

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.936
without a script and
the story unfolds

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.226
and then I don't know
why I'm writing about it.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.826
Why would I write about
an African slave?

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.390
Culturally, I'm not close at all.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.506
Physically, she's completely
different from me.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.413
Why would I write about that?

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.080
And I think that it has to
do with empowerment of women

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.356
and the obsession that I
have always had with freedom

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.290
and justice not freedom
in the-- can you hear me?

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.530
Not freedom in the, you know,
the big word, internal freedom,

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.783
the way that you can have choices
because freedom is about choices

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.663
and that has always been
really important for me

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:19.736
and the slaves have none so in this
case, why would I write about this,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.636
because it's an extreme case of
what has always been my obsession

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.233
and in all my books, you
would find marginal people

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.146
who are not sheltered by the big
umbrella of their establishment,

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.413
people who have to overcome huge
obstacles to have a destiny at life.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.363
I'm not interested in suburban
middle class white guys [laughter].

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.520
I couldn't write a novel about
Wall Street, about Washington.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200
I couldn't.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.333
I can write about people who are
outside who are in the margins

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.566
of the society for
different reasons, ethnicity

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.543
or sometimes a physical
disability or a gender option.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.973
Things like that.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.840
That's what interests me most.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.173
&gt;&gt; You know, you're making me--
you're reminding me that last year

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.070
on this very stage, John Irving
was talking and of course,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.413
he has written a lot of books
too and he said in the process

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.143
of his presentation that
every single one of the books

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.983
that he had written actually was
part of one big book and it seems

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.980
to me that that's what
you're saying.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.766
You have created one major opus
really of the women who struggles

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.383
against extraordinary odds and
extraordinary adversity and somehow

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.810
through love and through
perseverance wins.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.020
Is that true?

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.700
&gt;&gt; In a way, it's true but I've also
written a book about a man that goes

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.206
through the same circumstances.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.286
Actually, in 1987, I was
passing by California.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.806
I was living in Venezuela
then and I met a guy.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:19.953
He was introduced to me as
the last heterosexual bachelor

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.526
in San Francisco [laughter].

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.226
And he started telling
me his life and I said--

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.460
he said that he wanted to
write his life and I said,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.830
why don't you let me do it?

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.296
I would probably do a
better job and so we spent--

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.843
then I went to bed with
him of course [laughter]

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.660
because that's how you
get the stories, you know.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.280
Very intimately and I
ended up marrying him

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.860
because I needed a list an
American visa [laughter].

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.460
I would be married for 23 years
and that's the story of a man

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.330
and it's told in the voice of a man.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.216
So it's not always a woman and
then I have a trilogy for kids,

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.636
not for kids, for young
adults, that is also told not

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.280
from the point of view for woman.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.503
&gt;&gt; I also want to ask you about
your family history which is

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.556
such a big part of
your persona in a way.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.630
I think a lot of people have
it wrong I found out by going

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.983
into the internet and seeing that
a lot of people actually believe

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.383
that you we're the daughter
of Salvador Allende.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.903
You we're actually the daughter
of a cousin of Salvador Allende

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.923
but that September 11 which greatly
precedes many, many years ago.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.553
It was 1973 the September 11
that happened ten years ago.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.926
It was dramatically
imprinted on your life and was

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.616
in many ways I think perhaps the
impetus because it booted you

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.813
out of your own country and made you
an exile for the rest of your life.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.910
Could you tell us a
little bit about that sort

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.910
of the political aspect
of your background?

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.070
&gt;&gt; Well, I was related
to Salvador Allende.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.756
He has a daughter called Isabel
Allende who is very political and so

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.026
when she is asked to sign my
books, she does [laughter].

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.093
And when I am told that I was
marching with the communist in Rome,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.130
I said yeah, yeah, I was [laughter].

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:39.630
So why are you going
to explain so much.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.630
She is taller, she has blue eyes and
on September 11th, a Tuesday also

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.466
at the same time of the
September 11th here.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.226
In 1973, we had a military coup

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.803
which was a terrorist attack
against the democracy.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.170
The strongest and longest
democracy in Latin America in Chile

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.790
and it was back by the CIA
by the way and that gave-and

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.686
that started a dictatorship
that lasted almost 17 years.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.973
Many people died.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.440
Many people disappeared.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.106
Many people were tortured and many
people left the country either

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.380
because they were expelled
and they became exiles

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.033
or they chose to leave.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.566
I chose to live.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.460
I couldn't live in terror in my
own country and I went and lived

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.273
as a political refugee in Venezuela
for 13 years until I met that guy

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.076
in San Francisco [laughter].

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.343
So, my life has always been as
a foreigner and I've always felt

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.330
that I am not under the big
umbrella of the establishment.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.736
I, of course now, I'm legal
by the way [laughter].

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.643
But, I still feel like a foreigner.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.960
I will always look different, always
have an accent and then I go back

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.986
to Chile and after a couple of
weeks, I feel foreign there too

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.870
because I've changed and the country
has changed and it's hard sometimes.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.060


00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.180
&gt;&gt; Now, I mentioned before the
fact that you begin every book

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.253
on January 8, is this
your sort of rigorous side

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.353
or is this your superstitious side?

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.750
&gt;&gt; It is both.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.483
I wrote the house of--
I started the House

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.816
of The Spirits, my first novel.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.476
I sent a letter to my
grandfather on January 8,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.186
1991 and it was a very lucky book.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.420
This very seldom happens
that a first novel

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.093
from a totally unknown person
hits the market and in Europe,

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.003
in less than 3 months, it had been
bought by almost every language

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.003
in Europe and it became a
huge success immediately.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.883
That paved the way for all my
other books which are not as good

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.870
as the first by the way
[laughter] and so I thought,

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.710
well, this is a lucky book.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:06.936
I will start my second book
on a lucky day, January 8th.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.616
And then, I did the same
thing for 3 or 4 books

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.420
and then it became a matter of
discipline because my life was very,

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.400
very complicated and if I don't
save a few months of the year

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.243
without traveling and without any
social activity just lock myself

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:27.870
away to write, I won't
be able to do it.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.976
So now, it's discipline
and superstition.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:33.456
And by the way, it's Elvis
Presley's birthday [laughter]

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.576
which is also a lucky thing.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.980
[ Laughter ]

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.146
&gt;&gt; Now, you've been called the most
successful Latin-American female

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.133
author in the world.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800
&gt;&gt; Author.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.266
Not female [laughter].

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.533
&gt;&gt; Female author in your own.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000


00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800
[ Laughter ]

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.466
&gt;&gt; Why do we have to
make the difference?

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800
[ Applause ]

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.600
&gt;&gt; That was going to
be my question to you.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.200
You are the distinction is
really ridiculous, right?

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.200
I mean, in fact, Isabel
Allende is, well I know this

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.053
because I checked it out, sells
more today in contemporary life

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.193
than Cervantes, then Garcia
Marquez, then Carlos Fuentes.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.286
The numbers are there.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.420
Now, that distinction was
exactly what I wanted to ask.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.000
How do you look on the female role
of authors and how and what sort

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.686
of struggle do you have to make

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.253
that male authors perhaps
don't have to make?

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.686
&gt;&gt; Well, any woman has to
be twice as good as any man

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.163
to get half the recognition
and respect [applause].

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.283
Fortunately, that is not difficult.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.510
[ Laughter ]

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.790
&gt;&gt; So [laughs].

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:00.476
So, as a writer, I'm always
called a narrator, a story teller,

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.903
a female writer, when
you add an adjective

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:06.470
to the word literature,
you diminish it.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.030
The moment you say
African-American literature

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.430
or Latin-American literature
or female literature

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.100
or young-adult literature,
it's less.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.430
When it's just literature, it's
white males that are writing.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:21.560
So, I don't like the distinction.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.453
I think that I use the same
raw material, words and ideas

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:28.240
than any man and I'd write
books that are just as good.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.100
So, I don't want to be separated.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.466
Why would I separate myself?

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.100
[ Applause ]

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760
&gt;&gt; I love that.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760
[ Applause ]

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.503
&gt;&gt; Now, eventually, we're going to
get to questions from the audience

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:50.816
which is really the important part
or this presentation but I had

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.356
such fun a few years ago doing
the Proust questionnaire.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.223
Do you know about Proust
questionnaire?

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, don't do that to me.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.690
Please.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:00.823
&gt;&gt; Oh. I'm gonna do it [laughs].

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.690
&gt;&gt; Please.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.690
&gt;&gt; The Proust questionnaire
which is very, very silly and fun

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.090
and all your answers were wonderful.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.823
&gt;&gt; You want me to remember them.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:11.690
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:12.756
I want [simultaneous talking]--

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.823
&gt;&gt; I'm asking you different
questions this time.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.490
So here we go this is
Proust Questionnaire.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.490
What is your favorite
word in any language?

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.890
&gt;&gt; Sex [applause].

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.956
It's universal you know,
same with every language.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.930
&gt;&gt; What is the word
you absolutely hate?

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.220
&gt;&gt; Violence.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.086
Because of what it means.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.153
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid to ask
you the next question

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.326
because I think the answers
gonna be the same as the first.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.900
What turns you on?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.500
&gt;&gt; Chocolate [applause] ha!

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.606
And another thing if
someone murmurs in my ear.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.936
You know the only way that
women listen is when you whisper

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.316
in their ear and the
G-spot is here [applause].

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.013
That turns me on.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.880
&gt;&gt; Ayayay.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.613
What is your idea of hell?

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:17.096
&gt;&gt; Being in a prison, in a cell, in
a closed place where I can't escape

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.840
and I have no power over my life.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.410
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a writer's desk.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.183
&gt;&gt; No, because in the writer's desk
you fly, you are with the character,

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.403
you are the characters,
you are in the story.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.736
Oh there is-- it's
incredible freedom.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.510
[ Applause ]

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.210
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
hero or heroine in fiction?

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:44.403
&gt;&gt; There are many but I love Zorro.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.223
You know why I love Zorro?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.146
Because Zorro is an action hero

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.496
that has no special powers he's
just a guy, a young guy athletic,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.343
humorous, not violent who humiliates
the enemy but doesn't kill

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:08.383
and who just puts on a mask
and fights for justice.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:10.856
We can all do that, we
can all put on a mask

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.583
or not and fight for justice.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.930
We don't need any special powers
and I love the fact that he is,

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.173
what do we call him in
Spanish leviano de sangre

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.766
with a light blood.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.100
I mean he is funny, he is athletic,
he is young, he is just wonderful.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.073
The lightness of being.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.300
&gt;&gt; Marvelous.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:34.523
Now who is your favorite
hero or heroine in real life?

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.076
&gt;&gt; Actually my mother.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.110
[ Applause ]

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.253
&gt;&gt; No comment after that absolutely

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.793
and we would all probably
say the same.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.673
What is the quality you
most admire in a writer?

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.040
&gt;&gt; The capacity to grab
the reader by the neck

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.240
and hold the reader
to the last page.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.763
As a reader I don't want to be
bored, so I can take anything

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.206
as long as you keep me interested.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.916
I love the fact that you-- a page
competes with films, with fear,

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.223
with music, with things that have
so much vibrancy and elements

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.113
and technology and it's just a flat
page with little fly things there

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.466
and you get hooked you go in there
and you become part of the story.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.943
A writer that can do
that is a hero to me.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.510
[ Applause ]

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.980
&gt;&gt; And she does that.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.056
What is the sound that
you most dread?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.846
&gt;&gt; Actually I think that I remember
very clearly the hawker hunters,

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:05.043
the planes that bombed the palace
in Chile on September 11 and I fear

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.680
that very much, the sound of war.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.953
&gt;&gt; Now if heaven exists

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.863
and you finally make it
to heaven's door, right.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.320
What would you like to
say when He greets you?

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.466
&gt;&gt; Hi! Come in tell me a story.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.190
[ Applause ]

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:41.910
&gt;&gt; Now we're ready to take
your questions so please,

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.950
there are two microphones
here and come up.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.866
&gt;&gt; Don't be shy.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.866
&gt;&gt; Don't be shy.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.466
&gt;&gt; So here's my question.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.183
What's your process during
the day, you know for writing,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.973
I mean do you have to write
over your garage or do you write

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.623
in the morning or do you get
really creative at night.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.946
What's your process
for writing everyday?

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.753
&gt;&gt; I get up very early.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.673
I have a wonderful husband
who brings me coffee to bed

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.360
and I think that's just such a
wonderful luxury and very early I go

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.996
to a little casita that I
have in the back of our garden

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.696
where I keep my first editions,
dictionaries, maps, and the research

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:25.670
that I have done for the book
and I just lock myself there

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:31.203
and write all day until
Willie calls me for dinner.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.283
And so I don't know what I'm going
to eat but he has set the table

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.050
and he has food on the
table so that's my day.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:42.370
It is not very interesting but
that's the time when I'm writing.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:43.006
When I'm not writing then
I can be with the family

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:45.450
and I travel and I do lots of stuff.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.216
But I have to research a lot

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:49.603
so when I'm not writing
I'm reading for my work.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.496
&gt;&gt; Wonderful, thank you very much.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.036
&gt;&gt; What are you reading right now?

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.470
&gt;&gt; What am I reading?

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:04.536
Actually I am reading a book by
Azar Nafisi, a memoir of her family.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.116
This is what I started last night.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.713
&gt;&gt; High, this is not working?

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.960
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's working.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, I've been
following your career

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.403
because I'm also a Latin
American woman and I've read all

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:23.516
of your books and it's wonderful
to be able to meet you today,

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.916
I'm really honored to be here--

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.090
&gt;&gt; And I would like to know
what's in the works now?

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.036
What can we expect?

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.246
What are we-- I've always looked
forward to the next book so--

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.393
&gt;&gt; You can give us a hint.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.793
&gt;&gt; Well I'm going to take
a sabbatical next year

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.260
and do nothing, nothing.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.290
But I already finished
another book just in case.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.600
And I still have to pay the bills

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.843
and the book is a very different
book it's a contemporary book.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:59.570
It happens in 2009 to a young
19-year-old American girl

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.526
from California who gets in deep
trouble and then her grandmother

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.310
who is Chilean sends her away,
sends her to a very remote island

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:12.776
in the archipelago of
Chiloe in the south of Chile

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.076
where life is very rural,
almost medieval and she has

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.506
to change all these
technology and all the fuss

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.190
and all the noise for
a time of silence.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.023
And what happens in her soul.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:30.090
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was wondering if you
have read Madison Smartt Bell's

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.550
books on--

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.550
&gt;&gt; Yes--

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.106
&gt;&gt; Haitian revolution and
how if they influenced--

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.260
&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.926
okay, Madison Smartt Bell has
written a lot about Haiti.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.926
He has a wonderful trilogy that
is fiction and he has biographies

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:50.850
of Toussaint Louverture
that are extraordinary

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.523
and of course I read
them and as I said

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.390
when you research you
also read fiction.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.220
You don't read only history books

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:02.633
because other writers
have already researched

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.946
and also they have contributed.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.613
So of course it influenced me and
of course I am very grateful to him

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.306
and to other writers of
fiction that wrote about slavery

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:14.560
and wrote about-- because not only--

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.983
I mean you can find all the
information in the history books

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.243
but when you read fiction you're
really getting into everyday life

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.923
and that's so interesting.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.763
&gt;&gt; Because also his
writing seems very bloody

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.816
&gt;&gt; Wonderful but of course it's very
bloody because Haiti at the time--

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:35.816
I mean-- it was called Saint
Domingue, slaves were expected

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:38.510
to live in the plantations
between 4 and 6 years.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.296
They were exploited to death

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.563
with the most horrible
bloody cruel punishments.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:47.756
So of course it's a
very violent trilogy.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.750
&gt;&gt; Over here, please.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.683
&gt;&gt; I read the La casa de
los spiritus when I was 16

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:56.493
and it changed the direction of my
entire life it was an amazing book

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.540
but one of the things that's always
puzzled me is the relationships

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.530
oftentimes were abusive but
the woman maintained this love

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.100
for their husbands like remaining
in the home even after he hit her

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.540
and knocked her teeth out,
she remained in the home,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.423
her spirit remains in the home
looking after him and loving him

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.536
and as someone who is such a force

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.876
for female empowerment I was
wondering the reasoning behind that?

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah well if I would
write a book about a husband

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.576
who hits his wife today
a contemporary story

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:35.500
of course she would get out of
that relationship but at the time

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.540
in the 1900s, 1930, 1940 women

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:44.083
in Chile could not get
out of a relationship.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.290
There was no divorce an
there was no greater scandal

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.393
than leaving your husband.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:54.330
And that's what my mother
did actually, my mother

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.443
and my father separated
and my mother was blamed

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:05.036
for it although my father was to
be blamed so the story is placed

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.823
at a time when women did not have an
outlet and I think that in the case

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.860
of that couple in particular
he adored her,

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.873
he was just a very angry man.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.203
And a very unhappy man
but he really adored her,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:22.453
so that the relationship
is much more complex

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200
than just a violent man
and a submissive wife.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.400


00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.963
&gt;&gt; My students are reading And
of Clay Are We Created this week

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:34.236
in Missouri and I would
just like to ask,

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.570
what is the most difficult
part of the writing process?

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.783
&gt;&gt; Of the writing process?

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.783
&gt;&gt; Of the writing process.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.990
&gt;&gt; I don't remember that
story did I write it?

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.370
&gt;&gt; You did.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:50.503
&gt;&gt; I did. Oh, it must
have been a long time ago,

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.790
and what's the story about?

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.926
&gt;&gt; It's a love [inaudible] it's the
girl that's trapped in the basket--

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.273
&gt;&gt; Oh, because it has another
name in Spanish, I'm sorry.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.900
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.233
&gt;&gt; I might-- write in Spanish only,

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.300
I can never remember the
titles in another language.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.233
That story is based on a real case.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.900
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.300
&gt;&gt; It's the story of Omayra Sanchez,
a little girl that was trapped

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.966
in a mudslide in Colombia and
she lived for three days trapped

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.643
in the mud up to here and you could
see in every television in the world

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:21.146
because they flew the
televisions and the press

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.020
in you could see her dying for
three days and they could not fly

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:31.070
in a pump to pump the
water and save her life.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.383
So that is a very dramatic
and awful story

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:35.186
and I always have a photograph.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.083
&gt;&gt; In Katrina during Katrina
I thought of your story--

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:44.290
&gt;&gt; Yes and what it takes to write a
story like that I was a journalist

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.156
and so I'm aware of the stories
that are always floating in the air,

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:49.663
the extraordinary stories
you get in a car

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.150
and someone tells you the story
of her family and it's nine kids

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.763
and the father committed suicide
and there is another book, you know.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.256
You just find these
wonderful stories.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.856
Now which story you will write?

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:04.150
It depends on the moment and it
depends on what you are feeling.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.953
In the case of Omayra
Sanchez again it's a story

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.106
of person who is trapped.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.993
Who has, who can't escape.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.260


00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.730
&gt;&gt; I am delighted to
meet you face to face.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.120
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.120
&gt;&gt; Your books, most recently--

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.920
&gt;&gt; Pull up the microphone
I can't hear you.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry--

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.386
&gt;&gt; These tall people, I hate them.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.550
&gt;&gt; I read both in Spanish
and in English

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.396
and the three books
I've read most recently,

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:42.710
by you are La isla bajo el mar,
El Zorro, and Ines del alma mia.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.630
I am fascinated by your
creation of characters

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.660
who overcome amazing obstacles and
as you mentioned earlier are living

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.483
on the margins of society.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.800
I want to zoom in on Zorro.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.666
How was it that you-- what inspired
you to create a story of his youth?

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.726
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zorro was not my idea.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.920
I was one day in summer
of 2003 was it Willie?

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:17.200
2003 these people came to my
house and knocked at the door

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.920
and I thought they were Mormon
missionaries so I was prepared

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:29.566
for that but they were really the
owners of the copy write of Zorro.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.313
Zorro has owners.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:32.980
A family that owns the
rights and they came

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.273
and they said we've done everything
with Zorro, we've done movies,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.353
TV series, mugs, costumes,
all kinds of stuff

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:41.343
but we don't have a
work of literature.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.150
Would you like to write
a book about Zorro?

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.616
And I said, why me?

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.816
And they said because I've
written historical novels,

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:49.386
I'm Spanish originally, I mean
my-- Spanish is my language,

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:57.380
I live in California and I have
written stories for young adults

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.126
and so they thought I would be the
perfect person to write the book.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.546
And I said well I don't
write on commission.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.333
But then I thought of Antonio
Banderas in the movies [laughter]

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:11.086
and I thought maybe I will
have a chance to meet him.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.706
So that's why I wrote the book.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:16.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000


00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.290
[Applause ]

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.236
&gt;&gt; I just read And of
Clay last year for school

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.020
and I got really interested
so I read Eva Luna but--

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.183
&gt;&gt; I can't hear you.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.636
You have to get closer
to the microphone.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:44.500
&gt;&gt; I just read And of Clay last
year for school because I had to

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.533
and I got really interested in
your writing and so I read Eva Luna

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:55.110
but I was just curious
because you said you do a lot

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.320
of research what's your
favorite genre specifically?

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.046
&gt;&gt; What, what's the
research for what?

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.370
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite genre
like because if you do a lot

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.563
of research you're doing on fiction
so-- but what's your favorite?

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.123
&gt;&gt; Well I love to write
historical fiction

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.806
because once you research the time
and the place half the book is done.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.733
You have a theater where you
will move the characters.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.133
And I love that kind of book.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.933
It's-- for me it's easier.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.600
Of course the research
can take years

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:20.866
for Island beneath
the sea it was 4 years

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.000
in the meantime I write
a memoir but I love

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:24.466
that part of my work, I really do.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.533
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's all.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.066
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry we have just one--
time for one more question.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.200
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.733
&gt;&gt; Okay, the gentleman.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.333
&gt;&gt; The gentleman.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.400
&gt;&gt; The first man--

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200
&gt;&gt; Oh--

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:58.866
&gt;&gt; That stands up an
applause for him.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000


00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200
[ Applause ]

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200
[ Spanish ]

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200
&gt;&gt; Gracias--

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.533
&gt;&gt; I hope that one day my Spanish
will be as good as your English.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.333
&gt;&gt; You need to marry a
Spanish woman [laughter].

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.200
&gt;&gt; Ah.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.800
&gt;&gt; You learn language
in bed [laughter].

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.266
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'll be quick
let's say it's January 7

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.600
and if you aren't finishing up a
book from the year before or is it

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.866
or you are not taking a sabbatical
what is it are you thinking of ideas

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.800
for the book you will
start the next day

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.793
or by then you've already begun
the idea or whatever in your head.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.206
&gt;&gt; Well by January 7th I'm
a wreck because I think

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.180
that I know what I'm going
to write but I don't--

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.326
I am not sure and it has
happened more than once that I sit

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:17.783
with one idea and I end up writing
something totally different.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:25.130
The only thing I know is that
I will have my casita clean.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.960
I will have taken out everything
that is not related to the book

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.920
that I am going to write and
I have all my research ready.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:37.216
I light candles I put fresh
flowers, I make time, you know.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.706
I procrastinate as much as
possible but then there is a moment

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:41.630
when I have to sit down in front of
the computer and then I breathe in

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.726
and breathe out and write
a sentence that comes

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.773
from the womb not from the mind.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.173
And that first sentence usually
is like a door that opens

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.516
into a dark space that is the
story that I still don't know

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:04.643
and I will go day by day, hour by
hour, word by word investigating

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.130
in that darkness until I find
the characters and the story

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.363
and it's a very slow process.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.493
The first two or three weeks are
terrible because I am not sure

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:15.830
of what I'm doing and I
have not found the voice.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.823
But once the voice comes, the voice

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:25.593
from the island beneath the sea
is the voice of Zarite, the slave.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:31.470
When I saw the slave and I heard
her voice, wow, the book was done.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.273
Thank you very much.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.080
&gt;&gt; Muchos gracias.
