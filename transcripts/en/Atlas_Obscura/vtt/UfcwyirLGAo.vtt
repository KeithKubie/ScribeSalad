(audio player clicks)

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.925
- [Bob] I saw a puppet show

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.925
when I was six years old

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:11.982
and I'm still talking about it.

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:13.815
That was 80 years ago.

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:16.264
(audio player clicks)

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.793
- So, I was in school
for film and photography,

00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:22.247
looking for animatronics,
special effects work.

00:00:22.247 --> 00:00:23.810
I come down to see a show,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.055
it was the coolest place I'd ever seen.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:28.223
So, I talked to Bob about interning

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:30.390
and that's how I got here.

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.989
Bob Baker was the world's
greatest puppeteer.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.053
When he was eight years old,

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:47.011
he saw this puppet show.

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.415
He spent his whole life kind of creating

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.355
this place and so much more.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:54.527
We're more than just 2000 plus puppets,

00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:56.610
we're really representing

00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:58.494
a lifetime,

00:00:58.494 --> 00:01:01.098
and not just Bob's lifetime,

00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:02.711
the lifetime of everyone that's gonna come

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:06.961
in and out of this building's
experience down here.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:10.869
Essentially, the long and the short,

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.132
this is where imagination dwells,

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:15.294
that's what Bob says.

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:17.954
So, it's kind of a musical variety,

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.345
spectaculars of

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.787
dancing cats, singing dogs,

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.120
Russian waltzes.

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:25.677
All sorts of things that kind of

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:26.875
come to life and kind of

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.026
bring your imagination to life.

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:31.359
That's for kids of all ages.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.062
The community here,

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.092
at the theater,

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:37.938
is

00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.037
so big.

00:01:40.508 --> 00:01:43.373
And it represents from our
immediate neighborhood-

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.971
like, Daisy lives across the street,

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.514
now kind of helps us out in spotlight.

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:47.966
When Bob used to get her ice cream

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.490
when she was like a five year old kid.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.796
There's like school kids,

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:52.765
there's generations of puppeteers

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:54.865
that kind of used to work down here,

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:56.843
it's free of cynicism or

00:01:56.843 --> 00:01:58.437
messaging or whatever it is,

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:02.187
it's just "watch your
beautiful puppet dance"

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:05.610
(audio player clicks)

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.380
- [Bob] One of the things that I love,

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.111
when I was performing,

00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.936
the little child will
look up at you and laugh.

00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:16.606
It's a wonderful sound.

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:19.391
I wish I could go all
over the world doing that.

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:22.558
(audio player clicks)

00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:39.110
- I don't think it's difficult

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.884
to follow your passion.

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:43.063
I do think it's easy to kind of lose sight

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:45.212
of how much work is involved with that.

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:47.919
The work involved with that is huge,

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.457
it's giant.

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:52.869
And it's very easy to get demoralized by

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.161
things not working out

00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.364
because you're dealing with your passion.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:02:59.130
It kind of amplifies everything to 10

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.269
to kind of being disappointed in things.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.347
You just need to kind of persevere.

00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:06.430
It's what you have to do.

00:03:17.112 --> 00:03:20.112
It's inspiring to me, everyday, that

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:24.504
this place is filled
and bustling with people

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.456
inspired by what Bob did.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.538
And, to this day, we
still say, Bob is with us.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:32.014
Bob's in all these lights,

00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:33.828
and these shows and these experiences

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:36.654
and these things that kind of we put on.

00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.487
Bob has not passed on,

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:42.650
his soul and heart is alive and well.

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:45.655
That's what special.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.143
(audio player clicks)

00:03:50.143 --> 00:03:52.287
- [Bob] Look at things that were earlier,

00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:55.598
for the beauty that they might've had,

00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:59.431
or the entertainment
that they might've given.

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:02.216
Just don't forget about them.

00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:05.383
