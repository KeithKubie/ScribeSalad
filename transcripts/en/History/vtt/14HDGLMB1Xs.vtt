[music playing]

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.500
NARRATOR: At Morgan's
wind-pummeled homestead

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.330
in the great Alaska Range--

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.200
It's starting to sleet.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.500
NARRATOR: --there's a
storm brewing above.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.330
MARGARET: Hey, Morgan.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.030
What's that?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.330
NARRATOR: And another below.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.700
MORGAN: There's
water in the cellar?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.500
Yeah.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.070
Aw, no.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.500
[bleep] OK, I'll be down as
soon as I get this finished.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.800
God damnit.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.530
MARGARET: Oh, yeah.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.430
We got quite a bit.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.170
NARRATOR: The root cellar
beneath the cabin floor

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.000
holds their only
supply of potatoes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.830
and remaining vegetables,
along with the seeds

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.000
they'll plant in the spring.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670
MARGARET: We need
to take everything

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.530
out and kind of figure out
a way to deal with this.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.730
Oh, gosh.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.970
NARRATOR: Water damage can
devastate six months' worth

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.970
of food in a matter of days.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.330
MARGARET: They're all
gonna rot in there.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.470
And that would really
be unfortunate.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.830
Hoo.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.630
Well, there's definitely some
water on that valuable seed.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.800
So that's gonna have to get gone
through and the bag dried out.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.430
NARRATOR: Losing the food cache
would force Morgan and Margaret

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.230
to rely solely on protein.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.630
So-- oh, that one's wet.
Ugh.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.000
Yeah.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.900
I'm gonna work on this and hold
all the vegetables out really

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.230
quickly here.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.230
Dry off the vegetables, and
make sure everything is OK.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.900
[wind whistling]

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.600
MORGAN: We almost made it
without weather coming in,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.800
but now it's definitely
here, and started

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.270
picking up snow and sleet.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.000
I think it's turning to rain.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.670
Just gonna get out there and
get this ridge cap on so water

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.400
doesn't get in
underneath the roofing.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.800
NARRATOR: The ridge cap connects
the two sides of the roof

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.400
at its peak, 20 feet up.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.430
--service.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.000
Razor sharp along
the new cut edge.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.170
Gotta be real careful with it.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.030
[music playing]

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.230
Just a few more screws.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.170
[music playing]

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.130
[machine whirring]

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.570
All right.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.030
It's all buttoned down.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.770
We can get off of
here now, and go see

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.670
what's going on in the cellar.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.930
I hope it's not too bad.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.130
Oh, wow.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.500
NARRATOR: Morgan and Margaret's
most critical food supply

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.870
is under siege.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.500
MORGAN: Looks like you're
waist deep in the cellar there.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.000
MARGARET: Yes, I am.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.770
We got lots of water down there.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.800
It's a bad deal.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.170
We've got to take
care of that and get

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.100
these vegetables into a safe
spot so the rot doesn't spread.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.170
Oh, boy.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.300
Well, I will go get
a bucket and shovel

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.570
that will fit down in there,
and I'll dig a sump hole.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.930
I'm gonna climb down in
there and do some dirty work

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.570
and dig a sump.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.830
Basically what that
means, I'm just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.070
gonna dig a narrow,
deep hole that all

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.830
the water can run into, and
hopefully drain away into soil.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.700
MARGARET: So I'm going
through all of our potatoes.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.930
A lot of these
potatoes are dirty.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.300
You don't want to wash the
dirt off of your root crops,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.400
and it helps keep
them a little bit.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.530
And I'm putting
these in paper bags

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.100
because the paper bags
will allow the potatoes

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.930
to dry out pretty quickly.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.230
We're gonna toss the
rest of this batch.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.670
Put that outside for now.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.970
Nothing smells worse
than rotten potatoes.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.930
MORGAN: All right,
that should be good.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.800
It's down into a
nice gravelly soil.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.930
It should drain really well.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.670
MARGARET: And if you want
to get some boards, too,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.730
that would be nice
to lay some boards

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.230
down there to just
elevate things

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.430
off the ground a little bit.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.500
You bet.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.700
MARGARET: Kind of
makes it a little bit

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.900
of a makeshift floor.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.430
It's just to give the
vegetables a little bit

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.770
of elevation over any water
that might continue to come in.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.970
All right.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.230
I'm ready to put all these
back down on the slabs.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.930
You want me to move
any of the heavy stuff?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.730
MARGARET: Yeah, would you
actually do the big tots?

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.770
You bet, yeah.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.930
Everything looks good.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.430
And there's actually
surprisingly little loss.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.430
Not too much rot, not too
many vegetables that went bad.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.930
And hopefully they'll be
safe from any more moisture

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.330
that's gonna come in here.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.630
Come spring and summer,
when the ground's thawed,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.600
we'll just have to
improve the drainage

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.730
on the back side of the house
so this doesn't happen again.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.630
[music playing]

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.300
All right, cool.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.470
It's nice to have all
that stuff organized, too.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.570
Is that everything?
MARGARET: Yes.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.370
MORGAN: OK.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.470
Quite a day.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.170
It's like the whole
house was coming apart.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.670
I mean, when it rains, it pours.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.630
But we got both of
them nipped in the bud

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.130
before they could
get out of hand.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.700
The list of things to
do is never-ending,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.400
but we're just here to stay.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
