00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.503
- Yes, just seat yourself,
McCallister.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.238
I'll be back momentarily.
Gene!

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.106
- Oh, those are [bleep] done.
- Gene!

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.142
- Huh? What?
- Who is this?

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.377
This isn't part of the plan.
- This is New Chet.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.379
- Hi.
I'm Darryl.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.782
- I was inspired by your whole
blast from the past situation.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.583
Darryl and I used
to ass-mule liquid cocaine

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.118
out of the Bahamas together.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.820
- And we were married.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:22.388
- Oh, that's right!
We were.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.191
- Right? Yes.
- Oh, for two days.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.526
- Yeah, 'member?
- Oh, my gosh.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.794
Wednesday and--

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.196
both: Thursday.
- Excuse me!

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.697
- What?
- The burner isn't even on.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.800
his burner's not--
you're cooking over nothing.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.568
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.270
This isn't going well.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.138
No, no, no, no.
I'm gonna tell him.

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.540
- No, no, no, no.
You can't tell him.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.808
You can't tell him.
It's gonna be fine.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.077
- Get your hair-finger
out of the soup!

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.344
- Look, solved.

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:46.746
- He just sucked--

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.282
- Darryl is here for a reason,
okay, mon?

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.518
- Why are you talking
like a Rastafarian?

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.856
- Okay.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:00.359
- Can you bend at all?
Got it? Okay.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.628
- Thank you.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.300
- Dinner will be here soon,
because I-I'ma get it.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.502
- Thank you.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.505
So nice of you to come tonight.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.241
And I've changed so much
since our..."skyool" days.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.776
- What's with your voice?

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.145
- Sort of a global accent.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.514
I'm very world-traveled,
like Madonna Ciccone,

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:25.184
who I've met
at several giant balls.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.053
- Where did you,
uh, travel last?

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.055
I love to travel.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:33.126
- Oh, it's...
all a blur.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.661
Peni--Pen Island.
- Hmm?

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:37.163
- So glad we could do this.

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.065
- You mentioned that,
like, 30 seconds ago.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.267
- Mm.
- It actually worked out well

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.402
'cause my book signing, um,
was canceled.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.404
- That must make you
feel like...

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.406
no one likes your books.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.842
- No.
No, just too many RSVPs.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.444
Had to move it
to a bigger venue.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.346
I'll be hitting up
the B &amp; Nobles

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.715
in Pasadena tomorrow.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:59.285
- Grea--great.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:01.020
So glad you could come.

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.221
- You said that.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.489
- Boom, boom,
shake the room.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.391
- There we go.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.393
- Nah, you haven't seen me
in a bunch of years though, man.

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:08.661
I am grown.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:10.396
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.366
I've got a house.
I'm in a bowling league.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.667
- What?
- Yeah.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.103
I've got, like, two,
three kids.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.538
- So, you're
not a prostitute anymore?

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.306
- No, I'm still a prostitute.
- Oh.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.109
- So, how's married life?
Terribly confining or--

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.778
- Ugh.
Alice left me.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.446
We're in the middle
of a divorce right now.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.049
It's ugly.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.585
- I'm so sorry, McCallister.
I didn't--I didn't know.

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.254
- Don't be. Actually,
it turned out quite well.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.723
I'm now dating successful
screenwriter Diablo Cody.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.025
She won the Oscar for
"Juno."

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.728
- Never heard of it.
- Yes, you have.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.797
- I don't know.
J'you know?

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.598
- It's "Juno."
The movie.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.400
- J'you know what movie?

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.668
- J'you know that I'm dating

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.103
successful screenwriter
Diablo Cody?

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.806
- I don't know, like,
what's making me think of this

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:58.311
right now, but I've, like,
always wanted to be a witch,

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.280
with, like,
a bubbling cauldron.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.616
- That's super dope, man.
Go for it.

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.117
- Thanks. I will.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.087
- Hey, remember that Christmas

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.356
when we broke
into that kid's house

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.359
but we couldn't steal anything
'cause he was so wily?

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:15.528
- No.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:20.099
- Yeah, we were casing the place
for weeks posing as plumbers.

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:21.767
I think we even had a name.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.236
- The Wet Bandits?

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.104
- Yes!

00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.139
- Yeah, that's the plot
to "Home Alone."

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.308
- Oh, so it didn't happen again
in New York?

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.311
- No.
That's "Home Alone 2."
