BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So I'm going
to jump into some questions

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.500
before we get to your all
questions, just to seed things.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.470
So Trey, we mostly know
you as a photographer.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.270
That's your sort of main thing.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.075
Why are you writing a book about
staying zen on social media?

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:21.950
TREY RATCLIFF: Right.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.990
Well, that is--

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.850
90% of business is
fine art, and then 10%

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.850
is sort of social media.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.760
So I accidentally became
an expert at this.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.180
And I've noticed that there
is an incredible amount

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.930
of suffering out there.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.180
And I think it's
important for people

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.100
that are able to reduce
suffering in the world,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.080
I think it's good to do that.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.150
That's a good thing.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.500
And of course, there's many
categories of suffering.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.650
There's real suffering,
like civil wars or hunger,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.638
this sort of thing.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:57.680
But I've noticed in the
last three or four years,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.950
there's a new kind of
suffering, the suffering that's

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.590
brought about by social media.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.500
So I'll tell you
this funny story.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.600
It's a personal story.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.210
I became a full-time artist
12 years ago, when I was 35.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.510
Before that, I was IT computer
science, very left brain.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.940
So I made this transition
to being a full-time artist.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.610
And I was talking to
this wise old lady.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.130
And I was asking her for advice,
because she was an artist.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.380
She goes, Trey,
you will encounter

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.690
a massive amount of suffering.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.343
Most of it will be self-imposed.

00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:32.260
And that's what it is.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.190
People heap suffering on
themselves when really it's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.990
a fictionalized reality.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.130
It's not real suffering.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.470
And so when I see people
suffering anxiety online,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.340
now it's been exacerbated
and accelerated

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.100
by the way social media works.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.980
You're constantly being
reminded that you're not enough.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.670
And this feeds
off what I feel is

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.810
a problem with humans
that you can't overcome,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.360
which is an ego.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.440
You tell yourself this
story about yourself.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.730
And when things don't
match up with that story,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.740
it causes you a massive
amount of anxiety.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.513
So I became like an influencer.

00:02:14.513 --> 00:02:15.680
I didn't know what that was.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.050
I remember like 10 years ago,
I was speaking at this travel

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.150
photography conference.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.448
And we had one of these--

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:26.740
right afterwards, we had one
of these dreadful cocktail

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.750
parties, where people
are mixing around.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.930
This nice, well-meaning
lady came up to me,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.430
and her eyes were
as big as saucers.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.190
And she goes, are you
an influencer like us?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.430
And I was like, what the
fuck is an influencer?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.740
I can't even influence my
kids to clean their room,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.625
so I don't think so.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:46.000
Then I started to run into
more and more of these people.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.470
Some were legit.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.167
And some, they didn't
quite fit right.

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.000
You know, I like to
have deep conversations.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.190
And so I would talk to them,
and I noticed sometimes

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.490
there was a lacking, a
hollowness, something

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.370
that wasn't there that should
be there, no substance.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.620
And then I started looking
into it more and more.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.020
And I realized that a
lot of these people--

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.760
because I work in the
luxury travel industry--

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760
are faking it.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.780
They might have bought their
followers, bought their likes,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.270
bought their comments.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.980
And then they approach
these big brands.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.690
And then they ask
for a lot of money,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.840
and free travel,
and all this stuff.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.460
And then they put
these things online

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.620
that they're having
the perfect life.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.050
And this, in turn,
causes a massive amount

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.400
of anxiety online.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.070
But it's all based
on a false narrative.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.980
So they end up spawning
a bunch of copycats.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.780
And now there is
what I consider to be

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.810
this mass delusional behavior
of everyone pretending

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.077
to have the perfect life.

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:44.410
They all know that it doesn't
ring true in their hearts,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.175
so that causes them anxiety.

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:48.550
But everyone else that doesn't
have a perfect life, which

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.232
is pretty much everybody,
they feel more like losers.

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:53.690
They feel like if they only
had these things in their life,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.150
then they could be whole people.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.288
But this entire thing is
based on a false narrative,

00:03:58.288 --> 00:03:59.830
that you don't need
any of that to be

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.650
a complete person, that you're
already a complete person.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.430
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
a lot of questions

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.670
emerge from the narrative
you just put forth.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.410
One of them is what--

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.350
and again, these are deeply
philosophical questions,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.890
but what compels people to
feed on this sense of lack?

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.300
Like, you know, if it really
is diminishing me and making

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.065
me feel worse, why can't
I put the phone down?

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:33.940
TREY RATCLIFF: Right.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.148
Well, that's a good question.

00:04:35.148 --> 00:04:38.933
Who is the "I" that is
putting the phone down and not

00:04:38.933 --> 00:04:39.600
putting it down?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.310
The more you study mindfulness
and consciousness--

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.670
and I'd recommend
books by Eckhart Tolle,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.285
"The Power of Now" and "A New
Earth," Michael Singer's--

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:56.660
what's that book called?

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.133
I'll think about
it in a minute--

00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.300
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Google it.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.890
TREY RATCLIFF: Gosh darn it.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.650
Yeah, google it.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.810
Can anyone google that?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.400
Anyway, so these help you
to realize that you are not

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.970
the voice in your head.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.210
You're the silence
behind the voice that

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.610
can watch the thoughts go by.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.430
And you'll notice that
whenever a thought goes by

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.770
or you see something
online, and it gets stuck,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.298
and it bothers you,
you, like, notice, oh,

00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:23.090
isn't that interesting
that's bothering me.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.578
Why is that bothering me?

00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:26.120
Well, as stuff passes
by you, it gets

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.870
stuck on this egoic construct,
this framework that you've

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.660
built up in your
brain about your life,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.215
and the groups that you believe
in, what you believe in.

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:38.840
And when you see something that
comes in that doesn't match it,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.810
that makes you angry,
or it makes you upset.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.820
And what's actually
happening there

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.580
is your ego just
reinforcing itself, saying,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.780
I have the right story.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.640
I find that to be wrong.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.300
And it makes it-- it makes
the monster even bigger.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.040
And you stay on to look
for things that will make

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.410
it stronger or more defensible.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.600
This is why you stay
online because you

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.150
have come to identify
yourself with the stories

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.970
that you tell
yourself in your head.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.310
And social media now
is so good at either

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.880
going against these stories
or for those stories.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.950
It only reinforces what
you think is yourself.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.860
But that's not your true self.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.870
Your true self is one
without any of these thoughts

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.570
or preferences.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.470
You could be the dolphin
that swims in the waves.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.060
And so many people get caught
up in so many things that

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.870
bother them all day, and they
continue to complain online.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.820
If you notice-- I
notice this-- that a lot

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.900
of positive, loving people don't
even spend time on a Facebook

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.960
anymore, because it
just becomes sort

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.910
of this cesspool of complaining.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.050
And if you read comments
anywhere, even YouTube,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.910
especially Facebook
or whatever, you

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.500
see that there's like this whole
new group of idiots out there.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.050
And I consider this to
be like the Cambrian

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.600
explosion of idiot species.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.800
We've never seen like--

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.840
oh, look, there's a guy
that's an anti-vaxxer

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.830
and a flat-earther.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.270
That's a new species.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.810
And so these
platforms that we use,

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.980
they've accidentally reinforced
some of these ideas, which

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.850
may or not be true.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.022
Like, there are good
ideas out there and groups

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:15.730
form around them.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.070
And there are bad ideas,
and groups form around them.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.700
Like examples of good ideas
are like, the Dallas Cowboys,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.448
gardening club,
board gaming club.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:27.490
These are good ideas and
groups form around them.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.650
And people share in
positive, loving ways.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.870
And then there's bad ideas.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.420
And those get
spread even quicker.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.270
And a lot of bad ideas form
groups, where the groups

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.800
are against the other groups.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.340
Like the board
gaming group, they

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.090
don't care about the
Dallas Cowboys group.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.950
They're not saying, oh
man, I hate those Cowboys.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.135
The Cowboys ar
saying like, god, I'm

00:07:46.135 --> 00:07:47.470
glad we don't play video games.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.110
There's like the loving
positive idea groups.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.180
And these other ones,
which reinforce themselves

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.040
by destructing other groups.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.000
And that's not good.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.140
And the ego-- you have a choice.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.387
Like where do you want to be?

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:03.970
Do you want to be in a positive,
loving place in which there's

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.110
so many great groups?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.902
And the internet can
be an incredible thing

00:08:06.902 --> 00:08:08.000
for spreading that.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.070
But a lot of times, I think we
had this Pareto distribution,

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.190
of like 20% good stuff
to 80% bad stuff.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.278
And there are bad
aspects of human nature

00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:20.320
that are based on fear,
and a lot of these things

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.173
that are reinforced by the
media, which, you know,

00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:25.090
you don't have to be
scared of all this stuff.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.430
You can go into a loving place.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.525
And so people end
up in these groups.

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.150
And then that's why
they can't put down

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.450
their phone, because they're
seeing things that make them

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.570
angry, make them really
happy, when really, none of it

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.590
has to really
matter in your life.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.559
You can be the silence
behind your thoughts.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:43.330
You don't have to be this
all-consuming assemblance

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.950
of groups that define you.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.420
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So in terms
of our personal responsibility

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.030
and accountability towards
remedying this situation,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.370
I can think of a few recourses.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.130
One is to shun
technology altogether,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.220
to basically say this leads
to an unhealthy place,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.710
I'm going to opt out.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.190
Another would be to attenuate
it, and sort of say everything

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.420
in moderation.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.910
I'm going to use some
of the tools that Google

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.620
and others are putting forward
to monitor and regulate,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.680
similar to food.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.920
There's an RDA for these things.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.590
And I'm going to sort of be
very disciplined and thoughtful.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.750
Another would be to
change the way I relate.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.940
So you talk a lot about zen.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.340
So as opposed to
shunning technology,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.310
is there a way to
partake of it that

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.840
is less destructive or
less negative in terms

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.680
of my own reaction
to these things?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.040
And then finally,
there's sort of unfollow.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.590
So I can be more
thoughtful in terms

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.540
of what I expose myself to.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.340
And I imagine
there's a spectrum.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.130
As you're saying, there's sort
of very destructive groups

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.290
and then there's others
that are sort of healthy.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.810
So I can have a
responsibility to sort of turn

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.360
the dial toward the healthy
and away from the destructive.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.130
Like, is it all of the above?

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.740
Like, what is your
approach towards health

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.180
and our relationship to media?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.400
TREY RATCLIFF: As
all the parents

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.680
that are out there know
this, you want your kids

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.650
to end up with the good kids
that are out there playing

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.233
the good sports, that have
positive habits, that sort

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:20.805
of thing, because they will
start to feed off of that.

00:10:20.805 --> 00:10:22.930
You don't want them becoming
part of the bad group.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.820
But think the same
thing for yourself.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.830
Have the same
desires for yourself

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.060
that you have for your kids.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.710
You want to be part of the
good, positive, loving groups

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.490
because the brains are
incredibly plastic.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.830
And the more good,
positive, loving

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.113
stuff you have come into
your world, the better.

00:10:38.113 --> 00:10:40.030
Like, surround yourself
with friends that want

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.930
the best for you.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.930
I want the best for you.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.020
You want the best for me.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.260
This is sort of a mindset shift,
because all this same stuff

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.060
is on social media.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.070
Now, on the other side of it,
I grew up with social media

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.832
being a creative,
a photographer.

00:10:56.832 --> 00:10:59.290
And I would hang out with other
photographers and creatives

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.610
online.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.683
And so a creative--

00:11:03.683 --> 00:11:04.600
and it doesn't matter.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.780
When I say creative,
you can do anything

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.210
from bake cookies to-- there's
all kinds of creative pursuits

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.773
out there.

00:11:10.773 --> 00:11:12.190
It doesn't have
to be visual arts.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.400
It could be audio, whatever.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.770
I found it very natural
to make a creation

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.100
and then share it online.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.870
In the same way that
my little girls,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.420
they would make something
out of construction paper

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.740
and put glitter on it.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.240
And then they would run around
the house and show everybody.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.400
There's no ego involved.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.350
It's just pure creation.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.530
And it's said that a creation
doesn't exist until you

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.150
share it with the world.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.655
I think that's true.

00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:40.780
And so I was with all these
other creatives online,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.400
and we were all sharing.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.275
And I would sometimes
get negative feedback.

00:11:44.275 --> 00:11:46.150
Actually, I would often
get negative feedback

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.700
because my photos were quite
controversial, because I would

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.590
do things in a different--

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.590
not different, because I
wanted to be different,

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.130
but just it felt right.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.500
I was very interested in light
and the way it affected people.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.360
And so early on, I
developed a very thick skin

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.380
because I received so
much negative feedback.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.990
And I was wondering about that
because I know a lot of people

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.920
are scared.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.170
And if you get
negative feedback,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.110
it just feeds that healthy
self-doubt that we all have.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.330
Like, yeah, maybe
I'm not so good,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.530
and all this sort of stuff.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.710
And again, that's just your ego.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.360
Notice when things bother you.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.730
And say like, I'm a good person.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.720
I'm trying.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.060
I may not always be successful,
but I'm a good person.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.230
So I think if you go into
it with that mindset.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.420
And the second thing is, you can
notice the negative comments,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.870
but a way not to let
him get to you is--

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.500
and this is a little
hokey, but stick with me.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.300
I think about this
definitely in creative.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.440
And actually, it is
sort of this zen thing.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.807
We're all flowers, and
we're growing, right?

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.390
And as you grow,
your petals come out,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.343
and you get whipped
around by the wind.

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:58.760
You know, it's
kind of bothersome.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.790
You have rain hitting you.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.160
You have all this
stuff going on.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.258
But you're OK with
it, you just grow.

00:13:06.258 --> 00:13:07.050
That's what you do.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.717
You're a flower.

00:13:07.717 --> 00:13:09.020
You just keep growing.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.930
You notice the
rain and the wind,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.743
but you don't let it get to you.

00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:14.660
So it's sort of this--

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.830
I have this idea of like,
you're a work in progress.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.020
I'm a work in progress.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.255
Don't listen to that
negative stuff out there.

00:13:23.255 --> 00:13:24.630
And you're going
to be just fine.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.040
Surround yourself with
positive, loving people

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.320
that want the best for you.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.590
And just notice when you're
in a cesspool of negativity.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.920
You'll notice online
that complainers

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.050
tend to stick together.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.970
Someone says, oh,
let me tell you

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.780
about this problem I'm
having with so-and-so.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.280
And then the next complainer
will come aboard and say, like,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.380
oh, you think that's
a problem, listen

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.920
to this problem I'm having.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.730
So this is just--

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.280
this is not a good, positive
space for the human mind to be.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.690
And there's so many
great places you can go,

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.850
where you can be
supported, where you don't

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.120
have to spend the whole day--

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.840
imagine going the entire
day without being bothered

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.305
by anything, and just
like loving things,

00:14:05.305 --> 00:14:06.930
and having awesome
people in your life.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.270
Isn't that what we all want?

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.430
And you can slowly
make that choice,

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.630
make little
improvements every day

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.050
to change where you
spend your time.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.790
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
it sounds like most

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.880
of what you're talking about
is changing your relationship

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.330
to the content and
being determined

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.680
in how it affects you.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.710
Do you also, in
terms of absolutes,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.900
monitor your own screen
time on a daily basis?

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.810
Do you think that's good, bad?

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.370
Is it a muscle we need to build?

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.770
Or is that sort of a
different dimension?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.850
TREY RATCLIFF: I spend
most of my time creating

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.920
and very little time consuming
what's on social media.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.670
I do pay attention to
a few close friends.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.150
I think it's a good
idea to unfollow

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.480
people that aren't bringing
positivity into your life,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.970
and just people that
are inspirational,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.970
and give you good ideas, and
help you be a better person.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.940
Because I get inspired by
people like that all the time.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.642
And also one thing to note
is that the algorithms--

00:15:08.642 --> 00:15:10.600
Facebook algorithms, and
Instagram, these sorts

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.940
of things--

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.110
they're unconscious.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.700
They now serve up
ideas to you that

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.630
can aggravate you and cause
you to have a response.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.140
And the algorithms don't
know what it's about.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.390
And you're going to
get more and more

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.022
of that stuff in your feed.

00:15:32.022 --> 00:15:33.480
The longer it stays
on your screen,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.855
the more you like
it, the more it

00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:36.960
makes you happy, the more
virulent things you type

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.600
in there, that kind of
stuff, it's reinforced,

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.080
because they want you to stay on
the screen as long as possible.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.260
Because the longer you're on the
screen, the more ads you get.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.250
And the more it takes you
away from mindfulness.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.180
Mindfulness really has
nothing to do with the screen.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.220
Mindfulness is a nice
walk through the park,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.260
looking at trees, where there's
no past or no beginning.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.840
There's no past,
there's no future.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.130
And this is not
natural human behavior,

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.330
because this is
causing you anxiety.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.330
I was talking about this
with one of my friends.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.040
I live in New Zealand.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.660
And he was having
some anxiety issues.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.980
And he spends a lot
of time on the screen.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.560
I said, look, dude,
think about it.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.210
Just 5 or 10 generations ago,
we would not be doing this.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.350
We'd be walking
across New Zealand.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.910
We'd be out fishing.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.820
We'd be talking to each
other, telling stories.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.770
We'd be carrying some
rocks back or whatever.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.150
We'd be setting up a
fire for the night.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.200
We would light that fire.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.567
As it gets dark, we would cook.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:43.650
We'd all sit around the
fire and look at the fire,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.890
and we would all tell stories.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.065
No anxiety, this is a very
natural way of being human.

00:16:50.065 --> 00:16:51.690
And I have this new
theory, by the way,

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.820
that because 99%
of our generations,

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.980
they would sit around a fire
every night and tell stories,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.480
this is what the
screen has actually

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.060
replaced because it's bright.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:01.960
It's at nighttime.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.002
And it's telling stories.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.760
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
speaking of influencers,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.970
Yuval Noah Harari's
concept of fiction,

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.569
how does that relate to ideas
of followers, likes, comments?

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.492
What's the relationship there?

00:17:19.492 --> 00:17:21.450
TREY RATCLIFF: So he has
three great books out,

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.589
"Sapiens," "Homo Deus" and "21
Lessons for the 21st Century."

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.402
And he has these great concepts.

00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:30.610
I read a lot of books about
anthropology and history.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.240
It's one of my hobbies.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.990
And by the way, he
attributes his insights

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.403
to doing 30-day
silent retreats, where

00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:38.280
he has such clarity
of thought that he's

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.290
able to have these ideas.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.750
And one of the central
ideas in his books

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.950
is that humans are the only
animal on the planet that

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.190
can cooperate with strangers,
because we all collectively

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.500
believe in fictions.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.662
Like, we all believe in an
hour, which doesn't exist.

00:17:55.662 --> 00:17:56.370
You can't see it.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.400
You can't touch it.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.400
But it makes it convenient
to say, hey, Bradley,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.710
I'll meet you at
Google at 1:00 PM.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.390
There's no such
thing as a meter.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.430
There's no such
thing as a dollar.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.393
But we all agree on the
story of these ideas

00:18:07.393 --> 00:18:09.060
so that we can cooperate
with strangers.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.250
It's why chimps can't
cooperate with strangers

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.375
and all this kind of stuff.

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:13.417
So this makes it special.

00:18:13.417 --> 00:18:14.430
We believe in fiction.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.630
So there's many stories, good
stories, that we believe in.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.130
There's some bad
stories we believe,

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.020
but there's mostly good stories
that allow us to cooperate.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:27.390
Now as much as the hour, the
meter, the pound isn't real,

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.970
neither is the follow,
the like, or the comment.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.750
However, we have developed
at a monetary system where

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:40.300
you can trade dollars for other
things that can't be measured.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.492
And all of these
have a substance.

00:18:42.492 --> 00:18:44.700
We all agree on the measurement,
how long a meter is.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.740
Like, OK, you're
going to build me

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.980
a train that's 10 meters long.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.780
We know what we're going to get.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.510
But now if you can't
trust in the veracity

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.290
of a follower, a
like, or a comment,

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.330
that whole system falls apart.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.630
And so systems that
depend on that,

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.970
they can end up like
Venezuela because it's almost

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.680
like a counterfeit currency.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.690
And right now, people
kind of believe in it.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.920
And people are--

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.650
I think they spent
$2 billion last year

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.960
on influencers on Instagram.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.730
That's supposed to go
to $10 billion by 2020.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.040
And if all this money is
going into a system that

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.647
can't be trusted, then what's
going to happen is not good.

00:19:23.647 --> 00:19:25.980
I don't want to live in a
future where you can't believe

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.650
the numbers that you see.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.730
It doesn't-- it
doesn't make sense.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.110
And I think that
we can do better.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.640
And I think that
these organizations

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.140
would want to do
better because they

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.230
want to have a strong
internal economy that can

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.770
be trusted from the outside.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:49.110
Yuval has this other great
podcast he did with Sam Harris.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.490
And he was talking about trains.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.848
And he said, you know, there's
a time before trains and a time

00:19:56.848 --> 00:19:57.390
after trains.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.580
Trains is a technology.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.980
He says, trains don't
really care what they do.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.130
People have used trains to
build communist infrastructure,

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.010
so they can carry goods from one
place to another across Russia.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.260
It's been used in World
War II to take people

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.790
to concentration camps.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.550
Trains have also been used
in Japan to take salaryman

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.130
from Tokyo to Osaka.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.580
Trains, they don't care.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.480
It's a technology.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.880
So it's unknown how humans
will use technology.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.940
And I'm drawing that analogy
now to social networks.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.430
Like, they're out there.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.200
Maybe we have no control how
people are going to use them.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.530
That's a possible sad reality.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.350
I like to think we do
have some kind of control.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.470
But so far, it doesn't
appear that we do.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:48.140
And we're just grasping to fix
things when it's way too late.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.930
And that's not-- that's
also not the social media

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.200
world I want to live in.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.350
I want to live in a
positive, awesome place

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.560
because it has the
potential to do

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.852
incredible things for humanity.

00:20:58.852 --> 00:21:00.893
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well,
I want to talk about that

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:03.290
because I know you
self-describe as an optimist.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.660
You've been pretty harsh on--

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.350
or realistic on people's
relationship to social media.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.160
What do you see as the positive
side and the opportunity

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.535
for social media to enhance
and enrich people's lives?

00:21:18.535 --> 00:21:20.660
TREY RATCLIFF: You know,
I'm a travel photographer.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.077
I've been to all
seven continents.

00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:23.540
I travel all the time.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.780
And I know that travel has
made me a more gentle person.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.770
I know it makes pretty much
everybody a more gentle person.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.080
And the thing is, that I have
inserted myself into situations

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.820
that we're uncomfortable,
that I didn't understand.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.160
Like, here's a little story.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.840
I was in university.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.752
And my dad took me to France.

00:21:45.752 --> 00:21:47.460
And I just kind of
had been in the bubble

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.628
of the USA my whole life.

00:21:48.628 --> 00:21:50.670
And when I went to France,
it was like different.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.460
I was like, dad, why do
they do it like this?

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.000
You know, why do they put
mayonnaise on their fries?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.460
What's wrong with them?

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.150
Just little things like this.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.437
And he goes, son, it's
not better or worse,

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:00.270
it's just different.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.650
I was like, oh, OK.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.410
And so I continued
with these thoughts

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.270
as I travel around and see how
different parts of the world

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.400
do things in different ways.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.260
It's just different.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.850
And I'm not judging anymore,
and I'm very accepting.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.300
And you meet people on the
individual level, kids,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.960
grown-ups, and people are
generally really nice.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.710
They want good for their family.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.000
They want good for themselves.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.958
They want good for their
friends and neighbors.

00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:25.950
This is a universal human truth.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.010
It's totally true.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.920
There's a bigger specter
of ideas out there.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.870
And these ideas
have made themselves

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.070
more prominent on social
media rather than just people

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.380
loving their friends
and wanting everything

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.040
to go for the best for them.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.030
So if we can shift
around what we're

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:51.030
focused on, on loving our
family, helping our friends,

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.540
helping our neighbors, this
very natural human behavior,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.760
I think this is something
the internet can do.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.260
It hasn't been doing
that right now,

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.200
because that doesn't
seem very profitable.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.140
But humans are
capable of so much.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.860
It's done fantastic things.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.930
There are great stories.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.440
Like, I'm sure-- how
many tens of thousands

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.460
of engineers that were in
small little villages of India

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.400
have now ended up here
in Silicon Valley.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.870
It's because of the internet.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.150
Like, this is the idea
of spreading a good idea.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.180
And there's so many
options for that.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.400
It's almost-- I'm not sure what
the exact solution for it is,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.930
but I know if on the
individual level, if each of us

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:36.030
choose to stay in more
positive groups and help

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.340
surround ourselves with
positive, loving friends that

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.830
are pushing us help to
expose people to new ideas.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.560
I think that's really what
happened to me as I traveled,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.937
is I saw so many ideas.

00:23:46.937 --> 00:23:49.020
I saw so many things I
didn't initially agree with

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.600
and I thought, oh,
maybe that's not so bad.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.570
And this is a truth
for all humans.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.260
The more ideas you're exposed
to, the more conversations

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.080
you have, the more
it opens your mind

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.990
and makes you a more gentle
person, opens your heart,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:05.790
keeps you vulnerable,
and keeps you

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.653
in that good place for humanity.

00:24:08.653 --> 00:24:10.320
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Tell us about podding?

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.780
What is podding?

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.960
TREY RATCLIFF: Podding-- this
is a somewhat nefarious tactic

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.090
I go through in the new book.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.380
It's-- OK, what podding is,
it's mostly used on Instagram.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.540
It's against their terms of
services, terms and conditions.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.255
And it's when a group of people
get together and kind of cabal.

00:24:31.255 --> 00:24:33.000
It might be 10 people.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.910
It might be a
thousand people, OK?

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.440
And let's say they're in--

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.890
it happens in every industry,
you know, from fashion,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.920
to travel, to cars,
to you name it.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.970
But let's say they're
in a fashion pod.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.720
There's a thousand of them.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.070
Well, what happens is,
like, let's say, one of them

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.720
posts a picture of
themselves with a Prada bag.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.980
Well, they post inside their
pod, which is usually a chat

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.260
group, like a WhatsApp,
or a Facebook group,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.830
or somewhere else.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.510
And what happens is
immediately everybody--

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.240
the other 999 have to in
within the first five minutes

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.650
and comment on it,
and like it, and they

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.470
have to do at least three
words, all this sort of stuff.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.345
And then the algorithm
sees like, oh, this is

00:25:16.345 --> 00:25:18.040
a hot post about the Prada bag.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.300
And then it's more likely to
be seen in more people's feeds.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.970
So I find this
unethical in many ways,

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.300
because, A, all
of those comments

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.810
are coerced because if you
don't do what this cabal says,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.460
the pod does, you're kicked out.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.500
And suddenly, you're
not getting as much--

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.290
as many followers or
as much attention.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.630
So it's disingenuous.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.457
And the second thing
is that if Prada

00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:43.290
had paid for that or
something, that they're

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.332
seeing all these comments,
they're like, oh, wow,

00:25:45.332 --> 00:25:47.550
you know, this is
a great influencer.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.280
And also, to me, the
other fundamental thing

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.440
is, all the other
people that are just

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.020
putting a picture up
and trying, they're

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.750
at tremendous disadvantage.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.350
And so I see so much desperation
out there, like, on Instagram.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.620
People have a new business.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.190
You know, maybe a new wedding
photography business, or maybe

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.180
they've opened a new
pastry shop in Baltimore,

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.870
and they just are trying
to get attraction,

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.310
and trying to get
interest, or whatever.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.518
Meanwhile, people that
are gaming the system--

00:26:16.518 --> 00:26:18.060
when you start to
have algorithms out

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.540
there that decide
what people see,

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.010
normal humans will
try to game system.

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.250
There's going to be all
kinds of bots out there.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.420
They're getting
smarter and smarter.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.503
They'll always be able to
outsmart that algorithm.

00:26:29.503 --> 00:26:32.100
And it leaves like
normal, honest people that

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.650
are making good content
and want the best,

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.620
they're at a tremendous
disadvantage.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.540
That's just one of
many negative things

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.082
I outline in the
book that's going on

00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:42.507
that I think is rotten.

00:26:42.507 --> 00:26:44.340
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: In
terms of how these pods

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.150
self-organize and discover,
where does that happen?

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.750
Like, is that-- obviously,
they're in an arms race with

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.390
the spam and abuse team over--

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.630
TREY RATCLIFF: Right.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.450
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: --at
the platform level.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.410
But how do they find each other?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.410
And how do they develop?

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.312
Are they authentic people in
this case, or are they bots?

00:27:01.312 --> 00:27:03.270
TREY RATCLIFF: In this
case, they're authentic.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.960
A lot of the bad activity
on there is bots.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.590
But this is authentic behavior,
although for unethical reasons.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.025
Normally what they do is
they just contact you as a DM

00:27:13.025 --> 00:27:13.650
and invite you.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.367
I've been invited
to three or four.

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:16.200
I've never said yes.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.990
I talked to my
friend, Gino Barasa.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.950
He was invited to one.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.115
He was excited, because
he was kind of thinking

00:27:21.115 --> 00:27:21.645
he could get some action.

00:27:21.645 --> 00:27:23.950
He did it for a while, and
he felt like it was rotten,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.080
and he left.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.770
And there's this website
called SocialBlade.com,

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.682
which keeps track of
follower growth over time

00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:34.140
and all that kind of stats,
because that's the only way you

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.337
can really see over time.

00:27:36.337 --> 00:27:38.670
And he shows me the time when
he dropped out of the pod.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.212
You see his follower
count drop down,

00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:42.378
his engagement dropped down,
all that kind of stuff.

00:27:42.378 --> 00:27:44.400
So you see a quick ramp-up
as you join the pod,

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.930
then drop down.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.820
And so you just
sit around and wait

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.970
to get invited because
it obviously makes--

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.790
like, let's say you're
in a fashion pod.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.730
Like, we need to get
that gal that has--

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.130
that woman-- that has
100,000 followers.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.170
If she joins us, it'll
be great for the pods.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.880
They want high-level people.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.680
They don't want people
with less followers.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.850
But people with just
a few followers,

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.683
they really want to be
in there because it's

00:28:07.683 --> 00:28:09.330
good-- it's good for them.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.680
It's just a little bit of too--

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.870
and really, what
this amounts to is

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.520
people have to stay on their
phone 8 to 10 hours a day,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.522
which many already do.

00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:17.980
They're flipping
through Instagram,

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:23.040
typing for this ridiculous
system, that is coerced,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.860
inauthentic, and unethical.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.840
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
A question-- and I

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.470
don't presume you
know the answer--

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.320
but do you feel
like the platforms--

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.150
and let's speak at an industry
level versus one company,

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.620
but the platforms are
complicit and actually

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.070
benefit from behaviors
like this in terms

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.130
of being attractive to
brands and things like that?

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.235
Or are they truly
in an arms race

00:28:46.235 --> 00:28:47.610
where they're
doing the best they

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:53.177
can to stop and condemn these
behaviors, but it's hopeless?

00:28:53.177 --> 00:28:54.760
TREY RATCLIFF: I
don't know if they're

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.410
complicit or complacent.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.180
It's unclear.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.835
They're not doing
much to curb it.

00:29:02.835 --> 00:29:04.460
Every now and then,
every three months,

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.335
they have a big announcement
that we're going

00:29:06.335 --> 00:29:08.140
to curb this kind of behavior.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.520
But then I looked online.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.290
Three or six months
later, it's now

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.760
mushroomed into
ten times as much.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.760
Part of the problem is
they do want big numbers.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.120
I think that looks
good for Wall Street.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.240
They want people to stay on
the screen as long as they can,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.090
because then they
get to see more ads.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.840
I don't know if these are--

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.000
I don't know if you can
put moral judgment into it,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.550
but I don't find
these to be great.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.300
Because you're-- there's a
billion humans out there that

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.070
are using this stuff.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.750
And you can make
a strong argument

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.540
that people are wasting
many, many hours a day,

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.160
countless days per month,
probably a few months a year,

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.378
in doing things that
you shouldn't be doing.

00:29:46.378 --> 00:29:47.920
There's so many more
things you could

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.930
be doing that are
positive, that are

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.550
loving for your family, and
friends, and for the planet.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.390
So in that sense, I do
kind of find it unethical.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.090
I pose a few possible
solutions in the book.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.580
One, which I don't think
they would ever do,

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.660
is adopt the Spotify,
Netflix model.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.990
It's proven people are
willing to pay for content.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.200
And I think that would be
great, because now people

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.170
would get their feed in
chronological order once again,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.480
not get any ads.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.280
Their profits might
drop, but they'll still

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.910
make billions of dollars.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.780
And they will be
plenty profitable.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.250
They're going to have to--

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.890
that's such a big pivot for
such these Queen Mary type

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:27.810
organizations.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.170
They may not do it.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.750
It's going to make the users
angry when they find out

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.810
they have to pay.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.820
But the users are already angry.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.360
Give them this option.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.500
Say, here you go.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.330
I think that's a
possible solution.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.080
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We've
explored something

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.960
like that with YouTube
Red, that enables

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.450
you to pay a small
monthly fee, and you

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.855
don't get the pre-roll ads.

00:30:47.855 --> 00:30:48.730
TREY RATCLIFF: Right.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.630
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And
millions of people

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.550
have signed up for that.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:50.640
TREY RATCLIFF: Right.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.300
BRADLEY HOROTWITZ: Yeah.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.330
OK, I want to turn it
over to both in the room,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:59.080
we have runners with mics, as
well as we'll flip to the Dory

00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.770
shortly.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.978
AUDIENCE: So Trey, we've
done a couple of experiments

00:31:01.978 --> 00:31:04.300
with applying machine
learning to photos,

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.540
trying to separate out the
good ones from the bad ones.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.030
And one of the factors
that always comes up

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.130
as the strongest
is people really

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.250
like it when you turn
the HDR up to 11.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.190
And so you were way
out in front on that.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.950
But how do we know when
we're doing what people like

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.980
and when have you gone too far?

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.303
TREY RATCLIFF: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:31:27.303 --> 00:31:28.970
Yeah, I think one
reason I was unpopular

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.470
as a photographer
is because I liked

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.270
very vibrant,
colorful photos that

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.710
had high dynamic range in it.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.650
That spoke to my
retinex in my brain.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.403
It just made a lot
of sense to me.

00:31:38.403 --> 00:31:40.070
We're not supposed
to manipulate photos.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.295
That was a bad thing to do.

00:31:43.295 --> 00:31:44.170
It's a good question.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.000
You know, I know
one thing for sure

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.110
is that the stats show that
if you put up a picture--

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.000
if you, yourself,
are in the photo,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.790
it gets 30% to 40% more likes.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.460
And people are so addicted
to this public scoreboard

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.950
of how popular you are,
or how important you are,

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.590
or how meaningful you are
as a human is somehow based

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.420
on your likes, that
people are drawn,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.730
like, I better put
myself in the photo.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.533
There was a trend that started
about five years ago, where--

00:32:10.533 --> 00:32:11.950
I mostly do landscape
photography.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.540
A lot of people started to put
themselves in the landscape.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.450
You know, they would hold
out their arms outstretched,

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.825
like, I'm finding
my true meaning

00:32:17.825 --> 00:32:20.030
in life and all this nonsense.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.030
Or there would be like a
solitary shadow holding

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.960
a flashlight, like
considering life,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.840
the universe, and everything.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.462
And those always
got a ton of votes.

00:32:27.462 --> 00:32:29.170
And I thought, well,
maybe I should start

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.370
putting myself in the photo.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.870
I was like, that's
ridiculous, Trey,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.470
you know, you would just be
following what other people do.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.800
But like even I had
that temptation.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.880
So sometimes I think
that what looks popular

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.250
may not always be the best
or like truly innovative.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.022
So if you look at your--

00:32:51.022 --> 00:32:52.730
if you look at stats
across the internet,

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.880
if you look at the overall
bell curve of like 10

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.047
million photos, and you see
which ones have the most

00:32:57.047 --> 00:32:58.880
likes with machine
learning, you'd be like,

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.270
oh, OK, they all seem
to have a picture

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.440
of a person's face in there.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.490
So then the algorithm
might go through like, hey,

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.190
let us help you find
your best photos.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.623
It'll go through 1,000 photos
you took over the week,

00:33:10.623 --> 00:33:12.040
and it will only
serve up pictures

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.408
with your face in
it, which may not

00:33:14.408 --> 00:33:15.700
be the most interesting photos.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.620
They are to the
generalized bell curve,

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.820
but they may not be
the most interesting

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.540
because humans just
naturally respond

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.210
to other people's faces.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:29.290
So you've got a whole
can of worms there,

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.540
trying to figure out what's--

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.260
because you may not want to
go to the middle of the bell

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.510
curve, because the middle
bell curve is boring.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.030
None of us were
born to be boring.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.780
None of us were born
to take boring photos

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.520
and share boring photos.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.360
So you kind of look at these
trends on a meta level.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.770
And to me, I find photography
is a great creative tool

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.900
that we all have
access to now that can

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.870
help you find your true self.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.870
So you take photos of a
lot of different things.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.412
And you kind of
choose what you like.

00:33:55.412 --> 00:33:58.750
And you post-process
in a certain way.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.970
And you might be
tempted to copycat

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.850
other people for a
while, but then you

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.220
start to find your own voice.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.170
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I have a
follow-up question to that.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.880
In terms of finding
your own voice,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.719
tools like Instagram
filters, Vasco,

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:20.020
have made it so easy
with one click or a swipe

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.380
to sort of post-process
and treat your photos.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.360
And I think at first, it
was a big improvement over--

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.739
your crappy photos now looked
stylized and maybe crappy

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:33.639
on purpose.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:38.440
But it's certainly
overplayed and takes away

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.270
some of that individual voice.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.389
I mean, the dawn of
#nofilter is sort

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:46.630
of like this is authentic
and not overprocessed.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.949
What are your thoughts
about empowering everyone

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.900
with the superpowers
of what used

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.420
to be the purview of
photoshopped jockeys and people

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.600
who could afford expensive
post-processing is now

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.010
sort of a swipe away?

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.427
What are your
thoughts about that?

00:35:01.427 --> 00:35:02.802
TREY RATCLIFF: I
think it's great

00:35:02.802 --> 00:35:04.090
if people want to use filters.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.270
We-- a little plug here for a
product we made with Skylum.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.540
We made this thing
called Aurora HDR.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.930
It's on Mac and Windows.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.760
And last year, we actually
won Mac's app of the year.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.580
It has millions of downloads.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.390
And like me, as a photographer
with a special technique,

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.890
why would I want to share my
special technique with millions

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:21.640
of people?

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.670
Because I know it's
not a zero sum game.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.740
It makes the whole pie bigger.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.660
And you can't teach millions or
billions of people meditation.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.620
You can, but it's hard.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.037
You can teach them
to be creative.

00:35:34.037 --> 00:35:35.978
And I think when
you're a creative space

00:35:35.978 --> 00:35:37.270
that you're being very present.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.278
There's no past and
there's no future.

00:35:39.278 --> 00:35:41.320
So I think if people are
using filters and having

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.210
fun, that's a good idea.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.710
One thing that I would
say, future proofing,

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.970
is that this is not how you'll
interact with the world in 10

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.980
years, I promise you, OK?

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.605
Looking at a little
square, this is not

00:35:56.605 --> 00:35:59.480
a way to look at a photo.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.380
It's not-- it kind of
makes sense for the brain,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.440
but it doesn't.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.190
Like, if you've been
to a museum recently,

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.350
and you've seen like
a large format print,

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.870
and you physically have to move
your head around a landscape

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.730
to see it, this is natural.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.723
Because humans standing
in a landscape,

00:36:14.723 --> 00:36:17.140
you move your head around, and
you build a patchwork quilt

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.320
of what it's like.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.310
Here, your eye is just
looking at one little thing.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.800
And you can make almost
anything look good on Instagram.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.970
Everyone's a great
photographer on Instagram.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:31.150
But that may not translate
into the next layer, some AR,

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:35.290
VR combo, where we're
looking around a landscape.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.337
There may be 3D
that comes into it.

00:36:37.337 --> 00:36:38.920
So this whole world
of little filters,

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.920
I think it's good to
experiment, because now you

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.707
realize, oh, I can be creative.

00:36:42.707 --> 00:36:45.040
Think about this as a stepping
stone for what everything

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.240
will become in the future.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.070
I don't know what it
is, but it definitely

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.687
won't be looking
at a little square.

00:36:49.687 --> 00:36:51.270
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Well, I want to push

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:53.910
you to offer some ideas
about what it might

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.620
be beyond the little square.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.690
You look at
synthetic photography

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:02.430
and even the pixel camera now
is able to do incredible night

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.850
photography using techniques
that are AI based.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.860
What do you think might be next?

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.560
Is it combining modalities?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.310
Like, do you want to
bring in sound, and depth,

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.230
and 3D modeling?

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:21.090
Or is it more in the
frame buffer and sort

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.640
of the processing of capture?

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.160
What do you think are the big
innovations in photography

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.890
that you're attuned
to or curious

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.418
about in the next 10 years?

00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:33.460
TREY RATCLIFF: I love my
pixel phone, by the way.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:39.850
I'm not paid Google guy, but
I love it, independently.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.540
Well, people do like to
be visually stimulated.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.010
And there seems to be
no limit to that, right?

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.810
The more visually stimulating
it is, the better.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.290
A 4K is better than 10 EP.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.380
And so it's all going
in that direction.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.560
And we do have this bifurcated,
rectangular viewing system,

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.130
so that's why we tend to
like rectangular things.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.937
And given the
preference, we would not

00:38:00.937 --> 00:38:03.270
like to have any borders
around that, just like we don't

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.100
have any borders in real life.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.240
The higher the fidelity
and the more realistic, I

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.470
think the more we'll like it.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.060
There's going to
be stepping stones,

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.740
of course, until
we get to something

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.237
that feels as real as this.

00:38:17.237 --> 00:38:18.820
But I think the
realer we get to this,

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.640
the more people will like it.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.340
Now, of course, this means
some kind of VR topping,

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.160
or AR that goes black,
and gives you this.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.950
I don't believe in 360,
because people are lazy,

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.155
and you like to sit down.

00:38:30.155 --> 00:38:32.280
You're not going to be
turning around on cell phone

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.560
to see what's going
on behind you.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.248
But I believe in 180.

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.470
Two modalities-- one,
I think will be--

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:44.420
maybe three-- and one will just
be a photo, just a still photo.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.720
And like, wow, this
is really cool.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.940
It looks perfect.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.682
A second version of that
is one that's moving.

00:38:50.682 --> 00:38:52.140
I think in landscapes,
but it could

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.970
be you're just sitting there in
Shibuya, the crossing in Tokyo,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.532
and you're sitting there
just watching people go by.

00:39:00.532 --> 00:39:01.740
Someone could even set up a--

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.830
Google could set up a camera
there that's just 180,

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.612
super-high-res, 10K around you.

00:39:07.612 --> 00:39:09.570
And I would just probably
sit there on my couch

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:14.376
and just watch people cross
the street for hours, you know.

00:39:14.376 --> 00:39:16.320
You can do the same
thing with a field

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.185
in New Zealand, where the
flowers are flapping around.

00:39:19.185 --> 00:39:20.602
You see a bird
every now and then.

00:39:20.602 --> 00:39:20.760
There's a mountain
in the distance.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.810
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Just a sort of portal

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:22.500
to another point in the world.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.125
TREY RATCLIFF: Yeah,
you're just there.

00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:26.678
And I think that can
be quite relaxing.

00:39:26.678 --> 00:39:28.220
Because I know people
like to travel.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.887
Not everyone can
afford it, but soon you

00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:32.405
can do it in absolute
fidelity, almost as good.

00:39:32.405 --> 00:39:33.780
Without going
through the trouble

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.910
of going through airport
security, and TSA, and all

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:36.930
that jazz.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.990
You can have a
meaningful experience.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.070
So mode one is a still picture.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.580
Level two is having
motion, like with no story.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.730
Level three is having
motion with a story.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.790
Like you're sitting in
the middle of a play.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.830
You're watching "The
Book of Mormon."

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.830
And you're just sitting
actually on the stage.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.923
You can look around and
watch all these actors.

00:39:57.923 --> 00:39:59.840
This could be all be all
new for storytelling,

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.780
all new equipment,
all new skills.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.690
No one has created
these tools really yet.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.600
So chances are
everybody in this room

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.360
and my kids are going to be
doing things that haven't even

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.797
been created yet with tools
that haven't been created yet.

00:40:14.797 --> 00:40:16.380
Just like when I
went to school, there

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.578
was no digital photography.

00:40:17.578 --> 00:40:18.495
There was no internet.

00:40:18.495 --> 00:40:19.950
And now I'm doing it.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.620
So there's going to be,
like, so much opportunity

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.700
for creativity.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.140
And I know what people are like.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.750
People love
consuming stuff, too.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.880
I do think everyone
can be creative.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.400
And I think this will give them
an opportunity to play around

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.510
with being creative.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.280
Just like right now, they're
doing things on their phone,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.640
they'll have some device that
they can capture the world

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.160
around them, and
they can share it,

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.290
and people can see their world.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.990
They can have all new
levels of creativity.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.000
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So if
you do have a question,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.120
it would be helpful
to move to the aisles

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.920
while Trey's answering.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.890
In the back, please.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.880
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
how you reconcile

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.780
the treatment of places
of natural beauty

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.150
that are maybe not well known.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.420
You're trying to share and
celebrate these locations,

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.480
but then you're giving away
location and destroying it,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.180
like "Sunset Magazine," the
pristine beach, or trail,

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.893
or campground.

00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:17.310
You show up on the
cover "Sunset,"

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.920
and it used to be that
was the end of that place.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.410
And now Instagram is
destroying locations

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.090
when it attracts so many people.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:26.190
And yet, you want
to share, right?

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:29.470
How do you cope with
that philosophically?

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.120
TREY RATCLIFF: That's
a good question.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.610
There's been a lot of
stories now about what you

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.220
said, Instagram ruining places.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.770
To me, that's an egotistic
thing, where people just

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.300
go get copycat photos.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.280
So they get a
photo of themselves

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.262
in front of this famous
street in London.

00:41:44.262 --> 00:41:45.970
And you just look up
and down the street,

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.860
and everyone's just taking
Instagram photos of themselves,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.730
so they get more likes, and
they repeat what others--

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.330
this is what I consider to
be mass delusional behavior.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:56.590
We've never seen this
in human history.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:03.610
And I think the root of this,
by the way, is tied to our--

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.780
I'll think of the
word in a minute.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.553
Our 150 people--

00:42:07.553 --> 00:42:08.470
I know what you know--

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:09.250
that we have in our village.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:09.970
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
The Dunbar number.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.595
TREY RATCLIFF: Yeah,
the Dunbar number.

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:14.170
The Dunbar's 150, which
comes from-- for 99%

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.507
of our ancestors, we lived in
villages with about 150 people.

00:42:17.507 --> 00:42:20.470
You knew your immediate family,
your friends, the shaman,

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.850
the warriors, that
sort of stuff.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.727
So your brain got wired to
keep track of 150 people.

00:42:25.727 --> 00:42:27.310
If you think about
your real life now,

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.640
you can really keep track of
about 150 people, not thousands

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.660
and thousands.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.370
And normally, for
99.9% of our history,

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.960
you've been around
those 150 people.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.220
And you're checking
in, and you kind of

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.390
know people's relationships,
and that sort of stuff.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.420
But now we're separated.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.880
We might only have like 10
people around us that we know.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.380
And we're kind of connected to
other people on the internet.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.630
But you're also connected
to thousands, and thousands,

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.460
and thousands of people.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.350
And so, whereas before you
wanted to put on a good show

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.290
to make sure you impressed
people in your 150 people,

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:00.790
to make sure they're
happy with you,

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.020
make sure you're being
a responsible member

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.395
of the tribe, that
kind of stuff,

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:05.920
and that you're attractive,
or whatever, that you're

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.630
doing something needed.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.350
Now you're connected to
thousands or even more.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.490
And people have this compunction
to impress strangers.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.970
This never happened before.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.570
So now you've defined
your self-worth

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.600
on what thousands of strangers
think about you, who will never

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.950
have any impact on
your life or whatever,

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.660
you'll never be friends with.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.290
And if you don't
impress total strangers,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.000
you find yourself unworthy.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.070
So that's why people are going
out to do this kind of thing.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.060
I think the problem more is with
the selfie kind of situation,

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.500
or people taking photos of
their friends in these places.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.950
It doesn't happen quite so
much for landscape photography.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.350
There is sort of this
roadside bingo thing

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.200
with landscape photography.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.010
So you go to Tunnel
View in Yosemite,

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.730
and you'll see like 50 people
lined up to get the same photo.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.590
That's not as
environmentally destructive

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.840
as some of these other things.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.170
I tend not to do that.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.468
I tend to go around the outside
and try different things.

00:44:03.468 --> 00:44:05.260
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Have
you ever obfuscated,

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.420
like you're not going
to reveal where this is?

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:12.102
Like have you-- or do you feel
like that's not necessary?

00:44:12.102 --> 00:44:14.560
TREY RATCLIFF: No, I share
where it is, because people ask.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.560
It seems wrong to say I'm
not going to tell you.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560
You know, that's seems--

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.010
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
That's selfish.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:20.440
TREY RATCLIFF: Mean.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.398
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:44:21.398 --> 00:44:23.010
No, no, no--

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.100
TREY RATCLIFF: Yeah, but also
at the same time, I go out there

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.962
and profess like,
find your own places.

00:44:27.962 --> 00:44:28.920
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.270
TREY RATCLIFF: It's not--

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.800
it's not any great
accomplishment

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.500
to go copy a place that I took.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.050
For example, this
is why I don't take

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.470
underwater photography
of like sharks, and whale

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.770
sharks, and coral, and
all this stuff because we

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.940
know Eric Chang.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.900
He's so good at it.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.140
It would take me 10 years to
be able to get to where he is.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.250
I'm interested in it,
but I just can't do that.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.750
So I kind of stick
with what I know.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.240
And I like finding new places.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.160
I like street photography,
because that's always

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:57.660
different.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.470
It's always dynamic.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.803
You'll never see the same thing.

00:45:02.646 --> 00:45:04.173
I hope that helps.

00:45:04.173 --> 00:45:05.340
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.913
Acknowledging the
"Sunset" effect

00:45:06.913 --> 00:45:08.080
that was brought up earlier.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.975
So you're visiting
Northern California.

00:45:09.975 --> 00:45:12.540
A couple of your quick
favorite spots to go

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.850
shoot that you maybe already
have shot and anything

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.707
on your bucket list,
like around here?

00:45:16.707 --> 00:45:18.624
TREY RATCLIFF: All right,
Northern California.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:27.010
Down PCH, Highway 1, is a really
cute place called McWay Falls.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.760
It's a little waterfall that
you can't see from the road.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.010
And there's usually
not many people there.

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:37.380
I chose to reinvent the shot
by just going at midnight

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.260
when it was under a full moon.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.530
And I thought it
was very romantic.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.060
It looked like the
"Star Trek" set.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.560
You know, the old school "Star
Trek," where it doesn't quite

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.590
look real.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:48.560
Muir Woods is great.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.770
Again, I consider it almost
like street photography,

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:53.553
because there's so many views
and it can be so unique.

00:45:53.553 --> 00:45:55.720
Although, shooting in a
forest, is very difficult to

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.422
get the 3D-ness of
it into a 2D photo.

00:45:59.422 --> 00:46:00.995
Oh, man, there's so
many great places

00:46:00.995 --> 00:46:03.730
all in Northern California.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.140
I've been doing some street
photography the last two days

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:09.083
and two nights in San
Francisco around Chinatown,

00:46:09.083 --> 00:46:11.000
because you just see
interesting people there.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.050
There's cool lights.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.520
It's different.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.943
In a way, it could be anywhere.

00:46:14.943 --> 00:46:16.610
I like having photos
are a bit timeless.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.910
They could be anywhere.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.630
Gosh, that's all I can think.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.470
Those are three off
the top of my head.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.512
But if you go to my blog
and click on California,

00:46:25.512 --> 00:46:27.798
you'll see a lot.

00:46:27.798 --> 00:46:29.840
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: In terms
of street photography,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.000
I have a question.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.110
Obviously, if you're taking
a photo of Shibuya Crossing,

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:38.090
you don't go and
tell everyone I'm

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.650
going to be taking
a photo of you

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.350
and get their affirmative
consent and things like that.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.340
What are your feelings around
consent and capturing photos

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.558
of people in that context?

00:46:48.558 --> 00:46:50.600
TREY RATCLIFF: I'm definitely
a bit of a renegade

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.333
on this and no authority.

00:46:52.333 --> 00:46:53.750
But I do take a
lot street photos.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:57.210
And I never ask for permission.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.400
There's a caveat on that.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.947
Because I want
them to be natural.

00:47:01.947 --> 00:47:03.780
As soon as people know
the camera's on them,

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.220
a lot of people
get a little weird,

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.780
even if they're
trying to act casual.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.510
Like, only a real model
can really act casual.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.120
So you really lose the moment.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.650
You lose-- you lose the
person or the people

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.890
and the way they're interacting
with this environment, which

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.940
it should be very natural.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.030
Now, if I get a good photo,
which sometimes I do, and then

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.707
they noticed me, which sometimes
they do, I say, hey, guys,

00:47:26.707 --> 00:47:27.540
I got a great photo.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.060
Do you want to see?

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.070
And I show it to them.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.903
I say, do you want me
to you send it to you?

00:47:30.903 --> 00:47:33.150
99% of the time,
they say, no problem.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:37.120
Same thing with Burning Man is
people are dressed crazy there.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.120
You know, there's nudity
and stuff like that.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.470
I go crazy taking photos.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:44.425
I don't take nudes, because that
just seems a little gratuitous.

00:47:44.425 --> 00:47:46.050
You know, I try to
be inventive and not

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.390
show those-- show those parts.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.925
And I do it without
permission because people

00:47:50.925 --> 00:47:52.050
are in their natural state.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:54.240
You know, they're really
feeling their own sense

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.630
of self-expression, whatever
happens to be going on.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.055
And almost always, I go
over, show them the photo,

00:48:00.055 --> 00:48:03.570
and I send it to them.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.772
I've only gotten like 1
out of 1,000 rejections.

00:48:05.772 --> 00:48:07.980
Someone came up to me and
told me to erase the photo.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.380
And it's because she
was a schoolteacher.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.030
And she didn't want the
other parents to find out.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.030
I said, hey, no problem.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.830
She didn't say it in a mean way.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.140
She's was like, totally cool.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.710
I know what you're doing.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.325
But I don't want
to get in trouble.

00:48:18.325 --> 00:48:19.377
I was like, no problems.

00:48:19.377 --> 00:48:20.460
So yeah, it's really fine.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:25.050
Especially, I find that
the US is very fear based.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.182
If there's a kid in
the photo, they just

00:48:27.182 --> 00:48:28.890
assume you're some
kind of child predator

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.380
because the news media
has scared moms so much.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.290
And I don't think
that's healthy.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.790
When I think a lot
of photographers,

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.780
we just think kids are cute.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:43.050
So now, I tend to take photos
more in Asia, in Japan, where

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.280
they don't think it's weird.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.180
You don't get people--

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.760
people are just like ready
to be offended by stuff here.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.990
You know, they think--

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.450
it's poisonous how
much fear there is.

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.190
And not just in the
US, but other places.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.600
They just think like their
hackles are always up instead

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.305
of--

00:48:59.305 --> 00:49:00.930
it's the total opposite
of Burning Man,

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.160
where you're walking around.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.660
Everyone is just
there full of love.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.000
No one's going to
come after you.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.770
That's why I wish the world
was more full of love.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:13.113
And I think it's up to people
like us to make that happen.

00:49:13.113 --> 00:49:15.030
AUDIENCE: So a question
about post-processing.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:20.100
So oftentimes, due to
post-processing, photographs

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.250
are warped from reality.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.440
Sometimes I wonder
what was the reality

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.510
and what is the actual outcome?

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.300
Is there some standard that
photographers generally

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.470
should prescribe to, to indicate
how much processing has been

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:37.110
done, and how much
further of a photo

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.690
has morphed from the reality?

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:44.430
TREY RATCLIFF: Well, there's no
standard for any creative art.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:48.690
Absolutely, that's sort
of a basic statement.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.040
I'll tell you what I tend to do.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.130
This is my thought process.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:58.290
I think a lot about
kids and how they're

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.840
able to very quickly
go between what's real

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.150
and what's not
real effortlessly.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.500
They have a very thin membrane.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.920
They'll be talking about
dragons and all kinds of stuff,

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.465
and then suddenly you're talking
about having some pudding.

00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:12.770
And they just go back
and forth, you know.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:16.830
And it's not clear that
they're sure of the difference.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:19.230
But as humans, we don't have
this thin membrane-- or as

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.940
grown-ups, we don't
have this thin membrane.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.107
Our membrane gets thicker,
and thicker, and thicker.

00:50:23.107 --> 00:50:25.890
And we're like, this is real,
and this is what's not real.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:28.800
And you still enjoy
the fantasy, not real,

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.700
but you have to go into a
dark theater for two hours,

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.450
turn off the lights
so no one can see you,

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.580
so you can be alone,
and experience

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.760
this fantasy reality, which
you completely give up.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.205
You say, like, oh, man,
this is a great story.

00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:42.330
And you really get into it.

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.760
It doesn't matter
if it's not real.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.040
And this is part of
my overall thesis,

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.160
is there's not a big
difference between what's real

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.020
and what's not real,
as long as it's

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.520
beautiful and full of truth.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:57.320
So for my photos, I usually
like to walk that line.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.020
Like, is it real,
is it not real?

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:05.520
And this causes a conflict
in the brain, as you wonder,

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.720
is it real or not real?

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.760
And I think this tension between
what's real and what's not real

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.680
is interesting.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.220
Counterintuitively, with
art, especially photography,

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:24.600
is you want to confuse or
abstract the information

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.730
so that their brain has
to look at it for a while

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:27.980
to figure out what's going on.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.000
I notice when I look at
Instagram or Facebook,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.042
I stop on the photos that
don't quite make sense.

00:51:32.042 --> 00:51:33.192
I'm like, what's going on?

00:51:33.192 --> 00:51:33.900
Is this a shadow?

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.860
Is it a dress?

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:39.040
Where's the light coming from?

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.596
So those ones that are
mysterious, I stay on.

00:51:41.596 --> 00:51:43.890
The phones today are so good.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.460
You take a picture and
everything is totally literal.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.520
There's no guesswork.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.520
It's almost like a
courtroom drawing.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.620
You see everything
that's there and the mind

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.670
has nothing to wonder about.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.470
So I do what Pierre
Auguste Renoir did.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.590
He would always purposely
obscure information,

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:04.320
or confuse information, or
have parts of his painting

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.940
that didn't make sense.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.640
Because as you're
trying to work it out,

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.720
your brain doesn't
really like a mystery.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:15.593
It will start to fill that
mystery with your own history.

00:52:15.593 --> 00:52:17.760
Everything that you feel,
everything that you think,

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.103
your own stories.

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:21.270
So you're going to start
to build a story about what

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:22.470
this is about.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.330
And as you're doing
that, you become really

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.030
intertwined with the art piece.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:30.330
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I recently
bumped into a listicle, which

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.820
was top 20 optical illusions.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:38.340
And if you ever need a reminder
that reality is a construct,

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.640
anyways, so much of these
were just absolutely stunning

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.600
in terms of how much my brain
filled in or hallucinated,

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.520
given the right raw material.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.910
So it's fascinating
that you deliberately

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:52.950
play with real and
non-real, because it's

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.750
happening all the time whether
we're aware of it or not.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.110
AUDIENCE: What's your
advice for discovering

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.840
new content beyond
the mainstream

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.080
that everybody thinks about?

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:07.530
How do you find the next cool
thing to pay attention to?

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.030
TREY RATCLIFF: I
would try to follow

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:10.830
curators that are out there.

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.370
Like, not everybody
is a pure creator.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.640
Some people are curators.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.180
And they are following
new people all the time,

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.790
recommending new talent.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.620
There's lots of great
websites for that.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.100
And also, if you just
follow some artist

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.570
that you respect
and admire, they

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.970
will often mention other people.

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:31.012
Like, oh, he thinks these
people are interesting,

00:53:31.012 --> 00:53:34.828
I'm going to go follow them.

00:53:34.828 --> 00:53:36.120
That's probably my best advice.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.090
Follow curators and trust
what your current network is.

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.270
Always be up--

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.710
I always say always be
upgrading your Dunbar 150.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.920
You really only have to follow
150 really interesting people.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.350
That's what your
brain is used for.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.030
Same way with friends, try to
keep upgrading your friends.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.530
Not to say your old
friends are bad,

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.573
but you deserve great friends.

00:53:55.573 --> 00:53:56.490
You deserve great art.

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:58.080
You deserve to be inspired.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.602
You deserve all these
things as a human.

00:54:00.602 --> 00:54:02.310
I remember the name
of that book that I--

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:04.560
it's my number one
book recommendation.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.338
It's called "The Untethered
Soul," by Michael Singer.

00:54:08.338 --> 00:54:09.880
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Thank you for that.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.640
TREY RATCLIFF: Sure.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.973
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And thank you.

00:54:11.973 --> 00:54:14.190
I want to, on behalf of
all of us here at Google,

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:17.180
thank you for the work that
you do, both the art you create

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.910
and taking the time
to explain the process

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.980
and invite us into
your own journey.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.600
It's incredibly generous
and incredibly helpful.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.910
Thank you, Trey.

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.060
[APPLAUSE]
