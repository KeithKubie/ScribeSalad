00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
We're talking about the Euler line, which is a special so-to-speak "highway" for any triangle.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.340
For any triangle you can draw this highway

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.960
but you need to identify some very special points for the triangle.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:23.220
You can do everything that we talk about today using only a straight edge with no markings and a compass.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.340
So these constructions are called Euclidean constructions.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.080
So let's start with the first point.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.240
Well you can take the midpoints of each of the sides

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.420
and connect them to the opposite vertex.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.120
This segment here, CD, has a special name.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.940
It's called the median of the triangle.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.360
Okay, so how many medians we have... is three.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.260
The fact that this worked for one triangle does not guarantee that it will work for all.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.160
and so, should I draw a lot of pictures here and try on each of them?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.580
Or should I use some technology?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.640
Let's use technology.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.000
So let us now experiment having a different triangle.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.440
Well, they seem to intersect.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.460
Ooh fancy, I can get wild. Ooh.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.680
So it looks like for any triangle we will have those three segments intersecting in a point.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.400
Well that point turns out to be the center of mass.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.120
or our point which also is known as the centroid

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.780
or in Eastern Europe it is known by the name medicenter

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.480
which simply says it's the center of the three medians.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.320
The other point will have some practical implications

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.360
If you have two villages and you want to build a railroad

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.160
so that no matter when on this railroad you build a station

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.360
the people from the two villages will walk the same distances to that station.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.760
It's called the perpendicular bisector of segment AB.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.180
Hmm, no matter where you are on this railroad you build your station S,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.320
People from both villages will walk exactly the same distance.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.280
Suppose you have three villages which want to build a school.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.180
Where will they build the school so that kids from all three villages

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.680
walk exactly the same distance to the school?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.520
If you want villagers from A and B to walk the same distance

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.360
then you have to be on there, the perpendicular bisector.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.960
You can also say, about being fair to villages C and A,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.660
those villagers have to walk on the corresponding railroad.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.140
The school should be built where the two perpendicular bisectors intersect.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.220
So if we call this O,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.380
OB = OA, and OA = OC.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.240
(Brady) This is different to the medicenter?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.620
Yes, it is a very different one

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.540
and it has a name, it's called the circumcenter

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.660
because they're referring to a circle whose center is O

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.080
and that circle passes through the three vertices

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.600
Right now, the circumcenter is inside.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.380
The moment it passes the triangle,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.520
that triangle seems to be a right triangle.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.380
And this is true.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.800
Now if we push the circumcenter out, then the triangle becomes obtuse

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.320
and this is a property which is true for any triangle.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.580
That may not be the most optimal position for the three villages

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.500
but if you want to be fair to all three then you may have to take it out and they form an obtuse triangle

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.140
(Brady) Which one is the actual center of the triangle?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.620
There is no actual center; it depends on your viewpoint,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.080
so both of them deserve to be called centers of the triangle.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.780
So the area of a triangle is base times height (also called altitude) divided by 2

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.280
All right, so let's locate this height

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.860
So we need to drop a perpendicular from point C to side AB

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.540
There's your right angle.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.600
I'm so good I can do it from any position -

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.120
I'm just kidding, I will turn it.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.700
Guess what happens?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.520
Those three altitudes intersect in a point.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.000
That point, usually denoted by H, is called the orthocenter of the triangle

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.620
and in mathematics, when you say that some objects are orthogonal - some lines -

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.300
you really mean they're perpendicular.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.160
So we're intersecting the three perpendiculars, or the three altitudes, in this triangle

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.840
and again, they happen to intersect in the same point.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.480
So now, we want to again check if this is not a coincidence,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.380
so let us use our magic software.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.020
Yes, we will move it around

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.080
Now watch what will happen with this orthocenter as I try to get it next to C...

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.920
That triangle will be right

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.200
So you can push the orthocenter out, but it will again happen when the triangle is obtuse.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.140
So that's the third coincidence we have seen.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.860
We have three different centers.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.820
We're wondering which one is the most important -

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.900
there is no good answer to that question.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.840
(Brady) Which is your favourite?

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.800
The centroid.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.300
So now -

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.260
(Brady) Why do you - hang on - why do you like the centroid?

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.980
Ahh, because - oh there is something we didn't prove.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.300
This guy, AG... to GE, is like, 2:1.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.180
It's twice as long.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.860
And the same thing happens on the other medians

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.660
So they're all in ratio 2:1

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.480
This is a property which was part of the regular geometry program in Bulgaria in maybe 8th or 9th grade

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.080
and I remember its proof with similar tirangles

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.720
and I was astounded how you can prove such complicated facts using basic geometric tools

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.340
Okay, so now, if you are brave enough to draw all three in a single picture -

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.660
Okay, well I'm just going to basically close my eyes and draw three points.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.020
Will those three points lie on a... special place?

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.200
(Brady) Ah well, with you, they probably will!

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.380
Probably? Well let's try!

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.520
Okay I'm just going to do it on the side.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.740
*gasps*

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.260
Almost! Okay, I think you have to do it.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.620
(Brady) Even with your eyes closed, you do perfect mathematics!

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.020
(Brady) Ready? Here we go.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.500
Okay, Brady is attempting to put 3 points...
-- (Brady) Shut - my eyes are shut.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.760
He almost got them in a very special position

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.320
But not quite.
-- (Brady) But not quite.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.280
(Brady) Any three random points will rarely be on a line

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.740
Very rarely, that's a very special case.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.540
In fact, of probability zero.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.220
How about the three centers?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.860
Are they in some general position to each other, or are they relatives of each other?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.500
They're related somehow?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.420
So you have the medicenter, the circumcenter, and the orthocenter.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.880
We have the three medians, the three perpendicular bisectors, and the three altitudes.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.260
Let's simplify it...

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.220
So we are looking only at these three points. Let's see, what is happening?

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.940
So now let's see if these three centers indeed always lie on this line

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.200
They look like it.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.920
No matter what the triangle is, no matter how I pull these points apart,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.300
the three centers seem always to lie on the line

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:41.040
And the theorem says that the three centers of a triangle - circumcenter, medicenter, and orthocenter -

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.480
always lie on the single line called the Euler line.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.000
There are lots of things that turn out to be true once you know that there is this line.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.500
The other centers in the triangle are also defined using certain rules that happen to lie on this line

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.260
And so this line turns out to be sort of a highway for the triangle

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:12.040
There is one very important center called the incenter which almost never lies on this line.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.960
It refuses to lie there. So let's look at it.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.600
We will attempt to draw a circle which is inside and it touches each of the sides

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.940
What you do is you draw the angle bisector of angle A,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.480
you draw the angle bisector of angle B,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.100
and the angle bisector of angle C.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.260
They intersect in a point.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.920
The center of a circle which touches the three sides of the triangle.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.280
So again the question is, does this incenter lie on our highway?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.120
Let's check on the computer.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.400
So, off the line, it wants to be on the line, but we're not managing...

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.980
Now watch what will happen when - ah!

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.740
This is it, this is not just any triangle.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.580
It is an isosceles triangle.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.580
And so the Euler line in this case passes through vertex C.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:13.940
And it is the median, altitude, and perpendicular bisector, plus as a bonus the angle bisector of angle C.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.800
So it is all of those.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.840
And therefore, it will pass through this incenter too, if it is the angle bisector.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.080
But this happens only if the triangle is isosceles, and that's not easy to prove.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.020
What is the highway, the Euler line, for an equilateral triangle?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.460
So this is the only case where all of the centers collide in one

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.220
And you cannot draw a line; it's just a point

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:46.160
From now on, once you see a special point for a triangle, you can always ask the question,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.940
does this point lie on the Euler line or not?

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:59.840
One fourth of the big one, and you can see its siblings on the sides, these are all congruent for congruent triangles. So what is happening here.
