00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For the mean, we add up those numbers.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The sum is 342 divided by 9,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because it has 9 numbers,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
gives us 38.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For the median, we re-sort them,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we find that 9 is the number in the middle.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And for the mode, it's easy to see that there are 4 occurrences of 9.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Every other number only occurs once.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Obviously, sometimes there could be ties.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There could be 2 elements in the center

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or 2 numbers that could be for the same mode,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we just assume that ties are broken at random.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So pick either number; it doesn't really matter.
