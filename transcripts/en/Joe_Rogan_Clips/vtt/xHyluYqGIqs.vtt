1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.620
I really don't like to get into my office on,
on [inaudible].

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.220
And the reason is I just don't feel like it's my job.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
I feel like it's your job.
My job is different,
you know,

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.850
my job is to go up there and just,
you know,
make them laugh,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.510
but I don't want to be divisive.
Yeah.
I hear,
Ya know,

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.690
I just don't want to do it because it's,
my fan base is split and you know,

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:26.030
I've had,
uh,
and,
and you know,
nothing ever really happens,
but I,

8
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:30.810
I had a guy one time because I said something to meet and greet who is paid to

9
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.810
take a picture of me and then refused to take a picture of me because of what I

10
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.770
said.
And I'm like,
I don't give a fuck dude.
Don't take a picture.
Leave that.

11
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:42.420
I don't give a shit really touching.
Yeah.
But you know,
that's also one of the,

12
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.930
it's like they're exerting power over you.
I'm not even take a picture.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.670
I'm going to unfollow you on Instagram to run white.
Right.
God Damn Communist.

14
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.330
Yeah.
What am I going to do?
Yeah.
Told the one girl,
she said,

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.460
now I'm going to own file.
You used to be funny,

16
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:59.970
but now you're just doing it and I'm going to unfollow you and I know it doesn't

17
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.760
matter.
And I said,
you can't leave.
All the plants will die

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.980
whenever you're in a in a bind quote Bill Murray.

19
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.300
Yeah.
People are just so mean.
It's wanting to hurt you.
Ron White for no reason.

20
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.170
Yeah,
but nobody,

21
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.300
I've already been as mad as I can be and I'll never be mad or in.

22
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.070
It happened when I was 16 years old,

23
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.790
so it's hard to make me mad and I'll tell you what made me mad.

24
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.070
I just got my driver's license.

25
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.230
My mother asked me to go to the store to get something.

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.500
It's in the summer and he Euston.
I don't have any shoes on.

27
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.530
Oh my door step into a shitty pampers that somebody had just thrown in the

28
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:44.820
parking lot and it and I didn't just put a toe in and go,
oh,
that's baby shit.

29
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.790
That's wrong.
I just showed my whole foot into it.

30
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.790
Green baby shit coming through my toes,

31
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.140
smears all over the diaper.
Right.
So I'm stuck.

32
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.580
I don't know what to do.

33
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.120
I'm not going to get back in my mother's car with the shitty food.

34
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:03.360
I can't go into the store with baby shit all over my foot.

35
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.220
And I thought about just cutting my foot off and just leave it in the diaper

36
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:11.940
with a note that said,
you should used to be a perfectly good fucking foot dude.

37
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.400
And nobody's ever made me that mad since I was so fucking furious.

38
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:22.401
And I just wanted to hate and kill and over a shitty pamper.

39
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.120
That's crazy that that was all it took.
That's all it took.
That's all it took.

40
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:30.440
But it was so,
you know,
it just put me in a,

41
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.350
I've been stuck before.
Let me tell you about the other time I was stuck.

42
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.080
This will get us off of politics.
Um,

43
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.920
I'm in my tour bus and,
uh,

44
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.730
I'm party when my buddy Steve and my best friend,

45
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.550
my road manager who passed away and,
and he never gets laid,

46
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:49.830
but it looked like he had an angle on this girl.

47
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.000
So I picked up my beer and went back to my bedroom,
which I never do.

48
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.000
I sit up there and drink with the guys and I go back there to just to go to

49
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.260
sleep.
But I'd never take booze back there or anything in it.
But I,

50
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.800
I'd gone back there and lay down and I put that a Doseck he's bottle on the

51
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.240
counter and then we took off during the night while I was real drunk and Steve

52
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:12.550
and real drunk in the bottle falls off and breaks and I don't hear it.

53
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.880
So in the middle of the night and my bed sits high cause you want to try to get

54
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.510
those beds towards them,
center the cause.
It's on those axles anyway.

55
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:23.260
But the closer it is to the center,
the better fields when you're in it.

56
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.680
So you kind of slacked off of it about an inch.
And I have my foot went into,
uh,

57
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.540
the bottom of the beer bottle at a shard hanging off of it,

58
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:36.160
about an inch and a half long.
And uh,
and I just,
and I landed on it.

59
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.550
Well now I know exactly what it was and uh,

60
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.020
and somebody had hit the master lights so I can't turn the lights on.

61
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.390
You have to go back and turn them out on the master switch.

62
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.930
But I know that around me is broken glass everywhere because I understand what

63
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.630
happened.
I understand that bottle fell broke and I got it in my foot.

64
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.150
So I pull him up foot up and I didn't know how big the Shard was and I just pull

65
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:02.200
it out of their blood.

66
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:07.090
Just starts gushing out was Steve's passed out in a bunk and he can't hear me.

67
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.080
I can't get to a phone.
I can't see.
So what do I do?

68
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.630
I just crawled back in bed and went to sleep and bled and uh,

69
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.190
and Steve said the next morning it looked like somebody killed a hog in there

70
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.550
and,
and uh,
he is lifted up the sheets.

71
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.880
Even the bus driver saw my foot and they were like,
I just,
uh,

72
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.470
Jesus Christ.
Did you worry about bleeding out?

73
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.860
I didn't know what else to do cause they're,

74
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:36.370
the only option was to take another step and cut the other foot.

75
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.290
And,
uh,
do you have your phone with you?
I wasn't within reach.

76
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.130
I was just stuck and,
and I was also drunk,

77
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.560
stuck in drunk it bleeding.
Damn.
That's a good combination.
Yeah.
I was stumped.

78
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.540
I didn't know what to do.
I don't know how to fucking combat,

79
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.520
so I would just crawl back in bed and I'm like,
well,
is your foot oh,

80
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.070
13 stitches.
Uh,
as soon as I woke up and looked at him,

81
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.430
let's go to the hospital guys.
And uh,
things sewed it back up,

82
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:11.020
13 on the bottom of my foot,
right in the arch.
And uh,
it was,
uh,
you know,
it was,

83
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.830
it was a mess.
It was a fucking mess.
Every time if you fuck your foot up,

84
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.150
you realize how much you need them.

85
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.450
Like you could fuck your shoulder up and that sucks,

86
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.170
but you can still walk somewhere and get something with your other foot up.

87
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.350
You're like,
oh,
okay,
this is,
this is a real problem

88
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.380
operation or something.
