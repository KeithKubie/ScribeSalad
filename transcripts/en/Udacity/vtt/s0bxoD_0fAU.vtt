00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.589
Here's the equation for

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.480
computing the Sharpe ratio as
proposed by William Sharpe himself.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.760
It's the expected value of the return
on a portfolio, minus the risk free

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.560
rate of return, divided by the standard
deviation of that same difference.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.920
This is the ex ante formulation,
meaning, because we're using expected,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
it's a forward looking measure of
what the Sharpe ratio should be.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.460
Now to calculate this in reality,
we need to look back at those values.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.979
So, for instance, the expected
value of this difference is just

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.770
simply the mean of what that
difference was over time.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.540
So to calculate this in Python
using historical data, we just take

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.380
the mean of daily returns minus the
daily risk-free rate, and divide that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.660
by the standard deviation of the daily
returns minus the daily risk-free rate.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.920
Now you may be wondering,
what is this risk free rate?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.379
Where can we get it?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.820
Traditionally there are a few
numbers that people use for this.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.950
One is LIBOR or
the London Interbank Offer Rate.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.010
Another is the interest rate
on the 3-month Treasury bill.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.930
And finally, a value that
people have been using a lot

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.965
over the last [LAUGH] few years is 0.

00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:26.720
0 is a good approximation
to the risk free rate.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.341
Now I've been presenting this as if
this risk free rate changes each day.

00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:35.840
And indeed, LIBOR changes each day and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.600
3-month T-bill changes
a little bit each day.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.530
But there's a shortcut people use a lot

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.348
that simplifies this
equation significantly.

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:49.700
And this shortcut makes sense
because usually the risk free rate

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.300
is not given on a daily basis for, for

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.140
instance, putting your money in a bank
account or a certificate of deposit.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.380
Usually that's a percentage on
an annual basis or a six month basis.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.800
So you can convert that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.550
annual amount into a daily
amount using this simple trick.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.349
Let's suppose our risk free
rate is 10% per year or 0.1.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.870
That means if we start at the beginning
of the year with a value of 1.0,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.840
at the end of the year we have 1.1,
so we add 1 here.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.510
So this is the total value of our
asset at the end of the year.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.840
Now, what is the interest rate per
day that would enable us to get to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.910
this value?

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.620
It's a number that if we multiple
it by itself each day for

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.790
each day in the trading year, or
252 times, would arrive at this number.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.880
So here's how we do it.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.220
We take the 252nd root of that sum,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.840
believe it or not, that's pretty
easy to do in Python actually,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.670
and subtract 1, and
that is our daily risk free rate.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.155
We are, in most cases in this class,
just going to approximate the daily

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:06.280
risk free rate with 0, because that's
what it's been for such a long time.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.080
Of course, it may be changing in the
future, so keep this shortcut in mind.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.090
Now, suppose we want to use this value,
which is fine.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.590
We would plug that in here,
and also plug it in here.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.940
So observe that if we
plug a constant in here,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.590
in this standard deviation calculation,
we can just remove it.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.050
Because a set of values
minus a constant,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.670
when you calculate the standard
deviation, is just as if this were 0.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.740
Summing it all up, this is
the equation we typically use for

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.640
calculating Sharpe ratio
using daily returns.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.960
We drop the daily risk free rate

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.410
from the standard deviation because
we treat that as a constant.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.685
If our daily risk free rate is greater
than 0, then you need to plug it

00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:58.250
in here, but we can usually
use a constant there as well.
