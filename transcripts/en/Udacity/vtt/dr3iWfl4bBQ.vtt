00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.647
Well, let me first fill out the
information I know always be true for

00:00:03.647 --> 00:00:04.721
these intercepts.

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:10.976
Since the x-intercept goes through
the x-axis, the y value is 0.

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:17.960
And since the y-intercept goes
through the y-axis, the x value is 0.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.658
Now what else?

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:21.679
x-intercept, okay.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.220
It looks like it's going through 1,
2, 3.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.147
The x value is 3.

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:29.896
And the y value, it looks like,
is negative 1, negative 2.

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:31.684
So 0, -2.

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:33.217
If you got that, great work.

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:35.890
If not, go back and
review some of this content.
