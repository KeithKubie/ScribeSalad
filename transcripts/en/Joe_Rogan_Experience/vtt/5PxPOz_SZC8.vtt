1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey chip you out.
Why my brother?
Good to see you as always.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.610
I always get a seat.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.510
Thanks for jumping in this short notice for the folks who don't know.

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.510
I was supposed to have Kevin Leon today,
but Kevin and I,
we fucked up.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.350
It was partially my fuck up.
Partially his fuck up but he'll be on on Wednesday.

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.200
Yeah.
Aig Bra was in the neighborhood getting pumped.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.670
My friend getting getting solid.
You've been lifting the weights.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.230
How steady are you lifting now?

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.010
I tried to get three days a week but shit gets crazy sometimes and I could only

10
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.130
get to two to five stop for just a couple of weeks.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.670
I start at 51 just start getting so weak.
Even on TRT,

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
everything just start slipping.
He bought,
he's like,
Nah,

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.570
we don't need to be delivered to the shore is fuck.

14
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.630
I've been rolling with little people the last few months.

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.150
Like what kind of little people?
Hobbits?

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.350
I wish shit shit them up.
Do you think so?

17
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.290
I think Harvard's would be extraordinarily strong.
Hairy feet.

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.990
They're probably on a lot of like some kind of,
Nah,
man,

19
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.790
I bet their feet are fucking so strong.

20
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.550
Can never footlocker [inaudible] you seen the size of their heels?

21
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.260
They have giant hills,
but I bet their ligaments and shit are different.
I bet

22
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.440
there are bear.
This is weird about the hobbits right there.
Barefoot.

23
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.150
They got furry ass feet.

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.090
They have giant feet because you know obviously they had to wear those,

25
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.390
those feet over the shoes,
but even in the books didn't it didn't it did.

26
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.390
They said they had big herrings.
Look at those two books.
Yeah,
I Tom,
Holy Shit.

27
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:32.550
Out of that easy toehold hold right.
There may be.

28
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.620
Maybe my thinking is if their feet are that herring they got,
oh Jesus Christ.

29
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:39.630
What happened to that lady?
Don't do this to me,
Jamie.

30
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.400
This is the podcast that a person that's a through someone's got gout.

31
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.000
Inflammation.
No Man,
that's real.
Did you think that was a hobbit picture?
Oh,

32
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.080
that's hilarious.
Oh my God.
Google image.
Got You.
Again,

33
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.460
isn't that elephants algorithm?
That's the Russian,

34
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:58.020
so trying to fuck with this show.
No,
that is Bunyan's.
First of all,

35
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.110
that's a painful thing that happens to your big toe.

36
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.140
Some of it's genetic and some of it is putting your toes into pointed shoes for

37
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.330
like long periods of time.
Like people will have to go to work.

38
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.740
Like ladies particular,

39
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.010
they were like super uncomfortable shoes at smushed her toes up like that.

40
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.570
Your toes aren't supposed to be like that.

41
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.660
I've seen this thing on Instagram where they could fix that now with like rubber

42
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680
bands.
Yes.
Well I think that's real.
Well the,
they have yoga toes.

43
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.360
There's some shit that you use that you can,

44
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.440
you shove your feet in between these like styrofoam things that stretches them

45
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:31.470
out.
Apparently that's supposed to be good for them.
Um,

46
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.530
Vibram shoes is good.
Let's still make those,

47
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:38.480
I run in those they can suit or something.
They did get to propaganda.

48
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.650
A bunch of pussies.
Really?
Yeah.
A bunch of behind her man.
I used to,

49
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.760
I used to learn too.
Yeah.
Look man,
they're,
they're harder to run in.
No Bull Shit.

50
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.860
Good though.
I like them.
I like them.
But once you grip the ground,

51
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.350
all that shit came out that they were like a fraud.

52
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.480
They were sensing not what it is.
I think they had made improper claims.

53
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.790
If I'm not correct,
I mean if I'm not correct,
if I'm correct,

54
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.750
if my information is correct,
I think they made him proper claims.

55
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.490
I think that was what the word was.

56
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.880
The word was that they had said some shit and that people had gotten injured.

57
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.370
Like they said it would keep you from getting injured.

58
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.180
It's all based on the side.
Dia that you're supposed to run barefoot.
Yeah,

59
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.890
they said Mexican drinks and barefoot.
Yeah.
Mexico is like,
fuck you,
we got shows.

60
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.980
But those guys up in the mountains that they're talking about in that book born

61
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.350
to run,
I feel like they have,

62
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.770
some of them made their own shoes with like tires,

63
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.610
like that cut tires and made their own shoes and they're running like a hundred

64
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.470
miles up there.
Something crazy like that.

65
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
Like they have insane endurance and they live up in that mountain and they just

66
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:43.450
run around.
Oh.
Speaking of Mexicans.
One of the main reasons you're here.

67
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.440
I want to talk to you.

68
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.950
It's because you're my favorite Mexican and now we have a Mexican American

69
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.280
heavyweight champion of the motherfucking world.
That's crazy.
How crazy.
Sad.

70
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.850
That's insane.
I came to La,
Mexico.
Jesus Christ.

71
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.180
I didn't know Mexico had a heavyweight boxer.
Oh my God.

72
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.700
Andy Ruiz is the shit is the shit.

73
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.970
He's what America needs right now with all this border wall crisis shit and

74
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.730
heavyweight champion.
That's Mexicans come on son.

75
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.080
And one that's fucking good and one that has a big belly.

76
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.420
Any knocks out.
A dude who looks like he's chiseled out a granite.
I mean,

77
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:20.050
no one has ever had a better body than Anthony.
Joshua.

78
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.700
You've only had a different body.
No one's had a better bodies.

79
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.070
Like what is he like six,
seven or some shit and I,
Sam,
I don't mind know that.

80
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:26.711
God,
dude,

81
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:30.550
Anthony Joshua was the one of the best built heavyweight boxers of all time.

82
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.730
He's legit.
He was the champion.
All that Olympic gold medalist,

83
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.160
the champ knocked out Vladimir Klitschko.

84
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.850
I mean he's a fucking monster from the UK.
From the UK.
Yeah.

85
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:44.851
He was the champ and he was supposed to fight big baby Miller and big baby

86
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.780
Miller tested positive for the Mexican supplements.
Ironically enough.

87
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.730
Boom.
That's Anthony Joshua.
I mean,
come on son.
How tall is he?

88
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:55.900
Cause he's gigantic.

89
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.220
I've had a 12 pack because Andy Ruiz looked short in that fight.

90
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.350
Six.
Six Shit.
Yeah,
but Ruiz is like six to,

91
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.630
he just looked tiny when he's standing next to Joshua.

92
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:11.980
Joshua was a giant of a man and just fucking jacked.

93
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.000
What does it say is wait listed as two 49 to 40 or nine.

94
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.500
I wonder if that was for the last fight.

95
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.390
Cause I'm sure with a giant dude like that,
it varies back and forth.
But um,

96
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.380
so I was out to dinner and I get a text from Brendan Schaub.

97
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.880
Brenton shop hit me with a spoiler alert.
He said,
fuck,

98
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.920
Joshua got knocked out.
And I was like,
no.
And I go,

99
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:39.990
what happened?
And he goes,
he got fucked up in the seventh round.
I am Mexican.

100
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.540
And he goes,
I'm sick.
I go,
you're sick.
I go home.
Happy as fuck.
I'd locked.

101
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.260
I couldn't wait to come home and watch it.
I love when crazy shit happens.

102
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.170
This is my favorite thing in fights.
Look at that guy.
Look,

103
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.800
you re no disrespect champ,
but he jokes about it himself.

104
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.100
I'm trying to get him in here too.
Oh,
that would be cricket.
His body.

105
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.050
I mean it looks like a regular dude.
What have we got shredded?

106
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.180
How much would he weigh?
Why would you like it?
Get shredded?
No,

107
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.040
but if he did fuck out of here,
it might be a middle way.

108
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.600
I would feed him on the sneak tip.

109
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.000
I'd wake them up in the middle of the night with some great Mexican food.

110
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.280
That dude needs to stay exactly how he is.
See,
look,

111
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.860
he's got muscles under there like look at his stomach.

112
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.580
He's just got some body fat on them.
But here's one thing.

113
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.500
If you do have great cardio,

114
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.450
one thing that body fat can do is it can protect you somewhat.

115
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.730
It's like wearing eight sweaters.

116
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.630
I've joked around about this before and people think I'm bullshitting and I kind

117
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.990
of am a little bit,
cause I know most of the impact gets in there.

118
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.380
But if you were going to fight a guy and right before you fought him,

119
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.620
he puts on a vest made out of fat and meat and stitches it up and it sticks out

120
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.960
like fucking 10 extra inches.
He'd be like,
Hey,
what is all this?

121
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.060
What are you doing?
You can't put that on.

122
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.360
And then if you hit him to the body and he barely relaxed,
you'd be like,
fuck,

123
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.460
I can't believe this guy's cheating with his fat vest.
Hmm.
Think about that shit.

124
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.820
Yeah,
good cardio.
And you got some fat around your gut.

125
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.960
That shit might protect you.
Look at Daniel Cormier.
Yup.

126
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.260
Fade or look at Fay door.
You're dealing with these giant dudes,

127
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.630
giant dudes who can fuck you up with one shot.

128
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.840
There might actually be an advantage to having a gut.

129
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.640
And that's not bullshit at all.

130
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.800
It's not ideal in the lower weight classes.

131
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.770
Back guts he brought back on your backs.
Guts.
I'm thinking to grow in my own.

132
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.010
How great.
Healthy barely hanging on tired legs.

133
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.190
Chicks only dated dudes with guts.
That could be the new thing.
Yeah.
Dude.

134
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.570
Are you kidding?
Did you see that?
Uh,

135
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.610
that Gif on a Britain shops page of a Dj Khaled?

136
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:44.774
Is that how you say his name?

137
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.580
Who's a big fella himself climate out of a golf cart with a shirt open.
Look,

138
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.590
let me show you this.
I want,
I don't want to read the caption.

139
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.920
See my problem with sharing this is I want to know who the fuck made this cause

140
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:59.060
it's really funny.
I wish I knew the dude to give him credit.
You know.
Oh,

141
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:03.050
it says it there.
The creator of the gift.
Can I say it?
Yeah.
Yeah.

142
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.540
Put it up on there for him.
James.
Hold on.

143
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.680
Jamie's Tim was ghetto might be a problem.
Copyright issue.

144
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.370
Somebody might have stole it from somebody else.

145
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.510
You got to talk in the microphone.
People are listening to somebody else.

146
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.650
I'll just put it up.
Okay.

147
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.583
Look at this.

148
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.490
All the big meant all the big man headed to Brunch with their shirt open today

149
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:30.350
after the Andrew.
He's when
he's bringing back guts.

150
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.570
Dude,
that would be a man,
dude.
He's super friendly.
We like really nice guy.

151
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.720
Thank his mom.
So he told his mom after the fight,
you know,

152
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:42.470
we don't have to suffer anymore.
This has changed our lives,
you know,

153
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.200
it's beautiful.
It's pretty tight.
The last,
I mean,
I was,

154
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.390
I was crazy and do boxing before I saw UFC too.
Once I saw UFC too,

155
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:53.660
I kind of just drop boxing,
but I was way into boxing.

156
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:56.130
Had Stacks of ring magazine all over my house and wouldn't

157
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.870
<v 1>throw them away.
I was way into it.</v>

158
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.200
And all we had as Mexicans in the heavyweight division was Alex Garcia.

159
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.250
I remember him.
Yeah,
he was.
He broke the top 10 yeah,

160
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.260
he was up there for a little bit,
but he just,
you know,
that's,

161
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.390
that's the closest we ever got.
Unless there's been someone else since then.

162
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.500
This was like 1990 I haven't followed boxing at all.
Well,

163
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.770
that's why I was big for a Mexican Americans when Cain Velasquez was the UFC

164
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:23.431
heavyweight champ.

165
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:27.060
That was the first ever Mexican heavyweight champ in combat sports.
Yeah,
right.

166
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.460
Am I correct?
Yeah.
It's weird though,
in MMA,
uh,

167
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.070
people aren't racists in MMA really,
as much as boxing really raised like boxing.

168
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:38.550
I'm always going for the Mexican.
I don't want to fuck,
I don't give a fuck,

169
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.780
you know?
Yeah.
We talked about this,
but in [inaudible] Jitsu Guy,
I go,

170
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.400
I don't care what nationality you are in MMA or I go for the,
I want,
well,

171
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.430
like,
like if someone's fighting Melvin Manhoef,

172
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.590
I don't necessarily want Melvin Manhoef to win,

173
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.300
but I definitely want to see Melvin Manhoef go Melvin Manhoef on somebody.

174
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.930
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.
Oh yeah.
You know,
watching,

175
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.700
watching guys that,
that are known for their knockout power.

176
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:09.540
And I like watching those guys too,
even if they're fighting a Jujitsu guy.
Right.

177
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.530
I don't want them to win.
And that was why,
who was it?

178
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:17.370
Was it a Akiyama?
No,
it wasn't,
was it Akiyama?
No,

179
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.100
it was,
um,
who was,
uh,

180
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.490
was it Yoshida who beat Melvin Manhoef and arm Barnum?

181
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.600
I think it was your shoes and Akiyama.
I think it was Akiyama.

182
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.850
I think Akiyama I think sexy.
I'm fought him with a Gian.
Hmm.

183
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.240
I don't remember who fought Melvin Manhoef in pride.

184
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:41.210
See if it was a Melvin man who versus Akiyama.
I'm wondering,

185
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.290
Kay.
I,
yeah.
Sexy Yama.
You could say sexy Yama.
Who killed him?

186
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.050
Sexy on me.
It was it she Avello Michael Chavela did he,

187
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.800
I don't know who named him sexy Amaa Oh,
no,
he wasn't doing,

188
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.850
he wasn't doing pride right.
He was in Japan,

189
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.430
but I don't know if it was draining or no,
no,
no.
Yeah.

190
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.820
Well he does one now or he was doing,

191
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.480
he was doing all the shit on an access TV.
You know,

192
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:08.290
he was doing a lot of shows at pat military.

193
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.580
He's doing a lot of different things,
but he also does,

194
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.830
a lot of them are tied to Yoshi here.
I cannot be there.
Right.

195
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:20.310
Akiyama you gotta want to submit?
She rose hero got about that one.
Oh Wow.

196
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.540
That was the k one promotion,
right?
I think so.
Yeah.
Wow.

197
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.760
It's crazy how much this sport has changed and just in the time you and I have

198
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:33.600
been watching it to know from when you and I met in the 90s when we were doing

199
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.950
Jujitsu and you wear a purple belt.
Yeah,
I didn't Miss Shit back then.

200
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.550
I was on top of every Goddamn MMA fight.
Now I'm just like,

201
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.750
I'm lost.
There's so many promotional stuff now.
It's impossible.

202
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.350
So many UFC [inaudible] and it's,

203
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.520
it's hard to keep track and then I don't have time to keep track.

204
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.400
Everything's streaming.
I love like what is it on?
He has Penn APP,

205
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.980
<v 0>like how do I watch this?
Once you get it on though,</v>

206
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.650
once you figure it out and once you get it,
it works.

207
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.070
And once you get in and it works,
it's everything is on shit.
ESPN APP.
Yeah.

208
00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:08.080
So you can get every phone and I sound like a shill for the company.

209
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:10.390
Now I'm going to say,
well look for it,
but,
and then I'm not.

210
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:12.850
But I'm saying like for me,
like when I watch fights,

211
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:15.190
it's pretty fucking easy once you get it hooked up.

212
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.100
The problem is people that don't have their TV hooked up to the Internet,

213
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.210
which is quite a few fucking people.
Then you got to watch it on a laptop.

214
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.360
That's not ideal.
Oh,
your phone.
That's not my ideal.
I'll do it though.

215
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:27.670
But that's the good thing about it is I've done that.

216
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.970
Like I've been out and I couldn't go to see a fight.

217
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.790
I couldn't watch a walls at home,
but I have like an hour.

218
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.320
That's where I could sneak away and watch like the one main event and I'll get

219
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:41.830
to watch it on my phone.
I'll take that all day.
I'll take that all day.
Yeah.

220
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.720
What about like,
what's that function?
That mirror,
is that what it is?
Oh yeah.

221
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:49.960
We can shoot it up to the TV from your phone.
That's dope.
You could do that.

222
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.790
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
If you have,
um,
apple TV,
if you have apple TV or if you have Amazon,

223
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:57.550
what does that fire stick?
Is that what it is?
Jamie?
Do you remember?
Yeah,

224
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.750
Chromecast,
Chromecast and there's probably a few other ones.

225
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.900
You could probably do that with two but they have like a USB slot I think.

226
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.530
And you just stick this thing in the USB slot and it a lot.
Is that,

227
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.260
am I saying that depending on what in your bought your TV right.

228
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.460
Built into it now a lot of them chrome thing,
which is interesting,
right?

229
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:18.960
It's like what if a new company comes along and they want to get built into
that,

230
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.940
that system.
How do they,
you know,
cause when you get your TV,

231
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.070
does your TV have like the option to get Netflix?
Mine does.
Yeah.

232
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:30.500
It's like you don't need an apple TV.
It's like one of the options.
Oh No,
no,
no,

233
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.090
no,
no.
On my TV I have a set up,
I have an old TV dude.

234
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:38.680
It's like I got it like in 2006 or something.
Damn son.
You gotta upgrade.
Yeah.

235
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.200
Yeah.
Just talking to upgrade is still a flat.

236
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:43.870
TV's don't know how like then you need it.

237
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.350
I'm going to go old school and I'm going to start riding a bike and getting

238
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:51.790
around the TV when I'm fucked up.
Davies with a dark in the corner,
the boxes,

239
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.850
big old box and you put stuff on it puts stuff on lance a shelf to the first

240
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:01.720
time I got a TV.
Um,
I got like,
it was a big ass TV.

241
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.410
Like my first TV that I bought when I first got on television,

242
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.920
it was like 30 inches or something like that.
It's like,

243
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.050
look at the size of this fucking TV.
It was giant like from here to here.

244
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:15.070
I was like that big and I remember sitting in the stupid hunting inch.

245
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.280
I remember sitting in the stupid thing on the floor and I had,

246
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.480
it had to be so far away from the wall because it was all this extra shit behind

247
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:27.340
it.
It was like tubes and stuff and bazookas there's like the,
you know,

248
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:31.420
it was wires and everything and this big box and fans and stuff.

249
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.010
You remember bulbs.
There was,
you'd be bulbs.
Him,

250
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.630
they'd have to change the bulbs and it make you TV brighter.

251
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.240
Do you remember that?
Uh,
yeah.

252
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.900
I don't really know the mechanics behind the TV that I just turn them on and

253
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:47.650
then when they break down and you Kinda,
they're so cheap nowadays.

254
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:51.410
Two TVS are crazy cheese.
Crazy.
We were just talking about that there.

255
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.250
How much like

256
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.810
<v 1>a TV that for 10 years ago would cost and now it's like the same TV is like a</v>

257
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:57.830
couple hundred bucks.
Yeah.

258
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.120
10 years ago it was like ten thousand fifteen thousand like I remember when I

259
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:04.410
first moved out I had a little,
you know,

260
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.940
everyone starts with their little black and white little boxes,

261
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.541
you know what I mean?

262
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:13.541
You put a clothes hanger in for the antenna and the first TV I was in 19 edge

263
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.980
color TV.
She has like 300 bucks.
I saved forever for it.

264
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.150
But man,
that was my pride and joy.
Yeah man.

265
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.330
No [inaudible] living in the days before TV when they first invented it was all

266
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:33.410
radio.
It was random play and movie theater existed first.
Right.

267
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.570
I'm not wrong in that.
Right.
Yeah.

268
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.880
How much after the movie theater did the television getting medicine?

269
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.050
Like what year was the TV?
I think the fifties that's when it came in.

270
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.670
The TD came in the 50s yeah,
probably.
That's not that long ago.

271
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.830
Think about how much dominates people's time.
Yeah.

272
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.710
<v 2>The first TV started appearing in homes in the late twenties early thirties oh</v>

273
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:55.990
shit.
Yeah.

274
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.710
I think color is when those like the 50s or so late twenties hold on.

275
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:04.640
How many TVS had homes in the 50s only 9% of American households had TVs in the

276
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:08.180
fifties one at a 10 rich folks.

277
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.440
<v 1>Wow.
Managing,</v>

278
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.040
just being alive back then when those things started happening and being some,

279
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.270
some do two things way,
way ahead and looks at us and goes,
Whoa,

280
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.530
where's this going to go?

281
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.580
People in 50 years are going to look back at this time and go,
Shit.

282
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.370
Remember when people used to actually open their eyes?

283
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.810
Now we're going to be like in some kind of Matrix for sure.

284
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.450
Memo and people lived real life to went outside the alive stupid fucking

285
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:41.210
dummies.
We're so lucky we could live anywhere.

286
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.560
You know when Vr gets so good that you actually can just live any life you want.

287
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.230
You know it's inevitable.
Yeah.
They're mean.
They're,

288
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.850
they're getting closer and closer to it.
If you look at what we uh,

289
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.760
would have seen if we were a person living in 1920 when they turned on that

290
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:03.020
first TV,
I mean,
what was that like?
Those people are probably like in awe.

291
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.110
They probably thought,
oh,
now,
now they can't lie to us on the radio.

292
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.160
Now we'll get the truth in our living rooms.
Now we got,
finally we got the truth.

293
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:12.110
We get to see what's really going on in the world.

294
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:15.220
At least borough and the 1920s know what they thought they were.

295
00:17:15.221 --> 00:17:18.050
Just give me something to look at.
Yeah.

296
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:22.330
When you love to go back and talk to someone from the 20th that like,

297
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.880
what the fuck do you guys do?
Know how boring was like,

298
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.000
what are the Rod,
the hop hopscotch and shit like that and jump rope,
you know,

299
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.080
after a while that,
that just seems like so much fun.
Yeah.

300
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.760
Reading books and shit.
Remember that horses,
remember when people read books?

301
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.260
I rarely,

302
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:50.261
rarely I get almost 90% my reading I get done with audio books.

303
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.670
90%.
Yeah.
That's way easier.
Yeah.
It's great to do while running to,
they'd like,

304
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:00.390
it does two things at the same time.
It gives me some shit to think about.

305
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.660
That kind of like propels me while I'm running.
Don't do that.

306
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:08.190
Do I want to worry about getting jacked?
What do you mean?
Getting cat by a cat?

307
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.570
Oh,
do worry about that man.
Yeah,
I worry about that.
Legitimately.

308
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.760
I've been hiking,
uh,

309
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.570
more than ever lately and sometimes we're on some trails or have a rock ready to

310
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:23.040
go.
I carry a knife.
It's a good mood.
I carry a knife when I run.
It's a good move.

311
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.910
Yeah.
It's not likely.
It's not likely.
People would go,
oh my God,
you're paranoid.

312
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.840
Two people were killed by mountain lions last year and a kid got bit by a

313
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:37.470
mountain lion just a couple of days ago.
Jamie,
I'm getting over a cold.

314
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:42.270
Folks from CFI sounds Snotty,
but,
uh,
if,

315
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.070
if two people got killed by Werewolf's,
would you go out when the moon fall?

316
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.750
You would like,
fuck that.
If two people in Seattle got killed by Werewolf's,

317
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:54.270
when there's a full moon,
you're going to lock your fucking doors.

318
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:58.620
Am I in Seattle when I go out of Seattle?
Where am I in Seattle?
Well,

319
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:01.590
the guy who's the Werewolf could've gone on a plane and went to San Francisco.

320
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.770
It's totally possible and right.

321
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.120
Or just walk to the few knew there was a real werewolf that was on the full moon

322
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.870
was possibly going to kill somebody.
Sometimes he didn't.

323
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.350
Sometimes the full moon comes and goes and nobody dies because everybody's smart

324
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.240
and they all stay indoors.
Yeah,
yeah,
for sure.
You would stay out of the,
you know,

325
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:25.460
the odds would be astronomical.
Just like,
uh,
like jaws,
like,
you know,

326
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.260
if you get dropped in the middle of the ocean,
you know that we have this guy,

327
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.160
it'll take,
this guy has a fucking mountain line and that's what is that?

328
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:34.710
That's not a mountain line.
That's like,
that's a domestic cat.

329
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.250
Is that a bobcat that looks like a map or a cougar.
Looks like a no,

330
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:42.840
that's a domestic cat.
See those ears?
It's like a really wild domestic cat.

331
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.600
What is it called?
See

332
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.920
Shit.
Is it his?
Is Adam?

333
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.660
The guy might be a dick.

334
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.630
The guy doing that fucking with that cap might be a dick.

335
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:01.140
He's trying to get it to hiss.
I guess they have a good relationship.

336
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.060
It looks like those.
What were those two?
They look like that like Holy Shit.

337
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.500
That is a for what kind of animals that links it to students doesn't the video

338
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:14.100
doesn't say what it is.
I saw him crazy.
I saw links in real life once.

339
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.120
It's crazy looking like a big,
these big giant fluffy feet.

340
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.410
I saw him up in a Alberta pig.
Weird,
crazy feat.

341
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.330
Like almost like they're wearing shoes.

342
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.130
Very strange looking cat like a big old furry cat in the woods and Canada.

343
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:32.250
It's so strange,
man.
You look at it,
you're like,
what the fuck are you?

344
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:33.820
You ever see a links?

345
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.080
I'm not too sure what the difference between the links and a cougar.

346
00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:39.930
That's what I saw.
I saw him one of those motherfuckers.
I was like,

347
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:44.910
what is that fluffier bro?
They're super hairy because they're cats that live.

348
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.190
That's what it's like.
That won't the long legs right there,
Jamie.

349
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.390
That's like exactly what I saw.
And it was in the snow too or on.

350
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.600
It was not in the snow Rep.
It was a,
it was in the forest floor like green too.

351
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.290
When they,
um,
the feet are designed so that they can move quickly over snow.
They,

352
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.390
they almost act as snowshoes.
Like Soda Wolves,

353
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.860
like wolves have big ass feet and they spread out.
That's what it looked like.

354
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.340
We were driving down the road and we saw that guy on the side of the road and we

355
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:16.660
were like,
why is that?
What the fuck?
It's so weird to see one in real life.

356
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:20.030
If you see it at the zoo,
you wouldn't even look at it.
He'd pass by that cage.

357
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.470
He feel like,
what the fuck is fucking tiger?

358
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.500
That wack ass little cat and the crazy polar bears.

359
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:28.090
But if you see it in the woods,
man,

360
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:31.570
it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen in your life.
You're like,
wow,

361
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.220
look at it.
Look at it like a porcupine.
If I see a porcupine,

362
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:40.750
I'm driving,
I'll stop my car.
Like,
look at that.
Whoa.
What are they still,

363
00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:45.130
do they really shoot?
No,
no,
they don't shoot.
They don't shoot him.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

364
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:47.860
Do Porcupines and lily don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him.
That's a myth.

365
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.240
They just have barbs.
So if you buy them,
you get stuck up.
How crazy is that?

366
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:55.750
Ever went thought that growing up like an eighties.
Cause kids lie.

367
00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.220
They shot you with thorns.
Kids fucking lie to probably tell their dad.

368
00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:04.360
He shot him at me.
Dad Ran a cartoon or something.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's possible too.

369
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:08.680
Right?
Like everybody thinks coyotes are a stupid,
yeah.
Like jaws,
you know.
Um,

370
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.330
jaws pretty much scared 95% of the population out of the ocean.

371
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.500
Oh yeah.
Out of the ocean.
Well,
the other guy just got jack.

372
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.500
You heard about that guy that just got jacked about,
right,
right.
Yeah.
You get,

373
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:23.620
well,
they don't know what kind of shark got on,
but got bitten Maui,

374
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.000
I think Mallory,
that's a lot of tiger sharks,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Surfer surfer.

375
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.580
Um,
no,
I think it was a guy staying in a resort.

376
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:35.140
Just swimming died dead as far they find his body.

377
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.330
They got 'em.
I mean they brought him back to the beach,

378
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:42.160
but he had horrific wounds.
He died.
It just happened.
Yeah,
just happen.
Yeah,

379
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:45.190
man.
Sharks are no joke.
It's a terrifying animal.
And again,

380
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.490
if there was a fucking werewolf running around the woods exactly like a werewolf

381
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:53.770
just killed a guy last week.
Would you go to the woods?
Yeah,

382
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:56.710
it'd be just like jobs.
Like they had it on the news.
No,
no one would go.

383
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.280
But the thing is that sharks are sharks 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

384
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:03.670
They don't only on full moons become shark.
But what about,

385
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.330
what about guys that say that that's totally blown out of proportion.

386
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.170
They swim with sharks.
They get in the,
in the ocean with sharks.
They're right.

387
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.400
They're right.
I think the great wide is the only one that

388
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.590
the divers,
those crazy divers don't get in the water with.
Right.

389
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.100
But I think there was a lady that swam with a great white,
yeah,

390
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:26.560
there's pictures of Shit,
right?
We were,
we were um,

391
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.570
looking at her Instagram page once young Jamie,
do you remember that lady?
Yeah.

392
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.800
I'm just going to check.
Is it a trick?
Like she knows things.

393
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.090
She knows if it's pregnant you could go swim with it or something,
you know,
like,

394
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:38.280
uh,
those videos of,

395
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.730
of babies playing with King Cobras and then you find out that they defang them

396
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.980
so they can't hurt you at all.
They take their venom sac

397
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.770
<v 0>too.
I think if that happens,
if they have a thing,
I might've made that up.</v>

398
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.490
What's a venom sac?
Is that a real thing?
Is that I reckon nut sack,

399
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:56.510
but it sounds like I made it up.
Shark tank Brunswick,
the shark.

400
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:59.150
It's a eight foot nine inch white shark.

401
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.080
That's been just recently spotted yesterday or today I guess in oceans outside

402
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:05.710
of Ocean city,
Maryland.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
They,

403
00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:07.400
this is the way its Twitter account works.

404
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.110
They like it speaks in the first person.
What if it kills some of the,
I'm sorry,

405
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:14.660
he was tasty.
I think it's still going to keep up the Twitter account.

406
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:19.040
If we know that shark killed somebody.
Look,
if it gets hungry enough,

407
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.320
all these assholes are overfishing in the oceans.

408
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.830
You overfished the fuck out of those oceans.
Eventually they'll sharks.

409
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.690
They're going to turn on each other.
You know?

410
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:28.520
That's what's happening with snakes in the everglades.

411
00:24:28.521 --> 00:24:33.050
Do you know about that too?
Do you don't know about the everglades?
Nope.

412
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.270
Anacondas and pythons and shit.

413
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.020
Mostly pythons do tat them as pets in and they've got them cut them,

414
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:43.190
go and either finding them now there's 1718 feet long.

415
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.090
Anacondas are python python's shit.
They're eating alligators.

416
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.280
They did a study.
They did this fail then.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

417
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.580
They have photos of it and there's video.
There's video.

418
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:55.930
You can watch him eat an alligator in Florida,
in Florida.
God Damn,

419
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.610
they're giant and they're infested.

420
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.010
So they did like a biological survey of the everglades and they were down like

421
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.670
99% in some animals like deer,

422
00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:10.270
99% marsh hair.
You're like,
Nah,

423
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:15.020
like 98% 95% raccoons.
That kind of shit.
They don't say anything.

424
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.830
Are they killing people too all day?
We,

425
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:21.140
I for sure some fucking rednecks have disappeared and they just don't talk.

426
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:26.060
Guarantee a guarantee.
A guarantee.
If you wanted to get rid of somebody,
man,

427
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.310
take him to python country.
Are they,

428
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.790
are they doing anything that your total population to these things,

429
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.150
how much you can do?
Have you ever seen the everglades to set up traps?
Dude,

430
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.600
you kidding?
Show Jay show any problems.

431
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:39.650
These are some geniuses with that kind of shit.
There's too many of them.

432
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.860
50,000 of what?
Snakes?
Yeah,
there's over a hundred thousand pythons.
Yeah.

433
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.880
How did they count?
They have rough estimates based on corn quadrants,

434
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.700
so like what they'll do is they'll take like,
it's not,

435
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.750
it's not a hundred percent accurate unless they tag all of them in which the

436
00:25:55.751 --> 00:25:57.680
case they're assholes and she was just killed them.

437
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.320
But because they're an invasive species for people don't know.

438
00:26:00.321 --> 00:26:01.940
They're not from Florida at all.

439
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:05.120
So they're just devastating the ecosystem and they're turning on alligators.

440
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.880
They're eating alligators now cause they basically run out of everything else to

441
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:11.540
eat.
It's,
it's a crazy fucking animal.
So what they would do is they would take,

442
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.360
I would guess like a chunk of the everglades,
you know,

443
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:17.420
like a hundred square yards or something like that and they'd measure the amount

444
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.810
and then they would do another one.
They would,

445
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.820
they would do it like several places and then take an average and then calculate

446
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.140
all the square footage.

447
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.430
And that's why that'd be pro or con hundreds of people would have been killed

448
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:32.540
already know because I don't think that many people first of all go in there and

449
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.070
I don't think they want to eat people.

450
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.610
I think they probably don't know what the fuck a person is where they see a

451
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:40.700
rabbit or some other shit that probably looks like food.

452
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.690
People are wearing clothes.
I'm just,
I know they do jack people though overseas.

453
00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.350
There's been a horrible videos of guys getting cut out of giant snakes.

454
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:53.460
You never seen that?
I've seen.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Some poor villager.
Yeah.

455
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:56.250
Woman missing until they find the snake and they go,

456
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.940
we found her like they know they feel this motherfucker bounty hunter kills

457
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:04.941
Gargantuan Burmese Python gets 375 bucks and and earns our undying gratitude

458
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.590
thing.
Dude.
17 and a half feet.
So these things are Florida.

459
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.880
What like like Jacksonville or everglades?
Wherever the everglades on Miami.

460
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.630
The everglades is a giant ass one golf side middle.

461
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.420
Like the both sides kind of depending.
It's like a big swamp plan.

462
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:26.510
Show Eddie an overhead view of the everglades cause the everglades are fucking

463
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:30.540
bananas.
One thing that they found that was interesting,

464
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.020
it's like all that.
Yeah,
that shit.
Yeah.

465
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:38.660
So that all that stuff is done.

466
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.480
Swamp.
That's just monster soup.

467
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.260
The tip of the Dick of Florida is monster soup.

468
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.180
That's what that is.
You've got some leaves,
you've got some Bazell

469
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.090
fucking snakes.
You got some grass,
you got some shit growing out of the ground.

470
00:27:57.091 --> 00:28:02.091
And you've got fucking alligators and snakes in a aliens vs Predator battle to

471
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:07.140
the death.
Howard,
uh,
Joey described the everglades.
Listen,
cock sucker.

472
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.940
These fucking dirty white people with stinky feet.
All you want to fucking snake.

473
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.720
Oh,
what do you want all,
I'm a Wiccan.
Get the fuck out of here.

474
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.640
The Guy Kicks his fucking kid out of the house.
The kid can't feed the snake.

475
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.380
Next thing you know,
monster soup shit.
I mean,

476
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:30.180
it really is down to these two super predators battling it out to the death.

477
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.700
And right now,
I mean,

478
00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:35.820
I don't see any pictures of the alligators eating the pythons.

479
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:39.420
Do we have video of alligators eating pythons?
They're eating each other.
Okay.

480
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.730
So I guess it's just everybody's eating everybody.
Jesus.

481
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.120
Corralling that things got a whole deer in its body.
Is this Florida?
Yeah,

482
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.130
it's the same article.
Jesus Christ,
man,

483
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.220
they can swallow a whole deer that is so nuts.

484
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.480
They're not even as wide as us.

485
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.760
Imagine not being as wide as a person and you could swallow whole deer says it

486
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:06.480
fall.
It had a 35 pound white tailed Fonda in it.

487
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.950
It was eating 111% 11.1% I don't know.

488
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.940
111% it was a 31 pounds snake eating at 35 pound deer.

489
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.830
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
They don't give a fuck.

490
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:22.650
They didn't read that part.
Oh my God.
That is so ridiculous.
Yeah,

491
00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:24.810
they can eat their whole body weight,
but do you ever see that?

492
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:29.160
You've seen that we've showed that video of the frog or was a frog or a toad

493
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:33.450
that ate the mouse?
The mouse is bigger than him,
Bro.

494
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.410
He's just fucking eats it.
He just,
I didn't know that toads did that.

495
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.510
I had no idea.
This video,

496
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:42.340
there's like the little wow white mouse is in this cage.

497
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.210
Just like looking around with his frog and this frog just like slowly comes

498
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:49.450
close to him.
Slowly come closer and then swap.

499
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:54.790
It says half his body and you see this mouse trying to kick and get the fuck out

500
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:58.230
of there.
The fog just like slowly just choke some dial

501
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.310
insects.
That's what I thought too.
If they figured it out.

502
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.700
See if people believe in evolution,
right?
I believe in evolution.

503
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.810
If people believe in evolution,
why do we think it stops with us?

504
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.770
Why don't we think these guy frog's going to take over maybe like one of the

505
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:21.520
first,
the first signs of it was this pepe,
the frog controversy on the Internet.

506
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.830
Maybe it's shots fired,
things to come.

507
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.280
These frogs are going to start eating meat and the Trump fraud.

508
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.240
Maybe these frogs are eating meat.
That's what's going on.
Can get smarter.

509
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:36.010
Pepe Pepe,
the frog was,
was that around before Jamie?
What is this Jamie?

510
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:41.370
Oh,
I've seen that.
Has a thing this next fuck.
Yeah,
tacking a cat.
Whoa.

511
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.940
The cat comes over to swat the fucking snake.
Cats are ruthless,
bro.

512
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.160
Are Ruthless

513
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.800
as just a compilation of frog.
Eat and shit.
Well,

514
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:58.801
there's one that's like super specific that I found on yo use his hands.

515
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.160
That might be his hand.
The stuff that we're looking at.
This one,
here's one.
It's,

516
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.220
Oh,
they're only showing part of it.
It's just,
it's a bunch of shit.

517
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.730
Like look how he gets that whole mouse in his mouth.
Damn.

518
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.560
This isn't even the same one.
So there must be multiple videos of,

519
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.960
I guess that's a toad.
Is that a frog or a toad?

520
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.050
I honestly do not have the difference in that one.

521
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:24.880
But I think frogs are like green
frogs live in water.

522
00:31:24.881 --> 00:31:28.000
Right.
And toads hang out on the grass.
Right.

523
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.160
I think they,
hmm.

524
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.760
<v 3>When I was in Costa Rica,
the first night I was,
I was in,</v>

525
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:38.900
I went with a bunch of friends and they had this mansion dude right there in the

526
00:31:38.901 --> 00:31:41.670
Jones.
Oh,
we talked about the,
I remember,
yeah.
And,

527
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.630
and the first night I doused my whole,

528
00:31:44.631 --> 00:31:47.990
but I knew the bugs we're going to come out.
So that was when we got there.

529
00:31:47.991 --> 00:31:50.920
I'm like,
Oh my God,
I'm going to get attacked by bugs.
So I die.

530
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.000
I went to the neighborhood store and but all their off and just use it like

531
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.780
Moose all over my body.
And we sat,
we were sitting there as the sun set.

532
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.440
We were at the pole and it was like 10 of us at the pool.

533
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:08.210
And as the sun was setting,
all these frogs just appeared out of nowhere.

534
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.470
It was scary.
And the guy that lived there is that,
trust me,
don't be scared.

535
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.470
They're going to be your friends.
Like,
what do you mean goes?
Trust me.

536
00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:18.200
We're going to need them and go for the bugs.
He goes,
yes.

537
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.810
So when the sun went down,
we're,
we're,

538
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.550
we're at a pool and this JZ tight mansion at a pool in the middle of the jungle

539
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.330
and there's all these frogs everywhere.
And then the bug started coming.

540
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.320
You never saw the same bug twice.
And it was like Braveheart dude.
They were,

541
00:32:33.321 --> 00:32:37.820
all these frogs are just,
you just see them attacking these bugs.
It was,
it was,

542
00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:40.010
uh,
like a war.
He

543
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.510
<v 1>was crazy in the hogs.
Lost the bugs.
Lost frogs.</v>

544
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:47.660
Jack liked like those white walkers do.
They fucked him up,
dude.
Wow.

545
00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:50.540
That's an amazing,
very entertaining.
It was very entertaining.

546
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:54.830
We're just sitting there going,
Holy Shit.
Get those bugs.
Fuck those bugs up.

547
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.910
Why doesn't someone make a documentary about that?
It's crazy.
The war,

548
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.870
the daily war in the jungle.
When the bugs come out,

549
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.540
fucking frogs eat bugs and frogs.

550
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.240
What a what a weird place to choose to put a mansion when I get you want to be

551
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:13.700
able to scream?
No.
One thing I learned,

552
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:18.410
one of the thing I learned about that trip is there's the people that liked that

553
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:20.300
shit or the,
the people that will like,

554
00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:23.600
they'll see a trench that and pick it up and go and try to scare you with it and

555
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:25.040
then the fucking eat it or whatever.

556
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.690
Like you have to be one of those people like,
you know,

557
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.090
people like me who are scared of bugs.
Uh,
I,
I'm not a jungle guy.

558
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.680
I'm a snow guy.
I want to,
I just went to Lake Tahoe,
we went to squaw valley.

559
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:41.000
That's my shit.
Snow too cold for any bugs.
The jungle.

560
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:45.920
If I never go to another jungle ever,
I wouldn't give a shit at a horrible time.

561
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:49.730
That the last time I was in a giant cow and had a similar story about when he

562
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:52.590
was trying to be a bugged scientist.
What's that called?
Fuck it.

563
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.620
Just trying to be an entomologist and he was hanging out in the,

564
00:33:56.621 --> 00:34:01.010
in the jungle with these people and they had to put Turpentine on the posts of

565
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:03.890
the,
like the platform with a tent sat for the ants.
Yeah.

566
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.690
Cause the answer would be marching through the juggling.

567
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.950
Said you to hear them walking.
You could hear them.
Yeah.
You can hear the ants.

568
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.980
There's so many of you could hear him shut the fucking jungle dude.

569
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.153
Fucking jungle.

570
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:22.090
That's why if you had to choose between cold or or unbearable heat,

571
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.620
I'd always choose comb.
Yeah.
The thing about cold is it's like you can get warm,

572
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.520
you know when you're hot you can't really get cool.
It's hard.

573
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:32.780
You can get cool in your house,

574
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.760
but you could start a fire in your house and you just wear warm clothes outside

575
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.300
and you just live smart.
Yeah.
It's about the challenges of,

576
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.820
that's interesting when you look at like population in the world,

577
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.120
because in this country,
not the world,
but in this country,

578
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.900
all the places where it gets really cold population gets limited.

579
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.830
Like it's only gonna get so big.
But when things like sweet,
real nice,

580
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:57.890
like especially like La,
like Ooh,
people just pile in.

581
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.880
But I guess New York's the argument against that because New York's Phoenix

582
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:04.670
though it's opposite.
It's like super hot there.
Melts everybody.
Yeah,

583
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:06.710
but people like to party down there.
If you'd like to party,

584
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.760
if you'd like to party,
you go to Phoenix.
Hillman is where I live.

585
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.920
I live in Phoenix,
open carry state.

586
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.210
The fucking sheriff Arpaio makes everybody wear pink underwear and pink

587
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:21.590
jumpsuits and shit's crazy stake.
If you look at where people live,

588
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:23.330
I think generally speaking,

589
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:28.450
white people like cold and darker people like the heat.

590
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.470
It seems that way because if you look at the North Pole with genetically,

591
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:36.620
if you look at the North Pole,
looking down on it,
all the surrounding countries,

592
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:38.130
they're all white.
Right?
But you know why,

593
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.470
<v 0>right?
Because they want to be next to the,</v>

594
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.980
they want to be close to the North Pole.
Is that,

595
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.040
why did the one we say on this first stop?
A,
there's,
there's uh,

596
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.220
it's supposedly a magical place.
The North Pole.
Well,

597
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.450
it's because they don't get any vitamin D up there because it's hot as fuck

598
00:35:54.451 --> 00:35:57.450
where they're from.
And sunny weather from originally.

599
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.630
And then as people migrated and got these northern climates,

600
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.720
their skin became paler and Paler like a,

601
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.190
like a solar panel for vitamin D.
That's where you get it.

602
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:09.024
You get it from the sun.

603
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:14.010
So because they don't get much vitamin D because there's no fucking sun out,

604
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.060
it's cold as shit.

605
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.440
It's cloudy and England and Ireland and all these bills are and go really,

606
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:22.230
really white.
It's fucking cloudy all the time,
man.
It's cold as fuck.

607
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.800
So you're not getting that vitamin D plus your whole body's covered and fucking

608
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:29.520
minks and animal skins and shit.
That's why they're all white.

609
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.130
They're all from the same thing.
That's what's weird about it.

610
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.420
But there's also some,

611
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.380
some growing evidence that there was a whole gang of different kinds of people

612
00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.020
that are finding these new Russian people called Dennis Oh ovens.

613
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.570
They found bones of them.

614
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:46.980
So they think there was like maybe a bunch of other versions of human beings

615
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.780
that we just lost in time.

616
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.900
And then you're going to probably find that as people get further and further

617
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:56.250
into DNA testing to find more and more different versions of people and people.

618
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.220
There's supposedly a lost empire in Russia called Tardy.

619
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.910
We ever heard about that?
No.
Yeah.

620
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.830
It's supposedly erased from all history for different reasons.

621
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.070
Um,
I don't really know that much about it,
but it keeps popping up on Youtube.

622
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.100
I thought it was a juvenile.
I would make a joke about the,
the name of it.
Tardy.

623
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.380
Yeah.
I would make a joke.
What would you say?
Let's say something terrible.

624
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:23.810
Like what?
Tardy.
Yeah.
I can't think of anything.

625
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:28.530
I wonder why they didn't make it.
Okay.
That guy,
Graham Hancock,

626
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:31.230
who wrote that book,
did you ever listen to a podcast?
I did with him recently.

627
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.360
Not the recent one,
dude.

628
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:37.620
He was talking about the Amazon and that hidden civilizations that were at one

629
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:38.550
point in time in the Amazon.

630
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:42.030
Then European settlers or European explorers rather came there and gave them

631
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:46.110
smallpox and it burned through the entire fucking population just like it burned

632
00:37:46.111 --> 00:37:50.250
through the native Americans,
same deal and just wiped out these huge cities.

633
00:37:50.251 --> 00:37:51.930
People just abandon these huge cities.

634
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.170
And he was saying that at one point in time they think as much as 20 million

635
00:37:55.171 --> 00:38:00.000
people are living in the Amazon and they had these really big established
cities.

636
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.550
So now they're using this stuff called Lidar.

637
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:06.780
It's like light like laser that they shoot from a fucking plane and they make

638
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:11.670
maps of the giant cities and find berries sees dude.
It's crazy.

639
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.770
It's amazing to watch because the first European explorers,

640
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.470
when they went to the Amazon,
according to grant Hancock and his book,

641
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:23.910
which is called America before,
um,
the first European explorers,

642
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:27.630
when they came to the Amazon,
they were like,
oh my God,
this is incredible.
These,

643
00:38:27.631 --> 00:38:30.690
they have these massive cities and sophisticated culture,

644
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.250
and they wrote back about it.

645
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.160
Then when people came back hundreds of years later,

646
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.540
<v 1>everything was gone.</v>

647
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.650
It was all just engulfed by the jungle because all the people died off after the

648
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:45.700
fucking European explorers came.
So the European explorers came.

649
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.620
They spread their diseases.
They came in,

650
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:51.040
I don't know how many boats over how much time they wrote things about it and

651
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:54.190
then everybody fucking died.
They died like a,

652
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:56.440
just a like a haunted curse.

653
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.500
Like they brought a curse to a place and then the jungle overcame the city and

654
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:05.890
grew through the pillars of the floor and just took over and now they're finding

655
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:09.550
it through all this new sophisticated technology where they get scanned through

656
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:13.900
the trees and just get images of what the ground looks like and then they take

657
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:17.080
this image of the ground and you could see these grids see buildings.

658
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.960
It's amazing the irrigation that they could survive in the jungle with all of

659
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.950
that fungus and bacteria and viruses,
bugs and all that shit.

660
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.940
But smallpox takes them out.
Small crops jacked him.

661
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.220
They weren't ready for it.
They didn't have,
it was probably not a small pot.

662
00:39:35.221 --> 00:39:37.060
It's probably a gang of diseases that the,

663
00:39:37.061 --> 00:39:40.780
I mean smallpox for sure killed a lot of people during that time period,

664
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:44.860
so they assume it was smallpox and smallpox most likely was one of the diseases,

665
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.960
but I bet they gave him a bunch of other diseases too.

666
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:50.440
These fucking people had no immune system for any of the shit that Europeans

667
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:51.910
were running over there.

668
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.350
And I bet the same thing would happen if someone from there went to Europe.

669
00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.090
I bet they have some weird parasites and weird shit that if they could somehow,

670
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.180
I mean I guess you could imagine like people that live in the jungle and must be

671
00:40:04.181 --> 00:40:09.181
exposed to certain parasites or certain certain diseases are germs that they

672
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:13.300
don't get in Europe either for transferring them back and forth like that would

673
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:13.870
probably wouldn't know.

674
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.870
Like if they went and visited like a giant ship full of Amazonians went to visit

675
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:22.450
Europe,
they probably would have given him some strange disease.
Like,
dude,

676
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:25.630
can you imagine and wonder if those guys brought anything back?

677
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.390
I wonder if they got anything from the Amazon people and brought it back.

678
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:32.230
Vaginal parasites.
Derek and I believe you went there,
man.

679
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.950
Imagine the kind of sexual diseases they add in the Amazon,

680
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.750
but they were immune to that.

681
00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:40.800
Europeans were like just dying on the phone management.

682
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:45.830
Everybody's [inaudible] and a coral grown on their dicks.

683
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.230
There's no deodorant.

684
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.130
They probably didn't use soap and you've probably got used to it.
You know,

685
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:53.170
they say people are used to smells.
You get,

686
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.710
that's why people that live in those towns where they have a factory and

687
00:40:56.711 --> 00:40:58.750
everything smells like chicken shit or something like that.

688
00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:00.670
Those people get used to it.
When you drive,

689
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:03.640
when you're on the four oh five and you pass by that Budweiser plant,

690
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.540
it smells like it has that weird like almost fried fried food or something.

691
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:09.670
Or you're like,
what is that?

692
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:12.730
And you drive into San Pedro and it smells like the sewer.

693
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.100
You know when you're on the seven 10 or the one 10 is there's certain places,

694
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.700
there's certain places where you you like in New Jersey,
when I was a kid,

695
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:25.660
I remember there was areas that grow by that had factories and you could see the

696
00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:29.550
fucking smoke coming out of the factory.
They were just spewing it.

697
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.410
It would stink.
The whole fucking city would stink.
And if you lived though,

698
00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:36.800
you just had to accept that,
you know,
if you live there,
there's no fixing that.

699
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.880
That's just what the town smelled like.
That was your reality.
That's crazy.

700
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.740
What do you think of um,
five g and all that scared.

701
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.980
You think that's the terrified of they're all that shit scared?
Yeah,

702
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:51.920
because how much long term testing have they done?

703
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:56.730
Net zero or negative numbers.
They're putting them up,
dude.

704
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.610
Is that what,
uh,
when,
when,
when I'm driving around with my family,

705
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.840
my wife is obsessed with recognizing plates.
She's always calling out Florida,

706
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.780
Oregon.
She's her and my son.
They got a little game they play.

707
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:09.830
They're always looking at the plates.

708
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:15.000
I am always looking at cell phone towers and satellite dishes.
I'm always,

709
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:21.080
yeah,
all satellite dishes point to the southeast for some reason or other.

710
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.420
And that's what I always check them off.

711
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.300
They don't point to the north in southern California that just direct TV.

712
00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:29.930
So that's all words.
All satellites,
every side dishes.

713
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.690
It's pointing to the consumer consumer satellite.

714
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:36.110
Every satellite dish that I've seen,
I,
I'm obsessed with them.

715
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.660
They're always point.
They never point to the north.

716
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.940
They're always pointing south east.
All of them.

717
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:46.060
The great majority of satellite dishes that you see are probably like direct TV

718
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.500
or I've noticed all of them.
All of them.
But you go,
uh,

719
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.060
it's,
it's crazy.
I don't know why.
I don't know why,

720
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:57.880
but also those a cell phone towers.
I was on this website called um,
uh,

721
00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.820
smart meters.
murder.com smart meters,

722
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:06.710
murder.com I was trying to remember it.
Smart meters,
murder.com dude,

723
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.350
you want to get your fucking head blown off.

724
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.670
Go to that website and read the documents that they're pulling from different

725
00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:17.660
agencies.
Dude,
scary.
What are you talking about?
Scary.

726
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.180
But we just kicked it in stone.
You know what,

727
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.020
you're going to have to go check that shit out but it's like on five g but back

728
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:28.220
from back from their documents from government agencies,

729
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.190
from 2001 July,
2001 it was like this whole,

730
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:37.280
I don't know how big like 400 page plan for the world.

731
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.100
It's a plan for the world they're talking about who wrote this plan.

732
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.330
The way you're holding that here while you do it,
it is quite hilarious.

733
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.690
It's the perfect like if someone was talking about a conspiracy theory and they

734
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:52.691
had a blunt and they would just like full bore conspiracy job while they're

735
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:55.730
holding the joint.
It's so scary dude that I don't even want to talk about it.

736
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:57.980
Let's change the subject.
You know if you want to look into it,

737
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.030
go to smart meters.co a smart meters murder.com but it's scary.

738
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:03.710
Do you have ready want to talk about it?

739
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.800
I have read things where people are questioning the the like whether or not five

740
00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:10.250
g is going to be healthy,

741
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:14.000
but I haven't seen anything that verifies it is or it isn't.

742
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.720
I haven't seen anything that says I need to look into it,
but,

743
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.760
but just in what I'm worried all told is that I really think that Wifi signals

744
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.000
all the various signals that surround us all the time.

745
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:29.000
I think they have an effect on us and I don't know what that effect is.

746
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:32.000
I don't know if it's negative or positive.
I don't know if it didn't it,

747
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.750
<v 0>it dulls the senses.</v>

748
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.010
It's entirely possible that it does something to dull the sentence because it

749
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:40.860
occupies an area.

750
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.750
I mean if we have the capability of recognizing the fact that they're the

751
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:48.990
theaters,
you signals around us all the time.
Cellular signals,
signals,

752
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:52.770
radio signals,
satellite signals.
We're surrounded,
constantly buy signals.

753
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:58.290
Are we absolutely sure that our body doesn't have the capacity to recognize

754
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:02.820
those signals even though we don't have like a really clear method of taking

755
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:07.821
those signals in and then translating them into visuals or into audio.

756
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:13.270
But because we can't take that Sirius satellite signal and then t and then have

757
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:15.360
like a player in our head because of that,

758
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.110
we assume that we're not taking it in in some way.
That's what these,

759
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.920
that's what this uh,
report,
Oh,
let me just give me,
is about,
it's about bay.

760
00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.500
This is why I say,
this is why I say this,

761
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.680
because when I feel the least foggy is when I'm in the woods.

762
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.250
When I'm in the mountains,
when there's no cell phone service,

763
00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:39.090
there's no radio service.
There's no Wifi,
there ain't shit.
It's warehouse.

764
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:42.810
How satellites don't work when someone's in the woods.
But no satellites do work.

765
00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:44.880
You could actually not show,
not knowing the wash.

766
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:46.970
You get a dish you put on the roof of your car,
you can watch TV.

767
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.070
That's a new thing that Steven Rinella.
Dot.
Leon's work on satellites.

768
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.820
No phones work on cell towers,
but the GPS works on satellites.
Okay,

769
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.700
so your phone still works as a gps unit when you're in the woods,

770
00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:58.620
even if you don't have any signal show,

771
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.170
she could find your way out with a map if your phone was on,

772
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.590
you know there's people that say that GSP,
the GPS,
GSP,

773
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.910
the GPS is also run by the towers to that don't need to go into space that you

774
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:12.610
could triangulate your position from towers and loan,
but that's,

775
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.080
you probably could try triangulate your position from towers,

776
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:19.560
but you couldn't broadcast as such a gigantic area like you can with satellites.

777
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.980
You can see satellites,
the people that think that satellites aren't real,

778
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.010
they need to talk to somebody who makes satellites,
they,
they're there.

779
00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:28.140
You can see them with telescopes there up there.

780
00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.760
We have the ability to tune in to the very specific spot in the sky with the

781
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:36.420
direct TV and you'll pick up the signal.
That's how you get the signal.

782
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:38.400
You tune to the spot in the sky with the satellite is,

783
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.380
and you'd pick up the signal.
They're real.

784
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.300
People have a problem with fucking everything that's ever existed.
Everything.

785
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.040
Everything's fake,
everything's fake.

786
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.990
Maybe we'll think of it is how many people think that we're living in a

787
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:56.040
simulation.
Really,
really fucking smart people thinking that's okay.

788
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.620
That's okay.
That isn't crazy,
dude.

789
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.210
That's the craziest thing about all conspiracy theories,
like people that um,
uh,

790
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.830
are not on that side.

791
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:07.710
There's a conspiracy theory to side and then there's the people way on the other

792
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:12.420
side.
Those motherfuckers are totally into,
man,
we live in a computer.

793
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.550
That is hilarious.
That's not logical.
It's illogical.

794
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:18.310
Well,
the,
the,

795
00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:22.470
the reason why they think does cause some day there's going to be a program,

796
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.060
but it's going to be a to be true.
It may be true.
Maybe we do live in a computer,

797
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.070
but dude,
there's no evidence.
No,
there's no

798
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.120
<v 3>evidence on these conspiracy theories of if you look into each one individually</v>

799
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.430
tab,
maybe it's true.
Maybe it's not,

800
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:40.510
but there's actual evidence is enough evidence to prove it one way or another.

801
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.640
Who knows?
But don't talk shit on.

802
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:48.370
It's not the same like government conspiracy.
It's dude,
I've never heard,

803
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.270
I've never heard anybody like that's easy to categorize people like that.

804
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.240
No sane people to believe that I know that you know about people.

805
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:58.360
What I'm saying?
No,
no.
Okay.
For sure.
I haven't done any surveys,
surveys.

806
00:47:58.361 --> 00:48:02.090
This is all based on the people that I come in contact with.
Did I?
I,

807
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.450
I would say people,
you know,

808
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.900
80% of my students that are not a conspiracy theorist,

809
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:10.330
I don't even think about it.
They're just like regular people.
They don't,

810
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.350
they don't,
uh,
they don't concern themselves with it.
Right.
You know what I mean?

811
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.600
They think it's amusing that I'm into it,
but they're not into it.

812
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.480
You know what I mean?
But those same people,
when you say duty,

813
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:26.020
you know,
Elon Musk says that we might live in a computer and everyone's like,

814
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.870
it may be true,
but dude,
there's zero evidence of that,

815
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.470
that we live in a fucking computer.
What was the evidence?
Where's the evidence?

816
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:33.191
What did someone,

817
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:37.810
someone propose some sort of theory that proves that life is a hologram.

818
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.750
One wasn't a Hologram.
That life is a simulation.

819
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.470
Someone proves somehow I'd like to see that.
I tried reading this book,

820
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:46.660
the Holographic Universe,
but I didn't get into it.

821
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.340
Maybe I should revisit it saying it's not true.

822
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:50.170
I'm just saying there's just that,
oh,
I know.

823
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.850
It might not be the same fucking people that you're talking about that do or

824
00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:57.100
don't believe,
but people definitely get rigid.

825
00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.530
That's called to believe that you could talk to her.
Like,
you know,

826
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.220
Elon Musk said it.
It's called,
it's like a cool thing.
You know?

827
00:49:03.221 --> 00:49:06.760
You could be way on the left.
You could be way and just like,
oh yeah,

828
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:11.650
we might live in a computer.
Man.
It's interesting that,
that's fascinating to me.

829
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.280
I think the reason why they say that is because one day we will,

830
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.560
and we all know it.
We all know it.

831
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:21.790
We all know that one day you could be in something that's as ridiculous is what

832
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:25.210
you're experiencing right now.
And it could be a simulation.
Yes,
yes.

833
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:29.830
But they believe that's what happened.
Yeah.
Well,

834
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:32.710
renting on pay might not necessarily believe it,
but they're entertaining.

835
00:49:32.711 --> 00:49:36.430
The idea of the theory is,
yeah,
we might,
we might be in a computer simulation.

836
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.030
You know what?
I mean,
he might be living in a computer simulation.
Yeah,
maybe.

837
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:43.990
Maybe.
I'm not saying we don't,
I'm just saying,
dude,
there's no evidence of that.

838
00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.040
Right,
but the keywords might,

839
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:49.060
so to just explore an idea like are we living in a simulation?

840
00:49:49.061 --> 00:49:51.200
It doesn't mean you probably see nothing wrong with that.
Yeah,

841
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:53.510
that's what I'm talking about.
That's like a conspiracy.

842
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:56.110
That should be one of the,
you should lump.

843
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.980
It's logical to lump that in with all those like nine 11 conspiracy,

844
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:04.090
like nine 11 for instance.
There's lots of evidence that it was an inside job,

845
00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.960
but that's a crazy conspiracy to most people.
But then if you look into it,

846
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:11.320
they're scientific.
They're science supports that it was an inside job.

847
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.330
Then science,
despite Sta,
no button,
there's still science to dispute it.
No,
no,

848
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:18.070
for sure.
But there's evidence,
right?
I'm not saying,

849
00:50:18.071 --> 00:50:19.210
but what other it's true or not.

850
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:23.240
I'm just saying I don't want to go into a nine one one inside job conversation.

851
00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.180
I'm just saying I'm just my,
I'm going to be using that.

852
00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.700
I'm just using that as example,
like as a,

853
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.230
that's a crazy conspiracy theory,

854
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.080
but there's a lot of evidence whether it's true or not,
who knows?

855
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.780
You know what I mean?
Um,
I think it was an inside job,

856
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.730
but a lot of people don't and whatever,

857
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:42.080
but there's zero evidence of us living in a computer simulation.

858
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.490
We're not talking about the same people.

859
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.770
They might not be the same people that believe one or the other.

860
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.440
They're different lumping them together.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
I'm not.
I'm,

861
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.570
there are different.
There are different people.
I mean,
I,
I know,

862
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:52.940
but the people that don't want to believe that and don't want to look at the

863
00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:56.840
evidence I'm saying aren't necessarily the same exact people as the people that

864
00:50:56.841 --> 00:51:00.230
believe winners.
Their relation.
You're right.
I have,
there's no poll on it.

865
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.920
I haven't taken a poll.
I'm just going,

866
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.970
can I sing it to nine one one you just went,
you wanted to talk about it,

867
00:51:04.971 --> 00:51:07.100
so you've got to send to it.
That's,
that's,
yeah.

868
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:10.130
We don't want to tell him about nine 11.
I was just using that as an example.

869
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.620
I know what you're saying.
You know people believe weird shit.

870
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:16.130
They definitely do like the people that really want to believe in bigfoot or the

871
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:19.400
people that really want to believe in Ufos.
UFOS are coming back right now.

872
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.790
Everybody's talking about it ever bigger than ever.
Stronger than ever.

873
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:26.800
That I should tell you something.
Dave Foley's hooked Dave Foley from news radio.

874
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.400
I remember Dave Foley hooked.

875
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.750
We text each other almost exclusively about UFO evidence.

876
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.030
Dude,
I know many days.

877
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.460
I was the biggest office in New York Times a couple of days ago.
Oh Wow.

878
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.450
What is that?
Navy pilots report identified flying objects.

879
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:46.063
Here's the thing though,

880
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.840
we don't know what kind of shit the Chinese have figured out.

881
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.640
We don't know what kind of shit the Russians figured out.

882
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:55.660
We assume that we know cause,
but we didn't.

883
00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:00.260
We didn't let them know about the stealth bomber or any of the crazy shit that

884
00:52:00.261 --> 00:52:02.990
they were building an area 51 we didn't let them know.
Do you know me?

885
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:05.990
I was balls deep into the,
you know,
community did my tattoo.

886
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.850
The first Tattoo I got it.
I got an alien on my left arm.
Any Julian garb.

887
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:13.370
I was always into fucking ancient Egypt,

888
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.040
the conspiracy side of the ancient Egypt.

889
00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:18.840
There's the mainstream Egyptology I was into that though.

890
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:23.900
Oh look what Graham Hancock is saying.
And you F O's fun.

891
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.440
That's so fun.
There's so much proof in my head,

892
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:30.470
there was so much proof that the government was trying to cover up.
Look,
the,

893
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:32.300
why are they covering it up?
Why are they covering it up?

894
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:35.510
And look at all these guys from pilots,

895
00:52:35.511 --> 00:52:38.960
from the air force are saying they saw ufs pilots from the navy or saying they

896
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:42.500
suck.
You will foes dudes from the Pentagon.
It's gotta be true.
That's a dude.

897
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:46.700
That's a dude.
That's a CIA pilot.
He's saying it.
So when you're,

898
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.920
when you're balls deep and you really want to believe it,

899
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.390
you look at it that way,
you're like,
look,

900
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:54.230
there's all these government officials saying they saw you fos and they got

901
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:57.920
their own Ufo story.
You know.
And then,
um,
you know,

902
00:52:57.921 --> 00:53:02.921
you listened to Bill Cooper and he was former office of naval intelligence

903
00:53:03.321 --> 00:53:07.520
officer and you know,
and,
and when you hear what he says,
Shit,
he wrote that book,

904
00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:11.450
behold a Pale white horse he gave me that guys had crazy shit.

905
00:53:11.451 --> 00:53:14.540
He said there's a base on the moon.
Not that guy.
That's your talk.

906
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:18.410
Behold a pale white horse.
He said there's a based on the mass.
Yes.
No,

907
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.650
he at first didn't need at first.

908
00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.650
Now you're talking about lear.
You're talking about

909
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.820
<v 1>pop stars from that guy is crazy too,
right?
Totally.
What does that guy say?</v>

910
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.630
He says that um,
there's millions of people on each planet in,

911
00:53:34.631 --> 00:53:37.020
they're all,
every planet has millions of people.

912
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.050
Is he the guy that owned skin Walker ranch?
I don't know.

913
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:44.170
But he was a part of his dad owned Leer jet.
Right.

914
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:49.020
I forget what that does.
Seems like a super rich troll.
Totally.

915
00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.270
When he says what he says to crazy shit,
he says,
I'm like,

916
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:54.210
this guy's having a good time fucking with people.
Yeah,
totally.
Totally.

917
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.370
But Bill Cooper says that,
um,

918
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.520
because his job was to prepare notes,

919
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:03.630
top secret notes,

920
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:09.260
classified shit it for meetings with high level people in the military and he

921
00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:14.490
was based on what he was reading.
He was like,
damn,
Ufos are real.
Look,

922
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.640
I have proof.
So the,
at first he was like,

923
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:20.370
for sure Ufo is a real and for sure they're hiding him.

924
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.200
That's what he was saying.
He was preaching that.

925
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:25.800
Then he learned later they let him whistle blow.

926
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.490
He never got busted for whistle blowing that they w they want him,

927
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.240
they wanted him to lead that Ufo.
That's what his conclusion was.

928
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.840
He started to realize,
wait a minute,
they want me to leak this.

929
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.880
And then he,
he,

930
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:43.650
he got to the point where he believes that all Ufo abductions like,
oh,

931
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.690
like the,
he believed that um,

932
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.670
everything was a product of the government.
All UFO sightings,

933
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.250
abductions.
They're taking you in.
It's,

934
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:56.530
he believes it's like the CIA doing that shit.
And he was,

935
00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:59.640
that's what he was really about before he got killed.
He got murdered man.

936
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:01.140
They went up to us ranch and fuck them up.

937
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.880
If they wanted to really fuck with you,
this is what I think they would do.
They,

938
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.830
first of all,
they put acid on your shit.

939
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.710
They put apps on your door knob or something like that.

940
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.840
Cause there was a dude who found something.
I forget what he found,

941
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.060
some old thing.
And as he was opening it up,
he,
he,
I just,
by touching it,

942
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.140
it was like some old thing.

943
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:26.130
It was dipped in acid and he went on an acid trip for like six hours.

944
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.530
So this is what they'd do.
They'd dose you up,

945
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:33.360
they'd somehow or another dose you up whether touching a doorknob.

946
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:37.140
Finally Guy,
it's unreal.
Recent story.

947
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.010
A guy that was cleaning up a board like this,
a soundboard.
That's what it was.

948
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.140
He touched.
That's what it looks.
Just like,
Aww.

949
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.160
Tell him his girlfriend's gonna think I'm fucking high.
Yes.
Ended up testing.

950
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.470
That's exactly the story.
That's exactly the story.

951
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:53.940
So they could do that to you and then sneak up on you with some special effects

952
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:58.710
where some fucking crazy mask and fucking flashy with lights and you're so crazy

953
00:55:58.711 --> 00:56:00.130
high.
You don't know what the fuck's going on.

954
00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.730
They grab you and put you on a table,
a desk,
and tell you,
you,

955
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:06.030
you've been abducted by aliens from another planet.

956
00:56:06.031 --> 00:56:09.270
You don't think they fucked with people and did stuff like that do for a fatty

957
00:56:09.271 --> 00:56:13.620
they.
Have you seen the documentary abducted and plain sight?
No,
I have not.

958
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.000
Which ones that do?
What's that about?
It's exact.
It's about Ufos.
Well,

959
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:22.710
it's sort of sort of this guy,
he was married,

960
00:56:22.711 --> 00:56:24.130
had a couple kids.
He was

961
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.050
<v 3>tight with the family who had three daughters.
He was a predator.
So he targeted,</v>

962
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.910
he targeted the 12 year old.
And what he did is he,
uh,

963
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.290
had some fucked with the mom.
Fuck with the Dad,
fuck with the dad.

964
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:43.390
And next with the dad is sexual relations in some dad.

965
00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:45.450
The Dad jerked him off.
Oh Jesus.

966
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.820
They talk about this in the past to just jerked him off.
The guy jerked him off.

967
00:56:48.821 --> 00:56:50.980
He got,
he convinced the guy to jerk him off.

968
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:55.900
So we wanted black male on the parents so that once he took the daughter,

969
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:56.950
they couldn't say shit.

970
00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.270
And the black man because he jerked him off and he fucked with the mother too.

971
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:04.600
And it was,
it was a secret.
So I wish that guy doesn't want none of that shit.

972
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.320
That's the guy.
Take his kid,
he's going to t he asked to take the daughter,
uh,

973
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.870
horseback riding.
So,
and they were like,
okay.

974
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:14.230
So he takes the daughter horseback riding and what he does is he starts telling

975
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:17.680
her that there's all these alien abductions going on and we got to be careful

976
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:22.330
for aliens.
She's 12 years old,
so he sat in her up.
So when he does,
he drugs her,

977
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.670
she wakes up,
she's strapped to a table,

978
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:29.140
he's got a speaker with alien voice is coming out and the alien and she wakes
up.

979
00:57:29.141 --> 00:57:31.360
She didn't know where she's at.
She's like,
oh my God.
And this,

980
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:36.390
this alien voice says that she is a responsible for saving the earth.

981
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.500
She has to marry that dude.

982
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.650
She has to marry the dude in the alien voice.

983
00:57:41.651 --> 00:57:45.580
You have to marry Bob and you have to have this,
but you can't tell nobody.

984
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.710
And the rugs,
I don't know.

985
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.210
And then she passes out again when she wakes up and she's not strapped.

986
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.820
She's looking around the trailer and she sees the guy,
he's about,

987
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:58.180
he's pretending,
he's all fucked up and she's like waking him up and he's like,

988
00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.680
you know,
it's fake blood on him or whatever.

989
00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.200
And then he wakes up and then she tells him,

990
00:58:02.201 --> 00:58:06.400
we've been abducted by aliens and I need to have your child.
Oh my God.

991
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:11.030
He tricked her.
So from the age of 12 to 16,
he owned her good.

992
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.800
They ended up catching him with a girl.
Like a week later,

993
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.710
FBI gets involved and um,

994
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:22.780
the girl can't tell anybody or everyone dies,
so such.
And so she's obsessed.

995
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:24.100
Now she's back with their family.

996
00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.490
The guy's in jail for like a day because you know what he does is he has his

997
00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:32.350
lawyers send,
uh,
letters to the mother and father saying,

998
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.550
uh,
to make him a sign like that,
it was consensual.
What?

999
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.900
He threatened the black male.
So they signed it and let him out.
They signed in,

1000
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:44.560
they let him out and then he goes to like the next state over.
But that chick,

1001
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:48.280
she's like,
she's 12,
13,
14,
and she's obsessed with him.

1002
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:52.030
She has to save the world.
So that,
that's an example of,

1003
00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:57.160
and then it turns out,
it turns out that I think the guy was CIA probably,

1004
00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:59.710
and he knew that he knew those techniques.
That's how they get people.

1005
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.620
They fill them up.
There's all these alien abductions,

1006
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:03.880
get them all scared and then boom,

1007
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:06.970
when they do what they believe in Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1008
00:59:06.971 --> 00:59:09.910
So that's just mk ultra did dude,
she got MKL truth.

1009
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.460
I guarantee you they did that to people who are like political enemies.
Fuck.

1010
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:16.600
Why wouldn't they do that?
It's easy.
It's easy.

1011
00:59:16.601 --> 00:59:19.600
It just seems like something they would do to just seems like it makes sense.

1012
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:23.900
And then Bill Cooper,
um,
said that,
uh,
the mutilated,
uh,

1013
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.640
terrible thing that people were saying,
Oh,

1014
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:28.100
you let those who are taking them because you know,
they're,
uh,

1015
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.740
the Oregons were taken out so surgically that we don't have the either.

1016
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:35.470
But what Bill Cooper he was,
he got balls deep into that.

1017
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:39.800
He started getting into breaking down.
What's really happening with is he's gone,

1018
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.220
Oh shit,
we're being,
we're,

1019
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.760
the government is pretending to cover it up there.
They want to push it.

1020
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.410
They want people to believe in alien.

1021
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.760
<v 0>So what do you think that the counter mutilations where you think they were</v>

1022
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:52.140
testing weapons on these cattle?

1023
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.380
<v 3>Bill Cooper said it was really simple.</v>

1024
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:57.710
All the cattle are found by military basis.
And what they do is they,

1025
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.480
when they're constantly checked,

1026
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:02.660
checking radiation levels around basis constantly.

1027
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.440
So what they do is if there's cows,
they'll go routinely take a cow,

1028
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:07.820
take out it's rectum,

1029
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.690
take out at like certain Oregon surgically and then they dumped them just to

1030
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.080
scare people.
Just let them,
it'll kill two birds with one stone.

1031
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.900
They really needed to get some radiation,
um,
a test.

1032
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:21.470
But it's always good.
It's always good to push you.
Fos.

1033
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.050
It's always good to scare people with aliens.

1034
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.500
<v 0>I wonder if those,
those uh,
cattle abductions,</v>

1035
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:31.410
if they coincided with areas where there was like some sort of toxic dump,

1036
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:35.250
you know,
someday ammunition dump or something like that.

1037
01:00:35.251 --> 01:00:36.840
Like anything where some corner,

1038
01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.320
what do they have more of them around Nevada where they did all those nuclear,

1039
01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:41.221
<v 3>I'm not sure,</v>

1040
01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:46.221
but the gist of what Bill Cooper said was found near military bases and he knows

1041
01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:49.380
once he looked into it,
it's like,
oh,
I know what they're doing.

1042
01:00:49.381 --> 01:00:52.160
They're checking radiation levels and they're scaring people at the same time.

1043
01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.380
<v 0>Hmm.
That makes sense.
Because it was surgically removed.
Right?</v>

1044
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.640
Like people can do that.

1045
01:00:56.641 --> 01:00:59.070
Like why would that eliminate the possibility that people could do it?

1046
01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.200
Of course people could do it,
but Pete,
you know,
people like to eat.

1047
01:01:01.201 --> 01:01:02.490
Only aliens could do that.

1048
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.580
And then they take it and then they move it to another place so that the blood

1049
01:01:05.581 --> 01:01:09.420
is not in a spot where they find the animal.
That's all it is.
I'm a crazy,

1050
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:13.380
that's how they catch poachers,
you know?
Do you know that?
Oh,

1051
01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:17.010
they catch poachers that way.
Sometimes they find out where the gut pile is.

1052
01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.660
So like say if you,
uh,

1053
01:01:18.661 --> 01:01:23.190
you didn't really have a tag to shoot a deer and then you shot a deer and

1054
01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:25.350
another place where you're not supposed to be,

1055
01:01:25.351 --> 01:01:29.190
but you have a tag at a different place.
You,
you just cause of,

1056
01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:30.900
there's some places where it's easier to get tags.

1057
01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:33.570
He just take the deer out of the forbidden place,

1058
01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:36.630
take a picture of it or something like that and then go back home.

1059
01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:40.980
Well they busted people because they like Park Rangers recognized certain

1060
01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:43.740
mountain peaks and the like,
no,
no,
you weren't there.

1061
01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:45.960
I know exactly where you were when you,
when you killed this dear,

1062
01:01:45.961 --> 01:01:46.800
you were at a different place.

1063
01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:49.720
And then they go to that different place and they code,
they look at the,
fit,

1064
01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.250
the picture and they try to coordinate and then they find the gut pile and then

1065
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:58.251
they convict people of poaching that's happened before they look at the photos.

1066
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:02.350
Yeah.
Yeah.
So like so that's what Bill Cooper.

1067
01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:05.550
That makes sense that they would do that.
That they would do it because when you,

1068
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.900
if you think you took that animal and killed and cut it and left this big bloody

1069
01:02:09.901 --> 01:02:10.140
patent,

1070
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:13.500
then put it in a truck and then dragged it 10 miles away and dropped it off

1071
01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:16.710
there.
People be like,
this is crazy.
There's no blood at the scene of the crime.

1072
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.100
All the bloods missing.
It's been removed.
Like no

1073
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.180
<v 3>one could do this.
This is impossible.
Literally no blood on the ground.
Yeah,</v>

1074
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:27.240
because they put it there.
You fuck you fuck wit.

1075
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.000
You think aliens came this far to fuck with cows?

1076
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.590
Imagine if we went all the way up to like Neptune shoot gophers,

1077
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.030
which is going to get there.
Fuck up your gophers.

1078
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.230
Neptune Jack them cut their decks off,
thrown back.
It's funny,
man.

1079
01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:46.200
That's exactly what they thought aliens did and it's hilarious.

1080
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.760
Cattle mutilations are fucking hilarious in that regard.
Yeah.

1081
01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:53.580
It's gross too though that they did it so many times that it became a thing that

1082
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:57.840
people looked for and then they let all these people who believe in aliens

1083
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:01.650
anyway that let all these people just still are trying to scare us.

1084
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.810
They're trying to scare us with aliens.
For sure.

1085
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.440
Maybe that's what book foot's about.
Maybe big foot was about to let's,

1086
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.980
let's create this mythical monster and have people afraid.

1087
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:13.950
They don't want people to move in the woods.
The thing about it,
that's not good,

1088
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.480
that's not good for the Nwa.
They want people to go into cities,

1089
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.480
so they create these big floods.
If they not doing it,

1090
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:24.340
they should do is create another Bigfoot's.
That's,

1091
01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:28.920
that's the most easy way reason for believing in bigfoot I've ever heard.

1092
01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:31.710
That's so funny.
Thanks for,
it's been around forever though,
Dude.

1093
01:03:31.711 --> 01:03:35.160
They talked about it in the CIA's been around forever and it was in the native

1094
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:39.600
American culture before the Nazis did that.
Tabitha Nazis like have,

1095
01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.740
I bet if you go to Germany,

1096
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:43.890
they have these mythical creatures that they created a scare people out of the

1097
01:03:43.891 --> 01:03:47.910
woods.
If they're not,
if they're not doing that damn,

1098
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:51.120
they got to give me credit if they started doing it because that's how good

1099
01:03:51.121 --> 01:03:54.900
illuminati move right there.
Right.
That's how crazy deep you have to be.

1100
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.360
If you're a conspiracy theorist,
if you go so deep,

1101
01:03:57.361 --> 01:04:02.361
you think that the CIA was in the native American's before Columbus landed.

1102
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:06.660
You don't even understand.
It had a different name.

1103
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.520
It was the Steelers need about air can organization.
They taught the European,

1104
01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.740
maybe the CIA of the Apache,

1105
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:16.860
cause you know they had to have some evil elites that lied to their people.

1106
01:04:16.861 --> 01:04:19.800
Right?
Maybe they wanted to keep their tribes together.

1107
01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:22.970
So they said they created these monsters so you can't go out there and we're

1108
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.050
going to protect you because you got to stay here.

1109
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.610
Wouldn't that be a good move for,
it's probably exactly what happened.
Right.

1110
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.810
And they got these crazy stories of these monsters.
Yeah,
man,

1111
01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:35.410
you got to stay here and protection.
CIA.
Yeah.

1112
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:39.990
Native American sex.
Just Brown building empires.
One O one you create,

1113
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:43.380
you scare them with aliens.
We got a threat from up here,

1114
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:47.370
so we need to protect you.
And then we got threats down here.
Two jobs,

1115
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.300
maybe jobs as a CIA moving.
Let's keep people out the ocean.

1116
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:56.100
We got to keep them in the cities.
It's all CIA,
Bro.
Everything is all powerful.

1117
01:04:56.101 --> 01:05:00.300
Imagine if they just worked for good instead of trying to,
you know,

1118
01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:03.390
what they do at the native American community.
Mo Most,

1119
01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:05.410
I'm sure most of the people in the CIA,

1120
01:05:05.411 --> 01:05:10.130
I really legitimately trying to stop communism.
It's just like a few key cowboys.

1121
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.610
Cowboys.
Yeah.
In anything.
Any cops,
right.
When you hear about corrupt cops,

1122
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:18.220
that doesn't mean all cops are corrupt.
But did you ever see that doc documentary

1123
01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:22.420
<v 0>on um,
New York?
Uh,
the seven five,
uh,
Mike Dowd,</v>

1124
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:25.360
he'd been a guest on Joey's podcast,
my podcast.

1125
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.550
He was a corrupt cop and shit.
Deeply,
deeply,
deeply,
deeply corrupt.

1126
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.940
That means he murdered people.
No,
no,
no,
no.
We've got up to that.
According to him,

1127
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.010
he's never going to tell you he murdered people if didn't get caught for it.

1128
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.950
But he went to jail and I,
he says he did.
And I believe him,
just to clarify,

1129
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.150
but you know,
dealt with drug dealers and you know,

1130
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.270
it was driving around in a corvette and shit like live in like a baller and

1131
01:05:46.271 --> 01:05:48.820
scary.
We're all selling drugs and they caught him and you know,

1132
01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:51.460
they put him in jail for a long time and then they put out this fucking amazing

1133
01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:54.310
documentary.
It's called the seven five.
It's,
what does he talk about?

1134
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:55.870
Everything he tells them,

1135
01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.080
he spills the beans about getting involved with all these drug dealers and you

1136
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:00.160
know,
rolling these people over,

1137
01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:03.400
taking their money and then go into business with them.
It's crazy.

1138
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.940
It is crazy documentary.
You'll like,
you get anxiety even though,

1139
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:09.340
you know the guy is still alive while they're telling the stories.

1140
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:13.800
You're like Yeezus Christ.
They were just doing blow and going crazy and just,

1141
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:17.200
and Robin people just straight Robyn people showing up at people's houses,

1142
01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:21.580
putting guns to their heads,
robbing other drug money,
you know,
like it was nuts,

1143
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:25.230
man.
Like there was hits out on them.
It was crazy.
It's crazy.

1144
01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:28.690
It's a crazy documentary.
But this is like,
um,

1145
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.030
there's a guy who I should know who the,

1146
01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.080
the current guest is on Sam Harris' podcast.
I'll look that up in a second.

1147
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:37.930
But he was talking about it,
you know what they're talking about.

1148
01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:40.780
Like absolute power and absolute power.

1149
01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:44.560
Does that old expression absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1150
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.080
Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts.
Absolutely.

1151
01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.960
And what they're talking about today,
and I was when I was walking the dog,

1152
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.060
I was listening to this,
they were saying no,

1153
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:56.380
what it does is it exposes you more than it corrupts you expose this corruption

1154
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.380
and like in need.

1155
01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.520
He gave some examples about like Richard Nixon like that Richard Nixon when he

1156
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.080
was,
when he was young,

1157
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:06.760
his professor told them not to be a lawyer cause he has like really shitty

1158
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:07.510
ethics.

1159
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:11.800
Like expose him when he became president and that's when the power goes out to

1160
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:15.070
them.
And that that's an interesting,
that's an interesting subject.

1161
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:20.071
Like what does it like why does someone become out of control?

1162
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:24.130
Corrupt cop?
Well it's a,
exposes them exposed to something in them.

1163
01:07:24.131 --> 01:07:28.120
But in his case when he was saying was the whole department was corrupt when he

1164
01:07:28.121 --> 01:07:31.750
got in there,
they were corrupt.
People were corrupt.
The day he got on the job,

1165
01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.540
people were telling him what to talk about,
what not to talk about,

1166
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.420
and they beat some guy up or something like that.
And he's like,
this never,

1167
01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.920
this never happened.
You know,
like they have these little,
what do they call it?

1168
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.200
What does that expression they have for um,

1169
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.700
for cops keeping their mouth shut.
What the fuck is that?

1170
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:52.300
What if there's an expression,
there's a,
there's like a code,

1171
01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:55.590
it's called the Coda says,

1172
01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:59.770
it's like almost has like snitches needs stitches like code of somebody.

1173
01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.200
I'm thinking of a Chuck Norris Movie Code of Silence.

1174
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:08.070
But when you got the power to just rob drug dealers and you're,

1175
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:11.050
you know,
a young guy was doing coke,
you know,
you're crazy.

1176
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:12.080
He's a really nice guy though.

1177
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:15.760
My Dad literally returned this police officer code of silence,
Cortisol South.

1178
01:08:15.761 --> 01:08:19.460
So Chuck Norris movie.
It wasn't Chuck Norris movie.
Right?
Good one.

1179
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:22.880
That's a truck is doing those cop movies.
I love that shit.
When I was a kid.

1180
01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:25.150
Blue Wall of silence.
Anything coded,

1181
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:28.820
all of that's coming up as I just kind of code of silence is the name of the

1182
01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:33.200
Chuck Norris movie.
Pretty sure.
But um,
yeah man,

1183
01:08:33.201 --> 01:08:35.510
I eat just like this corrupt cops.
Most cops aren't corrupt.

1184
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.200
I think that's the case with agents with fucking anybody,
you know?

1185
01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:42.170
That's just how it goes,
man.
I have a bunch of cup friends.

1186
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.500
They're all could just made a mad dash.
You know what's that?

1187
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:49.340
That's what I would call it.
Diarrhea Dash.
Yep.
Running into that can,

1188
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:52.730
I know there's cops out there that you know are probably a couple of them out

1189
01:08:52.731 --> 01:08:56.420
there.
Fucking people up and maybe a for sure.
For sure.
But the cops,

1190
01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:00.740
I know the cops that I come in contact with,
they've always been cool to me.
Yes.

1191
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:03.310
Always been cooled them that well also too,
you know,

1192
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.870
they're not pulling you over there.
Also in the martial arts,

1193
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:09.590
you're a famous martial artist and a lot of times your training or learning from

1194
01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:12.380
them or what we were talking to them at UFC events and stuff in the south,

1195
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.180
Sita Big John McCarthy.
Yup,
Yup.
Yeah.
It's like,
great guys.

1196
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:18.510
I'm super pro cop,

1197
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.980
but I know that there's bad people in every fucking line of work.

1198
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:25.970
It doesn't mean cops are bad,
doesn't the cops.
It's a terrible fucking job.

1199
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.270
The problem is when,
when someone does do something bad,
man,

1200
01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:31.880
it changes everybody's opinion about what cops are like.

1201
01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:35.750
This two videos I saw last week of cops pulling people over with guns drawn

1202
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.030
pointed in the car.
One was a Mexican family,

1203
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.730
a guy in his girl and one was a black family.

1204
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:44.180
A guy in his girl is the same thing.
The guy's driving and the guy,

1205
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:48.500
the cop has his gun out pointed at them and he's telling this,

1206
01:09:48.501 --> 01:09:51.560
a black kid to shut off his car and he's like,
I'm not going to do that.

1207
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.640
He's like,
I'm not moving my hands.
He goes,

1208
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.450
you give you give you an excuse to shoot me.
I'm not moving my hands.

1209
01:09:56.750 --> 01:10:00.230
So his girls filming it and he's got his hands up and it's crazy to watch,
man.

1210
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.200
I don't know what happened before that.
I don't know what the context was.

1211
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.630
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1212
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.200
All I know is this guy's got a gun pointed at this guy and the guy's not

1213
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:10.034
threatening him.

1214
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.740
He's not sitting any and he's telling them to shut off the car and the guy's

1215
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:14.390
scared and shut off the car.
Cause there are,

1216
01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:18.850
there are videos of a cop telling a guy pull over the guy he gets,

1217
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:22.070
let me see your license registration and he reaches back to get his wallet and

1218
01:10:22.071 --> 01:10:24.320
the cop shoots him.
There's video though.
You can see that.

1219
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.410
But what about just people is my point.
But I got to clarify.

1220
01:10:27.411 --> 01:10:29.750
I know the whole story.
You guys know the whole story.

1221
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.890
They ran his plates and they go,
Oh shit we got to,

1222
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.580
we got a hot one sometimes I'm sure that's never know.

1223
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:39.680
Sometimes I'm sure that's the case,
but with this video that wasn't,
you know,

1224
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.600
nobody provided that information in that video.

1225
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:45.470
You just seeing the guy pointing a gun at a guy and I don't think he has his,

1226
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.160
you know,
I mean,
he just has his hands up.
Look,
it's all fucking,

1227
01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:51.560
we've talked about this a hundred times.
It's a hard guy.
Damn job.

1228
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:53.840
You're pulling people over.
You never know who's going to shoot you.

1229
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:57.380
You want to go home to your wife and family and every fucking day you're pulling

1230
01:10:57.381 --> 01:11:00.290
people over the line to you every day you're dealing with people that are

1231
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:04.320
breaking the law and they're not happy to see you every day.
And yeah,

1232
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:09.700
I think that's where that absolute power corrupting comes in.

1233
01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:14.690
Corrupt some fucking people.
You know,
there's some,

1234
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:18.870
some dirty birds out there.
I think in the future though,
ma'am,

1235
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.150
you're going to see less and less of it.

1236
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:25.650
I think it was probably 100% of the way things ran like many,

1237
01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:30.370
many years ago.
And now it's way less because it's just way more transparency.

1238
01:11:30.371 --> 01:11:33.060
And you know,
you know that cocaine cowboys documentary,
you seen that

1239
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.710
Billy Corbin stuff?
Uh,
yes.

1240
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:41.760
You know how the class of the graduating class,
the police academy in Miami,

1241
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:42.510
one year,

1242
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:47.130
100% of them either were murdered or went to jail for corruption the whole
class.

1243
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:49.000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1244
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:54.590
<v 3>That's crazy.
But that's what happens when places go sideways.</v>

1245
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:59.360
You know when things go so nutty.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1246
01:11:59.361 --> 01:12:02.870
Like the Scarface days.
Yeah.
That's how crazy I am.
If someone,

1247
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.730
if someone told me to do,
you know,
the CIA,
Purdue,
Purdue,
Scarface,

1248
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:12.470
to distract from their drug running,
I would just need a youtube link.

1249
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.393
You know what I mean?

1250
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:18.100
<v 0>Well,
the CIA,
even if they didn't produce it,</v>

1251
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:22.150
if they really,
if some cowboys in the CIA were selling drugs,

1252
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:25.270
even if they didn't produce Scarface,

1253
01:12:25.271 --> 01:12:29.980
they certainly benefited from it in somewhat because it made it made drug on
the,

1254
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:31.060
for all the drug smugglers,

1255
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:33.920
<v 3>number,
all Cuban.
Never all Mexican,
like,</v>

1256
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.720
but it made it sound like there was some guys.
What was that guy?
Well,
didn't,

1257
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:38.321
didn't,
uh,

1258
01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:43.321
Barry seal bring in over 5 billion tons or 500 billion or $5 billion or

1259
01:12:43.871 --> 01:12:48.730
something like that.
A big billion.
Yeah.
Of Drug Money and cruise movie on him.

1260
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.970
Yeah.
It wasn't that,
isn't that what it was about?
It was about that,
right?
Yeah.

1261
01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:56.110
And that's about,
it's about berries.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is that movie called?

1262
01:12:56.650 --> 01:13:00.280
The Tom Cruise movie.
American mate.
That's a fucking excellent movie.

1263
01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.630
That's an excellent movie.

1264
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.570
And for people who don't know how all that Shit went down and you watch that

1265
01:13:04.571 --> 01:13:07.330
movie,
I don't know how historically accurate it was because it involved,

1266
01:13:07.331 --> 01:13:11.740
the CIA told you talk about,
Oh yeah,
I may let that out.
Oh yeah.

1267
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:13.560
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

1268
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.560
And they essentially talk about exactly what we just talked about it cowboys and

1269
01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:23.571
the CIA and how many people were making money on the sneak tips son bringing in

1270
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:26.190
that cocaine,
bringing in that yet.

1271
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:29.790
I don't know if it had in the murders of the two kids though,

1272
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.340
because that's really how they got busted.

1273
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.720
They got busted because they were dropping off coke out of these planes and two

1274
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:41.280
kids saw the drop off and they found the two kids near the coke and they fucking

1275
01:13:41.281 --> 01:13:42.114
murdered them.

1276
01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:45.030
And then they put him on train tracks and said they got high and fell asleep on

1277
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:47.870
train tracks and p families,
uh,

1278
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:50.220
did an autopsy and found knife wounds on the kid.

1279
01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.780
They knew something was up and then they investigated it.

1280
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.400
And slowly but surely the,
the pieces started to fall apart.

1281
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:59.190
And then when Barry seal was murdered,

1282
01:13:59.191 --> 01:14:03.390
he had George Bush his phone number in his pocket when he was murdered.

1283
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:05.830
Is that in the movie too honest?
I don't know.
I don't know.

1284
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:07.070
I don't know if that was in the movie,
but that's,

1285
01:14:07.071 --> 01:14:11.260
that's what happened on his way to testify.
I mean,

1286
01:14:11.261 --> 01:14:12.220
they weren't even hiding

1287
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.000
<v 1>it.
They just let this guy get shot up on the way to testify.</v>

1288
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.760
He for sure brought in a,

1289
01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:24.100
what I would call a fuck load of coke.
Who?
Barry Seal for sure.

1290
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.360
A fuckload.
Who is his boss?
You think?
It's a good question.
It was an Arkansas,

1291
01:14:28.361 --> 01:14:33.130
right?
Somebody probably got a taste,
you know,
at many different stages.

1292
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.370
Right?
What's the coke coming in?
Arkansas.
Mina,
right.
Mean ours.

1293
01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.620
That was that real was that movie Tom Cruise made a movie about Mena Arkansas

1294
01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:42.130
grow.
It's good movie.
I don't know.

1295
01:14:42.131 --> 01:14:45.160
It's hard for me to watch any movies unless it's an animated movie from my kid.

1296
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.620
Like go into a regular movie can do it now.
It's hard.

1297
01:14:47.621 --> 01:14:50.890
Can't do it like I'm at home.
Well Google,
this was a,

1298
01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:53.110
we'd probably have a lot that we just covered that needs to be googled.

1299
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.150
The website about the accuracy of the movie.
Oh good.
Perfect.

1300
01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.490
That's what I was gonna ask too.
Who decides how,
what's accurate or not?
Right,

1301
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:06.550
right,
right.
And they let him go and certain certain times they caught him,

1302
01:15:06.551 --> 01:15:08.500
they let him go and people didn't want to let them go.

1303
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:13.280
So like crazy documentary or crazy a movie.
But what do they call that?
Uh,

1304
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:18.250
what a,
what a docu drama.
What is,
what does it,
when someone makes a movie about,

1305
01:15:18.251 --> 01:15:23.230
it's not really a docu drama though.
It's not,
it's a fucking movie.
It's like,

1306
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:25.930
you know,
you never know how much is true.
Well,

1307
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:29.920
we're talking about that goddamn wrestling movie with Steve Carell with a,

1308
01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:33.430
the Mark Hamill Mu or a Marka Schultes movie.
Oh yeah,

1309
01:15:33.431 --> 01:15:35.790
the Garrett gave and Marshall's.
Yeah,
the,

1310
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.770
we carry Goodrich thing where they replaced him with some Russian dude in the

1311
01:15:38.771 --> 01:15:43.090
movie.
That's a historical event.
But Gary Goodrich fought Mark Schultz.

1312
01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:44.350
That was a historical event.

1313
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.960
Marshall's dominated one of the best guys in the sport,

1314
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:50.590
easily just wrestled him to the ground with ease.
And we got a chance to see,
wow,

1315
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:53.740
this is what happens when an Olympic gold medalist wrestles a regular martial

1316
01:15:53.741 --> 01:15:57.700
artist.
But in the movie they decided to just change that for no reason.

1317
01:15:58.450 --> 01:15:59.770
Like they could do that with anything.

1318
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:03.750
So who the fuck knows the Bruce Lee movie with Jason Scott Lee.
Yeah.

1319
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.490
That was filled with a bunch of bull shit.
He's made shit up.

1320
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.180
He had a famous fight where he learned wing Chung doesn't really work on

1321
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:12.790
American's.
Yeah.
It was in a,
why MCA?

1322
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:17.170
He was fighting for the right to teach foreigners Kung Fu.
Cause,
uh,

1323
01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:20.020
the elders that lived in San Francisco or Seattle,
I forget,

1324
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:21.450
I think it's San Francisco.
Uh,

1325
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:25.360
they didn't want him to teach foreigners and they said,
if you beat this,

1326
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.660
if you beat our guy up,
then we'll let you teach foreigners.

1327
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:30.430
So he had this fight and he was in the Ymcas,
but in the actual movie,

1328
01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:31.810
it's in a fucking dungeon.

1329
01:16:31.811 --> 01:16:36.790
Did it's like a kid just a cave and the elders or sit up like no.
Or The rings.

1330
01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.750
It's like fucking rings.
That's right.
It's the craziest,

1331
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:44.190
they didn't have to go that far,
but I guess,
yeah,
it was just the YMC.

1332
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.580
Did he win the fight?
Yes.
And he didn't use,
in real life,

1333
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.593
he had a,

1334
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:54.460
he hurt his back doing squats or dead lifts and really bad.
Here it is.

1335
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.520
So that's when he wrote his first book is when he was like in traction.

1336
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:01.270
Is that what they call it when they get your backs and some kind of spinal or

1337
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:05.620
some kind of brace,
but,
so,
but in the movie,

1338
01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:09.910
the dude kicked him in the back and broke his back.
Uh,
yeah.

1339
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.200
<v 3>Tricky.
Yeah.
Alone.
Yeah.</v>

1340
01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.500
And then he's,

1341
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:20.590
there's a famous appearance of his at the Long Beach Convention Center back in

1342
01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:25.370
the 60s.
It was like a karate tournament and he did some demonstrations.

1343
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:26.320
He did that.
There's a,

1344
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:29.810
there's video famous video of him doing the one inch punch.
It's in front of,

1345
01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:33.560
it's like at the,
like an IB,
Jj have tournament.
He's doing a demonstration.

1346
01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.210
And in the movie it was a real fight and he fights the same dude from the

1347
01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:42.290
dungeon.
It's a rematch.
Oh No,
they made that.
They added on.

1348
01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:47.600
Who the fuck are you guys thinking?
Why would they do that?
They didn't need to,

1349
01:17:47.601 --> 01:17:51.710
his life was amazing in,
you know,
in reality.

1350
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:54.140
Aren't they doing something on him right now though?

1351
01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:56.060
Isn't something happening right now?

1352
01:17:56.061 --> 01:18:00.680
Some new Bruce Lee thing that I read that or am I just hoping there's a movie

1353
01:18:00.681 --> 01:18:05.681
coming out about a dude who was a famous actor in the late sixties and early

1354
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.470
seventies and in the movie
he's,
Oh,
he's a stud man.
Yeah.

1355
01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:15.440
He's a famous rich duck man dude.
And,
uh,

1356
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:20.130
in the movie there's a Bruce Lee part where he's in a Bruce Lee movie and also a

1357
01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:24.490
movie called once upon a time in Hollywood.
He showed that's it there.
Yeah.
Oh,

1358
01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:28.190
nice.
But it's not,
is it CGI Bruce Sleep,
nor is it an actor.
It's an act.

1359
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.860
They should have went with the CGI Bruce.
Oh,
how cool.

1360
01:18:30.861 --> 01:18:35.390
Would that make a new Bruce Lee movie all CGI?
They could do that shit here.

1361
01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:39.110
Imagine now Illuminati doesn't want you to know how good they are at that yet.

1362
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:43.010
Okay.
So if the Illuminati creative,
Bruce Lee,
what would be the reason?
Well,

1363
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.950
they would,
if they did it,
they would let you know,
hey,
fuck face.

1364
01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:49.100
We already can make movies at a anybody.
Anytime we want,

1365
01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.610
we are going to have someone talking like Bruce Lee.

1366
01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.670
Look at that.
Wait a minute.
That looks like Bruce Lee did.
It looks very good.

1367
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:02.840
Was that CGR doesn't look like I'm right there.
I mean,
it's close enough.

1368
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:04.700
Is that the new Bruce Lee?
This is just,
Oh,

1369
01:19:04.710 --> 01:19:08.930
they from the trailer is that only piece we can go?
Oh,
you know what,
that CGI,
no.

1370
01:19:08.931 --> 01:19:12.620
Okay.
No,
no,
it's not.
No,
no,
no.
For sure.
It's CGI.
That first scan,

1371
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.210
that first clip down,
right?
Their CTO,
it's glasses and he's wearing glasses face.

1372
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.380
He's already looks fake as fuck.

1373
01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:22.760
It looks like a CGI video game thing that they did something to his jaw.

1374
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:26.900
It little bit looks like a Cgi face,
so he has an unusual looks real,

1375
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.700
but that's cause you're seeing them at a different angle.

1376
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.710
Watch backing up to where he's at the side.

1377
01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.680
What if they're doing like that thickening to me?
Hold on,
hold on me.

1378
01:19:33.681 --> 01:19:37.170
That looks Jesus Christ already to find job.
His job he's getting.

1379
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:43.640
I know you got to stop.
You gotta stop.
It's exhausting.
Um,
could have though,

1380
01:19:43.641 --> 01:19:48.170
if they wanted to get in the fast and furious with Paul Walker created his face

1381
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:49.730
a lot.
Well they needed to do a Bruce Lee movie.

1382
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.230
They can't have it fucked up at all.
It has to be super smooth.

1383
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.730
It has to be.
It has to be really.
Bruce Lee ask.
Totally.
And you know what?

1384
01:19:58.731 --> 01:20:01.160
You could do it like that movie man.
This was like 20 years ago,

1385
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:04.280
the final fantasy movie where they did animation but they tried to make it look

1386
01:20:04.281 --> 01:20:08.160
real old people.
They got that shit down.
They got old people

1387
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.610
<v 1>down harder and make a young girl look real.</v>

1388
01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:13.380
So that kind of ad is still a cartoon effect.

1389
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:16.230
But older people should look like real people.
Yeah,

1390
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.600
they can do it with textured skins,
right?

1391
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.540
You do it with dragons and that was 20 years ago.

1392
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:26.220
They could do movies that are full CGI.
That's really hard to tell.
Well,

1393
01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:30.360
it's also because your brain doesn't have like a reference point for dragons.

1394
01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.830
They can make a dragon look real where it's like,

1395
01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:34.950
did you see game of Thrones when they have the wolves?

1396
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:38.780
The wolves are always just like,
eh,
the hair move.
They don't have a haircut.

1397
01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:44.100
They're like five years away from here.
It moves to to CGI.

1398
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:46.830
Slow Mo.
Yeah.
It's always super slow mo.

1399
01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.770
That is him that popped up here on this video thinking Michael Moe,

1400
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:53.130
that's the dude.
So when you see him with the glasses and see him from the side,

1401
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:56.010
um,
he should.
Uh,
that's interesting.

1402
01:20:56.490 --> 01:21:01.490
I don't know if they could do the CGI yet for a whole movie and make him with

1403
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:05.220
Bruce Lee's face.
I can do it.
Perfect.
Wow,
that's crazy.

1404
01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:08.700
So they could have done that.
But then again,

1405
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:12.210
if everybody else in the movie isn't like Steve Mcqueen and all the other famous

1406
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:13.044
folks in the movie,

1407
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:16.830
like are they using different people for them or that that would be fucked up.

1408
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:21.950
Imagine if in the future all they ever make is like Charles Bronson movies,

1409
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:25.230
Steve McQueen movies,
Bruce Lee movies.

1410
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:29.880
And they do it with regular actors in the regular actors get paid like scale and

1411
01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:32.760
these are giant ass when they do face to face getting on them.

1412
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.930
And they have new Bruce Lee movies and they have some dudes

1413
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.550
how rogue they added a princess Leia back was not even alive anymore.

1414
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.300
I didn't see the new one.
Yeah,
there you go.
Maybe I did.

1415
01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:47.580
Is that the ones where they're doing it now?

1416
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:51.060
She's in the more recent one that just came out.
And the one before that too,

1417
01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:55.900
I guess.
I think I saw the most,
what's the most recent?
There's a lot of them.

1418
01:21:55.901 --> 01:22:00.360
Yeah.
I think I'm,
I think I'm one behind.
I think I missed,

1419
01:22:00.361 --> 01:22:01.590
I haven't seen the new Avengers.

1420
01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:05.540
I didn't manage to avoid the whole spoiler when they start doing like,
uh,

1421
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:10.440
like they'll take Angela Jolena leaves face and has her own leave and put it on

1422
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:13.440
like a,
you know,
Beyonce,
his body or something.
You remember that song?

1423
01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.970
See that big old titties like Angelina's y'all lean.
I mean that song.
Yeah.

1424
01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:23.040
It's a great song.
That was a big hit for like a couple of weeks about that.
Yeah.

1425
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.990
Angelina Jolie got some big ass titties.
That was the song.

1426
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:32.400
That was the whole,
it was like different people that had some big ass titties.

1427
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:37.110
That was the name of the song.
Um,
she's in that new maleficent movie.

1428
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:38.850
They did some crazy shit to her face,
man.

1429
01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:42.780
They turned her into some like Dragon Lady's some wizard lady or which,
yeah,

1430
01:22:42.781 --> 01:22:47.730
there's a lot of satanism in movies,
man.
They go dark with the,
do you trip out?

1431
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.420
I know,
I know.
Uh,
we have different opinions on like,

1432
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.160
you know,
like the sky and space,
but do,
do you notice,

1433
01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.840
do you notice watching kids programming that they fucking bombard kids with

1434
01:23:00.841 --> 01:23:03.950
space,
right?
Sure.
Dude.
Hey,

1435
01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:06.100
they get hammered with it in every movie there

1436
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.540
<v 3>space,
there's aliens are space.
There's aliens.
They get bought movies.
Yeah.</v>

1437
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:16.300
It's crazy.
It's insane.
They blasted with it.
Well,
there's a lot above us.

1438
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:20.770
If you look at what's important for kids now,
totally important.
Period.
Man.

1439
01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:24.880
I went to see Brian Cox's demonstration that he did.
They did like to do a show.

1440
01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:28.840
I did it a in downtown La and I was thinking I would love to get Eddie Bravo

1441
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:33.280
high and have him watch this like a fight companion.
This is CGI.

1442
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.450
Is this fake?
Yeah.
Why do you think it's fake?

1443
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:41.170
How much do you think is fake that you see in space?
Man?
Um,

1444
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.640
you know,
Wernher von Braun was a Nazi,
right?
Yes.
Okay.

1445
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:49.840
He was brought in from operation paperclip,
right?
Right.
We had Annie Jacobson on.

1446
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:54.040
Did you listen to that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She talked in depth about that.
I mean,

1447
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.900
that's how everyone agrees on that.

1448
01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:59.980
Everyone agrees that he directed all six moon missions.
Yup.
Everyone agrees.

1449
01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.540
Everyone agrees that him and Walt Disney,

1450
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:05.650
we're best friends where they grow best friends,
they're best friends.

1451
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:09.670
They worked on space together.
Um,
[inaudible] they were like,

1452
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.350
you know,
jump into a lot of conclusions today.
In this day and age,

1453
01:24:14.351 --> 01:24:18.580
you don't think anybody's like when space x shoots rockets off in this space or

1454
01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:20.860
when,
you know,
Amazon has a rocket company.

1455
01:24:20.861 --> 01:24:25.861
Now these guys are going to be able to launch satellites and even have consumer

1456
01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:30.910
flights.
I just need proof,
man.
What about deception?
I see a lot of future.

1457
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:33.490
Would you be willing option everywhere?
So I'm like,
okay.
You know,

1458
01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:35.750
when you're talking about you're moving,
hold on.
You know,

1459
01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:38.740
you're talking about that Foxcatcher movie or like you've said a couple times on

1460
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.420
your podcast where you're like,
once you've,

1461
01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:44.050
once you saw that they left Gary Goodridge out,
you were like,

1462
01:24:44.051 --> 01:24:47.050
I can't trust this movie.
I can't try the whole movies.
I can't trust that.

1463
01:24:47.051 --> 01:24:50.140
It may be real.
It may not be real,
but I need some proof.
I got you.

1464
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.820
That's exactly how I feel about
that space.

1465
01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:58.750
The government,
the government coming from a government agency,
whatever.

1466
01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:01.420
It's a government agency.
I look at it like Fox catcher.

1467
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:06.310
You've lied enough where I'm like,
I need some irrefutable evidence.
Otherwise,

1468
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.910
why do I have to believe it?
I just assume any real I you don't get it,

1469
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:13.320
but space x is in the government space.
Private company.
No,

1470
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.280
they're subsidized by the government man.
Subsidized do they got like $4 billion.

1471
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:19.690
So they tell them the fake space.

1472
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.250
No one's trusting national more so they're handing it over.
Hey,
let's,
let's get,

1473
01:25:24.670 --> 01:25:28.970
let's do the side thing and everyone's all in space now.
That's,

1474
01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:34.110
that's the way to look at it.
I think it's when you saw the,
you saw that,

1475
01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.620
that Tesla lunch,
you saw that.
What are you talking about when you launched,

1476
01:25:38.621 --> 01:25:42.520
when he claim to launch a toaster,
did you see that footage?

1477
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:46.720
The actual Teslin space?
Yes.
Yes.
I saw that.

1478
01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.550
And you have a dude,
you've,
I've always known you as a dude,

1479
01:25:51.551 --> 01:25:56.470
had a strong,
vibrant,
vibrant bullshit meter.

1480
01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:01.150
You've always been that game,
you're going to watch that evidence and go,
oh,

1481
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:03.830
okay.
You can't just buy that dude.
You can't just buy that.

1482
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:07.340
Let me ridiculous elements.
The very first thing,
the very first day,

1483
01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.580
the very first don't poison the water.
She wanted me to get an honest

1484
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:15.800
react first.
Elon Musk set on his,
in his press conference,

1485
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:20.090
the first thing he said is like,
well,
I think it's impossible and ridiculous and,

1486
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:24.890
and uh,
if um,
you can tell it's real because it looks so fake.

1487
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:27.200
That's the opposite of logic.

1488
01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:31.070
There's logic and reason and then there's the opposite of that.
No,

1489
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.730
we can tell it's real because it looks so fake is the opposite of of words.

1490
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:38.390
That's just something he says because he's a fucking genius and he's taken a

1491
01:26:38.391 --> 01:26:41.040
picture from.
But the reason why he said no,
no,

1492
01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.690
the reason he said that was because all day when they did that all day,

1493
01:26:44.691 --> 01:26:48.040
all over the Internet with like fake,
fake,
fake,
fake,
fake something.

1494
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:51.110
He had to have a statements.
Please hold her.
She had Java statement.

1495
01:26:51.111 --> 01:26:54.710
This is so ridiculous.
Let me see it,
Jamie.
Come on,
let me see the video.

1496
01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:59.310
Which one?
When fucking the Tesla and space.
I know Tesla and space.

1497
01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.940
Our video,
which is just get a short one.

1498
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:06.620
Just go you just Tesla and space and you're gonna pick the wrong one that got

1499
01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:09.050
edited.
So I'm trying to find the one that's from space.

1500
01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:14.120
We could just abandon this up.
So for,
you know what,
I just,

1501
01:27:14.121 --> 01:27:18.210
it may be real space x maybe real exactly why,
you know,

1502
01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.510
seen him shoot the rockets off.
I mean,
literally people,

1503
01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:23.660
when you look at it and tell me she'll rocket,
anytime you see a rocket shoot,

1504
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.550
you see it go up and then you go down into the ocean,
they launch rockets,

1505
01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.740
they're launching rockets.
That's what it looks like.

1506
01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:33.470
Because what you're seeing it go over the curve of the earth.
Eddie,

1507
01:27:33.471 --> 01:27:36.770
you're seeing it go over the ocean.
You've seen it go up and over.

1508
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:39.740
And so as it gets further away that you can't see it anymore,

1509
01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:43.730
it looks like it's going to be going up.
The nods going parallel to the ground.

1510
01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.520
It's not going parallel to the right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

1511
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:51.170
So they're shooting fucking space.
They are sharing it spinning.
Okay.
I,

1512
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:54.020
I understand that.
That's what you believe,

1513
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:57.530
but you got to understand why I believe what I believe because,

1514
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.830
because that's what you see.
But if you have someone explain it to you,

1515
01:28:00.831 --> 01:28:05.120
what you still believe it.
Um,
if you have a scientist,
explain.
No,
no,
no,
no,

1516
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:10.040
no physics.
We're not no nation,
no explanation.
I need evidence.

1517
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:12.050
You need evidence.
And then when you see evidence,

1518
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:17.110
when you see that Tesla that they launched and you see how fake it looks,

1519
01:28:17.391 --> 01:28:20.840
it looks so fantastic.
But just because something doesn't look real,

1520
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:25.550
it doesn't mean it's fake.
But it doesn't mean it's real.
I need evidence.

1521
01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.390
I need to have a look at them.

1522
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:31.480
You see that you haven't seen with your own eyes might be fake.
Maybe.

1523
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:35.960
I don't trust you.
Don't trust that everybody's like a simulation.
You know,

1524
01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.700
I had a friend who lied about everything,
everything about his life,

1525
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:44.620
where he was from,
all the things he did.
He was a wrestling champion.
He was,
uh,

1526
01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.650
he,
he,
he had everything.
Then I found out like two years into the relationship,

1527
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.770
little by little that he lied about this and he lied about that.

1528
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.080
Then I find out that he lied about everything.

1529
01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:57.670
He's one of those guys that learn lies about everything and you the government.

1530
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:02.760
Exactly.
So he may be telling the truth and even total liars will tell the truth

1531
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:06.120
throughout the day a lot just to get through the day that you have to tell the

1532
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:06.780
truth to get,

1533
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.020
but then you know at the drop of a hat they're going to lie about their life in

1534
01:29:10.021 --> 01:29:13.740
some crazy way.
Whatever.
I understand your logic,
Eddie,
he me slow you down here.

1535
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.970
That's,
I understand your logic,

1536
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:20.210
but you also have to assume that most of the people that are telling you the

1537
01:29:21.391 --> 01:29:24.600
truth about this or that online,

1538
01:29:24.601 --> 01:29:29.601
that also don't have proof that also are talking about these things and they

1539
01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:32.010
haven't shown you.
You haven't seen it.

1540
01:29:32.011 --> 01:29:36.030
You haven't been there just like you haven't been,
you know,

1541
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:39.210
examining satellites,
these people,
they,
they,

1542
01:29:39.211 --> 01:29:42.130
you don't know if they're full of shit either.
It could be a real,
that could be,

1543
01:29:42.131 --> 01:29:46.260
it could be that they were,
why would you assume they were?

1544
01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:48.570
But the satellites are fake.
See what I'm saying?
What do you mean?

1545
01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.410
[inaudible] people that are making these youtube videos that they're correct,

1546
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:55.890
but the people that are putting up satellites are bullshit.
Go by science.

1547
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:59.640
That's what scientific evidence like real science,
like water is always level,

1548
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.420
right?
We know that water is always level at a hundred miles in the conversation.

1549
01:30:03.421 --> 01:30:07.690
If you don't understand how gravity works over a giant fucking sphere,
if,

1550
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:12.740
if we live on a ball that's $25,000 if we do,

1551
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:17.910
then the water should be bending.
So stop with this.
This is so crazy.

1552
01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:21.510
You don't even know what that means.
I do know if it's a ball,

1553
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.100
the ocean should be curving at a certain rate and they figured that out.

1554
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:30.890
Here's the power of perspective yet,
but it's going around.
Why?

1555
01:30:30.891 --> 01:30:33.870
Why is it going over the top and why does it shrink at the end?
Everything.

1556
01:30:33.871 --> 01:30:36.660
You look at the end of the street as streetlights do that.
Yeah,

1557
01:30:36.661 --> 01:30:39.150
but it does streetlights do that.
That's called personal 80.

1558
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:42.930
They did that on the hill.
Not on the ocean.
No,
no,
but you're looking at those,
uh,

1559
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.630
electrical posts or whatever you call them and they go down.

1560
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.640
That's how street like you go right in the middle of the street.

1561
01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:52.350
The very next streetlight is,
appears to be shorter than that one.

1562
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:55.860
And then the next one appears to be short.
That's how you draw shit you.

1563
01:30:55.861 --> 01:30:58.500
But is it really that short?
No,
it's just your perspective.

1564
01:30:58.770 --> 01:31:02.100
You're actually looking at an optical illusion.
You're actually looking at,

1565
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:06.330
it looks like they're getting shorter and descending.
It looks,
but are they?
No,

1566
01:31:06.331 --> 01:31:08.850
they're not.
Because if you went up and Eddie,
they disappear.

1567
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:13.260
They disappear over the horizon and then you could bring them back in.

1568
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:15.450
But that's not true.
Now you can,
you know,

1569
01:31:15.451 --> 01:31:20.220
you can see more up to the edge of the horizon.
But if he owed to the horizon,

1570
01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:22.050
it goes over the door.
The,

1571
01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.450
so when you're talking about win win with the naked eye,

1572
01:31:24.451 --> 01:31:28.290
you're looking at a moan,
go in the ocean and you see it open.

1573
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:30.560
Their is a really telescopes will.

1574
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:32.700
You're just getting small enough so that you can't see it anymore.

1575
01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:36.600
That if you use the telescope you can still see it for a little while and then

1576
01:31:36.601 --> 01:31:40.380
it goes over the fucking curb and they're a more powerful tell us,
go now.

1577
01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:42.690
It brings it even closer,
but you yet have more power.

1578
01:31:42.691 --> 01:31:45.240
Otherwise everybody had tests they've already done.
You could see England,

1579
01:31:45.241 --> 01:31:48.270
you could look out at,
you could see Hawaii too much.
You could see Hawaii.

1580
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.850
Then I can't.
You see Hawaii.
If you could see the moon,

1581
01:31:50.851 --> 01:31:55.630
why can't you see how there's a lot of atmospheric curves?
The fuck,
you know,

1582
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:58.950
fit curves.
Okay.
That's what the scientists say.
Eddie,
the ones who make the GPS,

1583
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.100
the ones that make the maps,

1584
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:04.210
<v 0>the ones who chart the fucking paths for airplanes and shipping routes.</v>

1585
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:07.150
All those people say it's around all the people that do satellites.

1586
01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:09.910
All the people that are involved in aerospace,

1587
01:32:09.911 --> 01:32:13.930
all the people that are involved in anything where you have to calculate the

1588
01:32:13.931 --> 01:32:17.920
fucking curve or the earth and the the the to get things to places.

1589
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:20.230
All those people think it.
They're all wrong.

1590
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:23.260
That's crazy that they haven't seen that picture,
that they don't.

1591
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:26.180
They don't see that picture.
If they saw the picture,
they would get it

1592
01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.640
<v 3>at a hundred miles in the ocean.
A hundred miles.</v>

1593
01:32:29.641 --> 01:32:32.190
How much curvature should they be?
Do you know?
I don't care.

1594
01:32:32.191 --> 01:32:35.400
It's about 6,000 feet.
It's about 6,000 feet of curvature,

1595
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:38.490
so you shouldn't have said how far you can see.
No,

1596
01:32:38.491 --> 01:32:42.540
you wouldn't be able to see a hundred miles away from the oceans.
Who?
Eddie,

1597
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:45.090
you didn't go to school for this stuff.
These people don't understand too.

1598
01:32:45.091 --> 01:32:47.460
You did I research these all the time?
No,
but you're hearing,

1599
01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.690
you're hearing for what?
Do you know what I'm saying?
You're at a hundred miles.

1600
01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:53.760
There should be 6,000 feet of curvature.

1601
01:32:54.150 --> 01:32:55.800
Do you don't even understand what that means?
I don't.

1602
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:56.700
I understand what that means.

1603
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.260
If we live on a ball that at every hundred miles there should be 6,000 feet of

1604
01:33:01.261 --> 01:33:05.700
curvature.
There's,
there's a formula for it and,
but when you look,

1605
01:33:06.150 --> 01:33:11.150
there's a navy ships that can target other navy ships with lasers a hundred

1606
01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:12.900
miles away.

1607
01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:17.100
It would be impossible if it that was a 6,000 foot curvature of water.

1608
01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:18.083
Impossible.

1609
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:22.260
They take pictures of their target pictures at a hundred miles.

1610
01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.610
There's no curvature.
It's flat.

1611
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:27.660
There should be 6,000 feet from the pictures of what?
Eddie,
this is something,

1612
01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.210
this is not your area of expertise.

1613
01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.910
This is one of the reasons why I get crazy about this kind of shit.
Dude.

1614
01:33:32.911 --> 01:33:36.440
I look into this box because you read something that someone said,

1615
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:39.480
I know that you can just be what I just said.
You can't just be what I just said.

1616
01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.810
I bet you can even go to school for it.
So I don't know,
but I bet.

1617
01:33:42.811 --> 01:33:45.960
Do you understand?
Do you stand up?
We live on a ball at a hundred feet.

1618
01:33:45.961 --> 01:33:47.610
There should be 6,000 feet of curvature.

1619
01:33:47.611 --> 01:33:50.170
Does that make sense to everyone's wrong,
Eddie?
So all these fucking people,

1620
01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:52.980
does that make sense?
Sound Australia,
they're doing it the wrong way.

1621
01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.970
All these people that go over the North Pole.
All that's all that's snow goes,

1622
01:33:55.971 --> 01:33:59.130
goes into lines.
There's no flights over the North Pole.

1623
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.210
There's no flight batteries.

1624
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:04.890
Maybe there's military planes to go over the North Pole.
Maybe.
Okay,

1625
01:34:04.891 --> 01:34:07.650
let's please this shit.
I've flown all over the world.

1626
01:34:07.651 --> 01:34:11.820
I've never gotten over the North Pole.
I found everywhere in everywhere.

1627
01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:12.480
I've never,

1628
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.700
no one ever goes over the North Pole so it doesn't mandate go over the notes.

1629
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.380
I Dunno.
So painful.
It's so painful.

1630
01:34:20.381 --> 01:34:22.950
This change the subject.
I'm trying to change the subject.

1631
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:27.240
We can talk about Tony Ferguson Saturday.
What about that?
That's great.

1632
01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:32.040
You got any questions?
What you've been working with them?
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah,

1633
01:34:32.041 --> 01:34:33.870
dude.
He's,
he's sharper,

1634
01:34:33.871 --> 01:34:37.140
stronger in the best shape of his life.

1635
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:40.650
It's the same Tony that,
um,
you know,
you'd think like,

1636
01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.280
is it going to be the same Tony after,
you know,
the,
you know,
he had,
he had some,

1637
01:34:44.281 --> 01:34:48.790
uh,
you know,
family stuff go on.
Is,
is that going to change him?
You know,
um,
uh,

1638
01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:53.580
his opponents hope it changes him,
but he is,
he's the same Tony.

1639
01:34:53.581 --> 01:34:55.980
When it comes to fighting,
we don't get into personal stuff.

1640
01:34:55.981 --> 01:34:58.160
We just stick to fighting the strategy.
He

1641
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.480
<v 1>sharper than ever.
It's not,
you know,
you can't guarantee any wins,</v>

1642
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.380
but I will guarantee that he's going to go win 100% Tony.
It's crazy.

1643
01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:10.250
Matchups very good match.
That's like Russian roulette right there,
dude.

1644
01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:12.920
They're going to be throwing bombs at each other.
It's real good.

1645
01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:17.921
Particularly now with Donald has been on a tear like the last four fights,

1646
01:35:18.411 --> 01:35:21.860
three,
four fights.
I mean,
he's just looked so good man.

1647
01:35:21.861 --> 01:35:26.830
The ally quantify for people who know how good allies for Donald to handle al

1648
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.240
like that and drop him and you know,

1649
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:33.250
and really put it to them like the way I'll put it.
I mean,

1650
01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.580
Al said he beat the shit out of me.

1651
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:39.170
I told I was exact quote was and I was very complimentary and respectful after

1652
01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:42.260
the fight to cowboy is no joke.
That guy's on fire racing.

1653
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:45.560
He doesn't fight like Khabib.
He doesn't fight like Connor.
He fights like Tony,

1654
01:35:45.561 --> 01:35:48.980
so it's like similar.
It's like telling versus Tony,
you know what I mean?

1655
01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.430
And it's a shit due to both get on the ground.

1656
01:35:52.431 --> 01:35:56.540
They're very good on the ground and we respect cowboys fucking ground game a
lot.

1657
01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.130
And you know,
we,
um,
you know,
we did what we could to make sure,
you know,

1658
01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:03.380
nothing bad happens on the ground,
you know what I mean?

1659
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:07.070
But they both have everything.
Yeah.
They both have great striking.

1660
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:11.540
They both have great submissions.
Tony's coming for war,
like he always does.

1661
01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:16.580
It's going to be the same tone throwing down,
that's for sure.
Did.
Now,
when Tony,

1662
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.890
let me ask you this,
cause you know the answer to this,

1663
01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:20.960
when Tony had his knee fixed,

1664
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:25.640
did he spar during that camp because someone said that he didn't do any
sparring.

1665
01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:29.360
It was like one of the rumors from someone who knew him.
Um,

1666
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:33.530
I think he keeps his sparring,
uh,
you know,
talking about striking,
right?
Yes.

1667
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.370
I'm never there for the striking.
Oh,
I've never had separate.
We don't,
I'm never,

1668
01:36:37.371 --> 01:36:40.330
I've never seen him.
Um,
uh,

1669
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:45.920
I'm never there for the striking.
I only show us when there's grappling his,
the,

1670
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:49.700
the amount of time that it took him into her cover in big bear.
He didn't,

1671
01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:52.070
we didn't bring anybody to spar like hardcore.

1672
01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:56.000
It was just like lights touching because of the needs.
Letting the knee heel.

1673
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.430
Oh no,
that a different fight.
I'm talking about the knee.

1674
01:36:58.431 --> 01:37:02.060
Remember you had the massive knee entry and then he had surgery and then what I

1675
01:37:02.061 --> 01:37:06.920
heard during the pedals fight.
Oh yeah,
no sparring.
No spine.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1676
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:10.730
Very light.
Very light.
Hmm.
Well I guess,
you know,

1677
01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:15.940
when you already world class you could do that and find a guy.
I mean,

1678
01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.740
he didn't want to fuck with it.
Wanting to make sure that nothing went wrong.

1679
01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.820
Get to the,
get to the fight.
It was that it was the right choice for sure.

1680
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.050
And when he showed up against pedis,
you looked like same old Tony.

1681
01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:29.120
He did that.
It was stunning.
Vicious.

1682
01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.460
You're talking about a catastrophic knee injury.

1683
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:35.630
And then six months later he's fighting a world class fighter and he's getting

1684
01:37:35.631 --> 01:37:39.080
his legs checked.
You know,
he got the,
that need check too.

1685
01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:42.050
We even worried at one point in time that he might be injured.

1686
01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.630
What makes Tony so good?
In my opinion,

1687
01:37:44.631 --> 01:37:49.500
just based on working with them is it seems that,
um,
you know,
at,

1688
01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:55.380
at the highest level,
high pressure fight,
people are,
aren't as,

1689
01:37:55.381 --> 01:37:56.214
uh,

1690
01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.810
<v 3>uh,
the more cautious.
They don't want to try and do anything stupid.</v>

1691
01:38:00.811 --> 01:38:03.750
They're not fucking just letting it swing and letting it go.

1692
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:06.000
Tony isn't like that.
Tony is,

1693
01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:08.610
people want to get to the point where they just unleash and they don't give a

1694
01:38:08.611 --> 01:38:12.000
fuck.
And there's a lot of fighters like that,
but Tony,
when he's in there,

1695
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:15.060
it's like,
like Nick Diaz,
they're not afraid to throw anything.

1696
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.500
You know what I mean?
He goes in there,

1697
01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:20.790
he'll throw two spinning elbows in a row and he's just having fun.

1698
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.710
It's like he's alive and he's having fun in there and he's,

1699
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:26.850
and on the ground,

1700
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.870
he's not going to be hesitant to do something wild and crazy.

1701
01:38:31.410 --> 01:38:32.580
That's just the way his man,

1702
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:37.460
and he thrives in the cage and there's zero hold back.
He's,
he's,

1703
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:40.770
he comes out guns a blazing the whole time.
Yeah,

1704
01:38:40.771 --> 01:38:43.830
they're both at the top of their game,
man,
that's for sure.
You know,

1705
01:38:43.831 --> 01:38:46.680
and Tony didn't miss a step when he got that knee injury,

1706
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.400
which was very impressive.
Even in striking was on point when he fought pedis.

1707
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:54.510
Yeah.
And even got tested.
He got clipped and pet has hurt him,
you know,

1708
01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:58.860
he knows how to survive.
Man.
He's a very unusual fighter man.

1709
01:38:58.861 --> 01:39:02.400
Very difficult to prepare for because studying,
always studying,

1710
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.680
always adding new weapons to his arsenal.

1711
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:08.130
Always adding something to is a workout routine.

1712
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:13.140
He's always adding shit.
He has the ability to focus more than anybody.
I know.

1713
01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:17.530
He his his ability to focus.
And you see that not only in,
you know,

1714
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:21.750
the striking aspect of his game or the rest of what you see it in the Jujitsu

1715
01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:25.680
and that's where I see it is he has so much focus.
He doesn't,

1716
01:39:25.681 --> 01:39:27.450
I don't have to reteach them shit.

1717
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.410
I will show them have very complicated transition of moves.
Like,
you know,

1718
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.140
in spider web doing the Ballinger break,

1719
01:39:34.410 --> 01:39:37.710
there's like four moves you've got to do.
You've got to fire them.

1720
01:39:37.711 --> 01:39:40.170
It's gotta be so smooth.
They can't be any fuck ups.

1721
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.380
And I show him this and after like four or five reps,
he's got it down.

1722
01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:47.580
And most people,
it takes,
it takes six months to get it down to understand it.

1723
01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.900
And he just can,
he just,
um,
doesn't take him long to learn shit.

1724
01:39:51.901 --> 01:39:56.040
Anything wrestling,
striking,
anything new,
he's down.
Uh,

1725
01:39:56.130 --> 01:39:58.530
but he doesn't forget it.
That's the most important thing.

1726
01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:02.420
He remembers all this shit.
And um,
you know,
it's,

1727
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:06.930
so who's working with him with striking?
A guy named Rashad used to,

1728
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.240
I think he was a like an Olympic hopeful back in the day.
Boxer.
Yeah.

1729
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:13.420
Most guys do that,
right?
Yeah.

1730
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:18.060
It seems like there's not a lot of guys who just use one for all striking.
Yeah.

1731
01:40:18.061 --> 01:40:19.500
He's got a bunch of people that train them.

1732
01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:23.400
He's got a couple of different strength and conditioning coaches.
Um,

1733
01:40:23.401 --> 01:40:25.680
he's got a whole crew man I got,
that's important.

1734
01:40:25.681 --> 01:40:28.290
And he's mostly bossing to really into recovery.

1735
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.240
Like he spends a serious time recovering.
He's got all these contraptions,

1736
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.350
you know,
those things that you can,

1737
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:39.150
they're like leg sleeves from a text and they inflate and he's on that all the

1738
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:43.320
time.
He's like,
yeah,
he's sh when it comes to rehab for any injury,
he's like,

1739
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.370
like a professional NFL player,
you know.
And um,

1740
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.200
ice baths,
like,
you know,
at massages.
He doesn't fuck around man.
He's,

1741
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:54.910
he's 100%

1742
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:58.840
<v 0>thinking about and doing something for the fight.
Usually just nonstop.</v>

1743
01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:03.520
He can go on for hours.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's fucking crazy matchup.

1744
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:07.130
But it's only the third fight.
I mean,
it's the third from the top,
you know,

1745
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:10.030
there's two championship fights on top of that.
That's crazy.

1746
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:13.420
That should be the headliner right there.
Come on,
man.

1747
01:41:13.421 --> 01:41:16.930
That fight's going to be nuts.
People going to go crazy for that.
She's great.

1748
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:21.070
But so Hutto and Marlin,
more eyes have to fight for the bantamweight title.

1749
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.820
That's a crazy fight too,
man.
So Hutto Mariah's that's the main event.

1750
01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:29.390
And then a Valentina Shevchenko and Jessica I for the,
uh,

1751
01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.820
women's flyway title.
So those are two world title fights.

1752
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.410
They have to have those.
At the top,

1753
01:41:35.411 --> 01:41:37.570
but that just shows you how fucking crazy the card is.

1754
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:41.860
The card from top to bottom.
It's just amazing.
Yeah,
it's going to be crazy.

1755
01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:42.820
Fucking him.
Jimmy,

1756
01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:48.150
Jimmy Rivera and Pyotr Jaan tied to advisee and blogged knee.

1757
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:53.570
I've enough you moving it while I was trying to read it.
Don't do the up,

1758
01:41:53.571 --> 01:41:58.540
bro.
That's rude.
Fuck up.
That dude's name tied to evolve as a animal.

1759
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.290
Those are,
that's a great fucking fight.
That guy is crazy.

1760
01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:06.610
That's that guy that drinks out of a shoe.
He ever see him do that.
He does.

1761
01:42:06.611 --> 01:42:10.810
Shoeys he pours beer into shoes and the other people's shoes to like tell

1762
01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:11.740
someone to take their shoes off.

1763
01:42:11.741 --> 01:42:15.520
He pours beer into their shoes and then drinks it.
Oh my God.
It's so disgusting.

1764
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.800
It's so foul.
Yeah.
I don't get it,
but I get it.

1765
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:23.560
I don't get it,
but I get it.
He likes to party.

1766
01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:28.870
He's like that dude in Talladega nights.
What the fuck's his name?

1767
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:34.000
Um,
the other guy.
John C.
Reilly.
Yeah.

1768
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:37.000
John Rise like party.
I like to party.

1769
01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:44.980
It likes to drink out of shoes.
Fuck it.
He's an animal.
I guess.
Like,

1770
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:48.790
I mean if you want to really show you don't give a fuck,

1771
01:42:48.791 --> 01:42:50.140
that's a good way to go about doing it.

1772
01:42:50.170 --> 01:42:53.590
Just grab a man's shoe and pour a beer and do it and drink it.
It's dirty,

1773
01:42:53.591 --> 01:42:55.840
sweaty feet have and fucking around.

1774
01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:59.650
Imagine if you died from that measure of someone's foot.

1775
01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:03.130
Fungus was so disgusting that even the alcohol didn't kill it.

1776
01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:08.320
It germinated inside your gut where foot fungus is never going to be like if,

1777
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.000
if there's venereal diseases,
right?

1778
01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.700
When we all know there are because you dirty bitch,
like what?
What?

1779
01:43:13.710 --> 01:43:15.070
What are you guys doing to each other?

1780
01:43:15.071 --> 01:43:18.280
You're both giving each other dirty fucking things with dirty things and that

1781
01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.900
diseases are weird,
right?

1782
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:23.650
People give each other disease this venereal diseases which are extra weird.

1783
01:43:23.770 --> 01:43:27.760
It's like,
oh,
you dirty people.
He gave each of these dirty,
dirty disease,

1784
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:31.210
but nature of says,
we don't like this nature.

1785
01:43:31.211 --> 01:43:35.920
Just let these sneaky little parasites and viruses and bacteria getting your

1786
01:43:35.921 --> 01:43:39.520
body.
What if there was an even more powerful one for people?
Sucked on feet?

1787
01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:43.120
What if it got into your gut?
Nature's like this guy is just too much of a freak.

1788
01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:47.070
We got to call them column for the herd if like if there was foot sucking

1789
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.350
diseases,
you know before you make out with someone,
you got to tell them,
hey,

1790
01:43:51.351 --> 01:43:55.070
I just want you to know I've got a foot socking disease.
So,
uh,
if you don't,

1791
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:58.850
maybe we shouldn't do this.
But Jamie,
what do you making faces for?

1792
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.850
Says you can get staff from doing this.
Of course you can.

1793
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:05.330
Science skins firms shoeys are really freaking dangerous,

1794
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:09.590
especially if you're rich.
Why is it more dangerous?
Yeah,
that's cliquey.

1795
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:13.310
But they try to get us with the clickbait.
Turns out you can get staffed.
Yeah,

1796
01:44:13.311 --> 01:44:14.960
you can get staff.
Don't do it.

1797
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.870
I don't get a science study to figure that out.
Yeah.
Because because the staff,

1798
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:25.460
Aurora's can cause toxins and these toxins are quite resistant to heat.

1799
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:29.410
They are quite resistant to the acidic environment when they can survive a

1800
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:32.270
protein breaking enzymes.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1801
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:36.230
If you drink from someone shoe containing staff and its toxins,
yes,

1802
01:44:36.231 --> 01:44:41.231
it can give you an acute gastro intestinitis fuck all that says.

1803
01:44:43.161 --> 01:44:45.890
But alcohol's a disaffected,
right?
Well,
yes,

1804
01:44:45.891 --> 01:44:50.090
but there's always still a risk of infection,
especially if you have lower abv,

1805
01:44:50.091 --> 01:44:52.430
alcohol by volume drinks as you'd expect.

1806
01:44:52.431 --> 01:44:56.900
Higher abv drinks like vodka do a much better job of rack or radicating
bacteria.

1807
01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.820
So yeah,
beer,
which is what they drank,

1808
01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:01.940
which is a low alcohol beer or low alcohol beverage.

1809
01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:07.580
What a fucked up way to die.
Die.
You've got to do shots and those things will,

1810
01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:11.060
shots are fine.
Oh my God.
People are crazy.

1811
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:15.950
But no one's happy with like taking it and leaving it where it is.

1812
01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:18.560
Everybody wants to take it to the next level.
You know,

1813
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:21.560
like everyone constantly like you want to one up somebody,

1814
01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:22.850
I'm going to drink out of the underwear,
bro.

1815
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.720
I'm gonna use your underwear as a fucking filter.
No dude are going to do undies.

1816
01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:30.530
They going to be ripping each other's underwear off and using them over a
filter.

1817
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.960
Put it over a glass and drink right through your underwear.

1818
01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.090
How did that cat coffee get found out that Kopi Luwak good idea because some

1819
01:45:38.091 --> 01:45:42.560
asshole decided to pick cat shit and find beans in it.
It's a,

1820
01:45:42.561 --> 01:45:46.260
it's a cat like animal,
right?
It's called a civet.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1821
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:49.700
You ever had that shit that Kopi Luwak coffee.
It's very expensive.

1822
01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:54.710
Tate and I got it once.
We were at a Gig in Florida.
Tate.
Yeah.

1823
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:58.040
It was like $100 a cup of coffee or something stupid.
It was really ridiculous.

1824
01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:02.840
Not that much.
Maybe 25 bucks.
I don't remember when he was bodyguards calm.

1825
01:46:02.890 --> 01:46:06.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
Back in the day.
That's the animal.
Look at that thing.

1826
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:08.450
So that thing eats the coffee beans.

1827
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:12.090
It shits them out and then people pull it out of the poop payday.

1828
01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:13.850
It looks like a little person.

1829
01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.810
Look the things baby like the thing for fantastic four.
It looks like his baby.

1830
01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.600
Yeah.
They pulled those beans out of the poop and then they uh,

1831
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:25.630
they dry them off and make coffee out of catch shit and a,

1832
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:30.410
it tastes delicious because what it is is the Diet.
Look at that.
That's gold,

1833
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:33.500
right?
There was gold coming out of that cat's ass hole.
We'll give that.

1834
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:37.290
That is a ridiculous,
you could just see that online.
Um,

1835
01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:41.780
taking a lar,
like if that was a person,
you'd be in jail,
right?
If you,

1836
01:46:41.781 --> 01:46:45.950
if you went and googled that person shitting on a log like that,
he'd be like,

1837
01:46:45.951 --> 01:46:48.770
you sick.
Fuck.
Long as it's an animal,

1838
01:46:48.771 --> 01:46:51.210
it's to look at their shit and even mine it,

1839
01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:54.570
they mind their shit for beans.

1840
01:46:55.290 --> 01:47:00.290
The idea is that the digestive enzymes from the civets body breakdown,

1841
01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:04.590
the,
uh,
the beans,
the coffee beans,
that's the idea.

1842
01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:09.630
And you liked it.
It was okay,
aren't you?
Wasn't better.

1843
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:13.500
It's not bad out here for the guests,
it's not better.

1844
01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:18.120
The idea is that it's supposed to be smoother and smoother.
This catch it,

1845
01:47:18.121 --> 01:47:19.590
coffee smoother.
I don't know,
man.

1846
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:23.040
I don't necessarily think it really is smoother.
It's just different.

1847
01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:24.173
Some weird shit.

1848
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:28.200
I wonder if you could just eat the cat shit just like that without cleaning it

1849
01:47:28.201 --> 01:47:31.560
off if you were really nasty.
Yeah.

1850
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:35.850
The natives probably just used to eat the cat should directly.
It probably did,

1851
01:47:35.851 --> 01:47:39.620
but I think you need to have energy.
You probably need a boil it.
That's why a,

1852
01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:43.260
when you're making coffee in that boiling water probably kills all the bad
stuff.

1853
01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.900
You know,
they blow.
Did the Indians boil shit.
I want to know.

1854
01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:52.830
I don't know who invented that shit and how long it's been around that shit

1855
01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:56.090
literal.
Literally who invented that coffee.

1856
01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.610
<v 2>Okay.
How long it's been around spinner.
I'm looking at it right now.
Wikipedia.</v>

1857
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.230
Since like the 18 hundreds,

1858
01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:05.360
they noticed that these particular animals were eating specific cherries or

1859
01:48:05.361 --> 01:48:08.480
whatever,
that they were leaving around and that they were going on digested.

1860
01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:11.900
So at some point they decided to clean it off and see how it tasted,
I guess.

1861
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:13.783
Fucking risk.

1862
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:16.580
<v 0>Hmm.
Um,</v>

1863
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:20.090
I was listening to my friend Ryan Callahan's podcast today.

1864
01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:25.120
It's a cow's weekend review and he was talking about this animal that they,

1865
01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.410
um,
this bird rather that people eat and they drowned.

1866
01:48:29.411 --> 01:48:33.830
This bird in brandy,
they take this little tiny bird.

1867
01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:38.860
Each one of them is like just a few ounces and they drowned them in brandy.

1868
01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:42.620
And then when you eat them,
you eat them whole,
you need everything.

1869
01:48:42.621 --> 01:48:47.120
The guts you eat,
the tissue,
the skin.
That's,

1870
01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:51.440
that's,
that's where it is.
Um,
what is the name of it?
What,
how do,

1871
01:48:51.441 --> 01:48:56.420
how do I pronounce it for Dalon Bunting Order Lawn.
And so when you eat it,

1872
01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:00.020
you put a Napkin over your head.

1873
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:02.930
Traditionally when they eat it and as they eat it.

1874
01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:07.220
Bordain was the first one to tell me about this shit that,
oh no,
it was Duncan.

1875
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:09.800
Duncan Trussell was the first person to tell me about the shit and the suddenly

1876
01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:14.000
Bourdain love,
they soak the bird in brand.
They drown it.
Okay.

1877
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:17.150
They drown it in brandy and then they cook it somehow or another.
But anyway,

1878
01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:19.430
go back to that picture where those guys are eating it.
Where you could see the,

1879
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:21.500
go back to the picture with the,
yeah.

1880
01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:23.720
See how they have those things over their head.

1881
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:28.870
They put these napkins over their head to taking the aromas and to trap the

1882
01:49:29.991 --> 01:49:34.460
aromas.
And they also do it to hide their face from God.
Those,

1883
01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:38.630
the idea.
Yeah.
Kind of people are these,
I think it's most,

1884
01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:42.550
I think it's Europeans.
I think it's,
uh,
something that in,

1885
01:49:42.551 --> 01:49:47.230
in France it's popular,
it's popular dish.
And,
um,
it's,

1886
01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:52.020
it's endangered.
Not endangered now,
but there.
Yeah,

1887
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:53.260
that's okay.
Order lawns.

1888
01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:57.480
Could Francis crew was food be back in the menu as French chefs lobby for order

1889
01:49:57.481 --> 01:50:00.010
lawn to be reintroduced onto menus.

1890
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:04.120
We explain why cooking the rare and delicate song bird is so controversial.

1891
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:07.150
So that's even grosser,
right?
It's a song bird.

1892
01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.320
Like how they named it a song bird not,
it's not a little tiny dinosaur.
No,
no,
no.

1893
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:14.800
It's a song bird.
It just wants to sing for you.

1894
01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:19.270
Make the woods bright.
Uh,
tweet,
tweet,
tweet.
Nah Man,

1895
01:50:19.271 --> 01:50:23.380
it's a weird little tiny animal says why is it illegal to cook and kill an

1896
01:50:23.381 --> 01:50:28.381
ordeal on the R S P B list their status as vulnerable.

1897
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:31.330
And throughout the 1970s in 1980s,

1898
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:35.380
numbers in France declined dramatically as poachers caught vast numbers to

1899
01:50:35.381 --> 01:50:39.160
supply restaurants where the bird has long been considered rare and expensive

1900
01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:43.390
delicacy.
Some restaurants would charge over 50 pounds for the dish.

1901
01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:47.860
What does that in,
um,
is that euros or pounds,
pounds,
pounds.

1902
01:50:48.190 --> 01:50:52.420
What do you think that costs?
What's 50 pounds?
Is that like 100 bucks?
Not quite,

1903
01:50:52.421 --> 01:50:54.040
but something like that.

1904
01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:59.340
Frances League for the protection of birds claimed a order lawn numbers plunged

1905
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:04.531
30% between 97 and 2007 as many as 1,500 poachers catching an estimated 30,000

1906
01:51:06.251 --> 01:51:09.850
live birds a year.
So they're just decimating these fucking things.

1907
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:15.040
Um,
the method of capturing,
killing them as what's fucked up about it.

1908
01:51:15.041 --> 01:51:18.750
So the hunters catch the birds using traps in the fields.
Uh,

1909
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:21.280
they're kept in cages,
uh,

1910
01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:24.760
encouraging them to gorge on grain in order to double their size.

1911
01:51:24.761 --> 01:51:29.260
And it said the Roman emperors stabbed out their eyes in order to make the birds

1912
01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:33.760
think it was night.
Making them eat even more.
Oh,
okay.

1913
01:51:33.761 --> 01:51:35.770
Here it goes.
And then how were they killed?

1914
01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.320
This is where the squeamish look away.
What is the name of his websites?

1915
01:51:38.321 --> 01:51:41.470
We give People Telegraph autograft from the Telegraph.

1916
01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:45.190
What does the name of the article?
Well,
we'll tell,
we'll say it at the end.
Uh,

1917
01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:47.980
how were they killed?
Says this is where the squeamish need to look away.

1918
01:51:47.981 --> 01:51:49.120
Traditionally in France,

1919
01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:54.310
the fat and little birds are drowned in a vat of our mock neck.

1920
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:58.150
I guess that's like a tiger cognac or something.
What does that are magnetic?

1921
01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.400
Probably you're probably dead on with.
Okay.

1922
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:06.030
Managing to snuff out their lives in marinate them at the same time,

1923
01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:10.840
killing two birds with one glug as it were.
It says here in the article,

1924
01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:15.520
French chefs argue that it's not a bad way to die in quotes.

1925
01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:16.354
What the fuck?

1926
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:20.260
But I suppose it might be less cruel than throwing a live lobster into a pot of

1927
01:52:20.261 --> 01:52:23.080
boiling water anyway,
so that's how they drown.

1928
01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:26.050
They drown them and then they cook them and then you eat the whole fucking
thing.

1929
01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:30.280
Bones and all and the bones puncture your mouth and shit.
And that's part of it.

1930
01:52:30.281 --> 01:52:34.660
Like you taste your own blood as you're eating these fucking things.
Yeah.

1931
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.260
People are weird,
man.
You leave them alone for long enough.

1932
01:52:38.770 --> 01:52:40.210
Let him get drunk and buy things.

1933
01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.900
Reminds me of that Andrew Schultz bit that he put on Youtube,
which one?

1934
01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.980
The eating and he goes,
if you eat ass,

1935
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:49.510
you should not complain about other people's food.
None of my friends,

1936
01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:52.700
my friend told me,
he goes,
hey,
you know in Thailand they crickets.
He goes,

1937
01:52:52.701 --> 01:52:55.790
I eat ass cause they're eating crickets because they have no food.

1938
01:52:56.150 --> 01:53:01.060
My refrigerator's full.
So true too.

1939
01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.440
He's so good,
dude.
He's,
he's so good.

1940
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.140
That's my new favorite dude.
This,
he's awesome.
Really,
really nice guy.

1941
01:53:09.141 --> 01:53:13.220
Too dirty as hell.
Yeah.
You meet him at went next time he's at the store.

1942
01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:15.920
The love him.
He's a real comic.
It's a real deal.

1943
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:17.720
Oh he's high level is high level.

1944
01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:21.080
What is his driver Tony to try and Tony and we're listening to Andrew Schultz.

1945
01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:23.270
Oh that's cool.
Yeah,
I love that guy.
He's great.

1946
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:27.920
And he also is one of the few that is doing the youtube thing now.

1947
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:32.390
Why you decided to release all this shit on Youtube?
Yeah,
yeah.
Thank God.

1948
01:53:33.130 --> 01:53:37.020
Giving me some,
you know,
entertainment very well.
It's also very smart for him.

1949
01:53:37.021 --> 01:53:40.040
I mean he's getting millions and millions of views on youtube.
It's blown up.

1950
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:44.180
Yeah.
Oh for sure.
Yeah.
He's killing it.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
you know,

1951
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:49.181
to have it available anytime they say that kids watch 50% of Netflix on their

1952
01:53:51.051 --> 01:53:55.850
phone,
50%,
at least that was,
I think that was the numbers they gave me.

1953
01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:57.073
Um,

1954
01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:01.640
I think that was what they said about my special 50% across the board for what

1955
01:54:01.641 --> 01:54:06.290
it takes.
Take your pick,
remove Netflix,
youtube,
50% twitch,
50% website,

1956
01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:10.640
50%.
But that's the,
the switcheroo though it was 50% watch on their phone.

1957
01:54:10.641 --> 01:54:13.430
That could be watching on the computer.
But how many of them watched on the TV?

1958
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.890
Like with Youtube it's probably a pretty small percentage,
right?

1959
01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:17.900
Switches because they,
they're tracking,

1960
01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.670
they stay splinter it between like an Xbox or ps four what?

1961
01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.450
Smart TV or watch youtube on my TV near that shit.
Yeah,
I do.

1962
01:54:26.451 --> 01:54:29.750
I do that sometimes I mirror that and I also,
there's a,

1963
01:54:29.751 --> 01:54:32.870
youtube is one of the other apps.
It's built into the TV I bought.

1964
01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:35.000
So you can get Netflix right from your TV.

1965
01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:38.780
You don't have to have an apple TV and youtube right from your TV.
It's um,

1966
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:42.650
it's interesting how big it is now.
It's so big.
Youtube is gigantic.

1967
01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:44.820
They got a bunch of movies on there now.
I just,

1968
01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.750
I was watching it on my TV and just like scrolling through to see what I could,

1969
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:50.310
what it was going to give me and it's like you're making their own with ads.

1970
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:52.910
They were making their own movies but it's weird to like,

1971
01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.690
it seems like you don't know where to search.
Like what did,

1972
01:54:55.710 --> 01:54:58.760
did you just go into the search bar and just search?
Just type things up.

1973
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:02.200
I see my subscription,
I subscribed to certain people and I just go to this.

1974
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:04.910
This is not what it means.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know I do that too.

1975
01:55:04.911 --> 01:55:07.550
But I mean like if they make a movie like they were making movies,

1976
01:55:07.551 --> 01:55:08.600
like how do you find that movie?

1977
01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.450
They got a pop up different right in your face.
They own that shit.

1978
01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.950
But if it's a movie that they make,

1979
01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:19.820
like I wonder how I would like to know the numbers.
Like have they,

1980
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:22.640
how many times did they done that?
Cause they made youtube originals,
right?

1981
01:55:22.641 --> 01:55:25.790
Like they made their,
they finance their own.
Most of them are shows though,
like,

1982
01:55:25.791 --> 01:55:26.740
uh,
like the,

1983
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:29.720
the one that I know has done the best is that Cobra Kai could second the second

1984
01:55:29.721 --> 01:55:31.850
or third season.
I think it's not weird though,

1985
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:34.310
that they get into the production side of it.

1986
01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.060
Like they're already a place where people produce things and then put them on

1987
01:55:38.061 --> 01:55:40.160
youtube and youtube was like,
yeah,
we're going to make her own shit.

1988
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:44.190
But then they become something different.
Right,
because they're

1989
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:44.580
<v 1>going to,</v>

1990
01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:48.320
they're going to favor their own stuff above your stuff if you make a movie too.

1991
01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:52.100
Yeah.
They haven't made like why bother?
I think they just want to,

1992
01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:53.880
I mean I think that's what every company,

1993
01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:58.530
every company gets into this position where they have to constantly expand.

1994
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.710
They've got to constantly be kicking ass,
you know,
and,
and no,

1995
01:56:01.711 --> 01:56:03.060
no one wants to be stagnant.

1996
01:56:03.061 --> 01:56:06.960
They don't want the quarterly earnings to be the same every quarter.
That's us.

1997
01:56:06.961 --> 01:56:10.410
That's a bad sign.
They want to be out there killing it.
Right.

1998
01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.780
They'll take take like that.
Like every company thinks like that.

1999
01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.810
[inaudible] finals is currently sponsored by a Youtube TV.

2000
01:56:16.130 --> 01:56:21.060
That's on normal TV.
They're broadcasting watch TV on Youtube TV,

2001
01:56:21.061 --> 01:56:23.070
which is pretty counterintuitive.
I have it.

2002
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.020
I have youtube TV every now and then you need to watch something on a regular

2003
01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:30.900
channel.
I use it once every eight months.

2004
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:34.890
Barely pay like 50 bucks a month for it.
Never use it.
Well,

2005
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:38.820
it's so much different though than the network because anybody can put their

2006
01:56:38.821 --> 01:56:41.520
shit up.
That's where it gets so weird.

2007
01:56:41.521 --> 01:56:43.950
It's like this is all so new and if it's,

2008
01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:48.150
we'll say youtube is our TV channels that you could watch through youtube

2009
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.140
channel four channel.
Oh,
that's not what I'm talking about.

2010
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:56.130
What I'm talking about is youtube originals.
Okay.
There youtube creating homes.

2011
01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:59.970
Yeah.
Those are different things.
But um,
it's just

2012
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:03.420
what percentage of the views,

2013
01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:08.350
what percentage of the eyeballs of America does youtube have all of them?

2014
01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.990
Is it a hot,
I mean,
are you kidding?
How,
okay,
let's just go with the low number.

2015
01:57:13.050 --> 01:57:16.680
Giant.
What does the would,
the low number is how many people every day?

2016
01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:20.280
Don't watch youtube.
I watch youtube several times a day.

2017
01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:21.750
But what's the percentage of people,

2018
01:57:21.751 --> 01:57:24.210
if you had to guess that don't use youtube at all?

2019
01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:29.990
10 I would guess that maybe they probably have 90% of the people's eyeballs.

2020
01:57:31.190 --> 01:57:32.850
It's like the number it technically,

2021
01:57:32.851 --> 01:57:36.720
it's the number two search engine on the Internet as far as I've read too.

2022
01:57:36.721 --> 01:57:39.030
That hurts my bigger thing and all that.
Like it's,

2023
01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:42.480
it hurts my brain when you stop and think about how many fucking people must be

2024
01:57:42.481 --> 01:57:47.460
watching youtube videos around the world.
And it's just a company,
but it's like,

2025
01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:52.140
so then the,
then they're,
they're,
they're a network sort of,

2026
01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:55.590
but you are,
you're allowed to just have terms and conditions.

2027
01:57:55.591 --> 01:57:58.500
So you're allowed to upload and then they have to monitor your shit and make

2028
01:57:58.501 --> 01:58:01.740
sure you're not putting anything horrible up.
No.
Isis beheading something crazy.

2029
01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.860
You're like,
what numbers are you talking about?

2030
01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:06.320
How even looking at all this stuff,

2031
01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:11.360
one of the funniest videos on genre videos on youtube are Japanese.

2032
01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:13.720
They're supposed to be,
uh,

2033
01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.550
instructionals on Japanese massage.

2034
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:21.480
It's like supposed to be an instructional.
This is,
it's all about instructional,

2035
01:58:21.481 --> 01:58:26.370
but it's not,
they take it as far as you can go for youtube.
Oh,

2036
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:31.430
you can't go with becomes a porn almost while most companies you'll show

2037
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:34.690
titties.
No educationally.
But no,
but they do.

2038
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:37.860
You could find loudest showed titties and then there's laid out the nipple's.

2039
01:58:37.890 --> 01:58:41.670
Now there's youtube or naked chicks just just tie.
Go to youtube.
Naked chicks.

2040
01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:42.070
Boom.

2041
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.820
<v 0>Yeah,
he's talked about this before.
Here's my question.
Imagine if they had porn.</v>

2042
01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:50.680
If they got right to the part where the people bone,

2043
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:56.070
like why to the par and then they just gave you like outlines.

2044
01:58:57.190 --> 01:59:00.370
Like from then out,
all you see is like outlines of bodies moving.

2045
01:59:00.371 --> 01:59:05.370
You don't see any real dick or any real vagina.
BC outlines.
Yeah.

2046
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:09.610
And dicks and vaginas feed up in the air and I bet that's all over youtube.

2047
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:11.110
I wonder if they could do that.

2048
01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:13.750
You only got changed a couple of letters and you're on a real website that does

2049
01:59:13.751 --> 01:59:18.160
that for real.
Like like UJIs or your porn.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2050
01:59:18.161 --> 01:59:21.880
But I'm saying on youtube,
like what other terms and conditions is there.

2051
01:59:21.881 --> 01:59:26.881
Like could you get right to the port of people actually having sex and then just

2052
01:59:27.551 --> 01:59:30.550
all of a sudden just becomes not even an animation just becomes outlines.

2053
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:33.080
You see people kissing loans,
they don't outline dicks.

2054
01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:35.380
Honestly don't have fake dicks and vaginas like tight shots.

2055
01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:40.480
You go tight shots of the chest,
back shoulder,
how fuck Blah in all,

2056
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:41.920
all of it is just outlines.

2057
01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:46.150
Just a black screen with like white outlines of bodies on a bed.

2058
01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:51.180
Is the audio audio illegal?
That's a good question.
Yeah.
Is the audio,

2059
01:59:53.650 --> 01:59:56.860
is that illegal?
Is that okay?
What's the terms of conditions for you?

2060
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:59.350
You can do a lot of stuff,
but I don't know at what point.

2061
01:59:59.351 --> 02:00:02.710
A couple of years ago they added,
I like age restriction,
right?
Sort of thing.

2062
02:00:02.711 --> 02:00:05.620
So you could probably do that but it'll get marked 18 and older only or

2063
02:00:05.621 --> 02:00:08.290
something.
Well,
here's the reason why I ask.
Twitter has porn,

2064
02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:12.580
straight up porn and I asked Jack Dorsey about it and he's like,
yeah,

2065
02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:15.580
we Twitter allows porn.
They allow porn.
Wow.

2066
02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:18.820
So you can be flipping through and someone's just got straight up.

2067
02:00:18.821 --> 02:00:23.821
Paul Coal Porn on the biggest mean it's gotta be,

2068
02:00:25.210 --> 02:00:29.500
if not the biggest social media platform on the planet earth.
It's top two,
right?

2069
02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:33.600
If it's not number one,
I'm never right.
I'm never on Twitter.

2070
02:00:33.601 --> 02:00:36.130
What is his number once Facebook,
Facebook's number one.

2071
02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.390
Are you on Twitter by just put things up there.
Read feeds,

2072
02:00:40.391 --> 02:00:44.140
occasionally read someone's feet if they got they post.
Interesting stuff.

2073
02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:46.660
I think snapchat's even harder,
but I avoided it for them.

2074
02:00:46.661 --> 02:00:49.840
I just don't have the time and I only have time for Instagram.

2075
02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:54.040
Snapchat as higher.
We'll either way it's closed.
Either way.
It's John,

2076
02:00:55.810 --> 02:00:58.660
it's giant.
I mean it's enormous and they allow porn,

2077
02:00:58.690 --> 02:01:03.010
which is kinda crazy cause like I know they're not as big as youtube in terms of

2078
02:01:03.011 --> 02:01:05.020
like total minutes watched of things.

2079
02:01:05.021 --> 02:01:08.560
And the thing is that most of what Twitter is his text,

2080
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:11.880
most of it,
you know,
so when they have porn it's not,

2081
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:15.880
it's like a fraction of what the whole thing is.
Whereas if youtube had porn,

2082
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:18.580
it would very quickly become most of youtube.

2083
02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.730
Like if youtube just had porn,

2084
02:01:23.110 --> 02:01:25.330
people would blow a fucking gasket.

2085
02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:28.180
Cause kids are on youtube all the time.

2086
02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.380
Did you start and get on Youtube and looking things?
Somebody who's,

2087
02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:35.320
I'll show him but he's not.
Yeah,
he's like,
he's too young to get on the Internet.

2088
02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:37.150
They look at little kids stuff.

2089
02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.650
There's a lot of little kid content and that was one of the ways that people

2090
02:01:40.651 --> 02:01:43.280
were getting kids to watch so they can make ad revenue,

2091
02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.800
see those weird fucking videos they would find.

2092
02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:49.110
So like kids would be watching like Wiley,
coyote cartoons.

2093
02:01:49.111 --> 02:01:53.420
So they watched some Mickey mouse type cartoons and then all of a sudden it

2094
02:01:53.421 --> 02:01:55.570
would be like these cartoons,

2095
02:01:55.571 --> 02:01:58.790
superheroes that were babies and they were getting drunk and they would fall and

2096
02:01:58.791 --> 02:02:02.830
cut their head open.
It was like,
what the fuck is this?
And there was like,
ah,

2097
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.700
hundreds of 'em and they had made it like with a formula just so that they could

2098
02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:12.260
catch kids in these algorithms that recommend the next video and play the next

2099
02:02:12.261 --> 02:02:16.520
video.
So it eventually get to their video because it would say,
you know,

2100
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:19.940
like someone from frozen with Spiderman,

2101
02:02:19.941 --> 02:02:22.730
like and have those names in the title Elsa,

2102
02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.630
Elsa from frozen and Spiderman.
That's like there's a large,

2103
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.150
something happened that we don't want that we missed.

2104
02:02:29.151 --> 02:02:32.300
I've heard about this recently too.
That's why I was actually pulling it up.

2105
02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:34.390
This is a really large youtube channel in there.

2106
02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:39.290
There's some sort of like inside joke going on to look at the Spiderman 10

2107
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.320
million,

2108
02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.320
870,872 views.

2109
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:50.690
What the fuck?
That's so many views.
If listen,

2110
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:54.420
if a television show on CBS got that,
they'd be doing fucking backflips.

2111
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:56.690
It'd be like,
look at all the views we got.
This is amazing.

2112
02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.140
This is Spiderman and Elsa.
Yeah.
I don't know.
There's just something else up.

2113
02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:05.720
But yeah,
so it's not like a dad to do that with a title,

2114
02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:09.290
a trademark spider putting the Spiderman,
find all of them.

2115
02:03:09.291 --> 02:03:11.300
They can't find all of them.
They try.
They,

2116
02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:15.560
I think they take some of them down AI that does that.
I think so.
Yeah,

2117
02:03:16.570 --> 02:03:18.590
sure.
Spiderman,
Spiderman.

2118
02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:21.710
But I think they're getting away with that because they were in a costume.

2119
02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.960
I think maybe you could get away with wearing a costume.

2120
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.360
I don't know where those laws change fits.

2121
02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.360
How many much of parodies or spider man is like at this point.
Public domain,

2122
02:03:29.361 --> 02:03:30.980
the name or something.
No Way.

2123
02:03:30.981 --> 02:03:33.230
Cause then other people would be banging out Spiderman movies.

2124
02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:36.980
You imagine that if someone didn't own Spiderman of anybody can make their own

2125
02:03:36.981 --> 02:03:40.940
Spiderman movie.
Spiderman was just like an archetype hero.
But you know what?

2126
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.630
Maybe there's some,
cause you can put out a video,

2127
02:03:44.631 --> 02:03:47.300
like if you wanted to talk some shit on Burt Reynolds or whatever,

2128
02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:50.390
you could put Burt Reynolds and they can't,
that's illegal.
Right?

2129
02:03:50.391 --> 02:03:53.910
Just putting people's names on the title.
Right.
But you,

2130
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.920
but that's not what that is.

2131
02:03:54.921 --> 02:03:58.610
That's like they're making a video using copywritten characters that someone

2132
02:03:58.611 --> 02:04:01.910
created like Elsa from frozen and Spiderman for sure.

2133
02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:06.140
I feel like they probably got away with it because they were dressed up as them

2134
02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:08.690
rather than like drawing them.

2135
02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:12.320
Like if they had footage from the movie or animation,

2136
02:04:12.321 --> 02:04:14.430
they probably all have that shit copywritten.
Yeah.

2137
02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:16.160
But you could probably get away with,

2138
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:20.750
if you have your own script and you make some stupid play with Elsen Spiderman,

2139
02:04:20.751 --> 02:04:25.610
you'd probably get away with that.
I don't know though,
man.
It's,
it's weird.

2140
02:04:25.611 --> 02:04:29.340
They're all like trying to figure out what you can and can't do.
You know,
what,

2141
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:30.410
what,
what can you not?

2142
02:04:30.411 --> 02:04:33.810
And so these companies that are making these weird fuck and that,
that was a,

2143
02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:37.740
a people one where there's people,
most of them that I saw,
they,

2144
02:04:37.741 --> 02:04:39.420
they purge them more animated.

2145
02:04:39.810 --> 02:04:42.630
They're a weird animations where it was always a baby and the baby would fall

2146
02:04:42.631 --> 02:04:44.310
and cut their head.
It was fucked up.

2147
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:46.410
Like the same image would happen over and over again.

2148
02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:48.300
And there's these websites that are analyzing it and they were like,

2149
02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:52.320
what the fuck is this?
Like,
why is this baby fall?
And cut his head?

2150
02:04:52.321 --> 02:04:56.640
And like all these different versions of this same sort of story with different

2151
02:04:56.641 --> 02:04:59.130
characters.
It was just like,
uh,
like,
uh,

2152
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.180
they had a pattern that they could stick it into.
So whatever the character was,

2153
02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.750
was Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck or they're always drinking.

2154
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:10.020
And they fall and hit their fucking hat.
It's weird,
weird shit,

2155
02:05:10.290 --> 02:05:12.660
but they would get millions and millions and millions of views.

2156
02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:16.140
So someone was raking in the dough from advertising revenue from that.

2157
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:21.410
I had a friend who dated a girl that ended up coming from a family of this.

2158
02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:24.600
Whoa.
Yeah,
broke up at there.
It's a long story,

2159
02:05:24.601 --> 02:05:26.670
but it's a very interesting story that I want to do.

2160
02:05:26.671 --> 02:05:29.460
They have a direct line to Satan know they broke up.

2161
02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:32.310
They were together for a couple of years and shit came out.
She's like,

2162
02:05:32.311 --> 02:05:36.540
multi-personality Satan,
his family father,
all that shit.

2163
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:39.780
And then they broke.
He broke up with her naturally and,

2164
02:05:39.781 --> 02:05:43.920
but they kind of kept in contact and the last he heard that she got a job

2165
02:05:43.921 --> 02:05:47.280
programming children's TV at a large company.

2166
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:48.980
You anyone to say the company

2167
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:54.120
is a pretty good friend of mine.
He's,
he's not bullshitting,

2168
02:05:55.570 --> 02:05:57.120
but that's scary.

2169
02:05:57.470 --> 02:06:01.710
Did you see that preacher the got confronted by inside edition?
What does,

2170
02:06:01.711 --> 02:06:06.360
his name's Copeland.
Kenneth Copeland Brow.
It's whole Arius.

2171
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:07.480
I don't know how much we,

2172
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:11.910
we can show this because this will absolutely get us pulled.
Um,

2173
02:06:12.210 --> 02:06:15.030
this dude got confronted by inside edition.

2174
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:19.230
They're doing these stories on these preachers that use the donations from their

2175
02:06:19.231 --> 02:06:23.760
flock to buy private jets and live like a bar.
And so she asks,
um,

2176
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:24.421
you know,

2177
02:06:24.421 --> 02:06:27.930
is it true that you said that you don't want to fly commercial because you don't

2178
02:06:27.931 --> 02:06:31.050
want to be stuck in a tube with demons and he,
first of all,

2179
02:06:31.051 --> 02:06:34.830
he got caught off guard and he kind of was chilled at first,

2180
02:06:35.130 --> 02:06:38.750
but then he got mad at her when she asked that same question again.
He said,
no,

2181
02:06:38.751 --> 02:06:42.210
we're not,
didn't and don't you bring it up and don't you say I did.

2182
02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:44.690
That's what he says.
And he points at her and this push,

2183
02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:49.590
pull it ahead a little bit because,
uh,
this is the full version of this.
Pull it,

2184
02:06:49.650 --> 02:06:53.670
there's a that right before that,
right before that,
right before that.

2185
02:06:54.630 --> 02:06:58.440
Like she asks him,
what is he an evangelist?
Yeah.

2186
02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:00.960
Yeah.
He was a big tech.

2187
02:07:00.961 --> 02:07:03.720
Now we can't because we'll get pulled off of youtube for sure.

2188
02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:08.160
But he gets really fucking mad at her.
She said,
but didn't you say,

2189
02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:12.300
didn't you say that you can't fly commercial because the tube is filled with

2190
02:07:12.301 --> 02:07:14.310
demons?
Do you think that people are demons?

2191
02:07:14.311 --> 02:07:19.311
Like this lady has balls of steel cause this guy's giving her the crazy eyes and

2192
02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:21.690
he's saying all kinds of crazy shit to certain questions.

2193
02:07:21.691 --> 02:07:24.630
She also asked about like why did,
why did you buy it?
And he's like,

2194
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:28.410
could be cause he made it so cheap.
Yeah,
it's like $980 million.

2195
02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:33.450
He made it so cheap.
It's like I couldn't say no.
That's what he says.

2196
02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:39.250
Ty was best guy made it so cheap.
That's it.

2197
02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:42.940
We're seeing it right there.
I had to buy it.
Yeah,
you can't.

2198
02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.670
Can't play it unfortunately,
but play it right after that.

2199
02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:49.210
Now this is where she asks him again.
He's getting frustrated with her.

2200
02:07:49.450 --> 02:07:53.800
This is where she asked him again about demons.
Now watch him get mad here.

2201
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:58.720
Hold up.
But you can't play it because if you get paid,
if they fucking hear it,

2202
02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:03.510
they hear it.
They'll yank us.
Don't talk to Joe.
Joe Do what?

2203
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.520
Jamie [inaudible] doesn't matter man.

2204
02:08:06.521 --> 02:08:09.670
It's whoever owns this content don't play any of the audio.

2205
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:13.450
So he gets mad at her and she,
she's about to say it.
She's going to go,

2206
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:18.280
but I'm sorry but didn't you say,
but didn't you say right before?
Yep.

2207
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:21.550
Right there.
So watch this.
She goes,
don't you say that they were demons?
No,

2208
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:26.740
look at this.
Don't you say that?
I did.
Look at that.
Look at that Bro.

2209
02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:29.620
That's intense.
And then he tries to charmer and he tries this trauma.

2210
02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:34.860
That to me is what I would imagine a demon would look like if you cornered it,

2211
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:39.360
like be realistically.
Tell me back up,
back up right there.

2212
02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:41.340
There's a little bit before that but a little bit before it will.

2213
02:08:41.341 --> 02:08:45.070
He's actually angry a little bit before that.
Watch when he gets actually angry.

2214
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.980
Like if if you taught the demons were real,

2215
02:08:48.250 --> 02:08:50.380
what would you think that they would behave like?
Wow.

2216
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:55.180
They would just pretend to be people be all slippery.
What's happening here?

2217
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:58.180
I just frozen backups so we could see them do it though.

2218
02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:01.780
Back up so we can see them do it.
See right here,
she asked him to watch this.

2219
02:09:01.781 --> 02:09:06.580
Watch this.
No,
don't say that.
I did.
And then watch this smile,

2220
02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:13.810
smile.
Just let it play.
Stop fucking around.
Watch this.

2221
02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:19.030
Look at that face.
Oh,

2222
02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:22.780
your friend again.
I'm just an ass preacher.
His hand looks like that.

2223
02:09:22.781 --> 02:09:27.180
Hobbit folk who looking at early,
his nails are long as fuck.
Just like say.

2224
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:32.600
I would imagine Satan's none of a manicure,
Eddie.
He thought,
no,

2225
02:09:32.850 --> 02:09:36.700
no,
it's,
you've got to look and evil and God,
that dude caught a sweet loophole.

2226
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:40.600
Tax exempt status.
That's what's really interesting about churches.

2227
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.640
Tax exempt baby.
They're doing the government's work.
The government's like,

2228
02:09:45.641 --> 02:09:48.640
you're doing such a good job of keeping these people in line.
Here you go.
Free,

2229
02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:51.970
free.
No taxes,
bro.
You're good.
You're good.

2230
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.080
Like imagine the government looking at televangelists going,
well seems legit.

2231
02:09:56.110 --> 02:09:59.800
Your definitely of the Lord's a words in mind and I definitely not making a ton

2232
02:09:59.801 --> 02:10:04.360
of money in the loophole,
so yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Keep that tax exempt status.

2233
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:08.590
Seems good.
Seems super solid.
Imagine.

2234
02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:11.860
Imagine that like somewhere someone must have had that conversation,

2235
02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:18.250
whether or not they should have tax exempt status.
Like at what point in time,

2236
02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.270
you know,
like how about the Catholic Church?
How many sex scandals,

2237
02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.990
how many pedophiles scandals does it take before you lose tax exempt status?

2238
02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.970
Is there like a million?
How many cases?
How many cases do you need?

2239
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:34.040
I get what point in time do you go,
maybe you

2240
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.840
<v 1>guys should fucking at least pay taxes.
You know,
maybe that's the deal.</v>

2241
02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:42.320
They cut.
You don't go to jail for the kids,

2242
02:10:42.321 --> 02:10:44.990
but you got to start paying taxes.
Wow.

2243
02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:47.420
They're not prosecuting him because people aren't screaming for it.

2244
02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:50.600
What's really interesting is that if you look at some of the things that people

2245
02:10:50.601 --> 02:10:54.560
are really rallying about today,
what you would call it,
social justice warriors,

2246
02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.460
people are rallying around so many different causes.
Those,

2247
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:00.590
those people that are rallying around all these causes,

2248
02:11:00.591 --> 02:11:04.310
supporting and Tivo doing this,
you know,
protecting this and going after that.

2249
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:08.340
Well they're not doing is going after that church.

2250
02:11:09.090 --> 02:11:12.270
How come they're not shouting from the,
if you really want justice,

2251
02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:14.550
if you really want to do good in the world,

2252
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:19.760
when you want to stop the pedophiles,
when you want to stop that,
if you didn't,

2253
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:23.480
you don't see that.
It's too scary for people so big.

2254
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:26.270
They've got their own country,
the Vatican's basically a country.

2255
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.580
They got their own passport.

2256
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:30.410
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

2257
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:32.840
<v 1>it's dark.
It's dark.
When people look like they,</v>

2258
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:35.750
they feel like they're doing progress and then do you not stop in that?

2259
02:11:35.751 --> 02:11:39.470
You're not.
You're not like your concern is what?
What's your concern?

2260
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:44.120
The sculpture of the resurrection.
Have you seen that?
No.
Evil.

2261
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:46.550
What is the Vatican?
It's supposedly,

2262
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:49.790
it's supposed to be Jesus rising from the dead,
but it looks like a Zombie.

2263
02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:53.750
It looks,
it looks like hell,
and that's that.
Yeah.

2264
02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:57.820
The sculpture of the resurrection.
Yeah.
There's some,
and then they got syrup.

2265
02:11:57.930 --> 02:12:02.570
They got a serpent,
a cathedral where it looks like a serpent's head.

2266
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:06.740
It's crazy stuff.
You been,
no,
but I've seen it on youtube.
You've been an idiot.

2267
02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:11.290
It'll yet.
No,
you should go.
Dude is insane.
It's so insane.
The Vatican.

2268
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:15.080
So insane.
It's absolutely worth it.
You went up,
you went into the Vatican.
Yeah.

2269
02:12:15.081 --> 02:12:19.640
It's amazing.
The artwork is off the charts.
You can't believe it.

2270
02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.710
St Peter's Basilica.
That's it right there.
Who fucking made that?

2271
02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:29.450
That's supposed to be something about like,
Bro,

2272
02:12:29.451 --> 02:12:32.840
that looks at represents Christianity Gate in front of Marilyn Manson's house.

2273
02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:36.740
Yeah,
totally.
Dude.

2274
02:12:37.650 --> 02:12:42.060
Marilyn Manson would be rocking.
This is they're depleted puppy POW.
The PNF of e.

2275
02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:43.840
Dot.
Yeah,

2276
02:12:45.230 --> 02:12:49.640
make a great photo shoot would be an amazing gate.
Right?
If you would like to.

2277
02:12:49.641 --> 02:12:51.290
Ultimate horror fiction writer.

2278
02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:54.160
Like Stephen King bought a house in the Hollywood hills.
Yeah,

2279
02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:58.460
and that was his gate.
Look up on the service erection feed.

2280
02:12:58.461 --> 02:13:02.420
Does that put the serpent cathedral?
Vatican.
That's,
that's crazy dude.

2281
02:13:02.421 --> 02:13:04.940
It's looks like a snake.
So there's a,

2282
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:08.150
there's a thing in there called St Peter's Basilica,
man.
You Ne,

2283
02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:10.880
you'd never seen anything like that in your life.
Right there.
Right there.

2284
02:13:10.881 --> 02:13:15.290
Look at that.
Wow.
It looks like.
Come on man.
That's correct.

2285
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:18.560
Come on man.
That's crazy.
It has the eyes of a snake,

2286
02:13:18.561 --> 02:13:21.140
the head of a snake and the fangs that is very,

2287
02:13:21.141 --> 02:13:24.880
you can see that resurrection thing right there.
Oh my God.
Oh,

2288
02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:31.140
come on,
God.
That's amazing.
That's amazing dude.

2289
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:34.950
If you were dating a girl into a Jesus right there,
dude,

2290
02:13:34.951 --> 02:13:36.330
I don't see Jesus anywhere.

2291
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:38.400
If you were dating a girl and she's really into witchcraft,

2292
02:13:38.401 --> 02:13:40.500
he'd want to fuck her.
Right?
Right in between the teeth.

2293
02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:44.400
Maybe I want to take you to the Vatican where sneak away.

2294
02:13:44.401 --> 02:13:47.520
I'm going to bribe somebody.
I'm gonna fuck you between the teeth.
Yeah,

2295
02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:50.160
that's scary.
Imagine if they just had a bed that you could borrow.

2296
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:53.640
What if the pope is really the king of the world?
I got them out there.

2297
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:58.550
It was crazy.
So it's definitely not.
Yes,

2298
02:13:59.790 --> 02:14:02.610
he might be.
It might be the most powerful man.
So let me ask you this.

2299
02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:06.390
What do you think about all this alien shit that's going on right now?

2300
02:14:06.450 --> 02:14:09.690
All this Ufo Shit.
What do you think that is?
You think that's a distraction?

2301
02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:14.250
The stuff that's going on right now,
100% the size.
It just got d class.

2302
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.900
They're trying.
That's what it is.
Uh,
the thighs,
the d class,

2303
02:14:18.901 --> 02:14:21.330
are you kidding?
That's going to bury a lot.
Lot of people going to jail.

2304
02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:25.920
So you think that's why the Ufo stuff is out there?
It's always been about Ufo.

2305
02:14:25.921 --> 02:14:27.300
It's really since that they do that,

2306
02:14:27.301 --> 02:14:31.320
like they have certain Ufo cases that they say,
listen,
if anything gets weird,

2307
02:14:31.321 --> 02:14:34.350
we're just going to let this motherfucker lose.
Woo.

2308
02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.960
And we're going to tell people,
listen,
we've seen the aliens,

2309
02:14:36.961 --> 02:14:39.390
we've got a hold of them.
We've got an alert congress,

2310
02:14:39.391 --> 02:14:40.440
we've got to talk to people.

2311
02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:43.080
And then people start just forgetting about corruption,

2312
02:14:43.290 --> 02:14:46.520
forgetting about the BP oil spill.
Forget about whatever the fuck is.
Dude,

2313
02:14:46.521 --> 02:14:50.580
the aliens are coming.
Trust me.
Yes,
they've been talking to the government.

2314
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:52.650
You know what my argument against it has always been?

2315
02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:56.730
Why would they talk to the government if you're from another fucking planet?

2316
02:14:57.270 --> 02:15:01.110
Like we,
when we visit chimpanzees,
we don't say,
Hey,
who's the number one champ?

2317
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:04.170
We want to bring you bananas and signed a peace treaty with you.

2318
02:15:04.410 --> 02:15:07.830
We don't give a fuck who the leader is.
Get out of here.

2319
02:15:07.831 --> 02:15:12.540
You don't get special deals.
You don't get special deals.
Alisha,
oh,

2320
02:15:12.541 --> 02:15:16.590
the top champ made a deal to let us kidnap some baby chimps so he could bring

2321
02:15:16.591 --> 02:15:19.350
them to the zoo.
Yeah.
The fuck out of here.

2322
02:15:19.410 --> 02:15:20.730
If they're coming here from another planet,

2323
02:15:20.731 --> 02:15:23.340
they must be so much more sophisticated than we are.

2324
02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:25.500
They're not gonna listen to us.
We're crazy.

2325
02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:28.770
They're doing it for several reasons in my opinion.

2326
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:31.140
And one like exactly like you said,

2327
02:15:31.141 --> 02:15:34.170
when there's fewer distractions and right now they're going heavy with it.

2328
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:37.880
But you know,
Warner von Braun,
uh,

2329
02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:39.990
the last four years of his life,

2330
02:15:39.991 --> 02:15:44.090
he had cancer and he had an assistant and you can watch it on youtube talking.

2331
02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:46.950
Her name is doctor Carol Rosalynn.

2332
02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.520
And she said that he kept telling her over and over because they're preparing

2333
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:59.350
like on his deathbed,
that preparing for a fake alien invasion.
Oh,

2334
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:00.240
that's what they're doing.

2335
02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:04.320
They're trying to scare us into a new world order downtime.

2336
02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:09.240
And she talked about no,
no,
she,
she doesn't say why.
He goes,
he never told me why.

2337
02:16:09.241 --> 02:16:12.420
He just kept telling me they're all this stuff you hear about aliens and

2338
02:16:12.421 --> 02:16:15.770
asteroids.
It's all fake.
First there's going to be,
uh,
uh,

2339
02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:18.990
an environmental threat that they're going to scare everybody up with global

2340
02:16:18.991 --> 02:16:20.910
warming is my opinion,
in my opinion.

2341
02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:24.420
Then there's going to be an asteroid threats and then the final one,

2342
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:27.450
and she says this,
and he kept saying that.
She goes to the final one.

2343
02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:30.190
The last one they're going to do is the fake alien

2344
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:33.490
<v 3>invasion that's going to,
that's why there's movies like Independence Day.</v>

2345
02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:35.690
It gets everyone used to,
uh,
we're all gonna,
Ugh,

2346
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:39.100
let's call China and Russia and we all band together.
It's,

2347
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:42.700
it's to get us prepared for a new,
a one world government.

2348
02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:45.010
That's what it's really all about.
The aliens and all that.

2349
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:48.730
The Nazis were doing that to their own people.
They may in the,

2350
02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:52.000
when I was balls deep in the Ufo community,
we would,
they would,

2351
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:53.350
they would show us that,
you know,

2352
02:16:53.351 --> 02:16:58.351
there's pictures of the German Ufos and in the Ufo community we looked at that

2353
02:16:58.691 --> 02:17:01.690
as evidence that they must've found crashed you,
fos.

2354
02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:03.580
And then they're trying to reverse engineer them.

2355
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.660
That's what everybody in the Ufo community thinks.
But when you look into it do,

2356
02:17:07.710 --> 02:17:11.280
they were trying to scare their own people to look for the government.
They're,

2357
02:17:11.281 --> 02:17:14.110
they're just scaring us so that we go to the governor's science fiction had

2358
02:17:14.111 --> 02:17:17.860
flying saucers before flying saucers where something that the government or the

2359
02:17:17.861 --> 02:17:20.770
journal,
you look at the time and none of the time here go,
tried to create.

2360
02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:22.470
So I think they were try,

2361
02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.540
if they were trying to freak people out and just make it seem like it was

2362
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:29.710
allergies.
Yes.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,
so we'll,

2363
02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:33.940
war is over with operation paperclip,
operation paperclip,

2364
02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:39.330
1945 1946 we bring in over all the guys that ended up creating the CIA and NASA

2365
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.570
were from operation paperclip.
So right away short NASA.

2366
02:17:46.571 --> 02:17:47.500
So when you look at this,

2367
02:17:47.501 --> 02:17:50.860
if the Nazis were trying to scare their own people with fake foes,

2368
02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:53.740
they must've came in and said,
dude,
you guys aren't on the Ufo Shit.

2369
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:55.150
You got to scare your people.

2370
02:17:55.151 --> 02:17:59.350
So that's exactly when all the comic books were all these comic books.

2371
02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:02.890
So the Germans were scaring their people with Ufos before the United States gets

2372
02:18:02.891 --> 02:18:06.190
guys with CFOs.
Really?
Yes.
This was the 30s that is,
listen,

2373
02:18:06.191 --> 02:18:10.880
if you're going to be a master of a propaganda like Hitler was,
right?
Yes,

2374
02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.150
manipulation and propaganda.
That would be the movement.

2375
02:18:13.290 --> 02:18:16.870
Who want him to new world order more than Hitler who wanted to control the world

2376
02:18:16.871 --> 02:18:20.590
more than that guy.
That guy knew how to do it and it's an old idea.

2377
02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:25.180
It's an old idea or way.
Everybody,
the old,
the ancient Roman emperors,

2378
02:18:25.181 --> 02:18:28.060
they all want,
they all dreamt for that one world government.

2379
02:18:28.061 --> 02:18:31.110
They couldn't pull it off.
There was no way they could pull it off cause you,

2380
02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.540
the only way to make a new world order actually happen is you've got to get the

2381
02:18:34.541 --> 02:18:37.030
people to embrace it.
You can't force him into it,

2382
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:40.710
so you got a mind fuck them to embrace a new world order.

2383
02:18:40.711 --> 02:18:41.980
You've got to make them want it,

2384
02:18:41.981 --> 02:18:45.210
otherwise they're not going to stay in their own little tribe.
Exactly.
Yeah.

2385
02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:47.620
You know the little problem on the little rulers would go like,
dude,

2386
02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:51.670
we do a one world government.
I'm a out of a job.
Fuck you.
It's impossible.

2387
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:56.500
But they knew.
They theorized if there was some kind of alien threat,

2388
02:18:56.890 --> 02:18:57.251
they don't.

2389
02:18:57.251 --> 02:19:00.670
You remember Reagan talking about exactly one year in the Ufo community,

2390
02:19:00.671 --> 02:19:05.140
you take that Reagan speech from the UN and from the CFR and you look at that as

2391
02:19:05.141 --> 02:19:08.290
proof that there's aliens,
but now I look at that.

2392
02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:10.330
When you look at him and I get the CFR,
he goes,

2393
02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.600
wouldn't all our jobs be a little bit easier if there was some sort of threat,

2394
02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:20.170
some extra terrestrial threat?
He's,
Tom says the rule.
Well,

2395
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:22.750
it's not exactly what he said.
No,
no,
no,
no.
You're talking about the UN one.

2396
02:19:22.751 --> 02:19:25.060
I'm talking about a different one.
He did it many,
two different too.

2397
02:19:25.061 --> 02:19:27.400
He was doing it all.
A bunch of them.
Yeah,

2398
02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:30.750
he was on a mission to get everyone and putting it to sound like,

2399
02:19:31.130 --> 02:19:34.500
but he's like making it sound like humanitarian,
like wooden.
What we,

2400
02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:38.450
all our differences just seem to diminish.
If there was some sort of extra trust,

2401
02:19:38.451 --> 02:19:41.870
you'll thrive.
That was getting,
everybody used to this shit,
we're going to come.

2402
02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:45.890
The UN is all about a one world got off.
They can't.
They can't do it,

2403
02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:48.530
but now we're approaching the tech.

2404
02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:51.140
We have the technology now with holograms now we could do it.

2405
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:54.050
It's always been for hundreds of years.
They knew that.
They knew that,

2406
02:19:54.051 --> 02:19:55.490
but they couldn't pull it off.
How are you going to pull it up?

2407
02:19:55.610 --> 02:19:59.660
How are you going to do to know how to make that shit or making movies when you

2408
02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:02.450
imagine,
what are you saying?
I told you about this last week.

2409
02:20:02.451 --> 02:20:04.020
You said you didn't see it.
What it is.

2410
02:20:04.021 --> 02:20:07.310
I'm just talking about the military industrial component.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
Oh,

2411
02:20:07.311 --> 02:20:10.780
let me hear that.
Let me hear that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Was that free use this.

2412
02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.920
You're talking about spreads force the president.

2413
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:14.620
Is he talking about space for it?
No.

2414
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:18.110
You can reassure people you're not looking for them.
This is Fox News,
man.

2415
02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:23.110
You can't play this news yet.
It's Fox.
It's like a clip from it.
Fox News.

2416
02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:25.230
It's the news though.
Yeah,
but I think you get pulled for,

2417
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:27.740
if you don't want me to play it on one,
play it,
but you can always play.

2418
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:30.580
Then let me know.
Let me hear him say,
this is my friend Steve Hill.

2419
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:32.910
<v 5>Michelle there,
and don't kid yourself.</v>

2420
02:20:32.911 --> 02:20:36.690
You do have a military industrial complex.
They do like war,

2421
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.870
you know in Syria with the caliphate,

2422
02:20:40.650 --> 02:20:42.990
so wipe out 100% of the caliphate.

2423
02:20:42.991 --> 02:20:45.660
That doesn't mean you're not going to have these crazy people going around

2424
02:20:45.661 --> 02:20:49.650
blowing up stores and blowing up things.
He's a seriously ill people.

2425
02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:52.770
I don't want to say,
oh,
they're wiped out.
You know Isis,

2426
02:20:53.130 --> 02:20:56.040
but I wiped out 100% of the caliphate.
I should.

2427
02:20:56.041 --> 02:20:59.310
I want to bring our trips back home.
The place went crazy.

2428
02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:03.340
They want to keep that.
You have people here in Washington on it.

2429
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:06.090
They never want to leave.
I said,
you know what I'll do?

2430
02:21:06.091 --> 02:21:09.720
I'll leave a couple of hundred soldiers behind,
but if it was up to them,

2431
02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:15.270
they'd bring thousands of soldiers in someday.
People will explain it.

2432
02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:16.270
[inaudible] have,

2433
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:20.650
<v 0>Whoa,
yeah,
that's fucking heavy.
I'll stop right here.
Now,</v>

2434
02:21:20.651 --> 02:21:25.480
if that was from anyone in any normal person,
you would say,

2435
02:21:25.481 --> 02:21:28.000
that guy's out of his fucking mind.
That's a conspiracy.

2436
02:21:28.001 --> 02:21:29.200
There's no one who wants war.

2437
02:21:30.010 --> 02:21:35.010
But you hear that from the actual sitting president of the United States who has

2438
02:21:35.171 --> 02:21:37.900
no reason to say that.
Like,
why is he,
why does he have a reason to say that?

2439
02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:42.760
It must be an excuse for why he didn't pull everyone out.

2440
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:47.470
100% and that's an,
that's a really overlooked insight.

2441
02:21:47.471 --> 02:21:49.990
And that's part of the problem is that so many people hate Trump.

2442
02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:52.330
But even when he says something like that,

2443
02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:55.960
that we should listen to because it's coming from the president of the United

2444
02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:58.510
States while he's a sitting president and why he's talking about pulling people

2445
02:21:58.511 --> 02:21:59.710
out of true at a war.

2446
02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:05.200
And people still don't want to listen because it's on Fox News and because it's

2447
02:22:05.290 --> 02:22:07.750
the president,
because people,
so many people hate the president.

2448
02:22:07.751 --> 02:22:10.690
They don't want to hear about this.
That should be something that's talked about.

2449
02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:15.300
<v 3>The,
the d class is about to happen.
Shit.
There you think so?
Well,</v>

2450
02:22:15.301 --> 02:22:19.000
what does the d class that's about to happen?
It's,
you know,
what does that mean?

2451
02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:22.530
You mean Dee d classification?
Pfizer applications at declasse.

2452
02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:25.140
Everything involved in how the Russian

2453
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.480
<v 1>started.
That's the problem.
They were,
there's evidence.</v>

2454
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:35.540
This is coming with the Pfizer class that Trump won,

2455
02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:39.830
supposed to win.
There's text messages going back between,
uh,

2456
02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:43.400
two FBI agents saying,
well,
what if he wins and goes,
he ain't going nowhere.

2457
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:46.840
And he's got,
Hillary's is going to crush them like a zillion to one and is,

2458
02:22:46.841 --> 02:22:49.630
but what if he does win?
And these are text messages had been released up.

2459
02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:52.290
Anybody can do that.
He got hit.

2460
02:22:52.291 --> 02:22:55.680
So bad folks were back from Pittsburgh.
We had to go.

2461
02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:58.650
I've been drinking a lot of water lately.
I'm trying to be super healthy.

2462
02:22:58.690 --> 02:23:01.680
Need soon,
man.
I thought Pellegrino was good enough.
I thought

2463
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:07.470
there's no way those bubbles are good for you.
You know what I mean?
Look,
yeah,

2464
02:23:07.471 --> 02:23:08.304
let's find out.

2465
02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:13.680
No dentists saying fuck it.
What would happen?

2466
02:23:13.770 --> 02:23:17.010
What would happen to your body?
How if all you drank was,

2467
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:21.180
was Perrier and Pellegrino and that's it.
No,
forget about the teeth.

2468
02:23:21.210 --> 02:23:23.150
The overall health of the body.
So much about the by,

2469
02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:25.950
it's by your teeth is what that is.
No,
but forget about the tea,

2470
02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:27.990
but it's going to give you a chance when you get,

2471
02:23:28.050 --> 02:23:30.810
but the carbonation has got gotta be doing something to you.

2472
02:23:30.811 --> 02:23:32.100
Teeth is all it's really doing.

2473
02:23:32.250 --> 02:23:36.570
I wonder if it's doing something to your orders to or something to your teeth

2474
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:40.650
because of the carbonation.
It's got to,
it's got to be,

2475
02:23:40.651 --> 02:23:41.970
it's just water and carbonation.

2476
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.480
So where's the carbonation is in nitrogen in the water.
Like what's,

2477
02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:50.190
what is the carbonation?
It's nitrogen,
man.
I hope it's great for you.

2478
02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:53.880
I hope I hose acid acids,
higher acidity.
Oh my God.

2479
02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:57.360
It's bad for you can be good.
Right.
And that's all I was drinking for awhile,

2480
02:23:57.450 --> 02:24:01.200
but I was happy with myself because,
you know,
I feel like you do.
I'm good.

2481
02:24:01.201 --> 02:24:04.200
My vice was coca cola,
so it got me off coke.

2482
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:06.360
I don't give a fuck about coke and got off it.

2483
02:24:06.361 --> 02:24:09.090
I'll drink coke every now and then,
but I'm not,
I used to be like,

2484
02:24:09.091 --> 02:24:11.580
I want it like with a meal.
If I went out to a restaurant,

2485
02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:16.170
had to have a fucking coke,
but now Pellogrino is,
it's totally satisfies me.

2486
02:24:16.171 --> 02:24:18.840
I'm good,
I'm good with it.
But then I just got away with,

2487
02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:22.710
I just kept drinking just that.
Anything,
it's better than coke,

2488
02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:26.130
but it's not as good as water.
I'm going to go with that.
Yeah,

2489
02:24:26.370 --> 02:24:29.310
it's gotten way better than coke.
Coke is the worst,

2490
02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:33.810
but why is it so delicious?
Dude?
Some some food.

2491
02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.580
You just want a cold diet coke with.
Look,
if I have a fucking cheeseburger,

2492
02:24:38.581 --> 02:24:42.510
I know I'm already not eating healthy fucking diet coke.

2493
02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:44.280
Why are we playing games?
Right?
You know,

2494
02:24:44.281 --> 02:24:48.420
that failing is that a Pellegrino is good enough for me is good enough with your

2495
02:24:48.421 --> 02:24:50.360
burger,
it's satisfying.

2496
02:24:50.490 --> 02:24:54.370
But if you're going to have a burger and fries best as Coca Cola,
for sure.

2497
02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:57.600
God Damn Coke,
you'll work it off in the gym.
Fucked diet.

2498
02:24:57.630 --> 02:25:02.130
Not Diet like regular coke.
Regular kind of like regular coke.
It's too syrupy.

2499
02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:06.060
It's just too hard for me.
It's just Jamie's like,
oh,

2500
02:25:06.061 --> 02:25:09.900
I miss it because Jamie's Midwest,
Midwest,
they give it to their babies.

2501
02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:11.160
They put it in bottles and shit.

2502
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:17.030
Put Cop can bottle or a [inaudible] code of breast bottle was asking coke.

2503
02:25:19.171 --> 02:25:20.850
Then she'd pull it in a bottle.
Yeah.

2504
02:25:20.970 --> 02:25:23.130
Oh I bet you you'd like to stay the styrofoam

2505
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.640
<v 3>only polo has got a weird flavor coke that I really liked that got me back into</v>

2506
02:25:27.641 --> 02:25:30.530
drinking it a long time ago.
Chipolte lay has their own Allen.

2507
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:35.170
People say Mcdonald's.
Coke is the best.
I highly disagree.
No,
it's definitely not.

2508
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:37.660
It's weird.
Yet they have different flavors.

2509
02:25:37.661 --> 02:25:41.380
They send the traces like different now announces its original taste on the

2510
02:25:41.381 --> 02:25:42.640
label at Chipola,
which is

2511
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:48.100
weird like which you make a deal with coke and you don't know which flavor

2512
02:25:48.101 --> 02:25:48.700
you're getting.

2513
02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:49.481
<v 0>Let me ask you this.</v>

2514
02:25:49.481 --> 02:25:53.200
Do you think Andy or wheeze being the heavyweight champion of bring Mexicans and

2515
02:25:53.201 --> 02:25:56.740
the rest of America closer together?
I think so.

2516
02:25:56.890 --> 02:25:59.920
What if he starts fucking everybody up?
What if he fucks up everybody?

2517
02:25:59.921 --> 02:26:04.860
What if he becomes the man?
That would be amazing.
Vivaan may go,

2518
02:26:04.861 --> 02:26:07.510
oh man.
Crazy interesting.
Right?

2519
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:12.670
Like what Joe Lewis was or what Muhammad Ali was during the civil rights

2520
02:26:12.671 --> 02:26:15.170
movement.
How about that?
What's his record?
Has He ever lived?

2521
02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:16.780
He's taking his 31 on one,
one loss,

2522
02:26:16.781 --> 02:26:21.640
but it was a split decision to Joseph Parker who's a legit worldclass fighter.

2523
02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.340
Hmm.
Um,
so one decision point 29.
Yeah,
he's young,

2524
02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:31.240
young guy and he's fucking good man.
Like he's good.

2525
02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:33.580
People get confused because of the way he looks.

2526
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:38.320
That motherfucker throws hands and the way he punches it's super fluid.

2527
02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:39.640
Everything is like blah,
blah blah blah,
blah,

2528
02:26:39.641 --> 02:26:44.050
like nasty combinations like way quicker than most heavyweights.
Wait,

2529
02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.390
wait quicker.
Really interesting man.

2530
02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:50.020
When you watch him fight like wow.
So the fights,

2531
02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.110
the fight is him versus that bronze bomber guy.
Right.
Well,

2532
02:26:53.170 --> 02:26:58.120
I would imagine the fight is the rematch in England and the fucking Wembley

2533
02:26:58.121 --> 02:27:00.790
arena or some shit in front of a million people.

2534
02:27:00.791 --> 02:27:03.750
That's probably got to be the rematch.
And if he fucks him,

2535
02:27:03.751 --> 02:27:07.330
I bug him wedge shot,
man.

2536
02:27:07.810 --> 02:27:11.740
I don't know what happened in that fight.
Um,

2537
02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:16.900
but if I Tyson fury too,
right?
Oh yeah,
for sure.
Yeah.
He could fight Tyson fury.

2538
02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:20.560
I mean,
Andy can fight Tyson fury and can fight,
uh,

2539
02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:25.600
Deontay wilder.
But the big money I think is in the rematch.

2540
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:27.490
That's probably where the big money is.

2541
02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:30.220
And then that's the problem with dad has man,

2542
02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.930
all of the sudden that heavyweight division looks good.
It's cool.

2543
02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:36.010
It's great right now.

2544
02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:38.500
This is as good as the heavyweight division has been in decades.

2545
02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:39.820
It's amazing right now.

2546
02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:44.470
But the most exciting is Deontae cause Deontae flatlines people with one shot

2547
02:27:44.471 --> 02:27:47.730
and this crazy way and he's just built like a,

2548
02:27:48.970 --> 02:27:52.690
he's built like a giant Tommy Hearns almost like,
you know,
when he just,

2549
02:27:52.691 --> 02:27:54.850
he just got crazy power man.

2550
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:58.780
His power makes me just put my hand on my hand and go,
what the fuck?

2551
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.580
Like Francis and Gattica box.

2552
02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:04.600
I know he could box at the top left at the top level.
No,

2553
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:07.780
I mean I think he could with training,
but he's a little older too.

2554
02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:10.510
You know Francis.
Hello?
How old is Francis?

2555
02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:13.990
I want to say he's 34 he started fairly late in life.

2556
02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:19.120
Learning how to fight in period.
But uh,
he's so big and so powerful,
man.

2557
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:23.420
What is he?
30 to 32 is not bad.
That's young.
That's pretty young.
He's,

2558
02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:25.460
he in my opinion,

2559
02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:30.580
is the most dangerous one punch guy I've ever seen.
He,

2560
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:34.820
he,
if you make any mistake with that guy,
it's slow heavyweights.

2561
02:28:34.821 --> 02:28:36.380
Just go flying across the room.

2562
02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.950
If you think of Francis and Ghana versus Andy Ruiz would be big.

2563
02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:45.740
Andy Ruiz is a way better boxer.
So he's a way,
way,
way better boxer.

2564
02:28:45.890 --> 02:28:49.670
It's a big difference.
[inaudible] hundred amateur fights.

2565
02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:53.600
People would see it just like people wanna to see Floyd Mayweather versus Conor

2566
02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:56.840
McGregor.
Yeah.
But it's kind of the same in the same way that you know,
you know,

2567
02:28:56.841 --> 02:29:00.530
Conor McGregor knocks people dead in the UFC and you know,

2568
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:04.220
Floyd Mayweather's the greatest boxer of all time,
of all time.

2569
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:09.490
I mean he's probably the most skillful defensive artists we've ever seen and

2570
02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:13.400
flow.
You know,
Floyd got hit a couple of times.

2571
02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:18.590
The thing about Francis and Gannon was I think even with big gloves,

2572
02:29:18.591 --> 02:29:22.460
you can't let him hit you like that.
If he gets,
if it like a Floyd.

2573
02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:25.670
The way Floyd got hit with that upper cut by Connor Connor just kind of placed

2574
02:29:25.671 --> 02:29:29.180
it there.
He popped him.
It was a good shot.
But Floyd didn't get wobbled.

2575
02:29:29.390 --> 02:29:32.750
He didn't get dropped.
If Francis,
it's somebody like that,

2576
02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:34.880
I don't give a fuck who you are.

2577
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:37.990
If he hits you with that Alistair Overeem left hook that he hit,

2578
02:29:37.991 --> 02:29:41.630
asked her with get the fuck outta here.
No one surviving that.

2579
02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:44.660
He just seems like the way he knocked out cane,

2580
02:29:44.661 --> 02:29:47.350
we clipped him with that little short upper cut and cane seemed like it.

2581
02:29:47.351 --> 02:29:50.990
Didn't even know your hit.
Yeah,
I think he hits stupid hard,

2582
02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:54.920
like crazy ridiculous off the charts hard.
I think when it hits people,

2583
02:29:54.921 --> 02:29:56.840
they're just like,
what in the hell?

2584
02:29:57.350 --> 02:30:01.160
The only guy who's been able to survive that shit is Steve Bay and of course

2585
02:30:01.161 --> 02:30:03.620
Derek Lewis,
but they just didn't do much to each other in that fight.

2586
02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:07.640
Everybody else,
he touches you with that Shit and you just go flying.

2587
02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:13.320
He had so god damn hard that if he just went into boxing straight instead of

2588
02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:15.050
UFC,
who the fuck knows man?

2589
02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:19.280
He could be the fucking heavyweight champion of the world.
Like legitimately.

2590
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:22.880
If you stop and think about how quickly Deontay wilder went from boxing to

2591
02:30:22.881 --> 02:30:25.700
earning a bronze medal in the Olympics,
it was a year and a half.

2592
02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:29.960
I mean while there is exceptionally talented,
exceptionally powerful,

2593
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:32.300
unbelievable one punch,
knockout power,

2594
02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:36.710
but so's Francis like a Francis has chosen to go that path.

2595
02:30:36.890 --> 02:30:41.690
Who fucking knows?
Man?
Who knows if he learns how to wrestle,

2596
02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:44.960
like really learns how to wrestle and really learned how to submit.

2597
02:30:44.961 --> 02:30:48.710
People can imagine like where everybody has to stand with them because you're

2598
02:30:48.711 --> 02:30:51.050
scared of him.
On the ground.
Yeah.
I mean,

2599
02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:56.260
he's at 265 pounds natural and shredded the way he is with unbelievable power.

2600
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:04.910
That's just a super unusual case.
Like I could have any,

2601
02:31:04.911 --> 02:31:07.550
any combat sport.
If you went into kickboxing,
same shit.

2602
02:31:07.551 --> 02:31:11.600
Be fucking everybody up just hit.
So God damn hard.

2603
02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:16.730
He hits people and you just go Young's like,
whoa.

2604
02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:19.980
It's hard to learn

2605
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.370
<v 1>Jujitsu once you're already famous.
That's a tough one.
That is draw the top.</v>

2606
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:27.650
It's tough because the only way to learn Jujitsu correctly is with a hundred

2607
02:31:27.650 --> 02:31:28.483
percent.
It's boring.

2608
02:31:28.890 --> 02:31:32.500
And you don't do that with your wrestling would wrestling by you.

2609
02:31:32.501 --> 02:31:35.520
You can go hundred percent supporting with dressing because there's no,

2610
02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:38.010
you don't do that.
What you striking.
Yeah.
You don't do that with your striking,

2611
02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:42.630
not that much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But um,
it's positive.

2612
02:31:42.631 --> 02:31:46.680
Once you become famous,
it very hard to go 100% with just anybody.

2613
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:51.240
You know what I mean?
It's others.
Um,
a lot on the line.
Yeah.
It's possible,

2614
02:31:51.241 --> 02:31:54.840
but it would have to be well engineered by a really good manager,
right?
Yeah.

2615
02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:57.720
Like someone like a Dan Lambert and comes along and says,

2616
02:31:57.810 --> 02:31:59.070
this is how we're going to do this.

2617
02:31:59.071 --> 02:32:03.180
We're going to take this as a project and we're going to bring in wrestlers and

2618
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:06.450
these guys are going to specifically work with you on these very specific drills

2619
02:32:06.451 --> 02:32:10.410
are going to help you get up and help you stay up.
And we're gonna,
we're gonna.

2620
02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:14.520
This is what are our job is our job as now this and we're going to turn you into

2621
02:32:14.521 --> 02:32:15.690
the heavyweight champion of the world.

2622
02:32:16.170 --> 02:32:20.400
But it would have to be like someone who had like a real specific group of guys

2623
02:32:20.401 --> 02:32:23.680
that knew the goal and that there was no egos involved.
So it wasn't,

2624
02:32:23.681 --> 02:32:26.280
you're not going to bring in some guys going to try to out wrestle him or hurt

2625
02:32:26.281 --> 02:32:28.680
him or knock him out or do anything.
They,
they,
they're,

2626
02:32:28.681 --> 02:32:33.360
they're working for the goal,
but that's hard to do.
You know,

2627
02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:35.250
everybody has their own ideas.
You know,

2628
02:32:35.251 --> 02:32:39.360
that's one of the real problems that a fighters have at a really high levels.

2629
02:32:39.361 --> 02:32:42.540
Finding people that you can train with that are commensurate and skill level,

2630
02:32:42.541 --> 02:32:47.430
but they're not trying to take you out,
you know,
to aid each other.
Like imagine,

2631
02:32:47.490 --> 02:32:51.700
imagine if Mark Kerr got balls deep into Jujitsu and got class.

2632
02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:55.860
He would've been,
he would've had a longer career,
that's for sure.
And you know,

2633
02:32:55.861 --> 02:32:58.920
if he got good on the back,
oh my God.
See that with wrestlers every now and then,

2634
02:32:58.921 --> 02:33:02.310
like after six,
seven years.
Do you see it like,
oh my God,

2635
02:33:02.311 --> 02:33:04.140
they're taking the back down there,
choking people out.

2636
02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:07.140
You saw that with John Fitch.
You know,
it took a while.
He,

2637
02:33:07.290 --> 02:33:11.250
he was just cool with ground and pound and just getting the take down and then

2638
02:33:11.251 --> 02:33:13.710
slowly start.
He started seeing him pass and,

2639
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:18.600
and take backs and then he took sacks.
Anthony Smith choking out customers.
Crazy.

2640
02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:22.530
Is that yes,
he did it with a broken hand.
Yeah.
Yeah man,
that was,

2641
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:25.950
that was pretty crazy.
Fucking dude is the real deal.
Yeah,
he's the real deal.

2642
02:33:25.951 --> 02:33:27.930
How did the Jon Jones fight go?
I don't remember.

2643
02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.690
John Jones is how class he was ahead of him.

2644
02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:34.200
He knew what he was going to do before decision.
Yeah,
five rounds.

2645
02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:37.950
Five round decision.
Okay.
Dominant decision.
John,
just a,
I mean,

2646
02:33:37.951 --> 02:33:40.290
he looked at her wobbled or knocked down.
Now you've got hit.

2647
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:42.480
I mean you definitely got hit.
He got,
he took some shots,

2648
02:33:42.481 --> 02:33:44.670
but he was fine at the end of it.
Um,

2649
02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:47.310
early in the fight though he show he looked very smooth,

2650
02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:50.490
very fluid and the first round he looked very good,
very,

2651
02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:54.870
very composed considering world title,
fight against Jon Jones.
I mean,

2652
02:33:54.871 --> 02:33:57.380
everything he did when he was moving,
he wasn't exploding.

2653
02:33:57.381 --> 02:34:01.260
It wasn't blowing away any nervous energy fought very technically very good

2654
02:34:01.261 --> 02:34:05.940
technical stand up and just look.
John is just John John's on another level.

2655
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:10.020
There's everybody else.
Then there's John Jones.
It's another level.

2656
02:34:10.050 --> 02:34:12.060
He knows when you're tired too.
He,
he,

2657
02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:15.300
you see him when he senses like any,

2658
02:34:15.301 --> 02:34:18.130
any time where you're trying to catch a break,
he senses

2659
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.550
<v 0>it and he starts ramping it up and moving towards you and kicking your legs.</v>

2660
02:34:21.551 --> 02:34:23.890
So you see it smells blood.
He smells blood.

2661
02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:25.570
He's a fucking straight up killer man.

2662
02:34:25.571 --> 02:34:30.130
He just knows there's a lot of aspects to his game that are very interesting,

2663
02:34:30.131 --> 02:34:33.490
but he just knows how to feel where a guy is.

2664
02:34:33.730 --> 02:34:37.330
He knows the distance in terms of like knowing how to feel where a guy is in

2665
02:34:37.331 --> 02:34:38.950
terms of how far away the guy is from him.

2666
02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:41.770
Cause he's the best ever at utilizing as long reach.

2667
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:44.500
But he also knows where the guy is psychologically.
He know.

2668
02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:47.770
He knows when guys are physically tired,
knows who's he fighting next?

2669
02:34:48.300 --> 02:34:51.620
He's going to fight Tiago Santos.
I don't know too much about it.
I'm like,

2670
02:34:51.621 --> 02:34:56.530
God that guy throws ex more of a striker.
Oh yeah.

2671
02:34:56.531 --> 02:35:00.370
Way More.
Way More.
More.
He's got a giant hammer tattooed on his chest,

2672
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:04.720
knocks people in another dimension.
He's a beast,
man.
It'll legit beast.

2673
02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:09.640
Which is that,
um,
that's a,
it's not,
August is not August in La.

2674
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:14.320
I think that's a,
the Anti Sim card I think.
Am I making that up?

2675
02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:19.390
That's great.
Fucking fight though.
Great fight for as long as it lasts.
Who knows?

2676
02:35:19.391 --> 02:35:23.310
You know that guy,
he can knock anybody out.
It's just swings wild.
But you,

2677
02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:25.510
John should be a heavy favorite going into the fight.

2678
02:35:26.620 --> 02:35:30.520
John Fights on the July card.
Oh,
it is the July card.
Oh my God,
that's right.

2679
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:35.260
That's right.
That's where I got confused.
Anaheim steepen and DC.

2680
02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:40.630
John Jones versus Taco Santos one.
Oh,
that was on steep NDCs is on.

2681
02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:44.260
Yes.
I don't remember.
I Want Paula Costa is also re booked for that.

2682
02:35:44.290 --> 02:35:48.930
That's Anaheim as well,
right?
Yeah.
Whoo.
Yoel Romero.
Paula Costa,

2683
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:53.830
best body ever fight.
They're fighting for the best body ever.

2684
02:35:53.950 --> 02:35:58.300
That's what they're doing.
Like who's the king?
[inaudible] boss.
Yes.

2685
02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:00.340
Well,
you'll might never fight again.

2686
02:36:00.341 --> 02:36:05.341
He won $27 million I gave up because there was a supplement company that had

2687
02:36:06.611 --> 02:36:08.260
tainted supplements.
Legitimately,

2688
02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:12.100
they tested them independently and they found out that this shit is,

2689
02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:16.370
it's tainted and it makes people piss hot for steroid tests.
Hm.

2690
02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:21.610
So he sued them.
The question is whether or not he's going to be able to correct,

2691
02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:26.050
uh,
collect rather because,
um,
you know,
when you sue someone,
they can go bankrupt.

2692
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:29.410
Like if they're a corporation,
that's why someone forms an LLC.

2693
02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:34.800
So if they've got some steroid tainted shit and athlete Susan,

2694
02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:38.500
I wonder if they actually have to pay or if one that they could just disband the

2695
02:36:38.501 --> 02:36:42.130
company cause 27 million is a lot of money.
You know?
Who knows?

2696
02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:44.110
The company might not have been worth 27 million.

2697
02:36:44.111 --> 02:36:47.940
I don't know what the company is.
Do you know what the company is right now?

2698
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.030
What's the name of it?
Gold.
Gold Star performance.
That's a big name.

2699
02:36:52.330 --> 02:36:54.640
I've heard that name before.
Have you heard that name before?

2700
02:36:55.330 --> 02:36:58.990
I think that's a big name and supplements.
You know what,
man,
if anything,

2701
02:36:58.991 --> 02:37:00.700
it'll blow them up.
It'll be worth it.
Just Pam,

2702
02:37:00.730 --> 02:37:04.390
we're going to make 100 million because a people are going to jump on it.

2703
02:37:04.450 --> 02:37:09.000
You know what I mean?
Like people got professionally.
Oh Shit.
Cool.
Let's do it.

2704
02:37:09.130 --> 02:37:11.230
Yeah,
that's true.
Right?

2705
02:37:11.410 --> 02:37:15.160
Give me the shit that Hector Lombard pissed dot for 100% that shit.

2706
02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:19.780
I got that shit on.
You're going to get a thick old neck.
Cool.

2707
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:24.110
What's up Jamie?
They got,
what if this is the right company?

2708
02:37:24.111 --> 02:37:26.930
I just looked up when I tried to type it in the revenue.
They're doing all right.

2709
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:30.200
Yeah.
How much they worth,
I don't know if this is the right company,

2710
02:37:30.201 --> 02:37:32.180
but the one I just found says they did.

2711
02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:37.360
I got a cash balance of 96.5 million as of December 31st 27 million to the Cuban

2712
02:37:38.481 --> 02:37:41.330
bay.
Be Not be the actual same company,
but it's got the same name.

2713
02:37:41.331 --> 02:37:44.750
At least a business.
That company,
let's say it is that comedy.
Come on,

2714
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:48.230
give up that money.
I want to see Yoel Romero just covered in furs.

2715
02:37:48.890 --> 02:37:51.620
Gold chains and shit.
Just live in like a pimp.
Well,

2716
02:37:51.621 --> 02:37:54.020
I want to see Yoel Romero and like,
uh,

2717
02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:59.080
some sort of crazy gazelle skin coat with like full six pack.

2718
02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.440
Just know minks right.
Makes it be better.
Like some,
something crazy.

2719
02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:07.760
Just 27 million in the bank,
not giving a fuck.
20 girls around.

2720
02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:14.170
He'll start rapping and Cuban.
It's pretty good.

2721
02:38:14.171 --> 02:38:18.170
I'm fucking guy.
He's the freakiest athlete I've ever seen.

2722
02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:23.620
He moves so fast.
Sometimes.
You like,
like what?
Like he,
you know,

2723
02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:26.140
when he fought Chris Weidman,
I remember when he landed that flying knee,

2724
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:31.060
I was like,
oh my God,
that guy can do that.
Out of nowhere,
out of nowhere,
you,

2725
02:38:31.061 --> 02:38:33.350
you can never sleep on him because he'll,

2726
02:38:33.351 --> 02:38:38.240
he like lulls you into this false sense of everything being okay.
He moves slow,

2727
02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:41.390
you know,
he just moves slow,
he moves slow and move away.

2728
02:38:41.391 --> 02:38:45.320
When you kick them loose,
it almost like he's conserving energy and I boom,

2729
02:38:45.321 --> 02:38:46.430
he just jumps on you.

2730
02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:52.420
It's amazing to see a guy like him at 40 years of age beat that fucking

2731
02:38:52.821 --> 02:38:54.230
explosive.
You know,

2732
02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:59.780
you're right at 40 with that lawsuit shit in my life fight.

2733
02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.520
He might go maybe once a fuckup Paulo Kosta and that's a wrap after that fight.

2734
02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:07.250
But if he actually gets the money,
that's the problem.

2735
02:39:07.251 --> 02:39:09.980
See it's all bullshit until the money's in your bank account.

2736
02:39:10.110 --> 02:39:13.190
Cause if they appeal and you know the dragon into appeals court,

2737
02:39:13.340 --> 02:39:18.170
which they probably will,
right,
man,
I'd imagine gears took years.
Yeah.

2738
02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:21.500
Yeah.
And then the meanwhile,
if they have that money,

2739
02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:25.760
they could just invest that money and just make itself back and then give them

2740
02:39:25.761 --> 02:39:29.240
what they invested with,
Eh,
yeah,
here's your money.
It didn't cost a shit.

2741
02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:32.330
I could do that too.
As long as it's long enough.

2742
02:39:32.390 --> 02:39:35.470
Maybe they have like 500 million.
They're like 25 million.

2743
02:39:36.010 --> 02:39:39.610
The whole supplement world is a weird world.
It's very weird.
You know?

2744
02:39:39.611 --> 02:39:43.520
We had problems with the on it with Alpha brain early.
We are a Alpha brain,

2745
02:39:43.521 --> 02:39:45.860
had other shit in it with different vitamins and that they weren't supposed to

2746
02:39:45.861 --> 02:39:49.340
be in there.
I'm like,
what is this and that.
It's,
we had to change suppliers.

2747
02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:51.501
It's tricky man.

2748
02:39:51.501 --> 02:39:55.010
When you're making stuff and you're not there for every step of the way,

2749
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:57.680
you hire companies to do it and like,
well how are they doing it?

2750
02:39:57.681 --> 02:40:01.610
How are they mixing it?
What's the VAT look like?
Did they clean that shit?

2751
02:40:02.270 --> 02:40:06.830
You know,
and then somewhere down the Rhine,
like Tim means he was another one.

2752
02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:12.080
I remember Tim means tend to dirty bird is a bad motherfucker.
He same thing.

2753
02:40:12.081 --> 02:40:15.180
Pissed hot for some shit that was just some over the counter stuff.

2754
02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:18.090
They found it but they,
they gave him like six months.

2755
02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:20.150
I think they give you all a long time too though,
didn't they?

2756
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:22.900
They give them like six months or something like that.
I don't know.

2757
02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:25.980
I think they gave him a long time.
It was like six months,

2758
02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:28.170
which apparently is where 27 million.

2759
02:40:31.050 --> 02:40:35.580
27,000 nice number two men.
You got a six month suspension?
Yeah,
whatever.

2760
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:39.780
Be Perfect.
If he gets that 27 million he won't give a fuck about that.

2761
02:40:39.781 --> 02:40:40.830
Six months suspension.

2762
02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:45.060
If you had 27 million clean in the bank that you don't have to pay taxes on,

2763
02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:47.730
is that how it works?
No.
You got to pay taxes.

2764
02:40:48.690 --> 02:40:50.760
Do you when you get a lawsuit that seemed,

2765
02:40:50.761 --> 02:40:54.000
some of them are definitely thinking like why not?
It seems it seems ridiculous.

2766
02:40:54.001 --> 02:40:56.310
Why would the government,
you could keep that.

2767
02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:00.410
Why would the government get a piece of you getting your little career?
Devry?

2768
02:41:00.510 --> 02:41:03.570
I know,
but isn't that nuts?
They get a,
but that's funny.

2769
02:41:03.571 --> 02:41:06.570
Like they ruled that you got damaged.

2770
02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:10.710
So someone has to give you money to make up for all the money that you lost.

2771
02:41:10.711 --> 02:41:14.400
You lost $27 million worth of revenue.
We're gonna make it right you well,

2772
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:18.540
so they give them that $27 million in the government is like not so fast.

2773
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:22.560
You might have lost 27 million,
but we didn't get our A's.

2774
02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:27.330
I bet you have to pay taxes.
If you didn't have to pay taxes on things.

2775
02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:29.860
Imagine how few people would pay taxes.
You know,

2776
02:41:29.861 --> 02:41:33.300
it would be like if the IRS wasn't so fucking ruthless chases people down,

2777
02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:35.610
it would be like those uh,
things.
We,

2778
02:41:35.611 --> 02:41:39.540
you bought 99 records for a dollar.
I remember that.

2779
02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:42.700
Or nobody ever paid for it.
The record club,
they,

2780
02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:45.090
David send you the cassette penny.
Yeah,

2781
02:41:45.091 --> 02:41:48.270
there was it like a petty and you'd get like used to pick these,

2782
02:41:48.271 --> 02:41:51.600
you get to pick this.
Oh,
Reo Speedwagon Oh,
Billy Joel,

2783
02:41:51.601 --> 02:41:55.170
the stranger and you get to check off the list and the bonus one ever pays.

2784
02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:59.760
No one paid.
I don't know,
a single person to pay.
They tried to chase me down.

2785
02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:02.550
Maybe they didn't want the money.
They just wanted to spread the music.

2786
02:42:02.610 --> 02:42:04.590
Maybe they did.
It was a scam.

2787
02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:08.370
Maybe they have insured themselves against a certain amount of loss in certain

2788
02:42:08.371 --> 02:42:11.790
amount of suckers paid cause they did harass you a little bit.

2789
02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:13.200
They'd send you letters like,

2790
02:42:13.201 --> 02:42:17.370
hey man sent you a all those kiss cassettes.

2791
02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:21.630
You haven't gotten back to us.
Remember that?

2792
02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:25.470
Did you do that Jamie Columbia House?
It's called Columbia records.

2793
02:42:25.471 --> 02:42:27.960
I will send you shit like a box.
Shit.
You didn't want him like,

2794
02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:32.610
I don't want Hala notes.
Was it Columbia House records or Columbia records house?

2795
02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:36.020
It was a club TV guides.

2796
02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:40.500
That's what always ask for insert two.
That's the first time I found out about,

2797
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:43.560
well it was actually late night TV about dianetics.

2798
02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:47.130
I didn't know dianetics is Scientology.
I thought it was like a,

2799
02:42:47.131 --> 02:42:49.710
you know you got kick ass,
take on the world,

2800
02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:52.040
get away from your insecurities and your fears.

2801
02:42:52.050 --> 02:42:55.950
Drag you in a little bit first he dragged you in with a volcano and smart.

2802
02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:57.990
They're showing the volcano and the commercial.

2803
02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:02.790
That's way better than than like those dudes you see at the freeway overpasses

2804
02:43:02.791 --> 02:43:06.360
that are screaming.
Jesus says,
Jesus saves like,
Dude,

2805
02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:11.250
how can block you from doing this?
You ain't bringing nobody that Jesus man.
Yeah,

2806
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:12.220
but it's smart.

2807
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:14.530
<v 1>You don't tell them you want to get someone in Jesus.</v>

2808
02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:16.740
You don't tell them it's about Jesus.
You know what I mean?

2809
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:18.370
Just pour in itself help.

2810
02:43:18.490 --> 02:43:23.290
The real way to get someone in who Jesus is to lead by Jesus's example and be a

2811
02:43:23.291 --> 02:43:26.500
really good Christian and someone says,
well why are you such a nice person?

2812
02:43:26.810 --> 02:43:30.010
Say because I'm a Christian and a real Christian is a really nice person and the

2813
02:43:30.011 --> 02:43:32.890
person and be like,
damn,
I want to be a really nice person.
And I said,

2814
02:43:32.891 --> 02:43:35.680
well why don't you come to church with me on Sunday and next thing you know you

2815
02:43:35.681 --> 02:43:38.350
go to church with them.
That's how you do.
It's how you do it.

2816
02:43:38.390 --> 02:43:42.030
You can't be screaming at Jesus on the corner of Hollywood boulevard and the
Bra,

2817
02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.390
but then when they corner you,
you're
don't.
You see that

2818
02:43:48.750 --> 02:43:49.810
you got pretty high.

2819
02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:57.750
That's going to be cut up.
Okay.

2820
02:43:57.770 --> 02:44:01.300
I see him demonic to me,
man.
He creeped me the fuck out.

2821
02:44:02.530 --> 02:44:06.730
That creeped me out man.
That guy's used to tell them people things like that.

2822
02:44:06.970 --> 02:44:11.970
Used to yell at people and point his finger out long fingernail Polish that you

2823
02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:20.140
don't,
you don't.
You see I did
it.
Make it great.

2824
02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:24.340
Imagine what it must be like to be a fly on the wall.

2825
02:44:24.341 --> 02:44:28.180
One of those billion dollar preachers just in must be getting pussy.

2826
02:44:28.181 --> 02:44:30.850
They must be,
oh it has to be right.

2827
02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.910
Of course has to be top shelf there.

2828
02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:38.650
But flying him in from Czechoslovakia and Shit,
just they got the crew of actors,

2829
02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:43.330
CNN on a fucking hill of cocaine.
It's crazy how,

2830
02:44:43.770 --> 02:44:46.510
yeah,
they got a bunch of actors and plants and all that shit.

2831
02:44:46.511 --> 02:44:48.920
But it's crazy how they get people to believe it and they get,

2832
02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:52.540
they get put in trances and shit and you know some of them over acting,

2833
02:44:52.541 --> 02:44:53.890
but some of them are like,
you know,

2834
02:44:53.891 --> 02:44:57.250
there's a certain percentage of people that are hypnotizable.
What is it?

2835
02:44:57.340 --> 02:44:58.870
What is it like,
you know what?

2836
02:44:59.350 --> 02:45:02.610
Maybe it's the people that didn't get sucked into pro wrestling.

2837
02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.000
Pro Wrestling could have gotten them.

2838
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:06.790
They would have believed that that was real.
They missed that.
And they got,

2839
02:45:06.791 --> 02:45:11.340
they got sucked into like the snake handlers and shit.
Cause when you go to uh,

2840
02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:15.850
the,
you know those,
those hypnotist shows,
the scam is that before the show,

2841
02:45:15.851 --> 02:45:18.700
like this is considered the scam part is before the show.

2842
02:45:18.910 --> 02:45:22.450
They go into the audience and they find people that are easily hypnotized,
right?

2843
02:45:22.451 --> 02:45:26.080
So then they bring them out of things they do is they let you be aware that they

2844
02:45:26.081 --> 02:45:27.910
might call upon you.

2845
02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:32.380
And so just to make sure that your story matches,

2846
02:45:32.410 --> 02:45:35.800
we would like to know what ever happened to you.

2847
02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:40.480
Is there something that's bothering you so that we know that when the Cindy,

2848
02:45:40.481 --> 02:45:41.350
the magnificent,

2849
02:45:41.351 --> 02:45:45.040
when she calls out to you that your story matches up with a piece of paper,

2850
02:45:45.041 --> 02:45:46.680
this little weird tricks they do with people.

2851
02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:49.690
They ask them to fill out these forms,
talk about their childhood.

2852
02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:53.040
That's the psychic psychic shit for sure.
Like A,
that's how they're going.

2853
02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:56.530
Just like listening to people talk.
But I'm talking about preachers do.
That.

2854
02:45:56.810 --> 02:45:59.370
Hypnotist shows where they take like a couple,

2855
02:45:59.410 --> 02:46:04.010
maybe they take one person and they hypnotize them.
Then they wake him up on,

2856
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:06.550
they make them do weird shit that they don't remember.
Oh yeah dude,

2857
02:46:06.551 --> 02:46:10.070
I saw that before.
I've seen it.
So that's real.
Oh real.
So there

2858
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:13.070
<v 0>are people,
a certain percentage of the population who knows what it is.</v>

2859
02:46:13.071 --> 02:46:15.770
Maybe it's 10% maybe it's 60% who knows?

2860
02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:20.920
But there are people that can be put under a spell on under a spell in it.

2861
02:46:21.801 --> 02:46:25.460
They could be in a trance while they're awake.

2862
02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:29.870
They're awake and they do something under command with without any control and

2863
02:46:29.871 --> 02:46:33.830
they don't remember it.
And then they get snapped out of it all.
That's real.
Yes.

2864
02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:38.360
That's crazy.
So varying degrees,
but,
and it's real in live audiences,

2865
02:46:38.361 --> 02:46:40.730
which is particularly weird.
Yeah.
Frank Santos,

2866
02:46:40.731 --> 02:46:45.200
the r rated hypnotists was a staple in Boston when I was coming up and I was an

2867
02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:45.411
open,

2868
02:46:45.411 --> 02:46:49.510
Mike or Frank actually even ran a comedy club at one point in time and it's just

2869
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:54.470
his son is a hypnotist now.
Frank Santos,
we,
he would do stitches,
comedy club,

2870
02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:58.280
me and Greg Fitzsimmons and Nick Depalo and all these guys.

2871
02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:02.390
We saw him do this and he would do it on a regular basis.
It happens every week.

2872
02:47:02.391 --> 02:47:06.920
You had one night a week and it wasn't just that club,

2873
02:47:07.130 --> 02:47:08.780
it was one night a week we get stitches,

2874
02:47:08.781 --> 02:47:12.650
but it was like one night a week at Nick's comedy stop and one night a week we'd

2875
02:47:12.651 --> 02:47:16.500
get giggles,
sorry.
Um,

2876
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:20.600
but he would get a bunch of people out of the audience and he would have a bunch

2877
02:47:20.601 --> 02:47:23.120
of volunteers who wants to volunteer and you get the people on the stage and

2878
02:47:23.121 --> 02:47:24.410
everybody be like,
Whoa,
I can't believe we're here.

2879
02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:27.620
And they would hit and ties and hypnotize me,
hypnotize me and do this thing.

2880
02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:29.600
You're getting sleepy,
you're gonna listen to me.

2881
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:32.030
I'm going to count to five and when I count to five,

2882
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:35.420
you are going to be doing pushups and underneath you is going to be Madonna and

2883
02:47:35.421 --> 02:47:36.350
she's going to be naked.

2884
02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:40.050
And he would do that and it would work on some people and look at people who
was,

2885
02:47:40.051 --> 02:47:42.590
you're not under,
come on,
come with me.
And he would get rid of them.

2886
02:47:42.591 --> 02:47:45.770
But then some people would just be under and you'd be like,
this isn't real.

2887
02:47:45.771 --> 02:47:48.350
Is this real?
But then you would see your friend go up there.

2888
02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:51.590
You would see someone you knew go up there and you'd see people see their

2889
02:47:51.591 --> 02:47:53.420
friends go up there and what they couldn't believe it.

2890
02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:54.950
And the person was really doing it.

2891
02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:57.980
And you could tell they were really doing it and they'd be so embarrassed.

2892
02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:00.560
They'd be so embarrassed when they found out that they did this in front of

2893
02:48:00.561 --> 02:48:02.270
these people.
They were like,
what?
Yeah,

2894
02:48:02.271 --> 02:48:05.600
you came in your pants and like some guys would actually come in their pants,

2895
02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:08.540
they would come in their pants.
He would tell them,
I'm gonna count to three.

2896
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:11.990
And I like number three.
You're going to come in your pants one,
two,

2897
02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:16.190
three and you got to be like,
oh.
He'd seem to get like super embarrassed.
Like,

2898
02:48:16.191 --> 02:48:20.090
these are good actors,
but you could see the embarrassment,
their face,

2899
02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:23.240
there would be wilderness.
There were so confused.
They were like,
what happened?

2900
02:48:23.270 --> 02:48:25.910
How did this happen?
But it wasn't everybody go on.

2901
02:48:25.970 --> 02:48:27.860
If there's probably couldn't go wonder if there's a,

2902
02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:32.300
I would love to see a documentary on people getting hypnotized and like proving

2903
02:48:32.301 --> 02:48:35.360
that it's real and doing different wines.
Hypnotized.
I got hypnotized.

2904
02:48:35.670 --> 02:48:39.230
They're real.
Yeah.
But I didn't get rid hypnotized to do anything.

2905
02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:42.380
I got hypnotized by Vinny shoreman.
Vinny shoreman,
the mental coach.

2906
02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:46.910
Did he make you do things you didn't remember?
Hope not.
No.
I just laid there.

2907
02:48:47.270 --> 02:48:50.730
I any gay.
He gave it to me.
No,
I laid there and uh,

2908
02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:54.650
he talked to me while I was laying there and one when he was talking to me,

2909
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:58.400
I knew he was there and I knew I was there and I knew I was just chilling on

2910
02:48:58.401 --> 02:49:00.820
this couch.
It wasn't like I,

2911
02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.730
I was in a trance and I was going somewhere and I was very aware that it was

2912
02:49:04.731 --> 02:49:08.430
happening,
but it was,
he was put me,

2913
02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:10.950
he was putting me in a suggestive state.

2914
02:49:11.490 --> 02:49:15.330
And he was talking to me about various things that I wanted to work on.

2915
02:49:15.331 --> 02:49:18.960
Mostly Organization and discipline stuff like discipline,

2916
02:49:18.961 --> 02:49:21.810
like getting things done and we just want something that I'm always

2917
02:49:21.811 --> 02:49:25.830
concentrating on.
And uh,
then when it was over,
it was just over.

2918
02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:30.270
I was awake through all of it.
But it was weird.
It was like a weird state.

2919
02:49:30.570 --> 02:49:33.840
It was like as if like the regular world has like a crazy filter over it.

2920
02:49:33.841 --> 02:49:38.190
Like where you stone,
that's a yes.

2921
02:49:39.630 --> 02:49:43.110
It's hard to guess.
I would probably say yes.

2922
02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:46.930
It sounds like you were hypnotized.

2923
02:49:46.990 --> 02:49:51.150
Like the Kinda like those dudes that don't remember what they did and all that.

2924
02:49:51.151 --> 02:49:53.220
But he doesn't do that though.

2925
02:49:53.221 --> 02:49:57.210
And I think other people can do that and I think they do that to some people,

2926
02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:00.660
but that's not what he's trying to do.
Anybody his I think,

2927
02:50:00.661 --> 02:50:03.060
and I'm speaking for Vinny,
um,

2928
02:50:03.090 --> 02:50:07.580
but I think that anybody can allow themselves to get into this suggestive stayed

2929
02:50:07.581 --> 02:50:08.910
to get into this state of hypnosis,

2930
02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:12.270
but that's different than the kind of people that will think that they really

2931
02:50:12.271 --> 02:50:14.630
are having sex with Madonna on stage.

2932
02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:18.570
Tell people that really do come in their pants that's locked in.

2933
02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:21.120
There's something locked in about them,
but it was a 100% real.

2934
02:50:21.150 --> 02:50:26.150
You think those people that can't or easily hypnotizable can be influenced by

2935
02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:32.430
that can be hypnotized by something on a TV screen maybe as possible.
Yeah mate.

2936
02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:35.100
Maybe why not?
I don't know what that element,

2937
02:50:35.130 --> 02:50:38.940
what is what's causing you to go under,
you know what I'm saying?

2938
02:50:38.941 --> 02:50:42.440
Like is it just the words,
the way the person saying it?
Is it them looking here?

2939
02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:43.960
Frank Santos was an interesting guy.

2940
02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:48.980
He's a very short fellow and this is coming from a short guy and he had glasses

2941
02:50:49.501 --> 02:50:52.650
and he was kind of like a big guy and he was heavy,
you know,

2942
02:50:52.651 --> 02:50:57.090
he was overweight and it just seemed real unassuming and sweet and kind and
soft.

2943
02:50:57.091 --> 02:50:59.490
And just,
hello everybody,
how are you?
How are you?
You know,

2944
02:50:59.491 --> 02:51:01.890
and you're just just talking to you.
Are you going to get sleepy?

2945
02:51:01.891 --> 02:51:05.220
And I get sleepy.
You get to sleep,
you're sleeping.
And they would just not off.

2946
02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:07.350
And he'd be like,
Whoa,
what the fuck?

2947
02:51:07.351 --> 02:51:11.550
He just knew how to do it and he would do it so calmly and confidently and he

2948
02:51:11.551 --> 02:51:14.880
would do it every week and every week we would watch,
some people would work on,

2949
02:51:14.881 --> 02:51:18.930
some people wouldn't work on.
I wonder if anybody can do it.

2950
02:51:18.931 --> 02:51:22.170
Anybody can put someone under their trans if they were taught the right way and

2951
02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:27.250
maybe you got to do is learn something or is it some kind of special gift or

2952
02:51:27.391 --> 02:51:29.850
some,
ah,
I bet it's a skill.
I bet it's a skill,

2953
02:51:29.851 --> 02:51:33.600
but I bet it's just like having a good personality.
Like some people,

2954
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:37.050
you want to hear them talk all the time.
Dude,
what if there's dudes like that?

2955
02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:40.770
They go,
they date and they're just looking for girls.
Yeah,

2956
02:51:40.771 --> 02:51:41.960
they're just looking for girls that could happen.

2957
02:51:41.970 --> 02:51:45.840
The ties to live when they take them home,
make them do all sorts of crazy shit.

2958
02:51:45.930 --> 02:51:50.910
I knew a guy who was a comic who also worked as a hypnotist and he,

2959
02:51:50.911 --> 02:51:52.080
he'd hypnotize people.

2960
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:55.530
And I remember walking by him while he's talking to this girl and she goes,
no,

2961
02:51:55.531 --> 02:51:57.090
I don't want to be hypnotized.

2962
02:52:01.360 --> 02:52:03.660
And I remember thinking,
well,
what are you saying her?

2963
02:52:04.320 --> 02:52:09.320
Oh this is back in the design to what if there was a hypnotist slash comedian

2964
02:52:10.691 --> 02:52:14.290
that mastered hypnotizing people from the stage?

2965
02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:16.420
And he got them to laugh hysterically at everything.

2966
02:52:16.421 --> 02:52:18.970
And so he's just like killing it.
Crushing every night.

2967
02:52:19.330 --> 02:52:23.200
Well I think comedy is a form of massive gnosis.
It's funny you say that,

2968
02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:26.290
cause I think that's what's happening when you're locked in,

2969
02:52:26.770 --> 02:52:30.610
like when you're locked in and everyone's locked into what you're doing and

2970
02:52:30.611 --> 02:52:31.444
you're killing,

2971
02:52:31.490 --> 02:52:35.860
there's just these moments where it's like the audience sinks minds with you.

2972
02:52:36.310 --> 02:52:40.300
Like hypnotism.
It's very similar because when you're killing,

2973
02:52:41.530 --> 02:52:46.450
there's this feeling that you get,
where are you?
Like it's an energy feeling.

2974
02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:50.530
It's not just you saying something and they think you're so funny.

2975
02:52:50.531 --> 02:52:51.700
So you feel so good.

2976
02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:57.120
It's like you're riding this wave and as long as you practice the material so

2977
02:52:57.971 --> 02:53:02.971
much that you know where the beats are and as long as you're so engaged in the

2978
02:53:03.641 --> 02:53:07.090
material that you really are thinking about it as you're saying it,

2979
02:53:07.390 --> 02:53:09.610
you're not bullshitting them.
You're not just saying the words.

2980
02:53:09.611 --> 02:53:11.230
Cause they know when you're just saying the words,

2981
02:53:11.410 --> 02:53:12.790
they want you to be fully engaged.

2982
02:53:12.970 --> 02:53:17.970
But there's these moments when you are fully engaged and they know you are and

2983
02:53:18.701 --> 02:53:19.030
you,

2984
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:23.440
you're riding this wave together because you know the material so much so that

2985
02:53:23.441 --> 02:53:27.340
you can be fully engaged but not have to think about what comes next because you

2986
02:53:27.341 --> 02:53:28.360
know what comes next.

2987
02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:33.010
But you're saying is if you've never said it before and you're thinking of it as

2988
02:53:33.011 --> 02:53:34.390
if you've never thought before,

2989
02:53:34.420 --> 02:53:37.780
you thinking of it as if you've never said it before and they're locked in and

2990
02:53:37.781 --> 02:53:41.680
it's like hypnosis.
It's very,
very similar as far as I know.
I mean,

2991
02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:44.890
I've never hypnotized anybody,
but I feel like when you're killing,

2992
02:53:45.010 --> 02:53:47.350
it's a state of mind is like you're,
you're,

2993
02:53:47.390 --> 02:53:52.360
you're achieving a group state of mind with all these people.
It's weird.

2994
02:53:52.810 --> 02:53:53.290
Yeah.

2995
02:53:53.290 --> 02:53:58.290
That's why I say that like specials are like at the very best 80% of what it's

2996
02:54:00.551 --> 02:54:03.400
like to be there at the very best.
It's probably not even close.

2997
02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:07.420
I'm probably being super generous with what a special actually is in comparison

2998
02:54:07.421 --> 02:54:10.840
to being there live.
Like there's sometimes I'll see a recording and I only,

2999
02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:11.770
I thought that was better.

3000
02:54:12.250 --> 02:54:15.610
I thought that was better when I saw it live because when I was alive and I was

3001
02:54:15.611 --> 02:54:18.400
watching the person I was in the room,
you know,

3002
02:54:18.401 --> 02:54:21.610
I'm soaking up the laughs in the room.
They're all the people in the room.

3003
02:54:21.611 --> 02:54:26.140
Everybody took,
they took an Uber to get there.
They got drinks.
They're,

3004
02:54:26.141 --> 02:54:29.950
they're excited.
They're pumped up.
The guy's killing.
You're locked in.

3005
02:54:29.951 --> 02:54:33.340
You're in the room with these people can't believe he just had that.
Ah,

3006
02:54:33.390 --> 02:54:37.000
and you're all feeling it together at home.
You're getting a fraction of that.

3007
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:40.930
Yeah.
You know,
it's like hypnosis,
man.
There's an energy that's being shared.

3008
02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:43.000
You know what I mean?
You've been doing a lot of standup now.

3009
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:45.010
Don't you feel like that?
Like when it clicks,

3010
02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:49.240
like there's an energy that is being bounced back and forth between two people,

3011
02:54:49.330 --> 02:54:52.920
between you and the audience?
Yeah.
Um,

3012
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:57.730
for sure.
I mean,
when it works,
you know,
I'm,
I'm a blue belt in comedy,

3013
02:54:57.790 --> 02:55:01.510
you know what I mean?
You're like a coral belt,
red belt,
you know what I mean?
Um,

3014
02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:03.980
you know,
I'm pulling it

3015
02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:05.320
<v 1>off and uh,</v>

3016
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:08.320
it feels good even when you just pull it off and everyone's laughing at him in

3017
02:55:08.321 --> 02:55:11.390
the town a good time.
So yeah,
it feels those moments.

3018
02:55:11.391 --> 02:55:13.280
That's why I'm doing it because it's so much fun.

3019
02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:18.020
It's just like what I do after Jujitsu.
I mean,
I hang out with my,

3020
02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:21.470
my students and we just talk about the craziest shit for about 10,

3021
02:55:21.471 --> 02:55:24.770
15 minutes and then I go home.
That's,
it happens almost every night.

3022
02:55:24.771 --> 02:55:27.770
We're talking about crazy shit.
And it's the same thing.

3023
02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:31.880
We're making each other laugh and when it works on stage,

3024
02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:34.970
it's that times a thousand.
It just,
you know,

3025
02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:37.220
when people are laughing and everything's working,
it's great.

3026
02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:41.690
Obviously when it's not working and they smell blood and you're not feeling what

3027
02:55:41.691 --> 02:55:43.920
you're saying,
you kind of just going through the motions and that,

3028
02:55:43.921 --> 02:55:48.480
that happens to me.
You know,
I'm still a new in the game.
Ah,
that sucks.

3029
02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:53.630
That's horrible.
That's horrible.
But luckily,
uh,
the first year,
you know,

3030
02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:56.300
I was just trying to figure out what the fuck was I was going to do and try to

3031
02:55:56.301 --> 02:55:59.870
structure my,
said I smoked,
I smoked weed before I went on stage.

3032
02:55:59.871 --> 02:56:03.380
I want to do that no more.
I go on and on stage,
just clear,
clear minded.

3033
02:56:03.381 --> 02:56:07.910
And it's way better because it's easier to remember all the material,
not stone,

3034
02:56:08.210 --> 02:56:11.200
you know.
Uh,
uh,
eventually I can,
you know,
uh,

3035
02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:14.990
go back to smoking weed like you before set because I've gotten the structure

3036
02:56:14.991 --> 02:56:17.870
down so well that I could just go up there and it's like,
you know,
when you,

3037
02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:21.830
when I teach and I do a seminar,
I got that shit down on lock.
Well,

3038
02:56:21.831 --> 02:56:26.030
I really liked doing sober October.
I really like not smoking before shows too.

3039
02:56:26.031 --> 02:56:29.030
Yeah,
it was fun.
It's fun to do.
It's different.
Have a cocktail,

3040
02:56:29.031 --> 02:56:31.220
you know what I mean?
I couldn't even do that sober October.

3041
02:56:31.221 --> 02:56:35.240
Everything was just completely sober.
I like having to drink and then,
uh,

3042
02:56:35.241 --> 02:56:39.290
you know,
maybe a cup of coffee,
got my blood going up.
Boom.
Like before I teach,

3043
02:56:39.291 --> 02:56:41.420
I have some coffee,
you know,
I'm over around.

3044
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:44.500
That's one thing I do is stretch out and move around shadow box.

3045
02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:47.300
I get my body loose.
I just want to get the blood pump.

3046
02:56:47.301 --> 02:56:51.350
Then I just want to feel looser physically.
It's hard to know what when though,

3047
02:56:51.410 --> 02:56:55.580
you know,
like what's,
when is it?
Loser is a loser right now.
And just Kinda just,

3048
02:56:55.581 --> 02:56:58.910
I just,
I have just a bunch of things that I do.
I just start throwing knees,

3049
02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:04.190
loosen up my arms,
you know,
stretch my back out,
stretch my legs out.

3050
02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:07.690
You know when it works though,
man,
when you're,
um,

3051
02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:10.670
just like connected with the audience.

3052
02:57:11.390 --> 02:57:15.620
What I felt that the most so far was in Houston a almost a year ago.

3053
02:57:16.130 --> 02:57:21.080
And just for some reason,
man,
that crowd of [inaudible] Saturday night,

3054
02:57:21.081 --> 02:57:26.060
yes,
I caught away.
They were all waiting to screen.

3055
02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:29.000
They could,
as soon as I walked on stage,
they were already laughing.

3056
02:57:29.001 --> 02:57:32.090
I didn't say anything.
They were just all ready to go.

3057
02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:37.160
Curtis was there with Priscilla is his fiance and it was,
it was,

3058
02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:41.990
that was the best night so far.
I mean as far as connection and um,

3059
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:46.520
man,
you know,
you're chasing that,
you always want that,
you know,

3060
02:57:46.521 --> 02:57:50.330
you always want that same high.
And then the next day in Austin,
man who wasn't,

3061
02:57:50.390 --> 02:57:53.570
it was the opposite.
We talked about this the last time you were here.
Yeah.

3062
02:57:53.571 --> 02:57:57.590
You got a rough set on Sunday.
Um,
you know,
had good for you.

3063
02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:01.980
Can I throw it a little Houston plug?
Not this weekend,
but next Friday,
June 14th.

3064
02:58:02.190 --> 02:58:06.990
Me and Sam triply or doing tin foil hat comedy a Friday in Plano,
Texas,

3065
02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:10.380
which is a just outside of Dallas.
And then Saturday,

3066
02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:15.180
June 15 we're back at the secret group in Houston.
That's where I,
that was my,

3067
02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:18.480
my favorite nights so far.
So hopefully we could do the same thing again.

3068
02:58:18.481 --> 02:58:20.580
I'm keeping my fingers crossed,
but man,

3069
02:58:20.581 --> 02:58:24.210
that I'm really looking forward to going back to Houston.
Yeah,
me too.

3070
02:58:24.211 --> 02:58:28.290
I'm on announcing a bunch of dates on Wednesday and Houston and Dallas are both,

3071
02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:32.010
uh,
on that menu.
And then we're doing another date in Colorado,

3072
02:58:32.390 --> 02:58:34.050
Colorado to two nights now,

3073
02:58:34.051 --> 02:58:38.250
23 and the 20 fourth@thebelkojoerogan.com for all the shit.

3074
02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:42.820
How bout those Houston gigs I used to do like back in 2004,
2005.

3075
02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:46.020
I remember we'd go to Houston,
man,
Austin,
those are some crazy,

3076
02:58:46.220 --> 02:58:49.980
those Houston was always there for some reason.
None.
Comedy town,
Dude.

3077
02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:53.670
They're ready to laugh.
Yeah.
Well that's with guests.
And started,
you know,

3078
02:58:53.850 --> 02:58:57.300
Kennison started there,
started there.
A lot of great comics came out of Houston.

3079
02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:01.950
It was a good spot.
So they had like a,
a real appetite from comedy.
Then,
you know,

3080
02:59:01.951 --> 02:59:05.870
they're,
they're smart people that are,
you know,
they're living in like a,

3081
02:59:06.210 --> 02:59:10.050
it's like a Texas city.
So it's like Texas,
but it's also city.

3082
02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:13.200
So Houston is a great spot.
Yeah,
it's one of the best.
All right,

3083
02:59:13.230 --> 02:59:17.880
let's wrap this bitch up,
bringing home Eddie Bravo.
Tell people,
uh,
Eddie Bravo.

3084
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:23.010
Um,
you on Instagram.
It's a Eddie Bravo 10 p one,

3085
02:59:23.011 --> 02:59:26.670
two p.
What is it on Twitter?
Do you use Twitter anymore?
Am never on Twitter.

3086
02:59:26.730 --> 02:59:30.810
I mean,
it's as Eddie Bravo,
but I've never on there.
That's it.

3087
02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:35.370
Bye everybody.
Thank you.
That's it.
Fun Time.
How's a good one?

3088
02:59:35.371 --> 02:59:36.160
Man?
