00:00:06.251 --> 00:00:08.258
- It's a huge treat to have Sundar Pichai,

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:09.913
CEO of Google here

00:00:09.913 --> 00:00:12.060
and you know, I will give a little bit

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.735
of a preamble more than I normally do

00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:15.652
and I think a lot of the team knows this,

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:17.504
but it's always worth reminding the team,

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.397
we wouldn't be here on many levels,

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:22.001
if it wasn't for Google.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.383
Clearly, Khan Academy certainly got

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:27.579
it's first attention on YouTube.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.081
I don't think I would have been able to do

00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:32.045
what I did had YouTube
not existed when it did.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:34.410
Some of you all might
not realize, but in 2005

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.200
we were on Java Servlet Webhosting

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.399
and that wasn't scaling.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.232
(audience laughs)

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:40.992
And so in January, I was like

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:42.655
hey there's this thing called App Engine

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:43.733
and we went on there

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.985
and we have been ever since.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:47.770
So even from a platform point of view,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.695
but most importantly, in the early days,

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.846
when, you know, we were
kind of not even clear

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:55.210
that we could become an organization.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.083
Google and Google.org was one
of the very first to step up

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.018
and allow us to become
a real organization.

00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:02.826
And ever since then, through Learn Storm

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:05.445
and even existing grants,
continue to support this.

00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:06.678
So first of all, just thank you.

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:08.577
- Oh, well there's are a
lot of people are behind it.

00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:11.345
I am glad we are part
of something this great.

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.178
- Thank you.

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:13.377
So let's just start.

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:14.294
You know...

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.705
Well you're not new to the
job as CEO of Google anymore,

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:20.331
it's been almost two years now.

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.164
A year and a half?

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.385
- Haven't counted, by something like that.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.282
- So what's your view of the you know,

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:28.455
of the world, what you're
hoping to do at Google?

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.423
- First of all, thanks for having me here.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:32.825
You know, I have to confess,

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.130
there are times when I have
to speak at things like this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.269
and on topics which I
don't know much about.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:39.451
I may sneak into Khan Academy

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:40.972
and see a video here and there,

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:44.622
so I'm a user of the platform as well.

00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:47.530
You know, from a Google
standpoint, in some ways

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.530
I think we share a lot of, you know,

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.317
what your mission is as well.

00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:56.124
Our stated mission is to bring information

00:01:56.124 --> 00:01:59.683
and knowledge, you know, for everyone.

00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:02.114
We take the for everyone part seriously.

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:06.281
And, you know, we are, we've
been working on it for a while,

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:11.002
but we again have this
renewed sense of excitement

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.072
within the company because
of machine learning and AI.

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:16.770
We think over the next 10
years, we can, you know,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.158
take a bunch of stuff we've
been doing to a different level

00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:23.741
and we are still in early days.

00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:27.200
You know computers are
just beginning to kinda

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.359
get better at things
like speech recognition,

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.228
image recognition, that's what a lot of

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:33.278
the excitement is about, when we say

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.639
you know, we are making a lot

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.909
of progress in machine learning.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.946
So using that thoughtfully
across everything we do

00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:44.001
and then taking things to the next level

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.720
is a big part of our focus.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.373
Closely related to that is,

00:02:49.373 --> 00:02:52.572
you know, building computing
platforms for everyone too.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.723
I think, you know I was
personally very inspired

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:57.627
by the OLPC project at the time.

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:01.279
And I think that notion
of being able to make

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.895
computing accessible to
everyone is very near and dear

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.187
to a lot of us, particularly to me.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.302
You know, I didn't have
access to computing growing up

00:03:09.302 --> 00:03:12.808
and you know, I literally, mainly got it

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:14.515
through the extent of my college

00:03:14.515 --> 00:03:17.682
and so I have a very discreet sense of

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:23.533
how it changed what I
was able to understand

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.239
and what I was able to get out of it.

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.307
So I think we're in the spot
where it's very exciting to see

00:03:29.307 --> 00:03:32.456
computing, which you know,
historically worked for

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:34.162
a small percentage of the world.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:37.413
Now is, that penetration is
getting better and better.

00:03:37.413 --> 00:03:40.582
You know, mobile use is
at three billion users now

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:44.249
and I see signs we can
scale it beyond that,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.214
so we are big with platforms
like Chrome, Android.

00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:53.100
We've always cared about making
computing more affordable

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.557
and reaching everyone.

00:03:55.557 --> 00:03:58.573
I think there are others
working on connectivity as well.

00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:00.089
So the combination of all that,

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.418
I think we can get to a stage where,

00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.909
pretty much, sometime
within the next 10 years,

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.845
you know for most people in the world,

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.998
I think you'll be able
to give them something

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.681
which with connectivity, you know

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:13.952
you have that access of
everything in your hands.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:16.959
And so, I think that's a
pretty profound transformation.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.500
And so, you know, broadly that excites us.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.288
And it serves our mission well

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:25.443
and we will do well as
a company too, meanwhile

00:04:25.443 --> 00:04:27.327
as we go through this.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:29.788
So a lot of it is, you
know, actually viewing

00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:32.455
these advances in machine and AI

00:04:33.363 --> 00:04:37.126
as an opportunity to bring it
in an equal way to everyone.

00:04:37.126 --> 00:04:41.464
And I think that's
largely what excites me.

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:42.812
- And yeah, it's incredible.

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:45.195
I mean, Google's one of the
few organizations in the world

00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:46.599
that are in the position to do this.

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.359
But on top of kind of
all this, I would say,

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.728
deep technical work
that you all are doing,

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:55.101
education I've heard is a
big interest area for you.

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.534
Google has several
initiatives in education,

00:04:57.534 --> 00:04:59.513
some of which we've been interfacing with.

00:04:59.513 --> 00:05:02.170
What's your view of Google's role in

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.664
education, either globally or in the U.S.?

00:05:05.664 --> 00:05:08.359
- I think culturally we have
always identified, you know,

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:11.470
pretty deeply with Khan Academy,
with education in general.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.918
And so we see this as a
big area, where, you know

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:19.932
I think, you know I said our
mission kind of, you know,

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:23.332
is complimentary to it
and so we wanna play a

00:05:23.332 --> 00:05:26.188
role to the extent we can.

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:29.068
We've been fortunate in
the sense that, you know,

00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:30.978
our products have gotten very popular

00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:34.682
in educational institutions
all the way from K through 12,

00:05:34.682 --> 00:05:36.756
largely with google appls first

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:38.870
and you know we have done
other things like classroom

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.740
and Chrome Books and so on.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.057
We'll also do, you know,
not for profit initiatives

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:48.974
in education as well, so
we are investing more.

00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:53.533
I think when I think
about, you know, I think

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:55.878
education is obviously,

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:59.437
most of you here understand
it better than me, but its

00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:02.758
complex and you know we
just think technology

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.018
can play an enabling part.

00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:07.153
You know, I was talking
with Sal about this a bit,

00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:10.822
but when I look at
approaching many problems

00:06:10.822 --> 00:06:13.793
in the context of Google,
we try to do things,

00:06:13.793 --> 00:06:18.043
we try to iterate, we see
what works, what doesn't work

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:21.243
and then we do these things that way.

00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:24.637
That concept is hard to do
in education, rightfully so,

00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:26.823
because you know, you don't
wanna get things wrong.

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.255
But I think it's important to

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:31.155
figure out how to innovate more

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:34.004
and in that context, I think
technology can play a part.

00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:38.491
And so play a part in
hopefully helping people,

00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:41.603
figure out what, you
know, many things to try.

00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:45.770
When things work, be able to
do more of it, scale it more.

00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:50.687
You know, how do you bring
educators and children

00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:52.350
all in a virtual cycle together

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.172
which is what you all are working on.

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.386
So for me, when I look at it,

00:06:56.386 --> 00:06:58.046
it looks like a complex ecosystem.

00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:01.259
So we wanna see where we
can enable these things.

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.864
So from a standpoint of
providing technology.

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:06.915
But a lot of people are
interested in Google,

00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:08.754
beyond just the products we build

00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:10.333
or the technology we provide.

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.049
You know Google is so passionate,

00:07:12.049 --> 00:07:13.754
they want to volunteer a lot in education.

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:17.016
For Google.org it's one
of the important pillars

00:07:17.016 --> 00:07:18.838
on which we invest.

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:21.416
So I think that's what makes it

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:22.861
a bigger thing for us.

00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:25.385
- Yeah and you know here at Khan Academy,

00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:27.047
you know you dabble in it a little bit,

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:28.531
you were just telling
me your daughter uses it

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.557
through her school sometimes.
- Yeah.

00:07:30.557 --> 00:07:33.597
- Where do you see ways
that we can work together?

00:07:33.597 --> 00:07:36.316
How we can support each other's goals?

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:38.429
- It's been interesting
to see, which you know,

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:39.898
from the first time I saw Khan Academy

00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:42.214
to actually, you know, my daughter,

00:07:42.214 --> 00:07:45.046
you know I see her sometimes
come when she has homework,

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:47.450
but it's part of like,
doing it on Khan Academy.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.302
I would once in a while lean over

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.142
and make sure she was not
just using YouTube generally.

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:52.535
(crowd laughs)

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:53.822
I would say that's a small thing.

00:07:53.822 --> 00:07:56.134
It's pretty amazing to see that you know,

00:07:56.134 --> 00:07:57.805
teachers are using it

00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.639
and it's been great to see.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.690
- So you too are upset
when you're children

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.816
are hooked on YouTube.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.809
- Sometimes.
(crowd laughs)

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:07.535
- It's a sign that something's working.

00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:09.080
- Yes
(crowd laughs)

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.224
No it's amazing, the kind of
stuff you learn on YouTube.

00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:13.682
I almost miss it because,

00:08:13.682 --> 00:08:15.614
they don't come to me with any questions.

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:17.987
So like you know they are,
they kind of figure out,

00:08:17.987 --> 00:08:20.223
they get their answers
from YouTube and leave.

00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:21.901
And later I'm like, oh you
could have asked me, you know.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:22.850
(crowd laughs)

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.807
Maybe I would have known the answer.

00:08:25.807 --> 00:08:28.619
You know, in terms of us working together,

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:30.389
you know I do mean it when I say

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:32.375
we think of our OLS enablers,

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.347
you know, we part has
been in many ecosystems

00:08:35.347 --> 00:08:38.354
and you know, in that
way that we approach it,

00:08:38.354 --> 00:08:41.349
but I do think that our
areas where we care about,

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:44.455
you know when I mention
the for everyone part,

00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:46.839
I think it's important, we think,

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:48.768
one of the things that
attracted me to Google

00:08:48.768 --> 00:08:52.489
and that Google Search
worked globally, right?

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:55.324
And you know it's kind of
like, if you had access

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:57.707
to computing and connectivity,
and that's a big if,

00:08:57.707 --> 00:09:00.272
but if you had access to
computing and connectivity,

00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:01.957
it actually really didn't matter

00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:03.710
where you were accessing Google from.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.698
You kinda got the same thing.

00:09:06.698 --> 00:09:10.308
That equality of access
I think is important.

00:09:10.308 --> 00:09:12.695
So hopefully, you know, I'm interested in

00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:15.958
you know, our last round of efforts,

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.557
you know we were excited
about your efforts

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.943
to localize what you're
doing more broadly.

00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:22.929
I think that's important to us.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:25.598
So getting these things to
work, even in places like

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:29.244
Brazil, Indonesia, India and
like how do you scale it up

00:09:29.244 --> 00:09:31.316
I think is something we deeply care about

00:09:31.316 --> 00:09:33.002
and feel actually we
can play a part in that.

00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:34.419
We wanna do that.

00:09:35.737 --> 00:09:38.006
You know, the other part
is, you know I think

00:09:38.006 --> 00:09:41.117
given we are working on things
like not just our products,

00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:44.018
classroom, you know,
connection via feedback

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:46.353
on how we can evolve, what we do better.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:50.066
You know, better to make all
this work more effectively

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:52.456
for teachers and students and for you all.

00:09:52.456 --> 00:09:54.500
We are openly trading
our products that way.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.465
You were mentioning that you know you guys

00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:58.244
are plugging into classroom and stuff.

00:09:58.244 --> 00:10:00.409
That's, you know,
encouraging for me to hear

00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:03.149
and we're also in early days of setting up

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:05.912
teams internally at
Google to do other things,

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:09.336
which have nothing to do with
our products on education.

00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:11.183
So hopefully we can align better

00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:12.959
and make some of them more complimentary.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.576
- Yeah and just a, you know,

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.192
unfortunately we could talk for hours,

00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:20.431
but just kind of a, you
know, an ending question,

00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.534
what advice, you know,
you've seen Google grow

00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:25.608
from a relatively small stage

00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:28.805
to now it's this thing that, you know

00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:30.955
actually delivering on it's mission,

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:33.484
and we have a huge
mission a free world class

00:10:33.484 --> 00:10:35.099
education for anyone, anywhere
and we'd like to think

00:10:35.099 --> 00:10:36.893
we're already making a dent in that,

00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:39.167
but we're serious about delivering.

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:40.515
What advice do you have to us,

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.160
you know as a relatively small team,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.611
as we try to go and try to do that

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.392
over the next five or ten years.

00:10:46.392 --> 00:10:49.204
- You know, you're doing this partly,

00:10:49.204 --> 00:10:51.537
but I wouldn't underestimate

00:10:52.738 --> 00:10:55.187
you know, the change you
do at the tip of the tree,

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.354
how fast it can flow down.

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:02.929
You know, I think you've already, you know

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.762
the fact that you guys are approaching

00:11:05.762 --> 00:11:09.158
a space like education and have
shown that you can innovate

00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:10.377
in the context of that space,

00:11:10.377 --> 00:11:12.559
I think that thing is big thing.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.929
You know, we take it for granted

00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:15.240
being in technology companies,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.762
like any time we face a problem,

00:11:16.762 --> 00:11:19.920
we think we can break it,
we fail by the way a lot,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.086
but at least our attitude
is that, you know

00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.936
you can approach anything,
however complex it is,

00:11:24.936 --> 00:11:26.601
with an engineering mindset.

00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:29.594
You know, you try and understand you know,

00:11:29.594 --> 00:11:31.142
what are the various components of it,

00:11:31.142 --> 00:11:33.032
how you can iterate
and make things better.

00:11:33.032 --> 00:11:36.526
It's kind of the default
assumption a lot of us have.

00:11:36.526 --> 00:11:39.843
But I think it doesn't always
translate to, you know,

00:11:39.843 --> 00:11:42.338
things like, you know,
many, many outside things,

00:11:42.338 --> 00:11:44.048
be it education or health care.

00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:46.321
You know when I deal with
this, you know I realize,

00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.601
well we take this for granted

00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:48.886
and like that's not how it works.

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:50.173
I don't mean it in a negative way.

00:11:50.173 --> 00:11:52.192
There are good reasons
why those systems are

00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:54.473
the way they are and you know,

00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:56.566
the cost of a mistake
is exceptionally high

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.994
in something like health care and so on.

00:11:58.994 --> 00:12:01.827
But I think figuring out how to,

00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:05.519
you know innovate, you know it just like

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:06.831
I think an imperative

00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:09.498
and I think, hopefully, you know

00:12:11.057 --> 00:12:14.176
you continue pushing what
you guys are doing already

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:17.427
and I think you've changed
already the conversation

00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:19.754
at least where all your name comes up

00:12:19.754 --> 00:12:22.275
and so you know figuring
out how to do that,

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.324
I think because for
every one thing you do,

00:12:24.324 --> 00:12:27.365
there is a multiplicative
effect of how many other people

00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.048
get excited by it.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:31.069
So you know hundred
people organization here

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:33.751
effectively over time,
you're motivating thousands

00:12:33.751 --> 00:12:36.743
and tens of thousands of people
to change their approaches

00:12:36.743 --> 00:12:37.977
and so on.

00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:41.654
I think I've always been, you know,

00:12:41.654 --> 00:12:44.172
the leveraged effect on top of a platform

00:12:44.172 --> 00:12:46.808
is always very counterintuitive to see.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.078
Like I can give thousands of examples,

00:12:49.078 --> 00:12:51.324
but the fact that everybody
starts using phones

00:12:51.324 --> 00:12:54.772
and phones have GPS and location on them,

00:12:54.772 --> 00:12:56.975
you know, you wouldn't
assume it would change

00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:58.775
transportation one day.

00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:01.204
But you kinda then like see, you know,

00:13:01.204 --> 00:13:03.410
ride sharing take off and things happen.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.404
Like you know, none of the
people who were working on phones

00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:07.987
ever had any remote

00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:11.265
sense that like people would use phones

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:14.931
and hence because of that how
you get car changes, right?

00:13:14.931 --> 00:13:17.357
And so anything you do at a platform level

00:13:17.357 --> 00:13:19.800
has these nonlinear effects.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.828
You know extraordinarily
leveraged ways to change things.

00:13:23.828 --> 00:13:26.010
And you know, I had a lot of experience

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.742
with this personally.

00:13:27.742 --> 00:13:30.110
Early on when we were working on the web,

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.419
you know, few people working on browsers

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:35.873
made changes in the platform so that

00:13:35.873 --> 00:13:38.053
you can asynchronously, you know,

00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:40.343
what is later called as AJAX.

00:13:40.343 --> 00:13:42.595
So that for example, if
you were doing email,

00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:44.755
just because you want to
change something in the email

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:45.996
or what you're seeing, you didn't have to

00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:47.904
reload the entire page.

00:13:47.904 --> 00:13:49.909
And that small change led to things

00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:51.282
like Google Maps.

00:13:51.282 --> 00:13:54.022
You can drag and look at maps

00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:56.051
and you know, how maybe YouTube works

00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:59.022
and how literally everything
became interactive on the web.

00:13:59.022 --> 00:14:02.172
So anytime I think you
work at a platform level

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:04.084
I think you end up impacting a lot more

00:14:04.084 --> 00:14:05.841
over time than you think.

00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:08.674
So I think trying to
platformize what you do,

00:14:08.674 --> 00:14:12.705
you know, so that others
can take it, use it

00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:15.178
over time, rethink it, you know

00:14:15.178 --> 00:14:17.228
I think is very, very powerful.

00:14:17.228 --> 00:14:20.425
So hopefully that's a way you impact

00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:22.783
a lot of how education works as well.

00:14:22.783 --> 00:14:23.788
- Awesome.

00:14:23.788 --> 00:14:24.896
Well thank you so much for visiting

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:26.359
and let's do this again.

00:14:26.359 --> 00:14:27.915
- All right, thank you guys.

00:14:27.915 --> 00:14:30.665
(audience claps)
