00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.400
Question is

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.420
How many times do you have to shuffle the cards - a deck of cards - to mix it up

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.220
I mean by shuffling probably what you mean by shuffling

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.620
Cut 'em about in half; you go like that; you push 'em together

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.740
Right and how many times do you have to do that til the cards get all mixed up

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.180
and uhh..

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.580
There's a practical answer

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.940
The answer's about 7

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.720
And uh.. And it's not "I think it" or "it feels that way"

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.800
It's a theorem

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.600
In contrast

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.160
There's another way that people shuffle cards

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.760
Uh.. They shuffle cards this way

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.240
You've seen people shuffle cards that way

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.480
(Brady:  That's how I shuffle cards)

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.440
Ok well uh..

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.280
And in India, they do it this way

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.240
It's the same - you can see it's the same

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.840
Little - dropping little clumps one after another

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.880
And so lots of - some - people shuffle that way

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.380
And the answer to "how many of those shuffles does it take to mix up cards?"

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.600
is about 10,000

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.440
So

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.080
It makes a difference

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.040
Uh..

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.820
(Brady:  yes) It makes a difference

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.040
There's a 3rd way of shuffling cards that

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040
is used in tournament poker games

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.040
And is used in Monte Carlo

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.140
I call that "Smooshing"

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.880
So that's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.660
This method of shuffling cards

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.860
You've probably seen somebody do that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.040
You might have done it yourself

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640
And then you gather them up and hope for the best

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.400
If you smoosh for a minute

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.680
uhh..

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.040
It passes all the tests we've ever thrown at it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.260
um.. If you smoosh for 30 seconds

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.780
It's sort of on the edge

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.040
But seems ok

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
And less than that uh..

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.520
It starts failing tests

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.040
And somebody could make money against you

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
Or guess cards right

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
Suppose you had a scheme for shuffling cards

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.260
One of these schemes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.900
And you wanted to think about

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.340
"Is it working?  Is it random? Or What am I talking about?"

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.720
If it was a few cards

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.020
Suppose you had 4 cards

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020
And you had some scheme for shuffling them

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.020
I don't know - some specific scheme

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.580
You could just try it a lot

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.000
With 4 cards there are only 24 possibilities

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.120
The top card could be any of 4 cards

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.980
The next could be any of 3

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.560
That's 4 times 3 is 12

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.520
Times 2 is 24

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.040
And then this is forced to go

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.940
So you could just do it 1000 times

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.740
And see

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.520
Do all 24 possibilities occur about equally likely

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.040
But with 52 cards

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.160
There are about 10^68 arrangements of a deck of 52 cards

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.020
It's more than the number of particles in the universe

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.960
Ok so one way of defining randomness is to say all arrangements should be about equally likely

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.900
I'll say a sort of more practical version of it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.580
Suppose that you had a scheme for shuffling cards

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.300
And then we were playing a card game

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.340
And you had to guess at the cards 1 at a a time as I turned them over

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.120
So for example

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.860
Y'know

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Take a guess - what do you think the top card is

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.680
(Brady:  6 of spades)

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
Uh.. maybe upside down

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120
Not so bad, Brady, not so bad

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.120
Uh.. y'know 6, 9, could be

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.120
Ok, but suppose

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.800
As in a card game or in a casino

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.760
The cards were turned up 1 at a time

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.620
And somebody tried to guess what they were

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.440
Now

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.120
We know now

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.920
That the 9 of spades is out of the deck

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.480
So you're not gonna guess that again

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.120
What do you think the next card is

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.120
(Brady: Jack of diamonds)

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.520
mm... not so good ok

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.280
So

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.900
No, but of course it's not so good

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.100
Your chance of being right on the first card is 1/52

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.320
If the cards were perfectly mixed

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.280
Your chance of being right on the next card is 1/51

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.160
Then 1/50 if you have a good memory

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.580
And if you have a really good memory, if the cards were all turned face up

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.860
you would know what the last card is for sure

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.700
It's the matching 9

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.700
If the cards were perfectly shuffled

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.480
um..

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.480
you expect to get

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.400
1/52 + 1/51 + 1/50 etc.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.160
Right and going through the deck 1 at a time

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.120
And that adds up to about 4 and a half

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.640
So, if somebody

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.120
could remember

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.740
and was guessing but the cards were well mixed

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.580
you could get about 4 and a half right on average

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.580
If you don't riffle shuffle enough

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.500
if you riffle shuffle 4 or 5 times

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.440
somebody can get 9 or 10 cards right on average

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440
Anybody would say that's not random

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440
Riffle shuffle is this guy

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500
You riffle 'em together is the way we say it

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.740
They sometimes do it on the table this way

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.440
Y'know

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.520
Casino dealer will do..will do that

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.440
That's riffle

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.940
This is called overhand and the other one I call smooshing

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.100
I wanted to say it's not just experimental

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.780
that gives us these numbers I gave you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.280
7 shuffles

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.860
It's math

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.300
and I wanted to try to explain

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.800
a theorem

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.500
and I think

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.920
this is one that I can explain without writing anything down

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.480
Let's see if I make it

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.440
I'm gonna take

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.680
A very simple shuffle

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.440
Which is take the top card off

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.120
And put it in at random

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.420
You might put it back on top

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.400
You might put it back 2nd from the top

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.240
You might put it on the bottom

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.120
It's intuitively obvious that if you did that alot

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.800
The cards would get all mixed up

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.740
I mean it's a silly way of shuffling

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.920
But it is like a riffle shuffle where you just happen to have cut off 1 card

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.620
Y'know I'm riffle shuffling this 1 card into this big deck

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.120
Putting it in at random

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.020
The deck starts out in order

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.160
Yknow ace of spades, 2 of spades, 3 of spades

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.600
whatever

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.080
and there's some card at the bottom

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.040
I'm gonna suppose it's the king of hearts

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.600
so the deck is in order, you know the order of the deck

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.100
It's in order

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.100
(Brady:  that's how it came from the pack)

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.740
yes, yes or you might have written them down

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.100
the guys in casinos, y'know, record them as they come off right

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.780
how it came from the pack

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.120
And now, you're taking the top card off the and poking it in at random

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.280
and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.260
just do that a lot

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.660
ok, uh huh, poke poke poke

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.620
now eventually

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.840
because of the rules

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.120
some card will go underneath that original bottom card

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.840
the king of hearts

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.200
there it is on the botom

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.720
eventually if you wait long enough, a card goes under the bottom card

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.520
how long does that take?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.100
well, the chance of a card going underneath the bottom card is 1/52

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.020
Because there are 52 places it can go

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.320
So the chance of that then happening is 1/52

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.200
Therefore it takes about 52 pokes

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.200
on the average to have that happen

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.700
ok

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.280
and now , keep going like an idiot

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.460
and eventually a 2nd card goes underneath the king of hearts

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.440
when I put that 2nd card

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720
underneath the king of hearts

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.620
so there are 2 card there

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.200
even if I told you "hey it's on poke 503"

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.300
I just poked

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.360
the 2nd card underneath the king of hearts

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.500
it's equally likely that the 2 cards underneath the king of hearts are in order low-high or high-low

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.880
because I'm poking the card in at random

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.160
I could have put it above the card that's on the bottom or below it

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.000
I'm poking them in at random

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.720
now, keep poking, eventually a 3rd card goes underneath

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.160
the king of hearts

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.340
there are 2 cards previously

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.160
this one

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.660
there are 2 cards

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.280
this one goes in here, here, or here at random

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.440
so all 6 orders are equally likely

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.940
every time you put a card in

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.220
given, as long as you're putting it in at random

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.980
the cards underneath the king of hearts are in a completely random order

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.840
I hope that's intuitive and it's true (Brady:  that's make sense) it makes sense

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.600
and now look at what happens; keep poking

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.020
the king of hearts slowly moves up

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.400
it never goes down

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.600
it might stay where it is

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.160
if I put a card above it

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.660
it stays where it is

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.660
but if i put a card below, it moves up 1

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.840
so eventually the king of hearts comes up to the top

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.520
by induction, by the argument we've been doing

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520
all the 51 cards are in random order

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.200
when i put the king of hearts in at random, the whole deck is random

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.240
exactly random

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.020
at that moment

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.720
every arrangement is equally likely

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.320
so that is not only intuitive it is an exact mathematical fact

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.220
i hope it makes sense, i think it makes sense

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.180
and now, you can just ask

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.200
"how long does that take?"

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.120
well, it takes 52 pokes for the 1st card to go under

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.940
there's the king of hearts on the bottom

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.240
then i put a card underneath it

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.280
so now there are 2 places where the next card can go

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.200
so it's it it's 2/52

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.820
So it takes 52/2 pokes

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.140
and then it takes 52/3 pokes for the 3rd card to go under

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.400
so it's 52 +52/2 +52/3

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:25.540
and that answer is well it's - what is it -  it's 52 times log of 52

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.860
which is around 200 or so

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.840
so it takes about 200 of these pokes

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.540
if you shuffle fewer times

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.540
if you shuffle 5 or 6 times

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.020
it really somebody could really make money against you

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.920
in a card guessing experiment

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.900
if you shuffle 10 or 11 times

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.900
it's not worth the wear and tear on your shoe leather standing there in the casino

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.780
if you're counting cards

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.780
it's just as close to random as it could be

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.400
of course it's never perfectly random

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.620
y'know we'd have to shuffle infinitely often to make it

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.140
there's still some trace of the original order but it vanishes exponentially fast

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.020
So wonderful question; let me try to match you with an answer

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.540
the model that the 7 shuffle is based on

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.280
i'm gonna say it as a slightly more mathy thing
