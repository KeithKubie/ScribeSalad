00:00:00.343 --> 00:00:00.843
Hi!

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.880
I'm Anna Akana.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.920
And I'm here to help women everywhere
not get raped.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.220
Because it's totally our responsibility, right?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.540
(dramatic chord)

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.540
The best form of rape prevention

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.260
is to assimilate yourself into society as a man.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.719
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:19.189
"Anna, rape does NOT just apply to women."

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.162
This is true.

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.480
So to ensure the safety of your butt,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.040
spread a rumor that you yourself are a rapist,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.224
so other rapists

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:27.500
will see you as a colleague.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.540
Anna: Hey fellas!

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.480
Anna: How dem rapes looking lately?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.948
Guys: What?

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:32.720
Anna: Yeah, you get any good rapes, dawg?

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:33.647
Guy 1: Yeah, we're busy right now.

00:00:33.647 --> 00:00:34.249
Guy 2: Yeah.

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.663
Anna: Busy thinking 'bout dat rape~

00:00:35.663 --> 00:00:36.481
Guy 1: Okay, we're gonna get--

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.509
Anna: Hey guys, come on bruh!

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:38.816
Anna: Give me some rape tips, dawg!

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.418
Anna: I just wanna learn how to rape from you!

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.240
Anna: Yo, we're friends, dawg!

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.160
(Arguing) Anna: Wait here! Get back, I wanna rape!

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:48.560
Man: NO! NO!

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.075
If you absolutely cannot pretend to be a man

00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:52.636
faÃ§ading as a rapist,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.920
another expensive and fear-induced solution

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.820
is to hire bodyguards.

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:57.657
Will you protect me from rape?

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:58.377
Yes ma'am.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.880
We will.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.720
But will you rape me?

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:03.514
Yes ma'am.

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:04.160
We will.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.137
I'm just gonna...

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:07.291
call 911 really quick.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.728
If your bodyguards aren't trustworthy,

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:11.907
protect yourself the old American way.

00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:13.076
(dingdong)

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.014
Excuse me, do you have the time?

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:17.045
(whoosh)

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:24.880
(gunshots)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.136
No I don't have the time.

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:27.929
For rape.

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:29.377
(gunshot)

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:31.137
We've been conditioned our whole lives

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.660
to not get raped.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.754
My dad put me in martial arts.

00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:36.729
My mom gives me knives and pepper spray,

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.254
and despite the fact that I like that stuff,
it's mostly for anti-rape.

00:01:39.254 --> 00:01:40.437
We're told by society,

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:41.636
"Never walk alone at night.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:43.106
Never walk down an alleyway.

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:45.285
If you think you're being followed, make 3 right turns

00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:47.254
cause that means they just went in a circle.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:49.014
Never run upstairs if you're being chased

00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:50.406
cause then you can get trapped.

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:52.938
Don't stop if you see a car seat on the side of the road.

00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:56.076
Hey, here's some nail polish that'll
help you identify date-rape drugs.

00:01:56.076 --> 00:02:00.077
Support this adorable yet fierce keychain
so you can gouge someone's eyes out."

00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:00.760
And on,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.754
and on,

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.014
and on.

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:04.437
You know what would be better?

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:06.136
If we just taught young boys

00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:08.284
that rape isn't even an option.

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:11.407
If we would stop victim-shaming and slut-shaming,

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:12.969
and excusing a rapist

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.137
because of the clothes his victim wore,

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:17.469
or because they were on a date.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.014
Cause I am seriously

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.667
so fucking tired

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:22.254
of being responsible

00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:24.075
for not getting raped.

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:26.759
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.254
You stay awesome.

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:34.030
(ending music)

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.436
