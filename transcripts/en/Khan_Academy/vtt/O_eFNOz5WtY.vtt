00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.440
- [Instructor] So right here,
I have a container of water

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.110
that is open to the atmosphere.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.090
It's standard atmospheric
pressure up here.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.120
And let's just assume that
everything in our system,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.970
the air and the water, the container,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.920
everything is 21 degrees Celsius.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.740
Now, our chamber is,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.900
or our container of water is
divided into two chambers,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.510
a left chamber and a right chamber,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.080
which is divided by a
semipermeable membrane.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.850
It's permeable only to the water,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.830
but not to the solute in the water.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.140
And on the left-hand
side, we have pure water.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.120
So it's just molecules of H2O.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.670
You could view that as distilled water.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.230
While on the right-hand side,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.690
we don't have pure water.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.310
We have some sodium chloride

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.610
that has been dissolved in the water.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.950
And we want to get a little
quantitative in this video,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.720
so let's say it is 0.25

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.600
moles per liter or 0.25 molar

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
sodium chloride right over here.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.420
Well, we know intuitively,
from our study of osmosis,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.190
what is going to happen here.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.340
Since our membrane is
only permeable to water

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.580
and the right side is
hypertonic relative to the left,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.100
it has a higher concentration of solute,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.710
we will have the water
going from left to right.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.240
But what we're going to do in this video

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.350
is get a little bit more
quantitative in thinking about,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.540
well, what is the potential of the water

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.400
to go from the left to the right?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.170
And to do that, we're gonna
talk about something known as

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.120
water

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.940
potential,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.213
which is denoted by the Greek letter psi.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.610
Now, by convention, the water potential

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.870
of the pure distilled water
when it is in an open container

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.720
exposed to standard atmospheric pressure,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.070
that is going to be,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.310
so psi over here is going
to be equal to zero bars.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.790
And as you can see
here, the units for psi,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.160
for water potential, are the
same as the units for pressure.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.880
Here, we're using bars,
but you could use PSI

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.730
or atmospheres or something else.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.650
But what is going to
be the water potential

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.920
on the right-hand side?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.810
Well, generally speaking,
you can break down

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.690
your water potential into
subcomponents, and the what,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600
the subcomponents that
we typically talk about,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.330
but there are more, are the
component due to the solute

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.130
and the component due to pressure.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.410
This'll often be known
as the solute potential

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.510
and the pressure potential.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.150
Now, because this right chamber
is open to the atmosphere

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390
and it's standard atmospheric pressure,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.430
the pressure potential in this situation

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.630
is going to be equal to zero.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.940
So our total water potential
on the right-hand side

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.330
is going to be the same thing
as our solute potential.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.920
Now, to figure out our solute potential,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.620
we will turn to a formula,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.640
and I'll show you a formula
sheet right over here,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.130
that's given by the College Board

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.780
when folks take the AP Biology Exam.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.280
But we'll see that this formula
is actually quite intuitive

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.850
and related to the ideal gas law

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.260
that you first studied in chemistry.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.250
It tells us that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.070
our solute potential
is going to be equal to

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.700
negative i, and I'll talk
about what that is in a second,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.720
times our molar concentration C

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.000
times our pressure constant R.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.780
Now, they're calling it
the pressure constant

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.510
in this context, but
it's actually the same R

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.520
that we see in the ideal gas law,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520
times the temperature
in Kelvin, so times T.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.840
So first, let's start with
i, so let me write this down.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.760
This is going to be equal to,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.440
it's all going to be negative

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.440
because all of these are
going to be positive values.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.240
So i is known as the ionization constant.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.610
And one way to think about it is,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.720
for every molecule of solute,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.410
how many molecules does
it disassociate into

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.080
when you put it into the water?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.110
So if I take a molecule
of sodium chloride,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.040
we know that when we put it into water,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.220
it's going to disassociate

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.560
into sodium ions and chloride ions,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.560
or into two ions for every one
molecule of sodium chloride.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.460
So here, our ionization constant

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.970
is going to be equal to two.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.140
Now, what's our molar concentration?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.120
Well, we already know that.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.840
Our molar concentration
is going to be 0.25 molar,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.980
or we could write it as 0.25

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.500
moles per liter.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.410
And then we're gonna multiply that

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.810
times our pressure constant,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.020
which is the same as
the ideal gas constant.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.760
And that is going to be,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.860
they give it to us right over here, 0.0831

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.500
liter bars,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.200
liter bars per mole

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.140
Kelvin.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.460
And then we are going
to multiply that times

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.130
the temperature in Kelvin.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.440
Now, what's that going to be?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.390
Well, it's going to be our
temperature in Celsius plus 273.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.360
So you add 21 plus 273,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.670
you're gonna get 294 Kelvin.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.700
And so this is going to
be approximately equal to,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.280
we're going to have
this negative out front,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.500
and if we look at our units,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.090
let's see, we have moles
canceling with moles,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.630
liters canceling with liters,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.270
and then Kelvin canceling with Kelvin.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.360
So our units are going to be
in bars, which makes sense

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.920
because that's what we
already talked about.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.330
That's the units that
we're dealing with here.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.280
And so let me get a calculator out.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.360
See, we already have the negative.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.610
So it's gonna be two times .25

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.110
times .0831

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.150
times 294

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.070
is equal to, and I'll just
round to one decimal place.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.970
So 12.2, but I have that negative there,

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.130
so approximately negative 12.2 bars.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.660
So our solute potential over
here is negative 12.2 bars,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.590
or it's approximately equal to that.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.500
And that's going to be equal
to our total water potential

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.470
because the pressure potential is zero.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.940
So how do we interpret that?

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.210
Well, one way to think about it is

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.180
you can almost view it
as, since it's negative,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.930
relative to the left-hand side,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.950
that it would pull water
in, that the water,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.750
if the membrane is only
permeable to the water,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.300
is going to go from high
potential to low potential.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.380
And that's exactly what we
thought would happen intuitively.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.780
Now, another thing that
we could think about is,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.740
well, how would we keep
the water from flowing?

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.370
Well, then we could add some

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.280
pressure potential right over here.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.650
Maybe we could put a piston over here,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.410
and we could apply some pressure

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.490
above and beyond the standard
atmospheric pressure.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.000
Well, how much pressure
would we have to apply here

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.790
to kinda push down on that
water so that we don't have

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.790
a net inflow from the left to the right?

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.490
Well, imagine if this was 12.2,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.390
12.2 bars that we were to apply up here.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.600
Well, then all of a sudden,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.220
this pressure potential wouldn't be zero.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.370
It would be positive 12.2.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.400
And then on the right,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.400
we would have negative 12.2
bars of solute potential

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.160
plus positive 12.2 bars
of pressure potential.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.730
And so that would add up to
be a zero water potential,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.400
in which case, since the left

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.010
and the right-hand side would
have the same water potential,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.010
you would not have a net flow
of water in either direction.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.330
So as you can see, this
idea of water potential

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.610
allows us to think a
little bit more precisely

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.410
and a little bit more quantitatively

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.883
about these ideas of osmosis and tonicity.
