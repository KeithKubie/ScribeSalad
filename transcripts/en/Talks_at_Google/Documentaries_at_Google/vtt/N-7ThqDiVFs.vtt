&gt;&gt;Tiffany Shlain: I'm really happy to be here
on this gorgeous New York day.I was just,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.030
like, ah, I love New York.Um, anyways, we
open on um, Friday at the Angelica Film Center

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.221
we'll be there for a week.And we'll talk more
about that later, we have all these speakers

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:20.340
lined up, but.I'm really excited to share
the film with you.And see a lot of laptops

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.800
out.That was also the case at Google on the
Bay area.Which as a film maker, well when

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.990
you see film you'll know the irony of all
that.[Laughter] But, um, no, no, it's cool,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.059
because it is cool.It's ok.Um, [laughs] but
the film is both a very personal film for

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.969
me as well as a kind of global look at what
all this connectedness means.And, um, you

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.510
know, it's been really exci-- Probably my
most exciting spreenings, screenings have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.249
been at the tech companies because you all
are creating these tools and you have so much

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.640
influence on how we're using them and what
is it mean?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.989
What are the implications of all the things
that you are creating?

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.570
So, uh and there's a couple, um, see if you
notice the very, the Google shot.'Cause, you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.870
know I founded the Webby Awards.And, uh, there
might be a shot of the founders with capes

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.440
and rollerblades winning their first Webby
Award.There just might be.Anyways, um, so,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.720
anyways it's an eight minute film and then
afterwards we'll have a good, um, discussion

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.220
afterwards, so enjoy.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.730
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Hello!

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.960
This is Tiffany Shlain as you met in the beginning
of the film.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.230
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: You now know more about me than
you ever thought you would know.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.501
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Exactly.I was going
to start off with a bio but I figured that

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:40.890
everyone already knows everything about your
personal and professional life.So I don't

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.890
think we need to go there.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.890
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, you don't need to go over
my life, yeah.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.600
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: I was maybe going to
share some, um, feedback that I've read about

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.390
your film.In particular, from ah, Al Gore.Ah,
he said "Tiffany Shlain demonstrates with

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.060
lyrical simplicity our interdependence on
one another and the interconnectedness of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.240
humanity with all life on earth.Throughout
she presents and honors with deep wisdom of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.729
her late father, Leonard Shlain reminding
us of the deepest connections that breathe

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.619
meaning into life."

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.230
And then I found another quote which I'm sorry
I don't know the author, um, I couldn't find

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.099
that.It said "A love letter to humanity and
our shared potential."

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.650
So that's quite an accomplishment to write
a love letter to humanity.So congratulations

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
on your film.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.709
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Thank you.Thank you so much.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.709
Thank you.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.299
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: It's excellent.Um, and
maybe we could start off talking about that.If

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.450
you could just tell us a little bit about
how the film started off as a documentary

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.989
and morphed into an autoblog-ography.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.989
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, yeah, this is my eighth film
and I have never made a personal film.I don't

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.680
know if I ever will again.But, um, I started
out, the film took four years to make.And,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.639
um, I was just focusing at, we called it the
idea portion of the movie.It's all about,

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.389
just about the ideas I was interested, obviously
you know my background.I was interested in

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.790
why are we creating all these technologies?

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.670
What's our desire to connect?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.329
And I wanted to place it in historical context
and kind of give this overview.And in year

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.919
two I sat in the editing room and got this
sinking feeling that no film maker wants to

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.439
feel as they're watching their rough cut.I
had a complete two hour movie.And I watched

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.760
it and I thought "I'm not connecting to the
material."

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.840
That it was about connectedness and I had
no emotional connectedness to what I was talking

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.489
about.The tubes are connecting us.Um, and,
so and my father had just been diagnosed and

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.499
I was really thinking a lot about connection.And
then it kind of hit me that in order to understand

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:38.200
connectedness of humanity I needed to understand
what I was feeling about connectedness in

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.239
my family.That that's where all of this stems
from, is our sense of feeling connected.And

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.290
we're all social creatures and that that I
needed to kind of explore my own sense of

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.239
connectedness.So then, it was a very difficult
process.I'd brought in a story editor, I have

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.190
a writing team and we spent two years.First
we looked at at the story arc in the idea

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.170
film then we made a story arc in my personal
life.Which was really weird.They're like "Well

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.390
what happened in the second act, like, was
there something worse that happened?"

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.359
And I was like--.And then we had to weave
them together but the exciting moments in

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.409
the editing room and in the writing room were
when the personal and the global clicked together.And

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.010
I realized that they were, you know, like,
growth, for growth's sake is cancer or these

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.260
moments when what was happening to me personally
were speaking to something globally.Whether

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.800
it was, you know, I think our society is so
exciting right now and something's also died

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.410
in our society.And something is about to be
born with the internet and, so there was all

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.351
these kind of parallels, um.And, of course,
I started weaving in my dad's work, which

00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:44.420
has been so influential to me.So, it was,
you know, and our big goal with this film,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.980
was to really get a conversation started.So
what does it mean to be connected?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.980
What's the good?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.980
What's the bad?

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.980
What's the hope of it?

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.000
And we made this whole, um, discussion kit
that goes with the movie.And a lot of educators

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.800
are using this right now.So it has a curriculum,
and then there's conversation cards and a

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.760
book.And we just really want people to get,
to be talking.We're all moving so quickly,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.370
as you all know here at Google.We're just
moving a million miles an hour.And what does

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.370
it all mean?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.520
Like we have an opportunity to kind of explore
what are the implications of our actions and

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.000
what we're building and how it's affecting
the world.And what's the potent- 'cause I

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.910
get very excited, especially with a lot of
the stuff you're doing about the collaborative

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.190
tools.And I should tell you that I can't wait
till we can get video online, but my team

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.730
is kind of all over and we wrote the script
completely on Google docs.Like, we'd all be

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.170
on at the same time writing.And, um, in different
places, in real time, it was fabulous.And,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.790
um, but the collaborative tools are where
I get most excited about the potential of

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.920
what that could mean.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: For this world.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.350
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: And speaking of the
toolkit that you have, I think it's for teachers

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.530
and things like that, so they can continue
the discussion in class.Um, you know this

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.520
generation of kids, they, all they know is
being connected.Their birth was probably announced

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.180
immediately on Facebook and, you know, tweeted
about and

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.630
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Ours was, that was our birth announcement.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.730
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Exactly.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.610
So what do you think it's like for those children,
I mean, you could, when you were looking at

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.980
connectedness you could go back to a time
when you remembered not being connected technology.I

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.750
mean, I think that kids--.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.710
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: I mean it's a great question as
I have a two year old and an eight year old

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.040
and their whole way of processing information
is different but the good news is my daughter

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.160
still loves to read.And we do technology Shabbats
every Saturday.Very serious.And since we finished

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.440
the film, so Friday night, sundown, we light
the candles and we turn off all screens for

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.760
24 hours which has been pretty life changing
for me, for me personally, 'cause I was feeling

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.660
too much.I was slee-- in my sleep I was emailing
and texting.Like in my sleep.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.660
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.590
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: And my mind was just too much.So,
um, we started doing that and my kids love

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.930
it.And everyone can try it.I know it sounds
weird, but it's kind of wonderful to remember

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.961
what it's like to just be not be able to act
on every single thought you have.And what's

00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:58.130
the one day of the week you want to feel long
is Saturday?

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.870
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Mm-hm
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: And time totally slows down when

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.150
you are unplugged.So I found it's been seven
months now and it's really rebalanced me.But

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.070
going back to our children, I'm very excited.I
mean I feel like, I think we've finally created

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.110
a work environment that mirrors our stream
of consciousness, 'cause we don't think in

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.780
a linear way.Our thoughts, you're listening
to me, I'm saying things making you think

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.390
of, like, 20 different things.And that's the
way we really thing.And you know I used to

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:26.200
watch my father do brain surgery, that's very
focused.Eight hours.Would not leave the focus

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.740
and just asked for tools.And now we have an
environment where every thought we have can

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.110
be acted on.Every idea, every link, every,
and I think that's exciting.So, I know people

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.670
who are so worried about the distraction but
I kind of feel like, you know, when the written

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.420
word was invented, everyone worried that oral
tradition would be, we'd lose our memory.Well

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.810
we kind of lost a bit of our memory but we
gained a lot of knowledge with books.When

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.960
I was growing up television was going to destroy
our brains.I watched a lot of crappy TV.It

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.380
has not destroyed our brains.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.230
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Mm-hm
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: And, um, I just think that they're

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.770
gonna process and explore this world in a
totally new way.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.150
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, and I feel like
technology, maybe, um, you know, it started

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.020
out where, it kind of came to us and sort
of forced its way into our life.And we use

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.210
it now and feel like it's shifting where it's
changing to adapt to how we need to use it.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.160
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, and that's what a lot of
you are doing here.That's exactly right.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.660
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, so that's exciting.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.490
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: And, um, I want, well, we can open
it up, but I want to tell you the reason we

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.650
do these preview screenings, like we're an
independent documentary.You have to see it,

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.280
I've opened in L.A. next to Brad Pitt's Moneyball.You
can imagine.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.260
[interviewer chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: They have a lot of marketing money.I

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.640
was like 'Oh my God'.There's like twenty billboards
in L.A.And like our but, you know, our film

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.469
has done really well through social networking.And,
um, it's been very exciting.So if you liked

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:44.169
the movie, we open at the Angelica on Friday.We've
all these exciting speakers.Every night, kind

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.170
of approaching connectedness from their perspectives.So
we have Anna Deavere Smith, we have designer

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.970
Todd Oldham, um, we have MeetUp founder Scott
Heiferman, film producer Ted Hope.We have

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.810
all these great people.And every night our
goal is to really start a dialog from a different

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.120
perspective.I mean, obviously if you saw any
of the film, you could approach this subject

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.900
from, you're an environmentalist, if you're
a technologist, if you're a woman, if, you

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.660
know, it's just we just want to crack open
the dialog.And we hope that you will either

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.140
come opening weekend, it's all about opening
weekend for independent docs.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.440
(Interviewer chuckles)
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Bring your friends.And, or just

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.260
spread the word, we'd be super, super grateful.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.220
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: And what else was on
the little cards that you were handing out?

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.210
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Um, the card was just kind of,
you guys all know this, like spoon feeding,

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.740
well can I just tell you I can't wait till
you guys have a Google plus for films?

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.210
'Cause you don't have that yet and we've been
having a lot of fun with having extending

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.020
the Q and A outside of the theater online.So
we've been having in our Facebook page but

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.250
I'm dying for you guys to have the, uh, ability
on Google plus to carry on the dialog and

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:44.820
the hangouts for films.Um, but on the cards,
it kind of says how you can post things, tweet,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.900
Google plus, whatever you can to get it out
to your networks that we're going to be in

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.060
the theater for a week in New York.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.230
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Okay.Great.Um, and then
before we open up to questions do you want

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.230
to show the short film?

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.330
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Do you guys want, ok, so I made
this film it was very much with YouTube, so

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.400
I thought it would be fun to show it.Do you
guys want to see a little four minute crowd

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.450
source film we made?

and, um, we showed it at interdependence day

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:37.080
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Sure.And, uh, my
other question, or my, is, uh, in the film

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:44.209
I was fundamentally optimistic, uh, and, uh,
you showed a lot of footage from, like, the

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:49.140
Civil Rights and, uh, JFK and the space program
and stuff like that which was great.But, uh,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:56.330
in the last ten years, especially, there's
been a lot of other stuff going on, uh, you

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.300
know, the film sort of had a--
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: It leaves on an optimistic note

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.970
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah, and, uh,
you looked at the arc of history as you sort

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.850
of sighted as progressive.You, uh-
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: I do believe, I mean, you know,

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.690
that's been the most interesting thing is
that the screenings tell how pessimistic a

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:18.100
lot of people are.And I guess, if you just
watch the news it would look like a pretty

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.250
horrible world that we live in.It's like it
highlights the worst of humanity and I think

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.292
that you could and I think that it's also
important that we highlight some of the potential

00:16:27.292 --> 00:16:32.570
of humanity.So I did put in the movie you
know this connectedness that's led to the

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.480
atomic bomb and all this news, but we didn't
blow ourselves up and we could've.And I ultimately

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.220
believe in the human species.I believe we're
moving the needle forward.The fact that I'm

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.450
a woman director up here right now means that
women's rights happened that meant so many

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.300
things had to happen for me to be sitting
here.I'm a Jew, my family almost died, you

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:54.170
know, we're evolving.Gay rights, I mean, I
just feel, like we're moving the needle forward.So,

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.971
if you believe that fundamentally and you
say and we have this tool that's gonna to

00:16:57.971 --> 00:17:02.089
have the potential in our lifetimes to connect
every person on the planet.What could that

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:04.100
world look like?

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.679
'Cause you have to at least imagine that in
order for it to happen.So I guess I hear you

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:14.299
that I am not Pollyanna in my sense of like
"Oh the internet is going to save the world."

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:17.780
There's been a couple articles that I was
like 'Ok'.So, people are going to save where

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.880
we go.The internet is an extension of the
human spirit.There's this great quote it's

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.720
like "Technology is neither good nor bad nor
neutral."

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:33.450
It's us.It's just us, like, telescope you
couldn't see far enough and our brains couldn't

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.730
grow big enough so we connect.So I just feel
like we can we have agency and we can direct

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:44.970
it and I hope that not only we talk about
it but we kind of direct it in a good way.So

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:50.480
I do leave on an optimistic note, 'cause I
am actually optimistic.I know it's rare these

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.780
days but.There's a great book called the Rational
Optimist by Matt Ridley, has anyone read that.And

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.720
he looks at throughout history and civilization
that innovation has always happened in cities

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.380
because the more people are next to each other
from different perspectives and that's usually

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.090
when big inventions happened all throughout
civilization.So we have the internet now,

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.820
that the potential is that we have this framework
for all these people to bump up against each

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.230
other from different perspectives and I think
that could hopefully solve some of our biggest

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.770
problems if we use it that way.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:25.260
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, seems as though
it has to evolve.I mean it had to have this

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.240
sort of big explosion before everyone figures
out where the pieces land.How to use it to

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.450
the best--
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Right and I think we're-- You know

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:36.280
I used to be a smoker, not proud of it.But
I used to smoke a lot and I think, you know,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.750
I quit like twelve years ago or fourteen years
ago.Sometimes I think like God, I can't believe

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:46.300
I smoked first thing in the morning or on
the plane.Remember when everyone was smoking

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.730
on the plane, like that's so gross.But I wonder
if we're going to look back on the way we

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.250
use social media way too much and be like,
I can't believe that person texted at a funeral,

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.380
like that is so rude!

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.299
Which I was at a funeral last week and saw
someone texting and, but I just feel like

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:06.121
how we swung way, 'cause we're just so intoxicated
with all this stuff and it swung so far in

00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:12.290
this way of there's no boundaries there's
no like, no that's not cool to use it then.And

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.590
I wonder about that.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.850
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, where the pieces
will fall.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.140
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Well the other thing about smoking--Did
anyone smoke in here, used to be a smoker?

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.140
No one?

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.140
Oh my God.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.919
[Chuckling]
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Ok I'm not going to use my other

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:25.390
-- none of you have ever smoked?

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.390
Wow!

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.470
See, we have evolved.Ok do you remember when
you'd be smoking and while you were smoking

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.980
you would think I want another cigarette while
the cigarette was in your mouth.That's the

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:39.140
way social media is to me.Like I'm doing something
and I'm wanting to do something else.It's

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:45.460
that same kind of addictive thing.I cannot
believe only two people in this room smoked.Well

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.950
that's, we've evolved.We learned that was
bad for us.Everyone used to smoke.Doctors

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.950
used to smoke.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.540
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah and you mentioned
that too, even cell phones, like when we're

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.540
kind of the guinea pigs.Right?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:01.251
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, I do think about that.I really
do use my earbuds, 'cause I think 'that much

00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:07.470
radiation against the brain' I don't think
that's good.And you know, the reason I put

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.020
that scene in, you know when my daughter,
they were, my dad was so against her getting

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:18.840
an MRI.Because, you know, radiation it's like
unclear on what that is doing.It's a lot of

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.370
uses of it and I'm actually, I'm not paranoid
about it, but I definitely use an earbud and

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.530
don't let my baby hold the phone to her head.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.559
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, which is very
hard to do, because every baby wants to play

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:30.860
with your cell phone.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.380
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: I know, she asked me, she's like
"Can I have some, can I have some phone?"

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.090
like she was asking for a lollipop.Can I have
some phone?

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.360
I was like, oh my God, she was like, wanted
it so badly.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.679
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: The other thing in your

00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:49.620
films, uh, you use a lot of archived footage,
which is wonderful, it's also very logical,

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.580
because it's economical, because you don't
have to go out and shoot that footage.What

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.420
I was thinking in this film was how interesting
it is that you're showing old, 'cause it's

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.780
showing how connected we are.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.970
You can make, you know, make these assumptions,
make these connections between old footage

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.970
and how interesting.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.740
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: To me, that's, you know, it actually
came from at Berkley, UC Berkley where I went

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.320
to school.There was no film production there.So
I actually had to make movies by recutting

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.290
old movies and then it kind of informed my
whole film making style.And now with the internet

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.730
I used to have to actually search for shots
and now I'm just like a kid in a candy store.I'm

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:25.330
on the web, I'm like, archival shot from the
'20s and like 20 images come up.So it's super

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:30.410
fun for me and but I also feel like I wanna
ground, I try to ground people in history,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.390
'cause that's another thing that we're so
not thinking about, the past.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.790
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah and I think that's
another wonderful thing about your film is

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.270
that it you give such a history and you're
teaching while then coming back and making

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:46.020
connections.Not to overuse the word with uh,
you know, your personal life and things.And

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.929
like I think your father had said, you know,
if you wanna go look for connections in the

00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:52.690
past--
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: That was always the way he approached

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:57.299
anything he was really, he always, I mean
even when he started working on Leonardo da

00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:01.130
Vinci I was like why are you, why are you
writing about Leo-- I really actually didn't

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:05.600
get it at first, like, why are so fascinated
with Leonardo da Vinci?

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.550
'Cause there's been so many books about Leonardo
da Vinci it was like it was like he was writing

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.450
a new book that hadn't been written.But he
did have a new, like he really thought Leonardo

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:18.390
da Vinci was like offering the future of our,
a glimpse into the future of our species.And

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.350
so he had to understand what made Leonardo
tick.I mean it's interesting.It is interesting

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.600
way to approach problems or the world.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.600
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, yeah.Please.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.730
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Hi there.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.250
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Hi
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: I'm very excited

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:35.380
for the future with the way technology's moving
so fast and I'm sure many other people are

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.410
here as well.At the same time I'm very concerned
about how it's just as you've mentioned it

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.910
spiraled out of control.I really enjoyed your
film because you've discussed the mindfulness

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:51.910
of or just being mindful about how technology,
how we use it, things like that.Now a common

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.320
problem I run into with friends, is their
all, like, in technology and stuff and I'm

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.470
trying to tell them we have to be, we have
to watch what we're doing.Things like that,

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.669
or that things become so well established
now.And if you contradict that you end up

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:09.150
sounding crazy.And I often do, so how do you,
how do you pass along this message?

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.030
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, I mean, we're, the good news
I can tell you is we've had premiers all over

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.290
the country and people are ready to talk about
it.You know I feel like I'm bringing up, even

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.630
the way I start the movie and we've all done
that right?

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.630
Right?

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:25.410
[Laughs] No, you're like with someone and
you go check your email in the bathroom 'cause

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.780
you're jonesing for an email hit.And I a lot
of people said it's like you called me out,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.760
you know, 'cause I'm talking about the thing
that we're all doing and um, people are ready

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.730
to talk about it.It's a very active dialog
in the feeders and online about it afterwards

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.190
'cause I feel like we're at that point where
we need to talk about it.And when I mention

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.660
the technology Shabbats people look at me
like I'm an alien.They're like, you unplug

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.660
every week?

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.280
And they're like, well I do that on vacation
once a year.I'm like, no it's about doing

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.160
every week is really what it's about, for
me.It's like a muscle you need to exercise,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.761
you're mind back into being in the garden
and reading and sitting with yourself, which

00:24:00.761 --> 00:24:07.429
is beautiful.And different and profound also.So,
I guess I feel like I'm trying to, I agree

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:13.289
with you.I'm extremely excited and I also
think we need to be mindful and conscious

00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:15.660
as humans, but I believe we can do that.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.120
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Thanks.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.290
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, thank you.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.980
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Then use technology
in order to have that time when you're in

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.480
the garden.Because you don't have to be at
your desk, you can answer the email, done,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.530
ok put it away, now go take a walk.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:32.000
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Yeah, I mean being a woman is so,
you know, great to be a woman today and I

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.419
can pick up my kids from school and have all
this freedom with technology to work in a

00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:41.611
different way, but we also, you know, we are
distracted, from what's right, the people

00:24:41.611 --> 00:24:42.611
right in front of us.

00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:45.390
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: On that note I have to go to a--

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.289
&gt;&gt;Female Interviewer: Yeah, you have another
event.Thank you very much, thank you for coming

00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:48.289
and sharing your film.

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:52.780
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Thank you so much, you're a great
audience.Thank you and thank you for the great

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.780
questions.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.780
It was great.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:54.781
[applause]
