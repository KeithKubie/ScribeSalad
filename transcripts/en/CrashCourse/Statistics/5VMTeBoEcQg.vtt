00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.260
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to
Crash Course, Statistics.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.040
We have to wait for a lot of things in life.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.809
We wait until we’re old enough to live on
our own, or go to college, or drive a car.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.660
Waiting can suck, and it’s even worse when
you don’t know how long you’ll have to wait.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.580
Luckily, in certain situations, probabilities
can help you guess how long it might take

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.160
for something to happen, like getting a full
house in poker, having your first daughter,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.620
or winning the lottery.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.980
INTRO

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.760
For example, you’re eating from a box of
Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans during

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.030
a fun, if risky, hang out with your friends.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.239
These Jelly Beans have some flavors that are awesome like Cherry and Peppermint, and some

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.160
not so awesome like Grass, or Boogers, or
Vomit. Ewww.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.760
The problem: you don’t know if you’re
gonna get a good or gross flavor until you eat it.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.400
And you know that your affinity for this game will go away if you’re ever unlucky enough

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.940
to come across one of those Vomit flavored
beans.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.550
Cinnamon!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.620
It's delicious.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.200
But how likely is it that you’ll be able
to eat 4 of these odd Jelly Beans before you

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.810
get that dreaded Vomit flavor and decide to
get new friends?

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.360
Turns out, there’s a formula to do this.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.690
The Geometric Probability Formula.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.500
This formula comes from The Geometric Probability Distribution, which looks similar to the Binomial

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.530
Probability Distribution that we talked about in the last episode.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.200
But they do something a little bit different.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.740
Geometric probabilities tell you the probability that your first success will be on your nth try.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.000
And success here just means the event we’re interested in happens, it’s not always a good thing.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.080
For example, the probability that your first
Vomit flavored jelly bean will be your 5th

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.920
Jelly Bean this means that the first 4 beans
were all not vomit flavored.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.720
Let’s pretend the probability of getting
a Vomit flavored bean is 5%, then there’s

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.030
a 95% chance that you’ll get any other flavor.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.900
As you remember from the multiplication rule.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:10.420
Our chance of getting four non-vomit beans in a row is 0.95 x .95 x .95 x .95 or .95^4.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.220
The probability of then getting the Vomit
bean is 0.05, so all together, the probability

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.480
of getting 4 non-vomit beans and
then 1 Vomit flavored bean is this or about 4.07%

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.860
In a more general form, The Geometric Probability Formula says that the probability of the kth

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.840
try being your first success, is the probability of failure to the k-1 power, times the probability

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.379
of success to the first power.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.890
Which is what we just did in the vomit jellybean example..

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.999
The probability of the 5th try being your
first success was the probability of 5-1 or

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.239
4 failures and then one success.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.251
If we graph the geometric probability for
all possible values of k, we get a Geometric

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.980
distribution that shows us the probability
of each trial being the first time we get a success.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.760
For example let’s look at a section of the
geometric distribution for finding the probability

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.040
that each trial is the first time we’d eat
a vomit flavored jelly bean.

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.269
You’ll notice that I said “a section of”
because the geometric distribution could go

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.409
on forever technically we could eat thousands of Bertie’s Beans and still not find any

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.290
Vomit Flavored ones...in fact that’s pretty
much what I hope when I eat them.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.650
It’s just very unlikely, which we can see
on our graph.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.200
As k increases, the probability of that being
your first success gets incredibly low, mostly

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.819
because you’ll probably have found the flavor that shall not be named already.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.779
Let’s look at another example: You’re
finishing up basketball practice and your

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.689
coach announces that you’ll have to make
one free throw before you can leave.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.940
You’re really bad at free throws, and you
have a 20% probability of making any given shot.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.820
So we can calculate the probability that the
first shot you make is your 10th shot.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.100
Plugging everything into our formula, we discover that the probability of this particular scenario

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.779
is this: or about 2.7%.

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:08.689
The Geometric distribution for this example looks like this which gives us all the probabilities

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.670
that a certain trial is the first time you
make a shot: But you’d also get to leave

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.150
if you made it before your 10th shot.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.750
To calculate the probability that you’ll
have to shoot 10 or fewer free throws before

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.720
you make one, we can add up all the geometric probabilities from 1 up to 10.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.660
This essentially tells us the probability
that it takes k or fewer tries before your

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.100
first success which you might remember from when we talked about cumulative distributions.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.540
A cumulative geometric distribution is incredibly useful because often when we ask questions

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.810
about how long we have to wait for a certain outcome, we want to consider whether it happens

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.850
before the nth trial.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.900
Like we said, whether it’s the first or
10th shot, you still get to leave practice,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.240
and it turns out that there’s a 89.3% chance
that before your 10th shot, You will have

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.560
made a basket.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.420
That make for a total of about 92% chance
that you’d make it on or before your 10th shot.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.640
If you want to find the average number of
shots you need to take before you score, you

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.211
can use the geometric distribution to calculate its mean, which is 1 divided by the probability

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.760
of success or this.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.080
The mean number of shots we’d need to take before we made our first would be

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.930
1/0.2, which is 1/(1/5) or 5.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.080
And this makes some sense.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.560
The smaller the probability of success is,
the more tries we’ll need--on average--before

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.010
we get a success.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.800
For example, if there’s only a 10% chance
that we’d make the shot, we’re really

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.820
bad basketball players we’d now need
to try an average of 1/(1/10) or 10 throws

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.900
before we sink that perfect shot.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.400
The mean and cumulative frequency of the geometric distribution can help you weigh your options.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.660
Say you’re at Target, and you see the display of Pokemon cards.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.370
You really want that Pikachu card, but let’s
say that the probability of getting one is

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.130
1/200.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.600
You have enough money to either buy 4 packs of cards, or Star Wars Episode VI on Blu-Ray.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.540
Star Wars guarantees ewoks.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.090
Pokemon means maybe Pikachu.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.300
You’re really into small cute animals...small
cute animals with Static ability...even better.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.690
You want that Pikachu.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.780
Is is worth it?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.110
If each pack of Pokemon cards has 10 cards, you’ll have 40 cards, each with a 1/200

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.530
chance of being a coveted Pikachu.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.700
The probability that you wouldn’t get a
Pikachu until your 40th card is only about

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.830
.04 %, but the cumulative probability that
you’d get a Pikachu on your 40th card or

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.950
earlier is about 18%, which isn’t bad.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.450
So now you’re left to decide whether it’s
worth it to forgo an evening with ewoks for

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.420
an 18% shot at getting your beloved Pikachu.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.760
That part is something statistics can’t
decide for you.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.500
Before we wrap up probability...let’s look
a really fun statistical paradox...the birthday paradox.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.840
There are 365 birthdays that anyone can have, we’re not going to count leap days-- to

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.080
keep things simple.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.260
So let’s say there are 20 people in your
classroom.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.690
What’s the likelihood that there would be
any shared birthdays?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.090
To me...it seemed like it’d be pretty low.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.220
Let’s assume that there’s an equal probability of having a birthday on each day of the year.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.860
That’s not quite true, but it’s close
enough.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.320
The first person we look at has a 100% chance of having a unique birthday, simply because

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.740
we haven’t looked at anyone else yet.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.110
The second person also has a pretty high chance of having a unique birthday, they could be

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:33.180
born on any of the 364 days on which person #1 wasn't born, so there’s a 364/365 chance

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.880
of having a unique birthday.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.340
Similarly person #3 can be born on any of
the 363 days on which neither person #1 or

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:48.420
person #2 are born, so there’s a 363/365
chance that they’ll have a unique birthday as well.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.740
And this pattern continues for all the people in the room.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:57.780
By the 20th person, there is a 346/365 chance that they have a unique birthday.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.810
Using the multiplication rule, we know that
the probability of ALL of these events happening--in

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.680
other words each person having a unique birthday-- is the product of all these probabilities.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.840
So the probability that everyone has a unique birthday is about 59%.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.920
That means that the other 41% of the time
at least two people will share a birthday.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.750
Once you get up to a group of 70 there’s
a 99.9% chance of someone will be sharing a birthday with someone else.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.800
This is one of those instances where statistics trumps my own intuition.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.360
And a good reason to be prepared for the possibility of double cupcakes if you have a big class.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.980
Probabilities are important.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.180
They’re things we use all the time.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.669
When you’re at your local diner and see
those super cool Crane machines, you might

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.980
estimate the probability that you can snag
that sweet stuffed otter by the time your

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.610
food arrives and whether it’s worth your
time and money to even try.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.360
Or you can use them to figure out that on
average, you’ll probably have to wait a

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.580
looooong time before you win the California State Lottery , like a really long time, on

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:01.499
average it should take you about 15 million
tries.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.589
That’s a lot o’ lotto tickets.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:05.440
Brandon made me say that.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.540
Geometric probabilities, and probabilities
in general, allow you to guess how long you’ll

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.720
have to wait for something, so you can decide whether it’s worth it.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.990
As the famous mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace once said, probability “is basically just

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:25.509
common sense reduced to calculus; it makes one appreciate with exactness that which accurate

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:30.170
minds feel with a sort of instinct, often
without being able to account for it.”

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.660
In other words, it allows us to quantify things we already feel.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.740
Probability assigns numbers to common sense.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.540
And we all need a little more of that.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.920
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time.
