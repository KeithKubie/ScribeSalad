00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.080
Here's one solution. First, the incoming position as copied over so I can

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.850
modify it's values. I then set the Z position with the formula given. I do this

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.040
over two lines and explain what each step does. The rest of the code remains

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.140
the same other than changing every use of the position vector with new

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.620
position.
