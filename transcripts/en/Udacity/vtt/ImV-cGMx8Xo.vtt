00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.210
Great.
Now you've learned all about

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.590
monetization strategies and seen how
to submit any game to an App store.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.770
&gt;&gt; We talked about how important it is
to start thinking about monetization

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.820
early on and went to with
the best design strategies for

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.000
finalizing your game.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like how your game's appearance
in the App store can help it stand out

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.330
And how it's okay not to have
the perfect game before you launch it.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.830
&gt;&gt; The important thing was to have
a strong game foundation, and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
then make changes as you go along
based on the player feedback.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.950
&gt;&gt; And you can get that feedback
directly from reviews or

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.980
from analyzing and
testing a game in real time.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.740
Taking what you have learned in this
course, you now have a leg up on many

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.090
developers who leave monetization
strategies just as an after thought.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.690
&gt;&gt; Congrats on finishing this course.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.090
&gt;&gt; Time to get working on a new game.
