00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:08.313
How did Dracula become
the world's most famous vampire?

00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:12.473
More than 100 years after
his creator was laid to rest,

00:00:12.473 --> 00:00:18.173
Dracula lives on as the most famous
vampire in history.

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:20.174
But this Transylvanian noble,

00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:24.524
neither the first fictional vampire
nor the most popular of his time,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:30.204
may have remained buried
in obscurity if not for a twist of fate.

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:35.944
Dracula's first appearance was in
Bram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same name.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.315
But that was far from the beginning
of vampire myths.

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:44.484
Blood-sucking monsters had already been
part of folklore for at least 800 years.

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:47.984
It was Slavic folklore that gave us
the word vampire,

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:50.605
or "upir" in Old Russian.

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:54.735
The term's first known written mention
comes from the 11th century.

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:58.075
Vampire lore in the region predated
Christianity's arrival

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:02.804
and persisted despite the church's efforts
to eliminate pagan beliefs.

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:07.755
Stories of vampires originated from
misinterpretations of diseases,

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:08.846
such as rabies,

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.106
and pellagra,

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:12.045
and decomposition.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:16.865
In the case of the latter, gasses swelling
the body and blood oozing from the mouth

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:21.557
could make a corpse look like
it had recently been alive and feeding.

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:26.136
Vampires were describe as bloated
with overgrown teeth and nails.

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:30.557
This gave rise to many rituals
intended to prevent the dead from rising,

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.666
such as burying bodies with garlic
or poppyseeds,

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.325
as well as having them staked,

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:36.227
burned,

00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:38.056
or mutilated.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:42.086
Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon
until the 18th century

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:45.987
when Serbia was caught in the struggle
between two great powers,

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:47.477
the Habsburg Monarchy

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:49.777
and Ottoman Empire.

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:53.217
Austrian soldiers and government officials
observed and documented

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:55.988
the strange local burial rituals,

00:01:55.988 --> 00:01:58.976
and their reports 
became widely publicized.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:04.007
The resulting vampire hysteria
got so out of hand that in 1755,

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.258
the Austrian Empress was forced 
to dispatch her personal physician.

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:11.038
He investigated and put an end
to the rumors

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:14.007
by publishing a thorough, 
scientific refutation.

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.549
The panic subsided, but the vampire
had already taken root

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.768
in Western Europe's imagination,

00:02:19.768 --> 00:02:22.858
spawning works like "The Vampyre" in 1819,

00:02:22.858 --> 00:02:29.168
and Joseph Sheridan
Le Fanu's "Carmilla" in 1872.

00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:34.817
This book would greatly influence a young
Irish drama critic named Bram Stoker.

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:37.976
Stoker, who was born in Dublin in 1847,

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:43.439
was famously bedridden with an unknown
illness until the age of seven.

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.210
During that time, 
his mother told him folktales

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.208
and true tales of horror,

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:54.263
including her experiences during
an outbreak of cholera in 1832.

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:59.099
There, she described victims buried alive
in mass graves.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.179
Later in his life, Stoker went on to write
fantasy, romance, adventure stories,

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:08.671
and, in 1897, "Dracula."

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:10.880
Although the book's main villain
and namesake

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.520
is thought to be based on the historical
figure of Vlad III Dracula,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.480
or Vlad the Impaler,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.090
the association is mostly just
that they share a name.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.950
Other elements and characters 
were inspired directly and indirectly

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.100
by various works in the Victorian Era,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.382
such as "The Mysterious Stranger."

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:34.510
The novel, upon release, was only
a moderate success in its day,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.842
nor was it even 
Stoker's most well-known work,

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:42.510
mentioned only briefly in a 1912 obituary.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.899
But a critical copyright battle would
completely change Dracula's fate,

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.571
and catapult the character
into literary renown.

00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:57.491
In 1922, a German studio adapted the novel
into the now classic silent film "Nosferatu"

00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.451
without paying royalties.

00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:03.052
Despite changes in character names
and minor plot points,

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:07.782
the parallels were obvious,
and the studio was sued into bankruptcy.

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:09.645
To prevent more plagiarism attempts,

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.702
Stoker's widow decided
to establish copyright

00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:14.912
over the stage version of "Dracula"

00:04:14.912 --> 00:04:19.460
by approving a production 
by family-friend Hamilton Deane.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.753
Although Deane's adaptation made drastic
cuts to the story,

00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:24.954
it became a classic,

00:04:24.954 --> 00:04:29.173
thanks largely to Bela Lugosi's 
performance on Broadway.

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:33.853
Lugosi would go on to star in
the 1931 film version by Universal,

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:37.512
lending the character 
many of his signature characteristics.

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:41.933
And since then, Dracula has risen again
in countless adaptations,

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:46.943
finding eternal life far beyond
the humble pages of his birth.
