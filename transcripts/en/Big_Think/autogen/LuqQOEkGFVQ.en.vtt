00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.020
What should governance of campus speech look
like?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.260
One is a morality and order paradigm, which
is to say, let's make sure that any campus

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.790
speech that we do have is the kind of speech
that we would really want our students to

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.140
hear, and let's make sure that we have policies
and practices in place that ensure that everything

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.260
they hear is appropriate.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.750
The problem is, if we take that approach too
far-- if, for example, we give to an administrator,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.989
or a central committee, the authority to determine
what should be said, and what shouldn't be

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.300
said on campus-- what students should hear
and what students shouldn't hear on campus,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.649
that means that, if they make a mistake, it's
going to be campus-wide.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.530
There's no there's no correcting of that mistake.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.589
And so, what I would prefer is a much more
bottom-up approach to speech governance on

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:01.589
campus.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:09.410
And a bottom-up approach really, in some ways,
mirrors what Oliver Wendell Holmes articulated

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.830
in his very famous dissenting opinion in the
1919 Supreme Court case of Abrams vs. the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.160
United States, in which he said, the ultimate
good really comes from free trade in ideas.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.280
And that marketplace of ideas, that idea really
started to change our approach to free speech

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.660
across the country in the latter half of the
20th century-- that we became freer and freer

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.260
in this respect, that we became less focused
on tightening up the morality and order associated

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.120
with free speech, and more having a default
of permissibility It's not an anything goes

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.050
proposition, it's not saying that there is
nothing governing speech on campus.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.480
It means that there are hundreds, maybe even
thousands, of different nodal points of governance.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.160
So in the case of a university, you have hundreds,
perhaps thousands of faculty members.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.790
Each of them access their own little gatekeeper,
in a way.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
Perhaps a better word than gatekeeper is curator.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.269
All faculty on campus are curators of speech.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.349
They think really hard about what goes on
their syllabus, and their reading list.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.969
They think really hard about their assignments.

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.569
They think hard about what guest speakers
they might invite into their classroom, and

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.650
not.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.329
That's a curatorial process, and it's a governance
process, and they are acting as gatekeepers.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.519
They're using their authority, their expertise,
to say, you know what?

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.280
That person over there is a credible scholar
that I want to either add to my syllabus,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.269
or add as a guest speaker, and they're making
that judgment on their own.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.280
Now, they may make a mistake.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.790
They may let in someone who perhaps didn't
have the credibility that they originally

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.060
thought, or they may miss people who really
merit a hearing, but they were perhaps too

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.879
narrow in their thinking to invite that person,
or to add that person to their reading list.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.310
The discursive space of the campus environment
is still contestable.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.029
It's still open for other points of view to
come in.

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:27.010
If I misslet's say I'm too ideological in
my choice of speakers or readingsand I miss

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.659
some really good people at a different place
in the ideological spectrum.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.450
If I fail in that regard, someone else can
pick up the slack.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.109
Someone else can notice, 'hey, noone else
is really assigning this really important

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.980
debate or reading, or inviting that speaker
to come to campus'.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.849
So that's what I mean about contestability,
that we need to have a discursive space that's

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.590
contestable so that error correction can take
place.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.290
An additional advantage is that it's much
less susceptible to corruption.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.650
If you have a centralized approach to campus
speech governance-- let's say it's one administrator

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.159
who gets to make the choices of who gets a
speaking slot on campus or one committee that

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:21.500
approves what can and cannot be assigned on
a syllabus for a class, for example.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.860
Now that would mean that there is tremendous
power concentrated in the hands of that administrator.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.770
Now you might say, well, let's fix that by
having a faculty committee be the central

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.569
focus, the central authority that governs
speech in this way.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:48.000
Still, even that centralized authority is
then going to become a source point potentially

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.650
for ideological faction to take hold.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.170
And it doesn't matter which side the ideological
corruption comes from, from the political

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.470
left or the political right.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.120
It's a problem either way.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:09.150
And so what I favor is a bottom-up governance
process, where if we're members of the campus

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.360
community we become a part of the curatorial
process.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.639
But none of us has so much power that we can
corrupt it.
