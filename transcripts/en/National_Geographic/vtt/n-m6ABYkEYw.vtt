00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.077
So, I first started
with equipment.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:15.514
<i> Women's side of Giant Bicycles
 'Liv' donated over 60 bikes.</i>

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:17.250
<i>Before the bikes were delivered,</i>

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.918
<i> I got the chance to
 ride with the girls.</i>

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:21.488
And it was probably the best day

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.189
that I've ever had
in Afghanistan.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.560
I can easily pinpoint the worst
days I've had in Afghanistan,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.829
and this by far is the best.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:30.963
<i> This is Mariam.</i>

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:35.568
<i> This is, you know, his
assistant, his right hand woman.</i>

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.637
<i> And she is the
 strength of the team.</i>

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.172
She is tough as nails.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.839
She's been run over
by a motorcycle.

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.042
She has crashed numerous times.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.745
She has been called
every name in the book.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.580
She's been insulted
multiple times

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.881
over the past three
or four years

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.116
that she's been riding bikes.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.886 size:28% position:14%
<i>These

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:53.886 size:34% position:83%
<i>Afghan
f Kabul</i>

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.188
<i>are doing this with great risk.</i>

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.892
But they're doing it
not just for themselves

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.427
they're doing it to inspire
other girls to ride.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:05.698
<i> So, I hired a little
 truck, brought all the bikes,</i>

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:09.702
<i> bussed in the girls to
 the province of Bamyan.</i>

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.837
<i> And we rode out.</i>

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.740
<i> We did a few laps
 around the city</i>

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.774
<i> to kinda get the
 feel of the bikes.</i>

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.744
<i> And played with the
 idea of riding</i>

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.245
<i> together for
 the first time</i>

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.147
<i> because we didn't have to
 watch out for potholes.</i>

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.382
<i> We weren't, you know,</i>

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.585
<i> avoiding cars and trucks
 and we looked--</i>

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:29.522
Okay, what's it like to
ride in a peloton tight,

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.058
what's it like to draft
off of each other,

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:33.959
what does that mean,
how does that work,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.397
lessons for me as well as a
mountain biker, not a roadie.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.500
<i> And the girls started
 to look like a team.</i>

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.803
<i> For the first time, they
 were riding together.</i>

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:47.173
<i> And while there's barriers
 between me and Afghan men</i>

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.442
<i> that are eliminated
 when I ride a bike,</i>

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.645
<i> the barriers that are also
 there between Afghan women</i>

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.847
of just... you know

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.248
a little bit of quiet,

00:01:56.248 --> 00:02:00.086
little bit of
distance and formality.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:02.354
When you're on a bike
that is out the window.

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.290
These girls are singing
Bollywood tunes

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.658
and dancing on their
bikes and shaking.

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:09.228
They're joking,
they're nudging each other,

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.696
they're nudging me,
they're shouting,

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.631
you know, teasing coach.

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:16.069
Acting like any other girl and
I get to be a part of that

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.503
in a way that I have
never been able to

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.539
connect with Afghan
women and girls.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.242
<i> Nazifa is studying
 to be a midwife.</i>

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.313
And is wanting to work
to save women's lives

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.514
and children's lives.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:31.017
But she also wants to
compete in the Olympics.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.686
And the reason that she says
that she wants to do that

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.488
is not for personal gain.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.556
It's because she wants to show
the world that Afghanistan

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:40.760
and this is her words, "is
more than drugs and violence."

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.629
She wants to show that
there are opportunities.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.365
And it comes back to everything
I have ever seen in Afghanistan

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:50.803
that keep me going back
and keep me believing

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.205
that change is possible, because

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.707
her face kind of... says it all.

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:58.744
That hope is always more
powerful than fear.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:01.147
<i> All of them have
 said at multiple times</i>

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.548
<i> because I have always
 checked in with them</i>

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:04.984
<i> one, as don't
 continue to do this</i>

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.752
<i>just because I'm supporting you.</i>

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.354
<i> Make sure that
 you're doing this</i>

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.022
<i> because this is the
 risk you want to take</i>

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:13.091
because you love it, and I will
continue to support you, but

00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.327
you are never letting me down

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.761
if you don't want to
do this anymore,

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.231
if for some reason the
security changes.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.767
And every single time each
one of them have said,

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.470
"change does not happen
by staying at home."

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.373
They realize that they
are on the front lines.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.075
They realize the
risks they take.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:31.877
Much more so than I...
could ever understand.

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:35.814
I get to go and come back here
because I have a passport

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.951
and I have a child here
and this is my home.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.221
<i> What's been really
 heartwarming for me has been</i>

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.458
<i> while the team is
 doing amazing things</i>

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.294
<i> to break open this taboo,</i>

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.962
what's really phenomenal is

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.565
there's two or three
groups of girls

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.567
that are learning to ride
bikes without a coach,

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:59.104
without any male influence,
maybe a brother here and there.

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:02.341
They're banding together
and riding bikes

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.577
in an effort to change
it on a social level.

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:08.647
Their specific goal is not to
race, their specific goal is

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.117
it takes boys 20 minutes
to get to school,

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:15.053
it takes us an hour or hour
and a half, that's not fair.

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:17.556
We should be able
to ride bikes, too.

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:19.658
And so what happened
in Bamyan was

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:24.130
I was back there in Jul-- June,
and I rode with two girls,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.098
who were riding
bikes and wanting

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.199
to teach others
to ride bikes

00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:30.169
so that they could get to and
from the Women's University

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.038
because the bus
line had stopped.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:37.309
In September, nearly 40
girls took to the streets

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.478
with t-shirts that
said, 'Right To Ride'.

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.314
<i>And Mohammed, who is one of the</i>

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:45.785
<i> Men's National Cycling team
 members was part of this.</i>

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:50.423
And it shows that men are a
huge part of this equation.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:54.526
That men and boys need to be
supporting women and girls,

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:55.627
need to be working together.

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:57.397
And that they are
working together.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.866
<i> I mean, this is probably
 one of my favorite photos</i>

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.367
<i> of that ride.</i>

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.904
<i> There's an incredible quote
 that has really stuck with me.</i>

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.975
<i> And I think that it really
 represents the work that I do</i>

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.677
<i> and how I feel about
 this whole campaign is,</i>

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:16.649
"change happens when
those who are unaffected

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.286
are as outraged as
those of us who are."

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.488
And that's what it takes.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:27.393
It's about realizing that
it's not always personal.

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.795
<i> But that you need
 to be outraged.</i>

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.530
<i> And that we need
 to band together</i>

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.867
<i> to believe that hope is
 more powerful than fear.</i>

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:37.837
<i> And that change is possible,
 no matter where that is.</i>

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.738
Thank you for coming.

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:43.743
( applause )
