00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.340
This is an underwater cave system recently
discovered by scientists.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.080
– Life has existed there for millions
of years without our knowledge.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.760
With regards to the ecology of these systems,
almost nothing is known.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.380
John Pohlman and his colleague, David Brankovits,
are researching these cave systems to understand

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.820
how life can exist here, in total darkness,
and with little oxygen.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.920
– We are providing an explanation for a globally
distributed ecosystem, that was unknown

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.920
to science until 30 years ago.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.320
Our primary objective is to go from description
of the animals inhabiting these systems

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.700
to, actually,  the processes that allow them to
live and flourish.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.440
Our research in the Yucatan Peninsula showed
that methane and other simple dissolved

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.120
organic material that is trickling in from
the jungle floor into the cave systems, and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.580
it's dissolved in the water, that it is being
used by microbes present in the caves.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.840
No one had imagined it operated this way before.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.980
We're hoping to understand exactly how external
factors related to weather, tides, hydrology,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.340
and all these things come together and wind
up creating a model for how the ecosystem functions.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.740
Because these questions have never been
asked before, John and David have creatively designed

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340
their own research equipment.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.440
This 300-meter copper coil will collect a
small sample of water each day for six months.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.260
It will serve as a history book of the water
chemistry in the cave, much like rings of

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.240
a tree can indicate the history of rainfall
in a forest.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.920
–  This is the osmotic pump.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.420
It's the osmotic potential between this salt solution and the fresh water: this very narrow tubing will be

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.340
connected into the copper coil so the water
is getting pulled from the other end.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.680
This will be something that no one's ever done before.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.200
– Charged.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900
Ready to extend.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.340
Go.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.000
It's going to be perfect.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.440
This is what we need for the field.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.940
I know that cave diving is not for everyone.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.530
I personally don't get claustrophobic, but
the first time I went underwater underground

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.370
it was breathtaking.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.069
What drove me was the curiosity.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.440
I wanted to see what's down there...

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.060
We typically penetrate the caves up to one kilometer
when we are doing research.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.620
The cavern environment is the part of the cave system

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.560
where you can still see some light shining
in from the sinkhole, but once you leave that zone

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.180
you are in the cave that is pitch black,
and the only light there is is the light that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.540
you bring with you.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.470
What's fundamentally important about these
systems is that we have freshwater, with

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.269
no oxygen, that contains large amounts of
dissolved material that can be food, but it's

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.120
not accessible to the animals living there,
the microbes in particular, unless it mixes

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.020
with the oxygen which is coming from beneath,
with the seawater.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.450
So, once those are mixed together, you have
all the ingredients for life, and then you

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.129
have growth of the bacteria.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.959
And then the higher-level organisms, the crustaceans
and the fish, they're feeding upon the bacteria

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.760
and that's what actually is supporting the
whole food web.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.800
When John and David finish this 6-month sampling
period, they’ll take everything back

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.840
to the lab, and hopefully begin to understand
this mysterious ecosystem

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.500
that has been hidden under our feet for aeons.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.400
Suddenly, you see a data set 
that actually tells you something

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.320
about the processes that sustain life in a
cave system.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.020
I mean, how cool is that?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.160
Those are the moments, the wow moments, that
make it worth it for me.
