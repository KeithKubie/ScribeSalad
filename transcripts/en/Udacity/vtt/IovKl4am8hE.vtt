00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.425
Alright, let's do this.

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:02.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.130
new. Oh my goodness. Why does it want all this information, Sam?

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.600
&gt;&gt; In order to sign up for a free developer

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.240
account, you have to give them a little bit of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.870
information. But giving them your e-mail, so that they can

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.000
send you the sign-up information to be able to log in.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.300
&gt;&gt; What if I didn't have a company? Could I just put none?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.710
&gt;&gt; You could put none. But it's asking for some geographical location just to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250
send you information about cool events that might be coming up in your area.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.350
&gt;&gt; What's the deal in here? Username,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.340
is that different from my email?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.700
&gt;&gt; The username can be the same as your email, but if you already have a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.010
developer edition account or any account under that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.990
email, it'll probably ask you for a new username.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.000
&gt;&gt; Oh. Oh yeah. Whoops, I need a new one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
&gt;&gt;

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.142
[LAUGH]

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:42.010
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what should I do? Just

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.160
like Andy, can I just do like Andy@udacity.awesome? Yup.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860
&gt;&gt; All right. I may have actually used

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.396
this one already, too. Yup. Let's do andy@udacity.sweet. Okay.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:52.358
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:53.323
&gt;&gt; No, sweet.

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:54.323
&gt;&gt;

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:54.610
[LAUGH]

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.420
So, the great thing about the developer edition account is, it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.650
free, it never expires, and it's your own little test environment

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.650
to build any sort of app that you might want to

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.190
in it. Okay. Says I should receive an email. Let's check.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.040
&gt;&gt; So, click into that.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, so this one isn't actually the login email, but

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.280
they send this out automatically when you sign up. It gives

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.900
you some cool links to getting started and, you know, learning

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.690
about the platform if you're new to it, but the other one

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.070
is the actual log-in link.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.528
&gt;&gt; There it is. Okay. Log-in confirmation. I'm not going to

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:30.250
read this. I'm going to click this. Okay. password, right. Alright.
