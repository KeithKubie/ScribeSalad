00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.880
One of the classic examples of median filtering is to

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.980
applying it to remove noise.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.190
So here I've shown an example of an image that has what is referred to

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.920
as salt and pepper noise.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.080
Basically what happens in this kind of this image, and it could be because of

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.120
a bad sensor, is some of the pixels or some bad sensor or some of the processing

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.630
errors, some of the pixels have either black value or white value.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.360
So if you notice, that's why it's called salt and

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.630
pepper, many blacks and many whites.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.750
Again, they're scattered all over the image in a random matter.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.060
We don't know where they are.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.550
But if you apply a median filter to it, you notice that all of the salt and

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.440
pepper noise is gone.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.590
You might be curious as to what happened if we do this as a simple averaging.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.095
This is the result of doing an averaging by 3 by 3 colonel, and

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:56.100
actually if you notice, to perhaps only magnified the salt and pepper noise.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.310
Now I'm just going to flip them next to each other so you can see and compare.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.410
This is the average.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.720
That's the median.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.620
Average.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.120
Median.
