00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.490
Genetically engineered plants that can detect
bombs could replace expensive electronic detectors

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.850
within a decade.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.929
And WASP-43b is a planet 260 light-years away
that features winds blowing at the speed of

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.240
sound in 3,000 degree temperatures which is
hot enough to melt steel.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
Vsauce!

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Kevin here.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.110
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.240
SpaceWorks Enterprises is designing a deep
sleep transfer habitat to help send humans

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.430
to Mars.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.370
Funded by NASA, the project aims to utilize
Therapeutic Hypothermia to slow down astronauts’

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.769
metabolisms inducing a sleep-like inactive
state for a prolonged period of time.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.219
Feeding would occur through intravenous nutritional
fluids delivered via catheter.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.850
RhinoChill is an intranasal cooling system
currently used in hospitals to induce therapeutic

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.550
hypothermia keeping cardiac arrest victims
in stable condition while waiting for treatment.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.649
But they currently only do it for up to a
week - not the 180 days it takes to get to

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.649
Mars.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.030
So a lot more research is needed to understand
its long term mental and physical effects.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.760
RoomAlive transforms your living room into
a video game.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.890
It uses projector-depth camera units to create
a unified model of the room and sends that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.110
information to a game engine.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.030
This proof-of-concept includes a holodeck,
a whack-a-mole game using a gun controller,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.540
a robot attack game, and booby trap virtual
darts shooting from the wall that players

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.740
try to avoid.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.230
All of which are just samples of how the system
creates augmented entertainment experiences

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.560
that can be setup in any room.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.920
White-footed sportive Lemurs don't like seeing
their family -- but they still care.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.240
So to let each other know they're okay, they
all pee on the same tree at different times

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.410
throughout the night.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.410
So yeah.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.560
A bionic eye has allowed this man to see for
the first time in 33 years.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.770
I first featured the Argus II Retinal Prothesis
Device on Mind Blow #59, and now Larry Hester

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.950
is the seventh person using it in the United
States.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.569
A sensor implanted in his eye picks up light
signals sent from a camera mounted on the

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.900
glasses -- not restoring normal eyesight,
but allowing Hester to see flashes of light

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.099
that help him differentiate his surroundings,
like telling the difference between a wall

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.099
and a door.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.760
So far, he says the best moment for him was
seeing, reaching out and touching his wife's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760
face.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.079
(Can you really see?

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.079
Yes!)

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.049
This is an animated map of a humpback whale’s
song.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.659
Michael Deal used shapes resembling the notation
of Gregorian chants to visualize whales' incredible

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:44.540
underwater music and hopes to further spread
awareness for saving whales.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.360
A Swedish truck driver has been using a mind-controlled
prosthetic arm for a year with no complications.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.209
The arm attaches to a titanium implant integrated
with the bone and it’s controlled with his

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.470
biological nerves and muscles.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.319
And they’re currently working on sending
that communication back to the brain to provide

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.779
intuitive sensory feedback allowing people
to also feel with the prosthetic hand.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.040
Indonesia’s capital is sinking into the
sea and they’re hoping to save it with a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.590
$40 billion dollar project that will take
30 years.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.029
Jakarta is dropping between 2.9 and 6.7 inches
per year mostly due to groundwater extraction

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.650
leaving large caverns under the city which
are collapsing.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.720
So the plan is to construct 17 new islands
and a massive sea wall in Jakarta Bay to protect

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.529
from flooding - with a waterfront shaped like
the mythical Garuda bird - the national symbol

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.390
of Indonesia.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.249
Researchers from the University of Southern
Denmark have created a crystal that can absorb

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.040
and release oxygen.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.909
A bucket full of the material, which is a
salt made from cobalt, can suck up and store

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.930
all the oxygen in a room.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.250
It can be reused many times without losing
its effectiveness and the hope is to someday

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.849
use it to drastically lighten oxygen tanks
-- a scuba diver would only need to carry

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.389
a few grains of the stuff because the crystal
could absorb oxygen from the water.

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.870
Finally, Susi Sie blends art and science by
using analog techniques to explore the mathematical

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.590
nature of unusual substances.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:58.830
I’m gonna leave you with a ping pong playing
robot - and as always thanks for watching.
