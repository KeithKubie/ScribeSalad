00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.563
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.563 --> 00:00:03.820
It's my pleasure to
welcome all of you

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.810
to Professor David
Patterson's talk.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.690
David Patterson probably
needs no introduction.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.500
He's been a professor
of computer science

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.630
at University of California,
Berkeley for 40 years now.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.620
And he's made a lot of
pioneering contributions

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.580
in computer systems, a lot
of which are technologies

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.990
we use at Google and elsewhere.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.990
So RISC, reduced
instruction set computers,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.260
RAID, Network of
Workstations, and a lot more.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.180
He has a pretty long bio here.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.650
I didn't realize he
has won 35 awards.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.497
And all of them are
pretty prestigious.

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:39.080
National Academy of Engineering,
National Academy of Sciences,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.885
Silicon Valley
Engineering Hall of Fame,

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.280
IEEE [INAUDIBLE] medal.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.870
And I'm sure I'm offending
some significant award by not

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.600
saying that, but he's had a
very distinguished career.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.950
And this talk today,
in his own words,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.560
collects advice that
I wish I had been

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.260
given when I started my career.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.280
And given how
distinguished that's been,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.200
I think it's a talk we are
ail going to benefit from.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.890
So, welcome.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.780
DAVID PATTERSON:
Well, this is-- what

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.009
happened is I decided-- somebody
wrote me these slides are

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.300
about how to have a bad career.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.120
I've been out there
for a long time.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.450
And they asked me if
there was a video of it.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850
And I couldn't find one.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.510
I actually figured out that
I gave this talk first 20

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.640
years ago, but I've
given it over the years.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.140
So I decided to
record it at Berkeley.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.510
And it ended up-- and
I announced my plans

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.810
to retire two days before this.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.440
So it got a lot of visibility.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.890
And it's fun to come here.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.900
As far as I can tell, all
of my-- oh, yeah, sorry.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.560
As far as I can tell,
all of my former students

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.090
are going to end
up here some time.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.590
Also, I have to ask
them, if they're

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.779
leaving, where they are.

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:44.070
I know where they're ending up.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.040
And so it feels like
it's a home week here.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590
As I said, this is
the advice I wish

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.310
I would've had in my career.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.385
This got started
about 30 years ago.

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:58.260
I decided I wanted to
give advice on talks.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.637
So I wrote, "How to
Give a Bad Talk."

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:01.720
And that was a lot of fun.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.320
And about 10 years later,
"How to Have a Bad Career."

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.140
And about a couple
years ago, I did "How

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.889
to Have a Bad Research Center."

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.050
So this is my bad series.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.265
Now I'm just going to put
the-- if you're interested,

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:18.640
these slides are certainly
available as well as the talk.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.560
And there's a lot
of papers and things

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.860
that you can cite if you
want to read more about it.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.100
And I'd like to thank a bunch
of people for making suggestions

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.610
that I've incorporated, or
their careers inspired them.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.890
One of those two.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.746
So the parts-- there's two parts
to the talk, the kind of tongue

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:38.120
in cheek how to
have a bad career

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.590
and then how to
avoid a bad career.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.810
And then I'll open up for
questions and answers,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.040
and then I'll wrap
things up whenever

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.530
we have to wrap things up
and take the last 5 or 10

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.680
minutes talking about my
story, how I got here,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.030
and what works for me.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.210
So you want to be a
leader of the field,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.790
especially if
you're in academia.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.960
So how can you do that?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.540
Well, invent a new field is
a really good way to do that.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.750
And you want to be the
only person in that field.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.910
So how can you invent a field
and then be the only person?

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.829
Well, one way is, different
from other fields,

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.120
you want to be the lone ranger.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.661
And a way you can
be the lone ranger,

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.620
the only one who is there,
is your personality can help.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.660
If you adopt the Prima Donna
personality-- and some people

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.390
don't know what
a Prima Donna is.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.990
But if you adopt
that personality,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.460
nobody will want
to work with you,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.750
and you can drive people away.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.624
And then you'll be the
world's leading expert

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:32.750
because you're the
only one in that field.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.090
In terms of the research
horizons for your new field,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.940
you want to have a lot of
flexibility on success.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.420
You don't want to get too far.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.640
And if you say
it's 20 years out,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.430
then you've got 19 safe years.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.350
And nobody's going to accuse
you of doing engineering

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.590
work if it's 20 years out.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.210
And stick to that topic
for your whole career.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.930
Now if I'd only
followed that advice--

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.890
my dissertation was
on micro-programming.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.790
If I had stuck to this,
I would absolutely

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.540
be the world's expert
on micro-programming

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.831
partly because no one's built
a computer with microcode

00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.890
in 25 years.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.720
And you kind of think of
it like it's like fashion.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.590
Skinny jeans are popular now.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.050
They were popular 25 years ago.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.466
If you had just kept them, you
could reuse your old jeans.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.540
So research is like that.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.410
Wait.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.240
It'll come back to you.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.370
OK.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.790
Let complexity be your guide.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.310
Confuse thine enemies.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.400
The best thing you can
say, it's so complicated.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.460
I can't understand what
you're talking about.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.770
You've done a good job.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.979
One reason is it's easier
to claim credit for things.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.478
If somebody else
has done some work,

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.220
you can say, well,
that was in my paper.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.678
And since they
don't understand it,

00:04:41.678 --> 00:04:45.110
how can they contradict you?

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.680
The other thing that's
surprising-- it's

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.860
really a lot easier
to be complicated.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.770
You read the first end
papers, and then you

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.770
figure out the next one.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.550
And people publish it.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.110
It's really much harder to be
simple than to be complicated.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.050
So that's the easy way to do it.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.274
And this sentence
captures it, right?

00:05:01.274 --> 00:05:03.440
If it's unsimple, how could
distinguished colleagues

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.250
in departments around the
world be possibly appreciative

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.140
and so on and so on?

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.681
There you go.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.540
That's the way to
speak and to talk.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.840
Never be proven wrong.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.610
The first thing you want to do
is don't implement anything.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.070
It's hard to prove you wrong
if you don't implement it.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.130
Now if some out of control
colleague builds something,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.740
then whatever you do, don't run
any quantitative experiments.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.100
If they're not quantitative,
then you can't be proven wrong.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.519
You've got the intuition.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.560
You can just kind of
extrapolate with the results

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.340
that there are, put that
in without any experience.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.870
And your job isn't
to help the critics.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.100
That's their job to figure out.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.080
Don't help them out.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.180
Now another reason
is that clearly

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.790
the success of the career is
to publish as much as you can.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.810
And it takes time to
build and to measure.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.020
So if you don't do that,
you can get more results

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.507
and have a more
successful career.

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:55.590
If somebody does it, the
last thing you want to do

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.756
is run any benchmarks,
because then they can compare

00:05:57.756 --> 00:06:00.010
your results to other things.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:07.680
The advice being that
you've got those safe years.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.930
And the benchmarks
can just-- the way you

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.170
get out of that is to
say, well, this computer

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.350
is for future programs,
not for current programs.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.110
And then these
benchmarks are too

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.337
antiquated to run
on my computer.

00:06:22.337 --> 00:06:24.420
Now the other thing that
we do in computer science

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.650
is we reject all the past.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.400
We're a new field.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.858
We're both science
and engineering.

00:06:28.858 --> 00:06:31.310
So we're not hide bound
by old fashioned things

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.760
like the scientific method.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.250
We have the computer
scientific method.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.320
Instead of a hypothesis,
we have a hunch.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.840
A sequence of experiments.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.010
We know that sequential is slow.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.696
So what we do-- we
change one experiment,

00:06:49.696 --> 00:06:50.820
all the parameters at once.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.860
That's much faster than
the sequential approach.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.560
Parallelism is a good idea.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.240
And rather than prove or
disprove our hypothesis,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.575
we discard if it doesn't
support the hunch.

00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:02.450
There's lots of data.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.227
It's a big data.

00:07:03.227 --> 00:07:04.060
Throw away the data.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.476
There's still
plenty of data left.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.664
And document for
others to reproduce?

00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:10.580
We've already done it.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.130
We'll have more
results of the field

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.970
if we don't waste our
time trying to reproduce

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.845
each other's results.

00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:17.390
That's the computer
scientific method.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.730
Don't be distracted by others.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.450
Avoid feedback.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.869
A big part of that
is conversation.

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:25.410
And if you don't
say anything, people

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.826
might think you're
not very smart.

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:29.850
So the corollary of that
is loud is smart, OK?

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.573
So be loud in conversations,
even when you don't

00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:34.000
know what you're talking about.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.310
People will think you know
what you're talking about.

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:40.810
If you're the world's
leading expert,

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.060
you don't really need
to read other things,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.120
because you're
the expert, right?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.240
And you don't have to interact
with others because they're not

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.670
as good as you are.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.640
In terms of doing
reviews for paper,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.850
if it's simple and obvious,
insult the prior authors.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.780
If you accepted something
simple and obvious,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.330
they probably thought of
it, so you should reject it.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.030
If they're quantitative
results-- and I've

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.620
gotten this review before.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.770
Well, I already knew that.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.050
So there's no
surprise to reject it.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.460
And everything else, you
might as well just reject.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.620
They're kind of competitors
to you in some way.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.450
And if their paper doesn't
get published, then you win.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.830
So that's a good guideline.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.075
Now, publishing journals
is technology transfer.

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.700
You're the leading
person in the world.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.270
You're the expert.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.978
All you have to do is
write in a journal.

00:08:29.978 --> 00:08:33.460
It's not your job to make
it understandable to others,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.090
to the ordinary engineers.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.320
Going to conferences just wastes
some of your valuable time

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.500
that you could be coming
up with new ideas.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.929
And having to interact
with industry and things

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.360
like that-- that's
a time waster.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.860
You write the journals.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.430
You're done.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.519
Now clearly, the winner is
the one with the most papers

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.560
at the end of the career.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.870
So I've come up with
this pyramid of success

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.660
for publication.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.180
It follows the rule of four.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.930
And the guideline is the
LPU, least publishable unit--

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.160
the LPU is good for you.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.482
So you start off with one idea.

00:09:03.482 --> 00:09:05.940
Then with the rule of four,
you get four journal papers out

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.140
of that.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.700
With the miracle of
world processing,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.880
then you can get 16
extended abstracts

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.890
and 64 technical reports
from one single idea.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.860
That's 84 publications
gets that.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.430
And then in terms of
getting credit for it,

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.450
my advice is to change your
name to the Swedish spelling

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.020
of Anderson.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.142
And then there's
the awkward time.

00:09:27.142 --> 00:09:29.350
Oh, how are we going to put
the authors on the table?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.750
You'll just say, well, I've
always done it alphabetically.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.920
All my papers [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.630
All right.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.330
Writing commandments
for a bad career.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.950
Thou shalt not define terms.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.900
That's what
dictionaries are for.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.310
And explaining things-- that'll
just insult the readers.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.980
So you want to be a little
bit more mysterious than that.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.340
Thou shalt replace I will
build with I have been built.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.094
Probably by the time your paper
gets published in a journal,

00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:00.510
somebody will have
implemented it.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.060
So it's OK to do that.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.190
Thou shalt not mention
drawbacks to your report.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.430
That's not your job.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.410
That's the job of the critics
to figure out the drawbacks.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.290
If you hide that,
they'll never notice it.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.380
Thou shalt not reference
any papers, again,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.860
except for maybe your own
or at your institution.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.350
And if the papers
were any good, they'd

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.780
be people at your institution.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.102
So don't do that.

00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:27.060
And then you should
publish before implementing

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.018
because that's when your
system is the fastest.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.402
OK.

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:33.860
Talk commandments
for a bad career.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.280
This is my bad career talk.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.030
Thou shalt not be neat.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.200
Why take the time to
spend it on your slides

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.330
to fix spelling errors,
grammatical errors?

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.410
You've can spend that
time on research.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.990
Thou shalt not waste space.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.380
You use up a lot of slides.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.420
That's a lot of kilobytes
being wasted there.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.280
You can save, like,
100 kilobytes a year,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.260
which saves some money.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.040
Thou shalt not covet brevity.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.360
Do you really want to
sustain the stereotype

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.810
that engineers can't write?

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.490
You want to show full
paragraphs, beautiful English,

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.690
and read it aloud.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.150
Thou shalt cover
thy naked slides.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.750
I'll show you what I
mean by that later.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.124
But you don't want to expose
the whole slide to everybody

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:20.630
and shock them.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.010
Thou shalt not print large.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.360
The important people
sit in the front.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.120
So who cares about
the guys in the back?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.220
Thou shalt not use color.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.430
Use of color indicates
uncareful research.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.260
You're emphasizing
some words over others,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.020
and it's just too
showy to use color.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.340
Thou shalt not illustrate.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.340
Confucius says, a picture's
worth 10,000 words.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.720
Who cares about the
wisdom of the ages, right?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.910
And thou shalt not
make eye contact.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.160
You want to be humble, kind
of pretend to be humble

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.740
and keep your eyes down and
try not to let anybody see you.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.562
Thou shalt not skip
slides in a long talk.

00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:02.187
I guarantee you, in
this room, somebody

00:12:02.187 --> 00:12:05.555
has looked at their watch,
seen how many slides they have.

00:12:05.555 --> 00:12:08.030
And their solution is,
I'll just talk faster.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.040
That's what people do.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.040
You prepared the slides.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.880
They want to see them all.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.921
And if you have to, just
cut off the conclusions,

00:12:12.921 --> 00:12:15.576
the last couple of slides
if you run out of time.

00:12:15.576 --> 00:12:16.950
And then this is
the golden rule.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.120
This one can save you, even
if you violate the others.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.400
Thou shalt not practice.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.390
How can you be spontaneous
if you practice?

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.170
It'll feel practiced
if you practice.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.350
So don't do that.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.790
That's the last
thing you should do.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.360
So here's an
example of doing it.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.160
It actually says PowerPoint,
but it's using Google Slides.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.450
So trying these commandments.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.350
So print small.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.670
Now these features,
some engineer at Google

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.610
put these features in.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.280
So you have to use them to
be a good Google employee.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.040
So you want to hide
your naked slides there.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.880
That's some variety.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.599
But again, no use of color.

00:12:58.599 --> 00:12:59.140
There you go.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.110
That's another
dramatic entrance.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.670
And then the next one
is just my favorite.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.644
I'm glad somebody
put the time in

00:13:07.644 --> 00:13:09.310
to put this in because
it's very useful.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.370
There you go.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.460
OK.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.070
So that was the
bad career advice.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.450
Let's talk about the
alternative career.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.940
This is taken from my career,
which spanned 40 years.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.390
So it's kind of an academic--
I hope it'll apply to here.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.000
It's in systems, not in theory.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.530
And I'll go through
these pieces one by one.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.770
So advice to writing bad papers.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.421
And again, I put some
writing tips there.

00:13:38.421 --> 00:13:40.670
The writing tips actually
have some grammatical errors

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.180
in them, following
my bad tradition.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.490
But you can go take a look.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.230
So do the opposite of the
bad paper commandments.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.360
Do define your terms.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.220
Distinguish will
do from have done.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.080
If you're writing
for critical review,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.240
reviewers are very
skeptical people.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.185
They're going to
assume the worst.

00:13:57.185 --> 00:13:59.060
They are much more
impressed if you point out

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.268
the drawbacks rather than
they have to discover them.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.200
And you have to measure
performance and reference

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.550
the work to be a scholar.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.200
And the good news is you guys
built a wonderful service

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.252
to make that much easier to do
these days in Google Scholar.

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:18.710
The best piece of
advice I ever got

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.640
was to read Strunk and White.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.690
Strunk believed in
brevity so much,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.980
he cheers brevity so much, he
couldn't write a long book.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.640
The book itself is
maybe 80 pages or so,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.620
and it's chock full
of good advice.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.850
Then the advice is basically
go kind of top down.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.850
You write a one page outline
with a tentative title

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.690
with budgets, how much
you need to write.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.000
That saves a lot of writing,
if you don't have to do it.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.460
Then a paragraph map, which is
a topic sentence [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.550
all the way through.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.640
And it includes
figures and captions.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.060
Even today in 2016,
it takes forever

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.360
on a computer to draw a figure.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.822
And since you're probably going
to throw that figure away--

00:15:01.822 --> 00:15:03.405
you'll change it--
the best technology

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:05.120
to do that today is
go to a whiteboard.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.204
You can have colored pens.

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:07.953
Take a little cell
phone picture and stick

00:15:07.953 --> 00:15:08.890
that in your document.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.860
That'll take you 1/10
the time as trying

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.680
to do something on a computer
because you might throw it

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.930
away.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.480
And then write the draft.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.440
I like the Scientific
American style,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.100
which has really long captions.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.220
Not everybody does that.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.600
But you can move text in there
and associate with the figure.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600
I think that works well.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.272
I really like tables a lot.

00:15:30.272 --> 00:15:31.480
There's a lot of dirty facts.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.860
I love putting them into tables.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.266
That works well for me.

00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:37.640
Then in terms of when you're
starting to polish the text,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.310
read aloud.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.450
Your ear is better
than your eyes.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.610
When I start reading a
document, and I forget,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.284
and I stop saying it
out loud, I lose track.

00:15:46.284 --> 00:15:47.700
But if you hear
the words, you can

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.150
hear terrible sentences
and grammatical errors

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.710
if you hear it.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.780
There's technology.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.381
In fact, I just learned
about this thing.

00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:56.880
It was from an
English professor who

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.190
taught a massive open
online course at Berkeley.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.500
I said, why aren't you
using a grammar checker?

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.291
And she said, this is
the world's best one,

00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:02.990
Pearson Writer.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.940
And it costs you a
whole $20 a year,

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.057
and it'll prevent terrible
grammatical errors.

00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:09.140
And even it'll help style.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.809
In fact, I was thinking,
you guys should buy this.

00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:14.350
It's one of the
things you're missing

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.808
from Google Documents
is a really--

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.390
and this is the
world's best one.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.790
I'm impressed that
they can pull this off.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.454
And then you get
feedback from friends.

00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:26.120
Of course, to get
feedback from friends,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.994
if you're writing to a
deadline, you actually

00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:30.520
have to get it done
early, which seems

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.510
to be science fiction, for
graduate students at least.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.470
But get it done early.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.970
Then it gives you time to give
to your friends for feedback.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.562
You can iterate.

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:41.020
And if you don't
do that, if you're

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.040
writing something for review,
then who's your reviewer?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.165
It's the program committee.

00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:46.580
And what I've seen sitting
on program committees

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.080
is a lot of the time the paper
gets rejected not because you

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.940
didn't do something.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.640
It's because the
program committee

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.450
didn't understand what you did.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.230
And if you interact
with outsiders,

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.300
you've got this
chance of clearing

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.350
that up as opposed to if you
just look at it yourself.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.570
OK.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.510
How to not write bad papers.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.355
Bad talks.

00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:07.540
Basically, do the opposite
of bad commandments.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.300
There's two parts,
preparation and practice.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.170
Most people take about
two minutes a slide.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.240
For some reason, I take
one minute a slide.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.750
I don't know why.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.250
You should plan on that, a
minute or a minute and a half,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.654
so you have plenty of time.

00:17:20.654 --> 00:17:22.570
And leave time for
questions since that's some

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.400
of the most important parts.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.500
Despite Google engineers
putting in spinning text,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.490
don't do that.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.074
And then, it's not
a speech, if this

00:17:33.074 --> 00:17:34.240
is the first time you do it.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.020
It's a talk.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.720
So you don't have to memorize
it, but have notes ready.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.050
Practice is the key.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.120
You want to do dry runs with
friends to get feedback.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.780
If you're giving a
professional talk, the way

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.930
you make an impression is
not only to give a talk

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.360
but how you answer
the questions.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.030
I think for those
of us in the field

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.940
a while, when you see
somebody give a dynamic talk,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.440
and they really
nail the questions,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.887
you pay attention to that.

00:17:59.887 --> 00:18:02.470
And then so your practice ought
to have really tough questions

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.640
so you can practice
tough questions.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.110
And then with modern
cellphones, you

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.990
can record yourself,
not only your audio.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.464
You can watch yourself.

00:18:12.464 --> 00:18:14.880
I got to tell you, it's going
to be a humbling experience.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.980
You'll hear the crutches that
you have in your verbal speech.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.880
I start a lot of
sentences with so.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.660
I say huh.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.500
You'll be shocked how bad it is.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.200
Everybody does it, and this
is the way you get better.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.450
And I practice everything.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.782
I think of it-- I
practice my talks just

00:18:29.782 --> 00:18:31.490
to show the students
that you're supposed

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:32.480
to practice your talks.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.790
But I practice my award
acceptance speeches,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.110
and they tear them apart.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.340
I would think an acceptance
speech is pretty good.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.412
But no, no.

00:18:40.412 --> 00:18:41.120
Make them better.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.440
So practice.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.040
OK.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.140
Now the other thing that I
was going to do in this talk

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.130
is quote Richard Hamming.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.970
Richard Hamming actually
came to Berkeley

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.100
when I was young as a
professor, a larval professor.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.450
And he gave this talk,
"You and Your Research,"

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.410
which is more or less how to
do great research like me.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.220
And so Richard Hamming of
Hamming code, you know,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.560
Hamming distance, the reason
memories don't make mistakes,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.120
spent his career
mostly at Bell Labs.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.450
And it's pretty clear
from watching these videos

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.211
he's a very opinionated guy.

00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:19.210
He's not saying, well,
maybe you should do this.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.310
He says, do this.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.140
But he watched careers
over at Bell Labs.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.220
He saw people fail.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.720
He saw people succeed.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.899
And I'll quote him, show a
one minute segment every time.

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:31.440
So this is him talking about
the importance of communication.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.490
And you'll get his
personality from this one.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.390
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.090
-Which brings me to the
topic of communication.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.045
You need to learn to
communicate orally

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:43.480
in talks like this,
written in written reports,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.114
and casual conversations.

00:19:46.114 --> 00:19:47.530
In the middle of
a conference, you

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.550
have to be able
to get up and say,

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.100
that's wrong for these reasons.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.450
Bing, bing, bing, bing.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.150
And you win.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.010
If you sit around
and say, well, I'll

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.135
write a report tomorrow
after I've thought about it

00:19:57.135 --> 00:19:58.890
some more, the decision's made.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.199
We go ahead, and it doesn't
matter what you do then.

00:20:02.199 --> 00:20:03.990
The ability to communicate
at three levels.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.580
Now, how do you learn it?

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.249
You can read books if you
want to, but forget it.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.040
The way you learn, as
far as I'm concerned,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.180
is every time you
go to a talk, you

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.670
listen, not only to the talk,
but to the style that's done.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.320
What talks are effective?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.010
Why were they affect?

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.844
What aspects of the
speaker can you adapt?

00:20:21.844 --> 00:20:22.687
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:22.687 --> 00:20:23.520
DAVID PATTERSON: OK.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.170
That's Richard Hamming.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:24.460
And then--

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.126
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:25.126 --> 00:20:27.110
-Which brings me to the
topic of communication.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.317
You need to learn to communicate
orally in talks like--

00:20:31.317 --> 00:20:31.900
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.816
DAVID PATTERSON: Stop.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.890
Stop, Richard.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.514
And then he-- he gave
this talk lots of times.

00:20:38.514 --> 00:20:40.430
This is the one that's
on your YouTube, right?

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.510
That's how I found it.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.217
But there was a text one before.

00:20:43.217 --> 00:20:44.800
And he said, in my
early days, I think

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.560
you should spend as much time on
polishing and presenting as you

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.330
did in the original research.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.060
Now at least 50% of it has
to go in the presentation.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.421
Now if you know Hamming's idea
of how do you encode memory,

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.420
it's beautifully presented
that almost everybody

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.160
can understand.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.420
So that was an example of him.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.490
He not just came
up with the math,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.340
but he laid it out and had a
very simple encoding thing.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.000
It's almost like a parlor trick.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.750
You can put a bit
pattern there, and it'll

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.250
tell you which one is wrong
from the way he does it.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.030
He made it very
easy to understand.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.020
And as a result, every
single computer in the world

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.160
uses his idea.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.899
But that was an example of
him following his own advice.

00:21:18.899 --> 00:21:19.565
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:19.565 --> 00:21:20.747
---this, written--

00:21:20.747 --> 00:21:21.330
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.442
DAVID PATTERSON:
Come on, Richard.

00:21:22.442 --> 00:21:22.941
Right.

00:21:22.941 --> 00:21:24.380
I think I can get him to stop.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.750
OK.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.870
OK, leading a project.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.270
Now I'm going to go through
the-- I think I said this.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.580
So academics have
bad benchmarks.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.940
Papers or maybe even
citations rather than impact

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.220
is what you're trying to do.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.252
I didn't realize
when I started, I

00:21:45.252 --> 00:21:47.035
have six phases for
winning your project.

00:21:47.035 --> 00:21:48.160
And we'll go through those.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.600
Selecting a problem, picking
a solution, running a project,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.900
finishing a project,
evaluating it,

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.780
and transferring technology.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.420
So let me go through
each of those.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.620
Let's go back to
Richard Hamming again.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.633
He's going to talk
about the importance

00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:01.070
of picking a problem.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.867
-And so I said, do you
mind if I join you?

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:04.450
So I sit down.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.616
And we talk about chemistry.

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:06.500
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.810
DAVID PATTERSON: Let
me set the stage here.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.850
So here's this pretty
opinionated guy

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.410
who studies how
people can be great.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.840
It's kind of a hobby of his.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.260
So at Bell Labs, one of the
greatest research institutions

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.200
in the history of
this country, he's

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.810
been having lunch
with physicists.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.320
But they start winning Nobel
Prizes inventing the transistor

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.190
and things like that
and got promoted.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.700
So he had to find a new group.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.570
So he decided to hang
out with the chemists.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.230
So he just kind of
butts his way in

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.954
as this outsider to
talk with the chemists.

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:36.620
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.170
---and things for a long while.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.770
And finally one day,
I walk in and say,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.760
if what you're working
on is not important,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.110
and it's not likely to
lead to important things,

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.290
why are you working on it?

00:22:54.544 --> 00:22:56.085
After that, I ate
with the engineers.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.600
That was spring.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.300
In the fall, going down the
long quarter at Bell Labs,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.870
my friend, a chemist, stopped
and said, you know, Hamming?

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.320
That remark of yours
got underneath my skin.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.820
I've spent the summer thinking
about the important problems

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.460
in my field.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.660
I have not changed my
research, but I think

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.930
it was well worth the time.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.860
I say, thank you,
Dave, and walk on.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.360
About two weeks
later, I notice he's

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.540
made head of the department.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.580
About 10 or 12
years ago, I noticed

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.560
he is a member of the National
Academy of Engineering.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.570
I have never heard of anything
about any other person

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.320
at that chemistry
table, not one.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.022
The one man who could
hear, if what you are doing

00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:41.980
is not important or not
likely to be important,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.930
why are you doing it?

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.020
The one man who could,
did become important.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.000
He did succeed.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.950
The rest of them who
couldn't hear didn't.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.500
It's that simple.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.640
If you don't work on
important problems,

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.460
you are not going to
do important things

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.116
except by the
dumbest of dumb luck.

00:24:02.116 --> 00:24:03.417
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:06.000
DAVID PATTERSON: And you realize
when he's giving these talks,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.541
the chemists that
he was sitting with

00:24:07.541 --> 00:24:10.020
were still around and could
hear him give these talks.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.180
A charming guy.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.430
OK.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.051
So selecting a problem.

00:24:19.051 --> 00:24:21.050
When I started at Berkeley,
I just jumped to it.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.970
I'll tell you about
it in the next one.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.450
Invent a new field
and stick to it.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:24.640
No.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.556
Try and do real stuff.

00:24:25.556 --> 00:24:29.725
Make sure other people think
it's important, not just you.

00:24:29.725 --> 00:24:32.090
It's particularly easy
to do that in academia.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.640
You're aiming for this positive
impact, big impact on computer

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.920
science and engineering.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.100
And stick to it
your whole career?

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.330
I think in this fast--
that's not what I did.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.620
In this fast moving
field, why not instead do

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.780
a bunch of short projects?

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.113
Because a lot of research
projects aren't going to work.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.310
These things always take
longer than you expect.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.560
And how are you going to
know if you work on something

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.976
for 20 years that this is going
to be an important problem

00:24:59.976 --> 00:25:01.960
for 20 years?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.180
And what we found by doing
lots of five year projects

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.587
is that learning was more
of the number of projects

00:25:07.587 --> 00:25:08.920
than it was the number of years.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.070
As you tackle something, it was
the new thing you learned from.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.742
And then a lot of times--
this, I'll say-- research

00:25:15.742 --> 00:25:16.450
doesn't work out.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:21.110
And you'd like to fail sooner
rather than fail later.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.280
What's worked well for
us is multidisciplinary,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.760
multi-investigator
projects, trying

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.420
to have somebody from multiple
fields on a single team.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.870
And then try and figure out
the strengths and weaknesses

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.000
of your local environment.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.124
Universities are different.

00:25:37.124 --> 00:25:39.530
There's strengths that
obviously Google has,

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.680
and there's weaknesses too.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.717
So try and figure out something
that matches your environment.

00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:45.800
And make sure it's exciting,
that you want to work

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.810
on it for several years.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.766
And what I've found is a
compelling prototype-- if we

00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:51.140
can build this
thing, it's really

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.370
going to be amazing--
is inspirational.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.700
OK, so that's
selecting the problem.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.070
My first project, when I got
to Berkeley 40 years ago,

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.311
I spent about a week
thinking about it

00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:03.560
and joined some other faculty.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.750
And it was
ridiculously ambitious.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.380
Three hardware faculty were
designing our own instruction

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.810
set, build our own chips,
build our own interconnection

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.229
network switches, board
systems, operating systems.

00:26:15.229 --> 00:26:17.020
We didn't have any
experience in any of it.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.170
We didn't have any
research funding.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.310
We didn't have any
computing or CAD tools.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.750
So what happened from all that?

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.250
You know, a couple
of papers, right?

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.740
Not bad for academics.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.224
Fortunately, I took a sabbatical
during that time and went away.

00:26:30.224 --> 00:26:32.640
And it gave me a chance to
think about things differently.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.265
And I came back and
did the RISC stuff.

00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:38.700
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have tenure today.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.140
Picking a solution.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.810
Let complexity be your guide?

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.880
No.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.370
Keep things simple, unless
you've got a really good reason

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.190
not to.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.340
I came up with this
phrase early in my career.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.510
It's intelligence beans.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.760
On any project, you have a
sack of intelligence beans

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.060
that you get to spend.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.810
So decide where you want to
spend your intelligence beans.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.612
And then were it
doesn't matter, you

00:26:59.612 --> 00:27:00.820
can use the common solutions.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.690
And the best result
you can possibly get

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.670
is afterwards for
them to say, anyone

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.002
could have thought of that.

00:27:06.002 --> 00:27:08.122
That doesn't seem
so complicated.

00:27:08.122 --> 00:27:09.580
Anybody could have
thought of that.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.470
You've achieved things well.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.120
Complexity costs everything.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.740
Longer design, construction,
testing, and debugging.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.157
And these delays lessen
the impact of what you do.

00:27:19.157 --> 00:27:20.240
So try and keep it simple.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.620
It's hard to keep things
simple, but that's the goal.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.680
The computer scientific?

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.571
Nope.

00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:27.820
You want to run experiments
to discover real problems.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.450
And as my friend John
[INAUDIBLE] says,

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.970
you use your intuition to ask
questions, not to answer them.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.190
We're really smart people.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.470
We can make up what we
think the answer is.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.215
But that doesn't
mean they're right.

00:27:38.215 --> 00:27:40.090
What we need is to figure
out the experiments

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.410
to figure out the real answers.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.060
So at Berkeley,
they ask me, well,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.600
how do you pick a
problem and solution?

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.600
What we've done
over these years,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.670
these five year projects is
before the end of a project,

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.550
we start meeting
for at least a year

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.730
to start talking about
what the next one would be.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.480
We spend that much
time thinking about it.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.275
Typically, what
we've done is saying,

00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:04.275
what are some interesting
technology trends that

00:28:04.275 --> 00:28:06.120
are happening over
the next five or 10

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.160
years that will shape
the future of computing

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.730
eight to 10 years out?

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.340
To see if the mix
of these trends

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.560
have some new opportunity.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.400
For RISC, it was probably
computer scientists

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.330
being able to do
integrated circuit design.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.270
There was Moore's law
that was taking off.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.830
So a 32-bit microprocessor
was plausible.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.260
What's the right way to
design such a microprocessor?

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.310
For RAID, personal computers
were getting popular.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.060
They started building
hard disks for them,

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.360
these so-called
small hard disks.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.620
They were inexpensive.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.590
Performance for input,
output was slow.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.720
Processors were getting
faster because of RISC.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.820
Disk performance was slow.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.710
Maybe we could do something
with a lot of them.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.680
For the Network of
Workstation projects,

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.810
not only were workstations
getting really fast,

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.970
but there were beginning to be
local area networks switches.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.790
Could we just build
a big computer out

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.430
of a bunch of these components?

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.650
And then how would that work?

00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:04.240
Another thing that we've
noticed over the years

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.550
is when you're all by
yourself, and you're

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.750
going to work in a new
field, it's very scary.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.540
But if there's a group of
you with different areas,

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.644
and you kind of go
after this thing,

00:29:12.644 --> 00:29:14.060
there's kind of
safety in numbers.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.704
You aren't all
risking your careers

00:29:15.704 --> 00:29:16.870
working on machine learning.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.411
But the three of
you working together

00:29:18.411 --> 00:29:22.290
seems not quite as scary
to be able to do that.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:27.400
And a big thing when
you've got these ideas

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.430
is to find people whose
opinion you trust and try

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.129
and get their feedback to
help you shape your vision.

00:29:33.129 --> 00:29:34.920
You don't have to do
exactly what they say,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.700
but you ought to hear
what they're saying.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.540
And then pick a good name.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.140
Apparently in some
parallel universe,

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.910
I'm in the marketing department.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.260
But it's not that hard.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.760
I have these
friends who show off

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.140
their Latin education who pick
some name nobody can possibly

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.640
spell.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.181
And they even have
a word for it now.

00:29:53.181 --> 00:29:56.060
You pick the name, and then
you backfill in the acronym.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.130
And so they're called
backronyms, right?

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.130
Nobody's ever going
to remember that.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.880
One of the projects my younger
colleagues picked is aspire.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.030
It's actually 11 or 12 words.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.760
Nobody but him can remember.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.739
So if that's true-- if you're
going to use the acronym model,

00:30:09.739 --> 00:30:11.780
it's got to be three or
four letters if anybody's

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.200
going to remember it.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.120
The way we do it is
put a bunch of words

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.120
on the wall that
describe the project.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.630
Vowels are really valuable.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.727
And you want to try, three or
four letters-- three or four

00:30:22.727 --> 00:30:25.870
letters that are an English
word that kind of have something

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.444
to do with the project.

00:30:27.444 --> 00:30:28.860
But I'm available
as a consultant.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.430
Running a project.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.709
You want to avoid feedback?

00:30:35.709 --> 00:30:36.750
That's one of the themes.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:37.250
No.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.590
We do these periodic project
reviews with outsiders.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.850
We've been doing them for 30
years, twice a year, three day

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:43.350
retreats.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:47.290
How many people here have been
to a Berkeley style retreat?

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:47.790
All right.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.982
That's like a dozen of you.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.970
And the outsiders are valued.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.930
Huge benefits to doing this.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.087
At the end, we get the
feedback from everybody.

00:31:03.087 --> 00:31:04.670
And we don't argue
with that feedback.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.430
We try and understand it.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.902
It also creates deadlines,
which are tough everywhere,

00:31:09.902 --> 00:31:11.110
but particularly in academia.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.400
It builds team spirit.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.030
And for the people
working on it,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.030
it gives them a chance
to communicate and spread

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.106
their ideas,
interact with others.

00:31:20.106 --> 00:31:21.480
Consider a mid-course
correction.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.320
Our first project
that I was doing-- it

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.864
was a multi-processor.

00:31:24.864 --> 00:31:26.780
The RISC ideas were just
starting to catch on,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.280
but they hadn't
been commercial yet.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.830
But by midway
through the project,

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.040
there were commercial
chips like MIPS and SPARC.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.761
We should have
redirected our project

00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:37.260
to be used in
commercial processors.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.230
But I felt like that was
breaking our promise,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.807
and we should have stuck with
the ones that we did custom.

00:31:42.807 --> 00:31:44.390
But we'd have had a
much bigger impact

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.934
with a multi-processor
RISC project

00:31:46.934 --> 00:31:48.850
then if we'd used
commercial instruction sets.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.710
So that's part of
our culture now.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.984
It's a five year project.

00:31:51.984 --> 00:31:53.650
Two and a half years
in, maybe the world

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.671
has changed in some way.

00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:56.170
And you should take
advantage of it.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.812
An example of that would
have been the RAD Lab, which

00:31:58.812 --> 00:32:00.020
was a couple of projects ago.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.810
We were doing internet services.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.350
And then cloud computing
got popular in it.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:09.310
So we embraced that, and that
became a big theme of RAD Lab.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.750
Pick the size and the members
of the team carefully.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.170
Tough personalities are
hard on everybody, not just

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.680
tough personalities for faculty,
even tough personalities

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.010
for students.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.160
It can make it no
fun to come to work.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.080
So try and get good people.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.820
I think Berkeley
consciously tries

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.710
not to hire Prima Donnas,
which makes it nicer.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.980
And if you have one expert per
area, it's a little easier.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.817
My colleague,
Kathy Yelick-- I've

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.900
got opinions about programming
language compilers,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.710
but when she speaks, I listen.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.980
And that makes it
easier to do things.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.590
Don't be distracted by others?

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.210
This is not going to be
so radical for you guys.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:49.340
But about 10 years ago, we went
to an open collaborative thing,

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.650
where we got rid
of faculty offices.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.610
What was happening is that
the students were staying home

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.460
because the computers were just
as fast, the networks just as

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.964
fast at home as
they were at work.

00:32:58.964 --> 00:33:00.880
And whether this is good
for a company or not,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.670
I'll leave to you.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.836
But it's terrible for
research because it's not just

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:05.478
put your head down
and plow ahead.

00:33:05.478 --> 00:33:07.852
You've got to talk to people
because you're not sure what

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.920
you're supposed to be doing.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.600
So we put it into
the open space.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.050
And now that I've read about
it, what you're shooting for

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.160
is communication
and concentration.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.042
So people can come in to work.

00:33:20.042 --> 00:33:21.500
They have to be
able to concentrate

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.590
enough to get the work done.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.820
But you want to have
spontaneous communication, which

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.260
leads to innovation.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.840
So bump into each other
and have meeting rooms.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.300
We've got the meeting rooms
optimized for discussions

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.350
and phone calls.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.157
Jeff Walz brought us
probably 10 years ago.

00:33:36.157 --> 00:33:38.490
And we saw what you guys did
with your conference rooms,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:42.220
and we imitated that.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.940
And like you guys, we have
kitchens and free drinks.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.020
We can't do food,
but we can do drinks.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.460
And the amazing thing,
it accelerates research.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.580
Who would've thought space
could accelerate research?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.550
It was startling what happened.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.390
We went from faculty offices
that had kind of white boards

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.394
there that were filled
with faculty reminders.

00:34:03.394 --> 00:34:04.060
And you came in.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.820
You got to work on,
like, one square foot

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.180
to put your idea in there.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.120
Instead, we had
giant whiteboards.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.670
There was no writing.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.790
You couldn't reserve it
in the high tech way.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.110
You copied it with cell phones.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.170
It became stimulating.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.270
People came in more.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.420
There were more
spontaneous meetings.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.000
And then we noticed the zero
to 60 time for new people

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.409
went incredibly faster by
having that kind of environment.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:33.210
So Matei Zaharia-- in
his second semester

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:35.070
there, he gave a talk
at Carnegie Mellon.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.510
And we've never had
anybody do that before.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.759
Now Matei Zaharia, who's
the founder of Spark,

00:34:39.759 --> 00:34:40.800
did a lot of good things.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.727
But it wasn't
obvious then that he

00:34:42.727 --> 00:34:44.560
was going to be that
good, as it turned out.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.179
And so maybe that had
something to do with it.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.560
And so Richard
Hamming has opinions

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.440
on this, based on
his experience,

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.940
which I'm sure
you're not surprised.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:55.440
OK.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.550
He's got two opinions.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.870
The first one is open
versus closed doors.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.820
And the only way he
can have this opinion

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.690
was to keep track of
all of his colleagues,

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.620
which ones kept the doors
closed, which ones were open,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.190
and which ones were successful.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.124
And here's his idea.

00:35:10.124 --> 00:35:10.822
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:10.822 --> 00:35:12.280
-The example I've
given you already

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.600
is working with the
door closed or open.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.489
If you work with
your door closed,

00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:17.530
you won't be interrupted.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.015
You'll get your work done.

00:35:19.015 --> 00:35:20.640
If you work with your
door open, people

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.960
come by and stop and
chat and so on and so on.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.140
But I've noticed very
clearly at Bell Laboratories

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.790
those work with the door
shut may be working just as

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.600
hard 10 years later, but they
don't know what to work on.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.960
They are not connected
with reality.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.610
Those who had the door
open may very well

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.920
know what's important.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.740
Now I cannot prove to you
whether the open door causes

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.030
the open mind or whether the
open mind causes the open door.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.840
I suspect both.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.860
I can only establish
the correlation.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.390
And it was quite spectacular.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.680
Almost always, the
guys with the door

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.190
closed were often very
well able, very gifted.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:05.530
But they seemed to work always
on slightly the wrong problem.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:09.020
So you have to get a wide
feeling for what is going on.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.980
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.160
DAVID PATTERSON: OK.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.050
And then he believed
that so much,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.880
that this is how his patterns--
how he handled Friday

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.590
afternoons, about
the importance,

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.470
especially for researchers--
you can start work really hard.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.460
But you could miss the
really important thing

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.662
by not interacting.

00:36:26.662 --> 00:36:27.650
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.880
-At the urging of some other
people partly and partly

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.930
of my own, I used to set
aside Friday noon and Friday

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:38.776
afternoon for great
thoughts, meaning, yes, I'll

00:36:38.776 --> 00:36:39.650
answer the telephone.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.330
Yes, I'll sign a sheet of paper.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:46.420
But mainly, what is the effect
of computing on science?

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.450
What the hell am I doing
with this computing machine?

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.170
How is it going to affect AT&amp;T?

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.320
What should I be
doing in computing?

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.000
What is the nature of software?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.430
My friends all after
a while got to know.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.980
Friday afternoon
is great thoughts.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.280
What's the nature of this,
that, and the other thing?

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.170
I spent 10% of my time trying
to answer the question,

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.490
what are the important
problems in my field?

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.390
10%, Friday afternoon,
straight through.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.140
Don't do it Monday
morning, because you'll

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.280
be interrupted immediately.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.565
If you do it Friday
afternoon, some of it's

00:37:18.565 --> 00:37:20.160
going to linger over
onto Saturday and Sunday.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.470
If you do it Monday
morning, there's

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.830
a hot conference at 10
o'clock, and bingo, everything

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.530
is broken up.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.460
I used Friday afternoon
for many, many years.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.830
I recommend that you find a
regular time to stop and think,

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.440
what are the important things?

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.730
What is going on?

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.530
What is the nature of
what you are doing?

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.010
What is the
characteristic of the job?

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.510
What are the
fundamentals behind it?

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.150
So you'll have some idea
of where you're headed,

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.140
so you can march in
a uniform direction

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.410
and get far rather than
being a drunken sailor

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.160
and getting nowhere.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.460
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.710
DAVID PATTERSON: And you're
free to ignore his advice,

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:58.160
but then your career is
that of a drunken sailor.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:58.660
OK.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:37:59.493
Finishing a project.

00:37:59.493 --> 00:38:02.190
I'll talk about this.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.610
People count the number
of projects you finish,

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.990
not the ones you start.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.140
And successful
projects go through

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.990
this unglamorous hard phase
of trying to finish it.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.740
And it's because design
is a lot more fun.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.300
It's a lot more fun to design
things, to make stuff work.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.490
But some positive things.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.240
Fred Brooks, one
of my heroes, says,

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.900
there's no winners on a losing
team, no losers on a winning

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.630
team.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.820
If you win, anybody involved, no
matter what they did, they win.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.660
Improve productivity
of team members.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.530
How can you do that?

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.990
Organize each day.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.330
Figure out when you're most
alert, when you need a nap

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.130
or exercise or sleep.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.720
When, how often should you
be reading and writing,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.080
programming and email?

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.610
And what I found, for
successful colleagues,

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:53.910
they always used to do lists,
daily, weekly, and even

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:57.880
every six months to see how
they're doing on their career.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.310
These days, there's this
idea of agile scrum,

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.770
where you meet in the same
place at the same time

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.500
and do sprints.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.150
I think this is a
pretty effective model.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.020
And then reduce the
project if it's late.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.210
Again, Fred Brooks said,
adding people to a late project

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.260
makes it later in his classic
book, "The Mythical Man-Month."

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.980
And finishing a project
is how you acquire taste.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.176
How do you get good taste?

00:39:19.176 --> 00:39:21.050
If you don't finish it,
you don't know really

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.872
what went wrong.

00:39:21.872 --> 00:39:23.330
And it helps you
pick good problems

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.030
and find simple solutions.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.710
OK.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.390
And then my friend
John Hennessy,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.450
President of Stanford,
said this a long time ago.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.130
You can quickly
tell whether or not

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.950
the authors have ever built
something and made it work.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.890
And if you never make it work,
you don't acquire that taste.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.361
Evaluating quantitatively,
never be proven wrong?

00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:43.860
Nope.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.390
If you can't be proven wrong,
then you can't be proven right.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.824
And you have to-- we need
reproducible results.

00:39:49.824 --> 00:39:51.740
You're trying to get
people to use your ideas.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.880
If they can't reproduce
them, they're not

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.171
going to take your word for it.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.780
And for better or for worse,
benchmarks shape our field

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.700
and especially in
the commercial world.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.350
If we have good ones,
it accelerates progress.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:07.240
Bad ones, then there's a
choice between helping sales

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.370
or helping customers.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:10.455
And often, sales wins.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.924
And then transferring
technology.

00:40:15.924 --> 00:40:17.340
It's not just you
write the paper,

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.400
and everybody starts using it.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.060
You have to go out and stump it.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.360
This last year,
there's RISC-V, which

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.560
is an effort to be able to
have an open instruction

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.680
set, an open alternative,
kind of like Linux

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.610
is to Microsoft Windows.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.157
So I gave talks
at 10 universities

00:40:36.157 --> 00:40:37.740
this fall to try and
get the word out.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.230
Then if they kind
of like the ideas,

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.313
then they read the papers.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.240
Of course, if you don't
pick a good problem,

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.990
people aren't going
to be that interested.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.430
And you can tell if it's a
good problem if more people get

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.310
interested over time rather
than yours start to do that.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:53.710
I think I am persuasive.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.710
The way I change minds is
with believable numbers.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.854
And so you have to collect that
quantitatively and believe it.

00:40:59.854 --> 00:41:01.645
The other thing I
learned late in my career

00:41:01.645 --> 00:41:04.390
is your personality affects
technology transfer.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.560
There's this person who
I won't name who had

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.930
a bunch of interesting ideas.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.201
And people wouldn't use them.

00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:10.950
And I talked to people
in the industry it.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.552
They hated that guy.

00:41:12.552 --> 00:41:13.470
They hated that guy.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.880
If there was any other
way to do it at all,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.252
they would use it
because that was

00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:20.460
the last thing they would do.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.664
So you can be a jerk if you
have the only possible solution.

00:41:23.664 --> 00:41:25.580
But it's kind of hard
to do that in computing.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.290
Maybe in biology,
you can do that.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.520
And then product groups.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.880
People don't want to change.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.430
There's risk
associated with change.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.050
It's worked for us.

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.810
And this goes back--
so Fred Brooks,

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.355
when he was a graduate student,
his advisor was Howard Aiken.

00:41:41.355 --> 00:41:43.282
And Fred Brooks says,
I think these people

00:41:43.282 --> 00:41:44.490
are going to steal your idea.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.510
These companies are
looking at his idea

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:49.490
at Harvard University,
a drum memory system.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.140
Watch out, Howard.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.975
And what Aiken said
in a southern accent

00:41:52.975 --> 00:41:54.440
is, "The problem
in this business

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.356
isn't to keep people
from stealing your ideas.

00:41:56.356 --> 00:41:58.085
It's making them
steal your ideas."

00:41:58.085 --> 00:42:02.140
And that's still true
today, 65 years later.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.580
So what's worked for us is to
find one bold group, often not

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.240
the leaders, but some bold group
willing to take a shot on it.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.680
And they are successful.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.970
And then kind of the rest
of the field is-- for us,

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:18.720
it was Sun Microsystems for RISC
and EMC for RAID and Inktomi

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.985
and then Google for
Networks of Workstations.

00:42:20.985 --> 00:42:22.860
But it's kind of like
the rest of the field--

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.410
oh, damn, they tried it.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:26.000
It works.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.090
OK, we'll change.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.160
Right?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.635
People don't really-- as
much as people enjoy ideas,

00:42:30.635 --> 00:42:32.010
they don't want
to take the risk.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.051
And then the other way of
transferring technology

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.420
is to start a company.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.840
In my 40 years,
everybody I've talked

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.760
to who's worked for a
startup likes doing it once.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.260
Absolutely.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.676
Now, there's some people who
love doing it more than once.

00:42:45.676 --> 00:42:47.790
A lot of people, once is enough.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.360
But everybody thinks
it was useful.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.530
They learn a lot.

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.580
And then if it works,
if it works out,

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.080
you see not just your
ideas but the product.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.380
And of course, you can
potentially make a lot of money

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.540
if that works out
and become famous.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.720
The downsides are that
you learn about things

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.310
you might not want to learn
about, particularly lawsuits.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.410
My friends have had
a lot of lawsuits.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.830
That's less fun.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.540
And you don't get to do
research and development.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.870
And then only 10% of the
startups make it, right?

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:21.370
But nevertheless, everybody
thinks it was worth it for once

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.260
in their life, maybe
when you're younger.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.040
So I didn't really
realize that there

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.250
were six roles to being
a leader of a project,

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.440
and it changes over time.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.770
But that's what I believe now.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:36.350
So wrapping things up-- and
there's time for questions

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.110
here.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.430
The goal is to have impact.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.300
Does it change the way people
do computing and engineering

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.120
in a positive way?

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.020
Now, we do these
five year projects.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:50.680
Now that my career is
ending, I will do 12, right?

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.420
They overlap.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.112
So I've been there 40
years, not 60 years.

00:43:54.112 --> 00:43:56.320
You can't tell if a project's
successful for at least

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:56.970
10 years.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.600
And the good news
is three of them

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.430
look like they're
pretty successful.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:02.330
They're 10 years old.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.860
So that's kind of 25%
batting average, which I'm

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.390
glad I did a lot of projects.

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:11.880
There are two that are finished,
but it hasn't been 10 years.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.270
The RAD Lab did Spark and Mesos.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.640
Those seem promising.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.210
The Par Lab did communication
avoiding algorithm [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.710
and this RISC-V stuff.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.439
But it'll take
five or seven years

00:44:22.439 --> 00:44:23.730
to know how significant it was.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.920
So maybe I'll get up to 5
out of 12, which is like 40%.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.690
But most of the
projects don't work,

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.710
so I'm glad I did
short projects.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.060
So solve a problem other people
care about, a taste that you

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.910
acquire by finishing projects.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.450
And then-- whoops.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.620
So OK.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.320
And I think the key theme
running over my career

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.530
is feedback, is figuring
out ways to get feedback.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.030
OK.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.594
With that, I'm
ready for questions.

00:44:49.594 --> 00:44:53.038
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.532
I there's a microphone here.

00:44:58.532 --> 00:44:59.990
AUDIENCE: Oh,
there's one here too.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.823
DAVID PATTERSON: OK.

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:01.356
Questions.

00:45:01.356 --> 00:45:02.730
Without the first
question, there

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.289
won't be multiple questions.

00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:04.955
Oh, there it is.

00:45:09.385 --> 00:45:11.260
AUDIENCE: Since you
asked for hard questions,

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.430
which of your projects
did you enjoy the most?

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.060
And which of them do you
think had the most impact?

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.550
DAVID PATTERSON: Which
did I enjoy the most?

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.270
Let me do the most impact.

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.620
Because I'm kind of
wrapping things up,

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.535
it's plausible RAID
had the biggest impact.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.520
Everybody uses it.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.455
The original RAID paper won
three Test of Time Awards.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:42.590
It looks to me, if I try
to be a neutral observer,

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:46.810
probably RAID is the
most significant so far.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.350
Which one did I enjoy the most?

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.720
I try and always make
projects that I really love.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.770
I try to make projects that
if I was a graduate student,

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:58.540
I'd just die to work
on this project.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.670
You know, gee, that's hard.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.170
Maybe--

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:04.230
AUDIENCE: Which of your
children do you love the most?

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.599
DAVID PATTERSON: Yeah, which of
my children do I love the most?

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:08.140
I don't know.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.590
The good thing about all the
projects, whether or not they

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.590
were home runs, is they
produced great students.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.850
And I didn't say
that in the slide.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.160
There were almost 300
students in those 12 projects.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.460
I had fun adding that number up.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.039
Jeff.

00:46:28.039 --> 00:46:30.580
AUDIENCE: So this isn't really
a problem for most of us here.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.400
But would you give
different advice

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.440
to a pre-tenure academic
versus a post-tenure academic?

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.606
Or do you think you can
do the kinds of things

00:46:38.606 --> 00:46:40.230
you're talking about
and not compromise

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.310
your chances of getting tenure?

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.184
DAVID PATTERSON: Yeah,
so people ask me this.

00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:47.060
So when Hennessy and I did the
RISC stuff, which at the time

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.920
was hugely controversial--
if you think

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.990
deep neural networks
are controversial--

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.350
a faculty member at
another institution

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.890
wrote a hit piece
on me personally.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.390
Dave Patterson's a bad person.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:05.350
We were talking about
instruction set design.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.464
But at the time, Hennessy
and I are were saying,

00:47:08.464 --> 00:47:10.380
Digital Equipment, one
of the leading computer

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.220
manufacturers in the world,
had a pretty stupid design.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.940
So yeah, we didn't
worry about that.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.480
Also, you have to believe
in what you're doing.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.420
I just can't give the
advice to do something

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:28.134
that you don't believe in
and work on that, because--

00:47:28.134 --> 00:47:29.800
in fact, when I've
visited universities,

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.427
and I've seen that-- this
assistant professor is telling

00:47:32.427 --> 00:47:34.510
me, well, I don't really
like what I'm working on,

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.010
but this is what I have
to do to get tenure.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:37.540
And then I go talk
to the chairman.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.240
This guy's just doing
incremental stuff.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.531
He's never going to get tenure.

00:47:40.531 --> 00:47:43.370
There's that gap there.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.265
When you're larval, you need
to make sure you publish.

00:47:46.265 --> 00:47:48.640
You need to go around and give
talks and stuff like that.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.730
But I think you got to do
projects you believe in.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.930
Otherwise, life's too short
to work on other things.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:56.430
Yeah.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.013
Question here?

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.420
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned a couple times

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.480
not to be a Prima Donna.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.360
So it's easy to identify other
people being Prima Donnas.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.585
But how do you tell if
you're being a Prima Donna?

00:48:12.585 --> 00:48:13.960
DAVID PATTERSON:
Are you married?

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.185
My family's really good
at pointing out my flaws.

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:27.207
Well, I think feedback
is the one-- I go out

00:48:27.207 --> 00:48:28.290
of my way to get feedback.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.390
If somebody hates my papers,
I send them new papers

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:33.930
because they tell me
the honest thing to do.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.605
I would like to think if
I'm acting like a jerk

00:48:36.605 --> 00:48:39.920
that I'm pretty sure
my friends or my family

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.910
would tell me that.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.770
I think you could ask.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.260
I think you can ask, right?

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.120
Geez.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.190
People are afraid to
tell you something.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:52.640
But I think if you asked, did
I handle that well or not-- I

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.860
think some people in academia
think that's the way people

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.860
know that you're famous.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:58.859
You've had some success.

00:48:58.859 --> 00:49:00.230
You start acting differently.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.910
It's just bad career advice.

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.770
OK Other questions?

00:49:08.142 --> 00:49:09.350
AUDIENCE: So full disclosure.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:10.766
I went to Berkeley
and experienced

00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:11.960
one of these projects.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.580
So I'm--

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.620
DAVID PATTERSON: Amin
was on the Network

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:14.500
of Workstations project.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.083
AUDIENCE: I'm biased
toward the model.

00:49:16.083 --> 00:49:18.470
My question is, given the
successful of the model,

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.700
why do you think more
universities haven't

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.201
adopted it?

00:49:21.201 --> 00:49:23.575
I mean, even though it seems
like the stuff you're saying

00:49:23.575 --> 00:49:25.514
is really obvious, it's
also somewhat rare.

00:49:25.514 --> 00:49:26.430
DAVID PATTERSON: Yeah.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.430
I got that exact same
question at Berkeley.

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:31.800
I think-- this time
I'll be less humble.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.060
You have to have somebody
who's willing to lead.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.880
For some reason, even the
wrestling-- as I'll tell you,

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.520
I wrestled in high school and
college as an individual sport.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.520
I had great
wrestling coaches who

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.495
realized we'd be more successful
if we bonded as a team,

00:49:47.495 --> 00:49:49.120
even though it was
an individual sport.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.250
So I had that kind of
role model going up.

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.451
And so I think I'm good at
kind of organizing teams.

00:49:54.451 --> 00:49:56.700
So you have to have somebody
who's willing to do that.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.160
The institution itself,
Berkeley, told me, day one,

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.440
have impact.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.220
They didn't have any problem
with multiple people working

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.720
on it.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.178
When you're an
assistant professor,

00:50:06.178 --> 00:50:09.191
you make up rules, like I have
to have only solo authored

00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:09.690
papers.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:10.940
Otherwise, I don't get credit.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.500
But yeah, that's not true.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.960
So the institution
let it happen.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.030
I think it was helpful.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.377
But I'm a good leader of people.

00:50:17.377 --> 00:50:19.460
But there's lots of good
leaders of people around.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.250
I don't understand why
that doesn't happen more.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.955
It seems common sense.

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:27.080
It's not like I've kept
this a secret for 40 years.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.490
I've been telling people
at lots of institutions.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:30.780
So I'm not sure.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.420
But we're a lunatic
fringe, right?

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.830
We put a group together.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:38.150
It's a different group
with interdisciplinary mix

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.710
and match.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.030
We tackle a problem.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:44.056
We've already visited you
guys on the next project

00:50:44.056 --> 00:50:45.180
to get some feedback on it.

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.720
I don't know why more
people don't do it.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.020
You have to ask them.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.309
Why don't more people--
you should ask them.

00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:52.850
Why don't you guys
act like Berkeley?

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.061
I'm sure they'd love that.

00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:57.515
There's probably a
nearby university.

00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:03.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I
think we have about five

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:05.400
or six more minutes
for questions.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.525
DAVID PATTERSON: All right.

00:51:06.525 --> 00:51:11.290
With that, then I need to
quickly give my life story.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:12.000
OK.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.960
So I'm an accidental CS student.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.632
I was a math major and wrestler
in high school and college.

00:51:18.632 --> 00:51:21.090
At the end of my junior year,
the math class was cancelled.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:22.500
I had to take a course.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.590
There was no CS major.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:27.230
So I just took intro to computer
science, and I was hooked.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.910
That was it.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:32.700
My senior year, I took every
computer course I could.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.160
I'm an accidental student.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.940
I went to UCLA,
graduate student.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.690
I just casually
mentioned at the end

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.197
of one of those
courses to a new PhD

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:42.030
that, boy, I'd sure
rather do this than work

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.430
in a factory to pay my college.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:44.960
And he on his own
went and found me

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.260
a job as undergraduate student.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.947
While I was an
undergraduate student,

00:51:49.947 --> 00:51:52.030
even though it was near
the end of my senior year,

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.946
that wasn't too late to
go to graduate school.

00:51:53.946 --> 00:51:56.000
And I asked my wife
about a master's degree.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.707
She said, sure.

00:51:56.707 --> 00:51:58.040
It's only four of rive quarters.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.250
And then when I got
into the office,

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.420
everybody else in my
office was getting a PhD.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.180
So I thought, maybe
I should get a PhD.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:09.080
So I decided to do that.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.120
We lived on research assistant
salaries, my wife and two kids

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.630
and I. We were at poverty
level at that time.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:18.590
And then the project ended,
and I lost my RA-ship.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:22.077
My adviser helped get me a
job at an aerospace company.

00:52:22.077 --> 00:52:22.660
He's aircraft.

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.360
And then it was touch and go
whether I'd ever finish my PhD

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.450
because I was working
20, 30, 40 hours.

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:30.570
But I did make it.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.380
I'm an accidental
Berkeley professor.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:36.652
My wife grew up right
next door to Berkeley.

00:52:36.652 --> 00:52:39.110
And when I was graduating, on
the interview tour, she says,

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.300
I can't help but think you're
going to end up with Berkeley.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.020
And I said, look,
Berkeley's up here.

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.420
UCLA's down here.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.110
I'm graduating.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.360
This is never going to happen.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.190
But she forced me as
a graduate student

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:53.260
to call the chairman of the
department at Berkeley computer

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.530
science to find out
about my application.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.130
So I called this guy.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:00.100
He said, well, Dave,
you're in the top 10,

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.460
but not the top five.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.826
And at the time, I'm
thinking, that wasn't so bad.

00:53:03.826 --> 00:53:05.950
So it turns out he said
that to anybody who called.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.742
But then he took my application.

00:53:10.742 --> 00:53:11.950
Yeah, that seems interesting.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.206
Handed it to somebody
visiting southern California.

00:53:14.206 --> 00:53:15.330
We had a good conversation.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:18.360
They invited me back to
interview and got a job offer.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.557
I barely got tenure.

00:53:22.557 --> 00:53:24.390
The first project, I
already told you about.

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:25.490
It was way too ambitious.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:28.680
I did the sabbatical,
and I did the RISC stuff.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.507
Tenure wasn't easy.

00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:31.090
I was one of those
guys that was using

00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:33.770
conferences, where the whole
campus used journals but us.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:36.347
So I was the Guinea pig
that went through that.

00:53:36.347 --> 00:53:38.180
The RISC stuff was
pretty new, but I got it.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.700
After that, things got better.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.390
But I still get papers
rejected by those jerks

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.650
on the programming committee.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:45.900
And so what have I learned?

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.710
What works for me?

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:50.740
For me, it was maximizing
personal happiness

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.810
versus personal wealth.

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:53.940
That's always been my guideline.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.380
In this country, you
think wealth is happiness.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.120
There's unhappy
billionaires in this world.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.060
They're not the same thing.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.664
Family first, especially
in that kind of a job.

00:54:04.664 --> 00:54:05.830
People ask you to do things.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.360
Your family can
go down the list.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.570
I made my family first.

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:11.770
So I did-- my wife
and I had two sons.

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:13.460
So I did Indian guides.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.700
I was the Cub Scout leader.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.030
I was the soccer coach on
their field trips out there.

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:19.409
So when my rebellious
teenage boy grew up,

00:54:19.409 --> 00:54:20.450
ah, you were never there.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:24.010
Then I said, Indian
guides, Cub Scouts.

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.010
So I went down the list.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:26.350
He said, oh, OK, maybe.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.630
Passion, courage, and optimism.

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:32.630
You might be able to tell
I'm a passionate guy.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:36.100
I have to believe the
thing I'm doing is going

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.010
to possibly change the world.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:41.730
My optimism story goes
back to high school.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:46.530
I started dating this girl who
was dating older guys who had

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.342
Corvettes and stuff like that.

00:54:48.342 --> 00:54:49.800
Nevertheless, after
a couple dates,

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.240
I asked her if she
would go steady with me,

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.320
as we would say at the time.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.850
She'd just been
dating older guys

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.360
and didn't now
what to say to me.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.151
She says, well, I don't
know how to say no.

00:55:00.151 --> 00:55:02.350
So me being an optimist
and a logical person,

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:03.190
not a no is a yes.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:05.710
So I said, great,
and I hugged her.

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:08.600
And she said, you know, I'll
let this guy down later.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.640
But we've been
married 48 years now.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.840
So I think that's OK.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.270
And then, yeah, I think
we swing for the fences.

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.770
Right?

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.520
That's that thing.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.274
Now another thing--
this is a saying

00:55:20.274 --> 00:55:21.940
that a colleague told
me that's actually

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.064
a couple hundred years old.

00:55:23.064 --> 00:55:26.610
Friends come and go,
but enemies accumulate.

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:30.020
So ironically, the
physical courage

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.810
that comes with wrestling has
to me been intellectual courage.

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:37.480
So when I was president of ACM,
the person in charge of DARPA

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.590
was cutting back on
academic funding.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.857
So I decided to take
him on with my friend Ed

00:55:41.857 --> 00:55:42.920
Lazowska in Washington.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.390
We tried to get people from
other universities to join us.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.995
But they were afraid this guy
would be vengeful and cut him

00:55:47.995 --> 00:55:49.980
off, I think with good reason.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.197
So it was just us taking him
on with editorials in "Science

00:55:53.197 --> 00:55:54.030
Magazine" and stuff.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.380
So this guy was not a fan of us.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:59.200
But we hadn't quite realized--
this was unintentional.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.660
But the other saying is, the
enemy of my enemy is my friend.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.370
So we made a lot of friends.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.600
But keep that in mind.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.180
Winning as a team
versus an individual.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:14.720
In my DNA, I believe a
team of average people

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.180
can work together
and beat superstars.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.660
And then I've already quoted
Fred Brooks about that line.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.000
Seek out honest feedback
and learn from it.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.670
It's easy to avoid feedback.

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:29.410
But that's how you get better.

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:33.350
The one warning sign I can
pass on from my 40 years,

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:35.522
always dangerous
is when somebody

00:56:35.522 --> 00:56:37.480
thinks they're the smartest
person in the room.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.859
There's a person in
my field who thinks

00:56:39.859 --> 00:56:41.400
he's the smartest
person in the room,

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.900
and everybody hates that guy.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.904
There was a president
of a university who

00:56:44.904 --> 00:56:46.070
thought he was the smartest.

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:50.040
That person was fired
for doing a lousy job.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.450
The people who
founded Enron thought

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:54.200
they were the smartest
people in the room.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.750
They went to prison.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:59.100
And I even have a
relative who thought

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.930
he was the smartest
person in the room,

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.390
and he's a convicted felon.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:04.400
So why would that be?

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.150
Why would this person--
they're probably smart.

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:07.941
And if they think
they're the smartest, why

00:57:07.941 --> 00:57:09.350
would it be such a bad sign?

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.690
I think it's that they don't
want feedback from anybody.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:12.930
If you're the smartest
person in the room,

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.350
you don't need to talk to
anybody about your idea.

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.010
So I think-- but
anyways, run away

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:21.157
if you find somebody like that.

00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:22.240
This thing happened to me.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.790
It was like God spoke
in my ear one morning.

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:28.030
And I remember waking up.

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.570
And it's not how many
projects you start.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:31.660
It's how many you finish.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.730
It was like in my
head, like somebody

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:34.860
was telling me what to do.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.670
So ever since that,
that's what I've done.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.960
So what I do is one
big project at a time.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.710
I do other things.

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:42.210
But there's one big
thing at a time.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:44.440
So when Hennessy and I
were doing our textbook,

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.650
that was the big thing
that I did that year.

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:49.730
When I was president of
ACM, I took a sabbatical.

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.740
So that was the one big
thing I did that year.

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.530
And so it turns out, if you
do one big thing a year,

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:57.620
over 30 years, you can
get a lot of things done.

00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.540
But a lot of
academics particularly

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.110
will work on 1,000
things at once

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.430
and not finish
very many of them.

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:08.060
And then have fun.

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:10.420
To be successful, you
do have to work hard.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:14.380
Our long lost colleague
Jim Gray-- even in his 60s,

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.790
he'd do one all nighter a month.

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.539
So you have to work
hard to be successful.

00:58:17.539 --> 00:58:19.675
But you have to have fun.

00:58:19.675 --> 00:58:21.800
As far as we know, you only
get one chance of this.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.630
And if you get to the end
without having any fun,

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:25.000
you've wasted a lot
of opportunities.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.666
I can put up with a
lot of stuff as long

00:58:26.666 --> 00:58:28.572
as I play soccer every Sunday.

00:58:28.572 --> 00:58:29.530
I can have a good time.

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:30.980
So that's my advice.

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.550
Thanks very much.

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:34.100
[APPLAUSE]
