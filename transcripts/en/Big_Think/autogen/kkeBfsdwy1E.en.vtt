throughout the stories the more he
 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.360
throughout the stories the more he
interacts with Watson because Watson

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
interacts with Watson because Watson
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.830
interacts with Watson because Watson
asks provocative questions he always

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
asks provocative questions he always
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.380

in the way that differentiates that from
 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.780
in the way that differentiates that from
kind of the multitasking or the

distraction that we hear a lot about it

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
distraction that we hear a lot about it
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.370

on on the better one sure so what you

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880
on on the better one sure so what you
 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.070
on on the better one sure so what you
like to do is definitely not

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080
like to do is definitely not
 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.150
like to do is definitely not
multitasking

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160
multitasking
 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.180
multitasking
that's kind of you know tasking at its

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190
that's kind of you know tasking at its
 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.770
that's kind of you know tasking at its
best because you're doing something very

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780
best because you're doing something very
 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.290
best because you're doing something very
specific you're kind of watching or

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300
specific you're kind of watching or
 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.910

letting your senses take everything in

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920
letting your senses take everything in
 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.400
letting your senses take everything in
so I think the the myth about

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410
so I think the the myth about
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.220
so I think the the myth about
multitasking is that you you can't be

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230
multitasking is that you you can't be
 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.130
multitasking is that you you can't be
looking at multiple things at once and

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140
looking at multiple things at once and
 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.280
looking at multiple things at once and
have that not be multitasking you can't

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290
have that not be multitasking you can't
 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.290
have that not be multitasking you can't
be doing multiple activities at once so

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300
be doing multiple activities at once so
 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.780
be doing multiple activities at once so
your brain can't be thinking okay I want

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790
your brain can't be thinking okay I want
 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.700
your brain can't be thinking okay I want
to do this but also I want to do this oh

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
to do this but also I want to do this oh
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.400
to do this but also I want to do this oh
I'm watching these people but also I'm

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410
I'm watching these people but also I'm
 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.560
I'm watching these people but also I'm
focused on what I'm going to order at

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570
focused on what I'm going to order at
 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.120
focused on what I'm going to order at
the coffee shop what I'm going to have

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130
the coffee shop what I'm going to have
 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.460
the coffee shop what I'm going to have
for lunch what I'm going to do after I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470
for lunch what I'm going to do after I
 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.320
for lunch what I'm going to do after I
leave the coffee shop what else I have

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330
leave the coffee shop what else I have
 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.090
leave the coffee shop what else I have
planned for the city if you were

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100
planned for the city if you were
 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.380
planned for the city if you were
thinking all of these things at the same

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390
thinking all of these things at the same
 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.840
thinking all of these things at the same
time then you'd be multitasking but if

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850
time then you'd be multitasking but if
 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.340
time then you'd be multitasking but if
you're kind of in the moment and just

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350
you're kind of in the moment and just
 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.650
you're kind of in the moment and just
soaking everything in using all of your

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660
soaking everything in using all of your
 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.730
soaking everything in using all of your
senses that's really sensory you know

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740
senses that's really sensory you know
 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.530
senses that's really sensory you know
taking in the moment in a very mindful

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540
taking in the moment in a very mindful
 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.610
taking in the moment in a very mindful
fashion which is the purpose of

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620
fashion which is the purpose of
 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.780
fashion which is the purpose of
mindfulness so I think those are two

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790
mindfulness so I think those are two
 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.220
mindfulness so I think those are two
very very different experiences and in

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230
very very different experiences and in
 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.560
very very different experiences and in
order to really I think to get a lot of

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570

questions from other mentor members who
 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.390
questions from other mentor members who
would have liked to have been with us

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400
would have liked to have been with us
 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.070
would have liked to have been with us
today but could not for technical

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080
today but could not for technical
 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.740
today but could not for technical
reasons so we've got Matthew J Clarke is

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750
reasons so we've got Matthew J Clarke is
 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.610
reasons so we've got Matthew J Clarke is
asking what are the current theories

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620
asking what are the current theories
 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.400
asking what are the current theories
about why task switching causes fatigue

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410
about why task switching causes fatigue
 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.680
about why task switching causes fatigue
and that's that's how he worded the

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690
and that's that's how he worded the
 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.570
and that's that's how he worded the
question and unfortunately folks aren't

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580
question and unfortunately folks aren't
 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.840
question and unfortunately folks aren't
here to do follow-up but of course so we

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850
here to do follow-up but of course so we
 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.000
here to do follow-up but of course so we
know that attention is an incredibly

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010
know that attention is an incredibly
 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.670
know that attention is an incredibly
finite resource so there's really only

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680
finite resource so there's really only
 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.160
finite resource so there's really only
so much of it to go around and we can

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.170
so much of it to go around and we can
 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.780
so much of it to go around and we can
train our attention so that we become

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790
train our attention so that we become
 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.850
train our attention so that we become
better but we'll never be able to make

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860
better but we'll never be able to make
 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.340
better but we'll never be able to make
it infinite and so one of the things

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.350
it infinite and so one of the things
 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.650
it infinite and so one of the things
that task switching does is use up

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.660
that task switching does is use up
 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.140
that task switching does is use up
mental energy so you need resources to

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.150
mental energy so you need resources to
 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.180
mental energy so you need resources to
switch your focus from one thing to

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190
switch your focus from one thing to
 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.060
switch your focus from one thing to
another and the theory is actually is

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.070
another and the theory is actually is
 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.400
another and the theory is actually is
very simple the more your mind is doing

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.410
very simple the more your mind is doing
 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.120
very simple the more your mind is doing
the more resources it needs and so every

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.130
the more resources it needs and so every
 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.710
the more resources it needs and so every
time you switch your attention you're

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720
time you switch your attention you're
 

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.900
time you switch your attention you're
actually switching circuits you're

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:55.910
actually switching circuits you're
 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.330
actually switching circuits you're
switching your focus you're switching

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.340
switching your focus you're switching
 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.400
switching your focus you're switching
control mechanisms behind it and that

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.410
control mechanisms behind it and that
 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.370
control mechanisms behind it and that
expense energy literally you can

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:03.380
expense energy literally you can
 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.480
expense energy literally you can
replenish it by having glucose or other

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.490
replenish it by having glucose or other
 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.370
replenish it by having glucose or other
other things that actually boost your

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.380
other things that actually boost your
 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.440
other things that actually boost your
energy levels so it's a very very

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.450
energy levels so it's a very very
 

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.210
energy levels so it's a very very
literal thing that happens your brain is

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:13.220
literal thing that happens your brain is
 

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.010
literal thing that happens your brain is
actually getting tired you're actually

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.020
actually getting tired you're actually
 

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.830
actually getting tired you're actually
losing resources and you're actually

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840
losing resources and you're actually
 

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.710
losing resources and you're actually
becoming less able to do other things

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720
becoming less able to do other things
 

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.380
becoming less able to do other things
because you use those resources for the

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:23.390
because you use those resources for the
 

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.750
because you use those resources for the
task switching now you no longer have

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:25.760
task switching now you no longer have
 

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.520
task switching now you no longer have
them to pay attention to the tasks that

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:27.530
them to pay attention to the tasks that
 

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.140
them to pay attention to the tasks that
you're doing there's a lot of really

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.150
you're doing there's a lot of really
 

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.880
you're doing there's a lot of really
interesting work that shows that people

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:30.890
interesting work that shows that people
 

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.480
interesting work that shows that people
who multitask frequently are less

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.490
who multitask frequently are less
 

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.760
who multitask frequently are less
efficient at task switching because

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:36.770
efficient at task switching because
 

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.910
efficient at task switching because
they're always they don't know how to

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:38.920
they're always they don't know how to
 

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.100
they're always they don't know how to
take those resources and really use them

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.110
take those resources and really use them
 

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.470
take those resources and really use them
to their full potential which i think is

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480
to their full potential which i think is
 

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.480
to their full potential which i think is
really fascinating because it ends up

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.490
really fascinating because it ends up
 

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.120
really fascinating because it ends up
that heavy multitaskers become worse at

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.130
that heavy multitaskers become worse at
 

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.890
that heavy multitaskers become worse at
the very thing that they should be very

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:50.900
the very thing that they should be very
 

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.100
the very thing that they should be very
good at right I've read some of that

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.110
good at right I've read some of that
 

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.780
good at right I've read some of that
research and yeah it's fascinating

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:55.790
research and yeah it's fascinating
 

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.250
research and yeah it's fascinating
because you know the sort of plugged in

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.260
because you know the sort of plugged in
 

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.090
because you know the sort of plugged in
millennial folks who you would think

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.100
millennial folks who you would think
 

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.430
millennial folks who you would think
would be the best at

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440
would be the best at
 

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.410
would be the best at
at this actually the more they multitask

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.420
at this actually the more they multitask
 

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.019
at this actually the more they multitask
it seems the worse again hmm you know

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:07.029
it seems the worse again hmm you know
 

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:09.360
it seems the worse again hmm you know
they become worse at being able to

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:09.370
they become worse at being able to
 

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.509
they become worse at being able to
filter out distractions and that's a

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519
filter out distractions and that's a
 

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.369
filter out distractions and that's a
good thing if you want to make sure that

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:14.379
good thing if you want to make sure that
 

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:15.900
good thing if you want to make sure that
you're paying attention to everything

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:15.910
you're paying attention to everything
 

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.189
you're paying attention to everything
but you also get off tasks very very

00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:19.199
but you also get off tasks very very
 

00:09:19.199 --> 00:09:21.840
but you also get off tasks very very
frequently and very easily which is not

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:21.850
frequently and very easily which is not
 

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.660
frequently and very easily which is not
a good thing so not being able to filter

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:24.670
a good thing so not being able to filter
 

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.730
a good thing so not being able to filter
out distractions can make you worse at

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:26.740
out distractions can make you worse at
 

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.699
out distractions can make you worse at
task switching to the tasks you actually

00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:29.709
task switching to the tasks you actually
 

00:09:29.709 --> 00:09:32.340
task switching to the tasks you actually
want to be switching to if that makes

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.350
want to be switching to if that makes
 

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.470
want to be switching to if that makes
sense yeah maybe like oh hey there was

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480
sense yeah maybe like oh hey there was
 

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.790
sense yeah maybe like oh hey there was
this distraction maybe I'll do that

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800
this distraction maybe I'll do that
 

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.240
this distraction maybe I'll do that
instead so in this regard do you think

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.250
instead so in this regard do you think
 

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.610
instead so in this regard do you think
that sort of we're all doomed given the

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:41.620
that sort of we're all doomed given the
 

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.639
that sort of we're all doomed given the
you know technological uh you know Moke

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:44.649
you know technological uh you know Moke
 

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.559
you know technological uh you know Moke
the sort of multitasking world that

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:46.569
the sort of multitasking world that
 

00:09:46.569 --> 00:09:48.569
the sort of multitasking world that
folks are growing up in now or are there

00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:48.579
folks are growing up in now or are there
 

00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:52.319
folks are growing up in now or are there
things people can do you know to to

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:52.329
things people can do you know to to
 

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:54.119
things people can do you know to to
counteract that I mean you know there's

00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:54.129
counteract that I mean you know there's
 

00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:55.619
counteract that I mean you know there's
concerns about people being addicted

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:55.629
concerns about people being addicted
 

00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:57.840
concerns about people being addicted
sure no I don't think we're all doomed

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:57.850
sure no I don't think we're all doomed
 

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.269
sure no I don't think we're all doomed
at all I think that technology is

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:00.279
at all I think that technology is
 

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.550
at all I think that technology is
wonderful and that we just need to be

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560
wonderful and that we just need to be
 

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.910
wonderful and that we just need to be
aware of how much you go pull it exerts

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920
aware of how much you go pull it exerts
 

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.769
aware of how much you go pull it exerts
on us and how difficult that can be to

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:07.779
on us and how difficult that can be to
 

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:10.679
on us and how difficult that can be to
avoid so what I would say is we need to

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:10.689
avoid so what I would say is we need to
 

00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:14.069
avoid so what I would say is we need to
learn to train our attention because as

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079
learn to train our attention because as
 

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.639
learn to train our attention because as
with anything attention is like a muscle

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:17.649
with anything attention is like a muscle
 

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:18.960
with anything attention is like a muscle
it's in the knowledge that you hear all

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:18.970
it's in the knowledge that you hear all
 

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.240
it's in the knowledge that you hear all
over and over in psychology self control

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.250
over and over in psychology self control
 

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.350
over and over in psychology self control
like a muscle

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360
like a muscle
 

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.970
like a muscle
you know everything basically you can

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:23.980
you know everything basically you can
 

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.800
you know everything basically you can
say hey it's like a muscle because it's

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:25.810
say hey it's like a muscle because it's
 

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.780
say hey it's like a muscle because it's
an analogy that works incredibly well so

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:27.790
an analogy that works incredibly well so
 

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.090
an analogy that works incredibly well so
if you train it it gets stronger it gets

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.100
if you train it it gets stronger it gets
 

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.670
if you train it it gets stronger it gets
better you are able to well weights you

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680
better you are able to well weights you
 

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.579
better you are able to well weights you
can you have more endurance and

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:35.589
can you have more endurance and
 

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:37.980
can you have more endurance and
similarly with attention the more you

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:37.990
similarly with attention the more you
 

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.230
similarly with attention the more you
train yourself to you need tasks and to

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240
train yourself to you need tasks and to
 

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.480
train yourself to you need tasks and to
only pay attention to one thing at a

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.490
only pay attention to one thing at a
 

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.819
only pay attention to one thing at a
time the longer and longer and longer

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:44.829
time the longer and longer and longer
 

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:46.980
time the longer and longer and longer
you're able to maintain your focus so

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:46.990
you're able to maintain your focus so
 

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.429
you're able to maintain your focus so
what's happening when people say that

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:50.439
what's happening when people say that
 

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:52.259
what's happening when people say that
they can't pay attention is that they

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:52.269
they can't pay attention is that they
 

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:53.910
they can't pay attention is that they
haven't trained their attention they've

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920
haven't trained their attention they've
 

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.749
haven't trained their attention they've
forgotten what it is to have a

00:10:56.749 --> 00:10:56.759
forgotten what it is to have a
 

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:59.490
forgotten what it is to have a
single-minded focus and because they

00:10:59.490 --> 00:10:59.500
single-minded focus and because they
 

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.660
single-minded focus and because they
haven't trained it their attention

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:00.670
haven't trained it their attention
 

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.549
haven't trained it their attention
actually has gotten worse so I think

00:11:02.549 --> 00:11:02.559
actually has gotten worse so I think
 

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:04.650
actually has gotten worse so I think
that people you know when they say they

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:04.660
that people you know when they say they

that you could take that a little bit
 

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.520
that you could take that a little bit
too far but you can learn to kind of

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:24.530

I think well what's the counter-argument

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.390
I think well what's the counter-argument
 

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.690
I think well what's the counter-argument
to that or why do I think that way so

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:37.700

it's really good to talk things through

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:19.730
it's really good to talk things through
 

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.050
it's really good to talk things through
and I think you often find that button

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:23.060
and I think you often find that button
 

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.970
and I think you often find that button
you see gaps in logic when you say

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:24.980
you see gaps in logic when you say
 

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.720
you see gaps in logic when you say
something out loud that before you you

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:28.730
something out loud that before you you
 

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.759
something out loud that before you you
never really voiced and so one of the

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:30.769
never really voiced and so one of the
 

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:33.280
never really voiced and so one of the
ways that can do that is if you think

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.290
ways that can do that is if you think
 

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.230
ways that can do that is if you think
that you know what you're doing actually

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240
that you know what you're doing actually
 

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.790
that you know what you're doing actually
pretend that you need to explain it to

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800
pretend that you need to explain it to
 

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.280
pretend that you need to explain it to
someone else and explain it

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.290
someone else and explain it
 

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.199
someone else and explain it
yeah out loud or you can even write it

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:41.209
yeah out loud or you can even write it
 

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.679
yeah out loud or you can even write it
out so writing is it is a good exercise

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:43.689
out so writing is it is a good exercise
 

00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:46.179
out so writing is it is a good exercise
to what you can say hey did I really

00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:46.189
to what you can say hey did I really
 

00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:48.730
to what you can say hey did I really
understand this because writing shows

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740
understand this because writing shows
 

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.780
understand this because writing shows
gaps in logic very very strongly so if I

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:52.790
gaps in logic very very strongly so if I
 

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.189
gaps in logic very very strongly so if I
write something and I'm like wait that

00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199
write something and I'm like wait that
 

00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:55.780

was a bit of sense in my head but on the
 

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.579
was a bit of sense in my head but on the
page it suddenly doesn't make sense I

00:16:57.579 --> 00:16:57.589
page it suddenly doesn't make sense I
 

00:16:57.589 --> 00:16:59.439
page it suddenly doesn't make sense I
have to try to figure out why that's the

00:16:59.439 --> 00:16:59.449
have to try to figure out why that's the
 

00:16:59.449 --> 00:17:01.499
have to try to figure out why that's the
case and anyone can do that

00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:01.509
case and anyone can do that
 

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.790
case and anyone can do that
anyone else you don't need to talk to

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800
anyone else you don't need to talk to

yourself you don't need to imagine
conversations all you have to do is

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:08.049
conversations all you have to do is
 

00:17:08.049 --> 00:17:10.689
conversations all you have to do is
write out your argument as if you were

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:10.699
write out your argument as if you were
 

00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:12.309
write out your argument as if you were
explaining it to someone else or write

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319
explaining it to someone else or write
 

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.600
explaining it to someone else or write
out your thinking as if you were

explaining it to someone else that's
 

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:17.949
explaining it to someone else that's
interesting yeah that's why it can be

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959
interesting yeah that's why it can be
 

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:20.230
interesting yeah that's why it can be
helpful to keep it a journal I know then

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240
helpful to keep it a journal I know then

helpful to keep it a journal I know then
I've experienced that in writing a

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.010
I've experienced that in writing a
 

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.399
I've experienced that in writing a
journal that you start writing you know

00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:24.409
journal that you start writing you know
 

00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:26.289
journal that you start writing you know
your thoughts about things and you're

00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:26.299
your thoughts about things and you're
 

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:29.799
your thoughts about things and you're
surprised to like your perspective on

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:29.809
surprised to like your perspective on

you might have thought it was in your

you might have thought it was in your
head so so I have a couple of questions

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280
head so so I have a couple of questions
 

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.190
head so so I have a couple of questions
of my own and maybe in the interest of

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200
of my own and maybe in the interest of
 

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.710
of my own and maybe in the interest of
time I'll ask just one of them and then

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720
time I'll ask just one of them and then
 

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.060
time I'll ask just one of them and then

otherwise I think that's a really
 

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.440
otherwise I think that's a really
interesting question and I think that

interesting question and I think that
 

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:21.070

to do so when you have no experience in
 

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.549
to do so when you have no experience in
something so experts can trust all of

something so experts can trust all of
 

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.200
something so experts can trust all of
their instincts and their common sense

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.210
their instincts and their common sense
 

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.740
their instincts and their common sense
in their areas of expertise and the

in their areas of expertise and the
 

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.930
in their areas of expertise and the
problem comes when non experts have a

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:37.940
problem comes when non experts have a
 

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.840
problem comes when non experts have a

really is just coming out of nowhere and
we do that all the time there areas

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559
we do that all the time there areas
 

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.860
we do that all the time there areas
where were expert but then we do the

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:47.870
where were expert but then we do the
 

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.570
where were expert but then we do the
exact same thing in areas where we're

exact same thing in areas where we're
 

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.180
exact same thing in areas where we're
not really expert so if you think for

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.190
not really expert so if you think for
 

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.100
not really expert so if you think for

know anything about the person so I

there if that makes sense yeah that's a
 

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:18.920
there if that makes sense yeah that's a
fun make sense okay so I think yeah I'll

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:18.930
fun make sense okay so I think yeah I'll
 

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.660
fun make sense okay so I think yeah I'll
ask one more question and then we'll and

then we'll turn it over to sit this is
 

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.910
then we'll turn it over to sit this is

at this point understand creativity I

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480
at this point understand creativity I
 

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.630
at this point understand creativity I

insights yet yielded anything that you
 

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.950
insights yet yielded anything that you
would think of as a sort of practical

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960
would think of as a sort of practical

etc yeah I think that we're starting to

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:00.420
etc yeah I think that we're starting to
 

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.990
etc yeah I think that we're starting to
understand creativity but it's a really

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000
understand creativity but it's a really
 

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.020
understand creativity but it's a really
really hard thing to study because there

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:06.030
really hard thing to study because there
 

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.150
really hard thing to study because there
are many different types of creativity

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:08.160
are many different types of creativity
 

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.500
are many different types of creativity
there are many manifestations of

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:09.510
there are many manifestations of
 

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.240
there are many manifestations of
creativity it's not like an overarching

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.250
creativity it's not like an overarching
 

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.850
creativity it's not like an overarching
entity you are or you are not creative

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860
entity you are or you are not creative
 

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.560
entity you are or you are not creative
you can be creative in different ways

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:15.570
you can be creative in different ways
 

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.320
you can be creative in different ways
and they're different ways of having

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:18.330
and they're different ways of having
 

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.320
and they're different ways of having
creative insights so psychologists

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:21.330
creative insights so psychologists
 

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.330
creative insights so psychologists
started a little bit

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.340
started a little bit
 

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.009
started a little bit
limited in that they have to study

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:24.019
limited in that they have to study
 

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:25.959
limited in that they have to study
things in a laboratory and so they have

00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:25.969
things in a laboratory and so they have
 

00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:28.119
things in a laboratory and so they have
to have an artificial paradigm and so

00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:28.129
to have an artificial paradigm and so
 

00:22:28.129 --> 00:22:30.039
to have an artificial paradigm and so
they try to figure out well okay how can

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:30.049
they try to figure out well okay how can
 

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:33.609
they try to figure out well okay how can
i approximate creativity um so that's
