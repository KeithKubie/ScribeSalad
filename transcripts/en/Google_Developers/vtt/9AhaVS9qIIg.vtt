DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.430
I'm Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.180
Today, my guest is
Louis Gray, my friend

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.790
and colleague from Google.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.090
We had a great show last week,
and I invited him back again

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.650
this week to go deeper
on luck and timing

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.710
and what it takes to
succeed as a startup.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.530
Welcome, Louis.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.640
LOUIS GRAY: Thanks for
having me on again, Don.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.370
Appreciate it.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.180
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.320
So we got into it a little bit
last week about luck and timing

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.490
and how that plays into success.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.180
We've both been in startups
where we worked hard,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.280
we had a great idea, we
did the best we could,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.570
and for various
reasons, it didn't work.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.160
How big of a part do you
think luck and timing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
played in some of those and
some of the ones I've done?

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.110
LOUIS GRAY: I think luck and
timing are significant factors.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.820
One thing about any
kind of business

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.640
is you're not in a vacuum.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490
If you're starting a
business in a place

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.150
has absolutely no
competition, you have to stop

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.670
and think, say, maybe I'm
not in a market at all.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.360
Maybe I'm deluding myself.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.670
Usually, you enter a market that
has significant competitors,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.937
probably two, three,
five strong ones.

00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:16.270
You have to find out what it
is that differentiates you.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.150
What is the market that you
can go after first where

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.030
you have the highest
chance of success,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810
and what do you need to do to
adapt your story as you try

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.310
and broaden that market?

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.810
When you look at timing, there's
also a lot of other factors

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.480
which you have absolutely
no control over at all.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.090
One company I was with, I
joined the company in '01.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.880
We launched our first
product in July of 2001,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.530
and the morning
of September 11, I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.320
was supposed to host a webinar
with hundreds and hundreds

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.850
of attendees talking about
our latest and greatest.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.540
As you can imagine,
that webinar didn't

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.860
happen because of other
factors, and the resulting

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.400
economic crises that happened
afterwards and people's lack

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.270
of willingness to
take more of a risk

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.780
and go to things that are more
entrenched and more secure

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.670
really impacted us as a company
and impacted our ability

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.919
to be successful.

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:03.460
And you don't have
control over that.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.430
What you do have control over
is what you have to offer,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.460
what you bring to the table,
how much attention you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.802
pay to the rest of the market.

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:13.760
What are the adjustments
that you need to make?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.330
How are your
customers responding

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.900
to what it is that you offer?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.080
And what are your
competitors doing well

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.810
that you could possibly
learn from and do better?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.060
DON DODGE: So
timing does matter.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.660
In the case of that example
you use, September 11,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.690
that was a big
catastrophe, and no one

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.050
could have predicted that.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.970
But there are other things
that you can predict.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.830
So give me another example
of where timing mattered.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.890
Let's talk about
Twitter and Ev Williams.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.120
So we always say teams
make the difference,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.980
but there are many
examples where

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.670
a really smart team,
experienced, tried something,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.306
failed, pivoted, failed, and
then did something that--

00:02:58.306 --> 00:02:59.930
LOUIS GRAY: I think
you and I both know

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.230
some of the players
on that team,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.850
but we're not intimately
familiar with everything

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.516
about that team.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.760
We start to learn more
as we read those stories

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.237
and talk to people about it.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:08.820
If you look at the
origins of Twitter,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.730
it came out of Odeo, which
originally was a podcasting

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790
company making
podcasting software.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.425
And when Apple integrated
podcasting directly

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.650
into iTunes, their market
essentially vanished overnight.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.440
And they came up with a
number of different ideas

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.800
to try and keep that
company going, one of which

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.700
was this status
update called Twitter

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.712
that Jack Dorsey and
others had come up with.

00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:31.920
And we all know what's
happened in the ensuing years.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.880
It really took off beyond
anybody's imagination

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.230
as far as we could see.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.760
And it's really
interesting to see

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.720
how they came to that
conclusion out of a company that

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.310
was in dire straits.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.130
And I think sometimes
when I talk about timing,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.442
sometimes companies and
products are ahead of the market

00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:49.900
where the market
doesn't exist yet,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.770
but they had a brilliant idea.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.880
Now, one of the examples I give
often is from Sun Microsystems,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.840
and Sun now is a little
bit of a dinosaur.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.690
It's gone back in time 10
years ago, 20 years ago,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.580
they were huge.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.121
And now in the
valley, they're almost

00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:05.660
like an afterthought
in a Wikipedia entry.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.510
But they had a product
called Sun Ray,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.610
and Sun Ray basically was a
web-based operating system

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.690
where you could plug in and
get all your content directly

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.730
from the main server, but have
nothing on your local drive.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.210
And when they originally came
out, it just didn't work,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.360
and there were issues with
broadband capability, people

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.470
not wanting to give
up the content they

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.162
have on a local
operating system.

00:04:29.162 --> 00:04:30.870
But now you see
something like Chrome OS,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.420
which I use every single day,
where it just makes sense.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.690
I can't fathom running
applications locally

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.450
and having files locally anymore
because the cloud has grown up,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.450
and web internet, the
speeds of the internet

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.090
have grown up so much as well.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.910
DON DODGE: That is
an excellent example.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.980
I remember working on
a network computer.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.030
Larry Ellison and Oracle came
up with this idea of a network

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.160
computer, and this
was back in '97, '98,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.040
which is exactly what
the Chromebook is today.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.880
So same idea, but the timing
was wrong with the NC,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.977
and it's right with Chrome.

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:08.560
LOUIS GRAY: You're
talking about 1998,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.100
and that was when
the iMac came out.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.225
And I remember hearing
rumors that if you held down

00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:15.506
the N key, it would boot up and
say, "Welcome to the Mac NC."

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:16.880
And the original
idea was that it

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.125
was supposed to have been
a network-based computer,

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:20.500
and then at the
last minute, they

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.116
threw in a four gig
hard drive, and it all

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:24.365
went off to where it is today.

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:26.180
But timing is a huge deal.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.450
I look at some of the work
that we did at BlueArc.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.710
The first years I
was there, we were

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.750
selling devices that
were exceptionally fast,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.840
things that were perfect for
post-production and geophysics

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.720
and bioinformatics.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.050
But it wasn't honed enough that
you could put it in a core data

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.160
IT center, and so
I would see people

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.730
who weren't willing
to take that risk.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.610
But if we had been maybe either
more developed and more fully

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.060
on board by the
time we launched,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.200
or if we had probably
launched two years earlier,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.820
we could have been
something dramatic.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.470
Our timing was just
off based on what

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.960
we delivered versus what the
market wanted at the time.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.950
DON DODGE: So another example
of timing that I use often

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.760
is Angry Birds.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.420
Angry Birds was the 52nd
game that this team built.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.570
So same team, same general
concepts, but the 52nd try

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.200
was a blockbuster
billion dollar hit.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.575
LOUIS GRAY: Which
everybody knows

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:23.560
and everybody's played
a million times.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.690
That's a really cool thing.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.600
I've met Mr. Angry Bird himself.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.587
I remember seeing him
at Google I/O in 2011,

00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:30.170
always wearing the
great outfit, and I

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.620
know our colleague Martin
Omander has met him

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.260
several times.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.718
But it's a really
interesting story

00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:37.290
to see you go from we're trying,
we're trying, we're trying,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.410
and we're not giving
up, into something

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.110
that looks like an
overnight success

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.337
because nobody was watching
their first 51 tries.

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:45.920
I know just before
the show, you and I

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.960
were talking about
some well known names

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.890
in the Valley like
Marissa Mayer.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.420
Marissa is now CEO at Yahoo
and had an incredible career

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.347
here at Google.

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:54.430
And you look at her story.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.846
How did she join
Google and become

00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:57.190
the first female engineer?

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.710
They were talking about
her having upwards of 15

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.550
or 30 different job
opportunities ahead of her,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.390
and she could have selected
something else with less risk.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.940
She could have gone ahead and
picked a consulting company

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.610
and probably done exceptionally
well, knowing her work ethic,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.320
but she wouldn't have had the
transformative career that she

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.470
had at Google and
now at Yahoo as well.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.580
You look at Steve Jobs
and Steve Wozniak.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.940
They both had interesting
careers at HP and Atari

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.760
developing Breakout, and they
could have just stayed there

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.690
and been comfortable.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.630
But instead, they wanted
to change the world,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.550
and went off and started Apple.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.200
And just a really interesting
scenario of taking a risk,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.220
and also finding the
right time to do it.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.040
DON DODGE: So in summary,
then, be really smart,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.170
work really hard, and
make the timing right.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.670
That's the--

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.586
LOUIS GRAY: Make the
timing right, and the way

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:46.930
you make the timing right is
paying attention to the way

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.320
the customers are responding
to you, the way the partners

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.070
and the other stakeholders
are responding to you,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.777
seeing what's happening
in the market.

00:07:52.777 --> 00:07:55.110
It was not the right time to
launch the network computer

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.820
in 1997.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.530
I believe the right time is now,
or two years ago when I first

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.760
got my first CR48.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.520
The ability to do
what you can do today

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.280
in an always connected
world is much different

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.650
than it was 15 years ago.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.350
DON DODGE: Louis,
this is awesome.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.780
Great show.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.490
And I think maybe we can
come back again and talk

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.770
about why now, because when
investors look at startups,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.850
they hear the pitch and
they look at the team

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.080
and they see everything, but
to get to the timing question,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.470
they say, why now?

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.330
And as a startup
entrepreneur, if you

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.890
can't answer that
question, why now, then

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.250
maybe you ought to wait.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:36.770
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.186
I think before we go, one last
thing I want to talk about.

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.570
When you hit Twitter,
would they ever

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.940
have succeeded without
the massive penetration

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.700
of mobile and smartphones?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.790
I think if they had just
been a website, just

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.050
another flat website,
they would never seen

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.860
the stratospheric
growth that they've had.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.470
And it all started with
mobile and the ability

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.470
to consume the content
right there on your phone

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.450
and update immediately
on your phone.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.197
And mobile has
changed everything.

00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:00.530
DON DODGE: I think you're right.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.400
Well, thank you very
much for joining us,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.380
and join us next
time when we get

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.910
into another topic
of great interest.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.080
Before we leave, I'd like to
remind you of a special offer

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.880
