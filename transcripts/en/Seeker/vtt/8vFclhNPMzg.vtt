00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.920
WE FOUND WATER ON MARS.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.450
THERE IS WATER ON MARS.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.450
AAAAAAAAAAAA

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.789
Martian fans
By now you've definitely heard, there's brine

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:13.789
on Mars.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.159
Salty, salty, brine.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.800
BREAK OUT THE BALL JARS GENT'S.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.970
LET'S PICKLE SOME CUKES.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.970
Yes!

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.000
They found water on Mars.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
But like, didn't we already find water on
Mars?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.260
Haven't we been here before?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.199
[[Anthony, water on mars clip]] Yeah, we did.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.500
Literally two years ago almost to the DAY,
NASA announced water was found in experiments

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.930
done by the SAM -- a portable robotic laboratory
living in the belly of MSL Curiosity.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.760
Well, back in 2013, we knew there was enough
water on Mars to cover the whole planet to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.280
a depth of 35 meters, but as far as scientists
knew, the water was trapped in quote "ice

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.260
caps, thick sequences of ice-rich layers,
and mantles of snow."

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.061
In fact, the Wikipedia page at the end of
the year in 2013 uses the Journal Icarus as

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:58.120
a source and says quote "Some liquid water
may occur transiently on the Martian surface

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.490
today but only under certain conditions."

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.180
The journal says their experiments indicate
there could be water in seasonal melts on

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.180
Martian slopes.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.360
Well GUESS WHAT Michael H Hecht!

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
YOU WERE RIGHT.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.230
The newest discovery says just that!

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.290
In a paper published in Nature Geoscience,
researchers announced the Mars Reconnaissance

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.160
Orbiter has found signs that water may flow
intermittently on present day Mars, showing,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.560
yet again, that though science moves slowly,
it bends toward the truth.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.110
The water in question is very salty water…
technically, it's hydrated perchlorate.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.330
Water mixed with high concentrations of salt
has a lower freezing temperature than pure

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.549
water, so it can still flow on the slopes
of Mars even when temperatures are as low

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.110
as minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F).

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.229
That's cold.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.150
Salty water means there might be life in it,
because pure water would freeze, killing any

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.630
life present.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.340
Perchlorates have been known on Mars for years.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.040
Phoenix found some in 2007, and Curiosity
in April 2015 found calcium perchlorates.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.780
Under the right conditions these perchlorates
absorb water vapor from the air, and then

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.119
FLOW.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.469
But you shouldn't picture rivers and streams
for this water.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.310
Instead, as best as I and DiscoveryNews' space
producer Dr. Ian O'Neill can figure, it's

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.340
probably a denser sludgy water that appears
in the warmer season and disappears in the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.340
colder.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.110
The very salty water is still super cold and
highly toxic to humans, it would damage the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.459
thyroid, but even so salted, it might not
be toxic to everything.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.709
NewScientist reminds readers in the Atacama
desert, microbes can live on salts which absorb

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.319
moisture from that, the driest atmosphere
on Earth.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.569
And, according to a 2012 study, Mars may have
had an ocean that could sustain bacteria 3.5

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.519
billion years ago (Oceanus Borealis) covering
38 percent of the planet.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.329
In the intervening years, Mars' low gravity
and thin atmosphere allowed the water to slowly

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.950
escape into space… leaving what we find
today, but even still, water is a huge win

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.700
for scientists, and it's incredible that we
can find it in liquid form on our neighbor

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
planet.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.169
The question now, is where this water is coming
from?

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.359
Mars can reach 100 percent atmospheric humidity
on winter nights, so some believe the perchlorates

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.189
absorb water from the humid Martian air, others
think it might come from underground aquifers.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.049
Scientists can't be sure without more data.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.459
Finding water increases the chances even more
of finding evidence of life off of our planet.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.189
Curiosity is only 50 kilometers from the site
where water was found, but it can't go there,

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.189
why?

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.900
Because of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (one
of my favorites) which has a sort of Microbial

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.999
Prime Directive.

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:42.370
Curiosity wasn't sterilized enough to go near
water on another planet where any stowaway

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.439
Earth-life could take a foothold and contaminate
Mars!

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.079
For now, we know the water is there, and we
know the possible life implications that brings

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.410
with it… but we can't do much about it until
either a super-sterile mission is sent, or

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.239
humans show up and can see it with their own
eyes.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.549
Maybe you saw the headlines about water on
Mars this week, but that's the full story.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.370
Thanks for holding out and tuning in.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.150
