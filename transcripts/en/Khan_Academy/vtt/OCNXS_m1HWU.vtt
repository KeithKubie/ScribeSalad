00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.380
Let's now use our
understanding of some

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.210
of the operations on sets
to get some blood flowing

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.670
to our brains.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.031
So I've defined some sets here.

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:10.530
And just to make
things interesting,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.238
I haven't only put
numbers in these sets.

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:15.580
I've even put some colors and
some little yellow stars here.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.970
And what I want
you to figure out

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.890
is what would this set
be, this crazy thing that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.660
involves relative complements,
intersections, unions,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.957
absolute complements.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.540
So I encourage you
to pause it and try

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.336
to figure out what
this set would be.

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:31.460
Well, let's give it a shot.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.790
And the key here is to
really break it down, work

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.945
on the stuff in the
parentheses first,

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:37.570
just as you would do
if you were trying

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.010
to parse a traditional
mathematical statement.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.720
And then it should hopefully
make a little bit of sense.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.740
So a good place
to start might be

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.415
to try to figure out what is the
relative complement of C in B.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.220
Or another way of thinking
about it is what is B minus C?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.850
What is B if you take out
all the stuff with C in it?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.240
So let me write this down.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.830
The relative complement
of C and B or you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.380
could call this B minus C.
This is all the stuff in B

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.019
with all the stuff
in C taken out of it.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.880
So let's think about
what this would be.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.950
B has a 0.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.370
Does C have a 0?

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.180
No, so we don't have
to take out the 0.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.300
B has a 17.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.270
Does C have a 17?

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.980
Yes, it does.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.640
So we take out the 17.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.920
B has a 3, but c has a 3.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.340
So we take that out.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.410
B has a Blue.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.930
C does not have a blue.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.490
So we leave the Blue in.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.790
So let me write down--
we leave the blue in.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.020
And then B has a gold star.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.410
C also has a gold star.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.340
So we take the gold star out.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.270
So the relative complement of
C in B is just the set of 0

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.160
and this Blue written in blue.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.510
So let me write this down.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.999
Let me write that down.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.040
Now, it gets interesting.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.360
We're going to take the
absolute complement,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.530
the absolute complement of that.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.613
So let me write this down.

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:57.880
So B-- the absolute
complement of this business

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.920
is going to be-- let me write
it this-- the set of all things

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:21.450
in our universe that are
neither a 0 or a-- and I'll

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.757
write it in blue-- or a Blue.

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:26.840
That's the only way I could
describe it right now.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.679
I haven't really defined
the universe well.

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.470
We already see that
our universe definitely

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.790
contains some integers,
it contains colors,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.307
it contains some stars.

00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:35.640
So this is all I can really say.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.223
This is the set of all things
in the universe that are neither

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:39.240
a 0 or a Blue.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.940
So fair enough.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.690
So we so far we figured
out all of this stuff.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.850
Let me box this off.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.390
So that is that
right over there.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.310
And now we want to
find the intersection.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.065
We need to find the intersection
of A and this business.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:58.782
 

00:02:58.782 --> 00:02:59.740
Let me write that down.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.710
So it's going to
be A intersected

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.010
with the relative
complement of C and B

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.660
and the absolute
complement of that.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.030
So this is going to be the
intersection of the set

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.070
A and the set of all things in
the universe that are neither

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.460
a 0 or a Blue.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.000
So it's essentially
the things that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.030
satisfy both of these
that has to be in set A

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.290
and it has to be in
the set of all things

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.270
in the universe that are
neither a 0 or a blue.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.140
So let's think
about what this is.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.500
So the number 3 is in set A and
it's in the set of all things

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.650
in the universe that
are neither a 0 or Blue.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.450
So let's throw a 3 in there.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.590
The number 7, it's in
A and it's in the set

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.750
of all things in the universe
that are neither a 0 or a Blue.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.470
So let's put a 7 there.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.120
Negative 5 also meets
that constraint.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.540
A 0 does not meet
that constraint.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.804
A 0 is in A but
it's not in the set

00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:54.720
of all things in the
universe that are neither

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.500
a 0 or blue because it is a 0.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.650
So we're not going
to throw 0 in there.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.940
And then a 13 is in
A and it's in the set

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.010
of all things in the universe
that are neither a 0 or a Blue.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.650
So we could throw a 13 in there.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.680
So we've simplified
things a good bit.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.210
This whole crazy business,
all of this crazy business,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.570
has simplified to this
set right over here.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.660
Now we want to find the relative
complement of this business

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.140
in A. So let me pick
another color here.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.110
So we want to find the relative
complement of this business

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.645
in A. And I'll just write out
the set-- 3, 7, negative 5, 13.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.270
Actually, let me
write out both of them

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.880
just so that we can
really visualize

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.030
them both right over here.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.910
So A is this.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.460
It is 3, 7, negative
5, 0, and 13.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.420
And I could write the
relative complement sign.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.560
Or actually, let me
just write m-- well

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.934
let me write
relative complement.

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:54.280
I was going to write minus.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.800
And so in all of this business,
we already figured out,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.550
is a 3, a 7, a
negative 5, and a 13.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.621
So it's essentially,
start with this set

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.620
and take out all the stuff
that are in this set.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.660
So this is going to
be equal to-- so you

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.884
see we're going to have to
take out a 3 out of this set.

00:05:10.884 --> 00:05:12.050
We're going to take out a 7.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.270
We're going to get a negative 5.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.750
And we're going
to take out a 13.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.560
So we're just left with
the set that contains a 0.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.470
So all of this business
right over here

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.500
has simplified to a set
that only contains a 0.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.590
Now let's think about
what B intersect C is.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.170
These are all the things
that are in both B and C.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.340
So this is going to be B
intersect C. Let's see,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.250
0 is not in both of them.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.260
17 is in both of them.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.240
So we'll throw 17 in there.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.419
The number 3 is in both
of them, the number 3

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.210
is in both of them.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.840
Blue is not in both of them.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.000
The star is in both of them.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.450
So I'll put the little
gold star right over there.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.077
And so that's B intersect C.

00:05:57.077 --> 00:05:58.660
And so we're essentially
going to take

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.785
the union of this crazy
thing-- which ended up just

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:03.310
being a set with a 0 in it--
we're taking the union of that

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.850
and B intersect C. We
deserve a drum roll now.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.490
This is all going to be
equal to-- we're just

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.910
going to combine these two sets.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.550
It's going to be the set
with a 0, a 17, a three,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.930
and our gold star.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.440
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.950
And we are-- I should make the
brackets in a different color--

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.380
and we are done.
