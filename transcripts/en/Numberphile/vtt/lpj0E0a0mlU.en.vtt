00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.820
So, Brady, we're gonna talk about how many particles there are in the universe.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.860
We're gonna calculate the number of particles in the observable universe.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.680
So that's, you know, the section of the universe that we can see,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.260
where light could have reached us from.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.840
What are the particles that we're talking about here?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.700
So we're gonna be interested in particles that's, that are particles that we know exist,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.980
that are fundamental, and we're interested in the ones that have mass.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
So, we're not really talking about photons, for example.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.560
What we're gonna be talking about are things like quarks, electrons, those sorts of things.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.455
So the quarks, of course, are gonna live inside protons, neutrons,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.760
and the electrons are gonna be in orbit around those, those protons and neutrons in atoms.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.740
Pretty much everything else is insignificant.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.045
So, how do we do this? So we're gonna use four bits of data.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.300
Part of it's gonna be cosmological data.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.000
Data from the Planck satellite, which measures the cosmic microwave background radiation.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.080
People call it the radiation that's left over from the big bang.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.595
It's the radiation that you get, after, you know, when the first sort of neutral atoms began to form.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.300
So, we're gonna need, we're gonna use data from that.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.960
And a little bit of particle physics data, as well.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.700
So these are the four bits of information we're gonna use.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.640
So the first of these is the critical density of the universe.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.100
So this is a good measure for what is the energy density of the universe, full stop.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.440
This is because we, we know that the universe is very close to being spatially flat.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.585
So, it's, it's not shaped like a sphere or a saddle,

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.520
it's somewhere in between the two.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.740
And because of that, we know its density

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.035
is very close to the critical density, which is a really really really light density, actually.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.600
If you look at it, if you compare this to the density of water,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440
the density of water is one gram per centimeter cubed.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.040
And this is a million million million million million times less than that, right?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.455
So it's super undense, right? Because this is the universe we're talking about.

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.325
The next bit of information that we're gonna need

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:54.975
is the fraction of that energy budget in the universe

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.740
that's stored in baryons. Now, why baryons?

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.075
Well, baryons, really, in this context, they're just

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.320
the protons and the neutrons, which is where the quarks live.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.240
The other thing the size of the observable universe. Again, coming from Planck data,

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:11.645
we get this figure of about ten to the twenty-eight centimeters.

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:14.100
A one with twenty-eight zeroes after it.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.140
So, lots of centimeters, but the universe is big, right?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.720
Brady: "Why is it in centimeters?"

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.700
Well, I put it in centimeters, because this one was in centimeters, and I don't want to start getting,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
getting all my units messed up. So I thought it safest to, to just be, keep one set of units in there.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.560
And the last thing is, that I'm gonna need is the mass of the proton.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080
The baryons that we're interested in are protons and neutrons,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.800
they have got about the same mass, very close, you know, the mass is pretty much identical.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.160
And so the mass of the proton is ten to the minus twenty-four grams, roughly.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.600
These are the four things that we're gonna need to work out, you know,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.835
how many particles there are in the universe.

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.915
So, to start off with, we're gonna work out how many baryons there are in the universe,

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:53.015
i.e., how many protons and neutrons, in total, there are.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.680
First thing we're gonna do to calculate that is, we're gonna say,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.000
what is the energy density stored in baryons?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.800
Or stored in protons and neutrons?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.920
Well, that's just the fraction of baryons

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.400
times the overall density. This gives us the energy density stored in baryons.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.860
We want to know the total energy, so the total mass stored in the baryons,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.760
we need to multiply by the volume of the universe.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.340
But we know how big the universe is, right?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.620
It's given by this radius. So the volume is just the size of the sphere

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.600
of that radius, which is four, pi by three, and then that radius cubed.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.980
That gives us the total energy stored in baryons.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.720
All right, these baryons, like we said, they're basically protons and neutrons, which have the same mass, essentially.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.960
So if you want to know how many baryons there are,

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:42.365
we just divide by the mass of one baryon, okay?

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:44.940
So we divide by the mass of a proton.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.200
And this gives us the number of baryons.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.400
That's not what we want, no. So we want to know the number of particles.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.420
So we've gotta think about how those particles are distributed.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.620
Now, one thing we know is that the universe is, on average,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.340
electrically neutral, okay?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.020
So the number of posi- positive charges balances the number of negative charges.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.320
For our purposes, that means the number of protons is gonna balance the number of electrons.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.440
The other bit of information we can use is,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.600
we know, where are these baryons stored?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.760
Well, we know that 75% of them are stored in hydrogen atoms,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.200
and 25% in helium atoms. There's other atoms as well, but it's insignificant.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.560
Brady: "Not to us."

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.580
Yeah, not to us, but in the broader scheme of things, it's insignificant.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.880
By far the vast majority, so 75% in hydrogen, 25% in helium,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640
that's where all this is stored.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.660
And we know that from, from looking at, you know, distant gas clouds.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.240
We also know it from one of the great triumphs of cosmology, which is nucleosynthesis.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.480
So, given that information, let's suppose we took a sample of four atoms,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.160
and we know that three of those atoms are gonna be hydrogen, and one of them is gonna be helium, right?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.920
Well, the hydrogen atom contains one proton and one electron.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.860
So these three contain three protons and three electrons.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.500
The helium atom contains two protons, two neutrons, two electrons.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.740
So, now, well, we can split this up, because each of these protons contains three quarks.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.440
Each neutron contains three quarks. So altogether, how many particles

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.700
do we get from these four atoms? Twenty-six particles.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.140
How many baryons did we need to get those twenty-six particles?

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.400
Well, we've got three protons,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.840
another two protons, and two neutrons, that's seven baryons, okay?

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.480
So we get twenty-seven particles from seven baryons.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.180
So we know how many baryons there are in total.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.615
We know for every seven baryons we get twenty-six particles,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.880
so if we want the total number of particles,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.620
we just need to multiply this number by twenty-six over seven.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.760
So we just plug in all the numbers, yadda yadda yadda,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.140
magic, and what do you get?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.680
You get 3.28 times, and then the magic figure, ten to the eighty.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.015
So that's how many particles there are in the universe.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.420
Seems like a lot, right?

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.520
Ten to the eighty, that's like a one with eighty zeroes after, that's a big number, right?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.740
But actually, the universe is a big place, that's about one particle every cubic meter.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.880
Hardly anything, right? But of course, you know, most of space is

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.440
space, it's empty space.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.780
Brady: "That's not even one atom per cubic meter, that's one particle."

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.420
One particle per cubic meter, yeah, exactly.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.520
So the other, the other cool thing to think about is you could aak,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.260
how many particles are there in a typical human body?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.060
Well, we know the human body is about two thirds hydrogen, about a quarter oxygen.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.200
So from all our information, you can work out, the number of particles

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.860
in a human body, about 1.46 times ten to the twenty-nine.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.480
Okay, so that seems like a lot of particles,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.340
but of course, it's not as many as there are in the entire universe, right?

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.315
So how many humans would you need to

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:46.815
use up all the particles in the entire universe?

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:49.995
Well, of course, you just take the ratio of these, these two, right?

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.920
So you'd need 2.25 times ten to the fifty-one humans

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.480
to use up all the particles in the universe.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.500
So, there's about 7.5 billion humans alive today, right?

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.140
The population growth rate at the moment is about 1.11 percent per year.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.220
So I thought it would be fun to work out how long it would take for us to, uh,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.300
given that rate of growth, for us to sort of use up all the particles in the universe, right?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.440
So we can work this out.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.900
If we take the population when it's using up all the particles,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.040
dividing this number, so this is the population corresponds to this number,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.360
divided by the population now,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.620
which is about 7.5 billion,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.500
P now is 7.5 times ten to the nine.

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:38.895
Then that's related, by an exponential,

00:07:39.445 --> 00:07:42.885
to the rate of growth R, which is

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:45.705
1.11 percent per year.

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:48.300
I can plug in all these numbers, I can rearrange this equation.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.855
I get T is one over R log P all over P now.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.760
So I just plug in the numbers, and it turns out that we will have used up,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.440
carry on, the population keeps growing at the same rate,

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.715
we will have used up all the particles in the universe,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.060
in humans,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.680
in 8604 years.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.940
Which is not that much.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.400
Brady: "I thought it was gonna be..."

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.740
I know, it's amazing. This is exponential.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.360
Brady: "Forget using up the fossil fuels, we're gonna use all the particles."

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.820
Yeah, exactly. I mean, just forget, just forget what,

00:08:22.365 --> 00:08:25.625
what, talk about impact on the planet, impact on the universe, right?

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.665
Population growth, this is. Within less than ten thousand years, we'll have

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:31.635
used up, and we keep growing at the same rate, we'll have

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.420
used up all the particles of the universe, in the form of humans.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.860
Surely somethings gotta give before that happens, right?

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.360
Well, there might be only 8604 years left for us here in the universe,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.135
but luckily that's plenty of time to learn a new skill.

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:49.435
And a great place to learn new skills is with skill share.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.740
They're the sponsor of this video, and they've got something like 16,000 online video lessons,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.400
to teach you all sorts of stuff, from making videos, to cooking, design.

00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:04.435
And something that I'm quite keen to learn a bit more about,

00:09:04.435 --> 00:09:07.345
and that's filming with, and flying drones.

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:09.380
They've got a whole series of lessons on that.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.620
And it's something I've started looking at in a lot more depth.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.095
I got pretty inspired when we made this numberphile video using a drone.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.800
So finally I'm splashing out and getting one for myself.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.360
Anyway, from around ten dollars a month, you can get premium membership on skill share,

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:25.285
you get access to all the videos, including offline.

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:28.660

Check it all out. See what you think.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.455
One of things that's impressed me very early on was how well-made

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.520
the lessons themselves are.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.540
They're really kind of professional and modern.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.980
It makes them a lot more enjoyable to watch, and therefore a lot easier to learn what they're teaching you.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.700
Anyway, don't take my word for it. There's that website again,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.900
