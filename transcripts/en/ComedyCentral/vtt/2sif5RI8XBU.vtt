- UM, ALABAMA.

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:10.477
OOH.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.413
I PUT TOO MUCH OF THAT
IN THE GLASS.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.783
- IT WAS A LITTLE MUCH.
- [coughs and burps]

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.385
HELLO.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.787
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT PERCY JULIAN,

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:24.858
ONE OF THE GREATEST SCIENTISTS
TO EVER LIVE.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:29.329 line:0%
 
PERCY JULIAN WAS BORN
IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, IN 1899.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.732
SO THAT MEANT HE WAS GROWING UP
AS A KID

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:35.769
IN JIM CROW SEGREGATION LAND.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.972
EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS A HUGE OBSTACLE,

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.109
HE WAS ABLE
TO ESCAPE INTO PLANTS.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.312
THAT SOUNDS SO DUMB
WHEN I SAY IT.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.114
- NO, SOUNDS GREAT.

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.616
- HE SAID,
LOOK AT THESE PLANTS.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.152
THERE'S A WHOLE LABORATORY
INSIDE THESE THINGS.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.889
I JUST WANT TO UNLOCK
ALL THE HEALING QUALITIES

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.891
OF ALL THESE PLANTS AND THINGS.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.829
LITTLE PERCY DECIDED,
I WANT TO BE A SCIENTIST.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.400 line:0%
 
HE GOT ACCEPTED
TO DEPAUW UNIVERSITY IN INDIANA.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.235
HE THINKS, THIS IS GONNA BE
SO MUCH DIFFERENT

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:11.638
THAN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA,
AND ALL THE SEGREGATION THERE.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.542
HE GETS THERE, BLACK STUDENTS
ARE BANNED FROM CAMPUS,

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.845
UH, LIVING ON CAMPUS.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.080
HE FINALLY FINDS A FRATERNITY

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.784
THAT ALLOWS HIM TO LIVE
IN THEIR BASEMENT

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:27.120
IN EXCHANGE FOR BEING
THEIR BUTLER, AND THEY'RE LIKE,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.655
CAN YOU MAKE US
SOME HOT DOGS?

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.490
YEAH, I GUESS I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME HOT DOGS.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.194
I'M ONLY TRYING TO [bleep]
BE A SCIENTIST HERE.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.929
WE DON'T CARE.
CAN YOU MAKE US A PIZZA?

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.297
YEAH, I'LL MAKE YOU A PIZZA.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.567
I'M ONLY [bleep] TRYING TO GET
MY GODDAMN DEGREE.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.169
WE DON'T CARE.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.571
BUT AT THAT TIME,
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.842
NO ONE WOULD ALLOW
A BLACK MAN TO...

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.613
GET THEIR PhD.

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:55.883
SO HE GOES TO VIENNA, AUSTRIA.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:58.485
HE'S LIKE,
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.622
I MEAN, WE'RE DOING
REAL WORK HERE, GUYS.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:05.058
CARBONS AND HYDROGENS,

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:08.729
OXYGENS AND CARBUTRONS,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.631
AND THAT'S MOLECULES FOR YOU.

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.666
HE WRITES HOME,
AND HE SAYS, THIS IS--

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:17.638
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING,
AND I'M KIND OF A BADASS HERE.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.740
LIKE, LADIES LIKE ME.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.975
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.844
I'LL SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:26.613
I'VE HAD SEX
WITH SOME PEOPLE HERE,

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:31.451
AND THEY WEREN'T ALL
RACIALLY RACIST AND STUFF.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.388
I DON'T WANT TO GET
INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.491
I'VE PENETRATED MANY WOMEN.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.893
ALL THE BEST, PERCY.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:44.264
THOSE LETTERS WOULD COME BACK
TO HAUNT HIM LATER.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.933
- [chuckles]
NO.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.734
- YES.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:51.538 line:0%
 
PERCY'S BACK IN AMERICA,
AND HE'S LIKE, AH, YEAH,

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.407 line:0%
 
I'M [bleep] BACK FROM VIENNA.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:55.742
I GOT MY PhD.
NO BIG DEAL.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.545
LET'S JUST KEEP DOING
SOME SCIENCE, GUYS.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.881
AND THEN HIS BOSS,

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.516
THE PRESIDENT
AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY,

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.618
IS LIKE, NO, NO, NO.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.386
ALL THOSE LETTERS
THAT YOU WROTE

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:10.357
ABOUT ALL THOSE BABES YOU WERE
HOOKING UP WITH IN VIENNA?

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.760
THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING
TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.831
SO WE NEED YOU TO RESIGN,
AND PERCY'S LIKE, WHAT?

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.268
THESE WERE PERSONAL LETTERS!

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:25.539
AND HE'S LIKE, THERE'S A LOT
OF "OPPORTUNITITIES"--

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.443
"OPPORTUNITITIES"?
[laughs]

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.712
[bleep] YOU GUYS, I GUESS.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:35.549
HE'S A MAN WITHOUT A JOB,

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.918
SO HE HAS NOWHERE TO GO.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:41.154
THIS GUY WILLIAM O'BRIAN--WHO'S
A VICE PRESIDENT OF GLIDDEN,

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.290
A PAINT COMPANY--
HE'S LIKE, THIS IS ABSURD.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.526
THIS IS CRAZY.
THIS GUY IS A GENIUS.

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:50.731
I'M GONNA HIRE THIS GUY TO BE
THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.633
IN OUR LABORATORY.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:57.237
SO PERCY AND HIS TEAM WERE
STUDYING SOYBEANS IN THE LAB.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.939
THEY'RE GOING,
THIS MOLECULE

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.874
GOES TO THIS MOLECULE,
AND THEN BOOM,

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.510
AND THEN WE HAVE THIS MOLECULE
THAT'S GOING TO THIS MOLECULE,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.545
AND THEN BOOM.

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:05.913
WE'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:09.049
SO HE'S WORKING
ALL THIS STUFF.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.886
SO ONE TIME,
PERCY'S IN HIS LAB.

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:16.356
HE FOUND OUT THERE HAD BEEN
AN ACCIDENT, AND HE WAS LIKE,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.159
OH, [bleep].
OH, [bleep].

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.729
SOME WATER GOT
INTO THIS 100,000-GALLON TANK

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.631
OF SOYBEAN JUICE.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.634
I'M IN [bleep] TROUBLE.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.771
AND HE NOTICES THESE CRYSTALS
ON THE SIDE OF THE TUB,

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.372
AND HE REALIZES,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:36.076
I JUST MADE STEROIDS
FROM A SOYBEAN.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:40.080
AT THAT TIME, THEY WERE GETTING
STEROIDS FROM, LIKE, HORSE PISS.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.316
EVERYBODY WAS LIKE,

00:04:42.316 --> 00:04:48.188
WHOA, PERCY JUST MADE
PROGESTERONE OUT OF A BEAN.

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.891
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO, LIKE,
USE A HORSE DICK FOR THAT.

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.426
THERE'S ONLY
SO MANY HORSE DICKS.

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:56.997
THERE IS, LIKE,
A MILLION SOYBEANS,

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:01.635
UH, PER EVERY ONE HORSE DICK,
OKAY?

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:05.072 line:0%
 
PERCY STARTS MAKING
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.540 line:0%
 
BECAUSE OF THIS.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.709
HE'S ABLE TO HELP
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE,

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.646
WITH THINGS FROM ARTHRITIS,
GLAUCOMA, BIRTH CONTROL,

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.348
AND HE WAS A ROLE MODEL

00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:19.219
TO MANY OTHER AFRICAN-AMERICANS
AFTER HIM.

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.054
HE CREATED
SO MUCH GODDAMN STUFF,

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:24.791
I CAN'T EVEN LIST
ALL THE STUFF HE CREATED,

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.561
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME
ON THE SHOW,

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.563
BUT CAN I JUST, LIKE--

00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:32.933
CAN YOU JUST SCROLL A LIST
OF ALL THE STUFF HE CREATED?

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:34.067
- YEAH, WE CAN--

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.736
- BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY.

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:37.838
- JUST WHILE YOU'RE TALKING?
- I CAN'T--I DON'T HAVE--

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.974
I CAN'T,

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.409
BUT I HOPE YOU'RE SEEING
THE LIST

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.845
OF ALL THE STUFF HE CREATED,
BECAUSE IT'S INSANE.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:47.748
IT'S, LIKE, A LOT OF STUFF.

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:51.985
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:54.154
LOOK AT THAT.

00:05:58.725 --> 00:05:58.792
- [laughs]
