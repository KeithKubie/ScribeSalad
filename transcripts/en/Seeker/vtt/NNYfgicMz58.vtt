00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.960
People take medicine every day, but not many
people know how arduous of process that those

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.270
drugs have to go through to get from idea
to your body.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.490
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.800
The pharmaceutical industry is big business.
According to a study published in the Annual

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.439
British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology world
pharmaceutical sales are approximately 365.6

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.710
billion dollars. “Big Pharma” is often
portrayed as the villain. Sometimes rightfully

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.950
so, think of a recent example of a company
acquiring a life saving drug and jacking u

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.410
p the price 4,000 percent overnight. But it's
not always about greed. One of the reasons

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.059
for the high price of drugs is simply it’s
so expensive to develop a new one.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.469
Developing a new drug or medicine is a slow
and expensive road. It can take decades and

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.429
billions of dollars before a drug ever reaches
the FDA -- who then has to approve it for

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.460
use. According to The Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry for every successful

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.120
new drug about 25,000 chemical compounds were
tested, on average 25 of these will have gone

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.161
into clinical trials and just five will receive
approval for marketing. And according to a

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.640
report published by the Tufts Center for the
Study of Drug Development (CSDD) it costs

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.280
more than $2.6 billion to make a drug that
finally receives approval.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.040
So why does it take so much time and money?
Well the FDA, thankfully has established strict

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.790
guidelines for drug manufacturers as well
as, quality control measures like good laboratory

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.640
practices and guidelines for clinical trials.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.960
With that in mind, drug discovery often starts
with basic research. Scientists might find

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.710
mechanisms behind cellular receptors, ion
channels and enzymes. For example, research

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.310
in the 60s on neurotransmitters led researchers
to discover an imbalance of brain chemicals

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.320
might have something to do with depression.
Knowing that, drug companies could get to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.400
work on a way to fix that imbalance. Shout
out to basic research! Woo woo!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.180
Historically medicines were discovered in
nature, like bark from the willow tree which

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.850
ancient cultures used to relieve pain. Turns
out, the bark contained a compound which modern

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.670
pharmaceutical companies used to make aspirin.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.800
Your granddad’s pharmaceutical researcher
had to create new compounds by hand,and could

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.890
only make about 50–100 new compounds every
year. But today, using genetics and computer

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.000
models, researchers can quickly predict what
compounds will work and create a bunch of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.370
samples using specialized robots. According
to a study published in The Pharmaceutical

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.780
Journal, as many as 10,000 compounds may be
considered and whittled down to just 10 to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.980
20.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.840
From there, these compounds must be tested.
Drugs must go through rigorous testing to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920
make sure they do what researchers suspect
and that they don’t have overwhelmingly

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.500
negative side effects.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.131
First compounds must go through either phenotypic
screens or target-based screens. Phenotype

00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:45.210
screening measures the test compound's ability
to affect cells, tissues or whole organisms.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.910
It's pretty general. Target screening measures
the effect of compounds on a purified target

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.970
protein in a test tube, so it's way more specific.
It's called an in-vitro assay, and it targets

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.069
the direct effect a molecule or compound has
down the protein. Even with the best phenotype

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.030
screening, the target-screening is way more
valuable to the scientists and regulators.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.800
Only compounds which show positive activity
are developed further. They are made in larger

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.459
quantities and subjected to more and more
tests. Some compounds are tested in animals,

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.690
then they go on to clinical trials, which
test the compounds in humans in tightly-controlled,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.840
highly-regulated studies. Phase one trials
test the safety of the new drugs, phase two

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.110
tests efficacy, and phase three are the holy
grail of science: double-blind, placebo-controlled

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.110
studies.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.920
After all of this, if the drug does what's
it's supposed to do predictably, it can be

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.730
submitted to the FDA for market approval.
So you imagine with all this time, effort,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.150
money and a huge failure rate, pharmaceutical
companies tend to focus on drugs they think

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.560
will have the best financial return.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:56.211
Over on testtube news, I dig deeper into how
exactly drug prices are decided here in the

00:03:56.211 --> 00:04:01.820
United States.
