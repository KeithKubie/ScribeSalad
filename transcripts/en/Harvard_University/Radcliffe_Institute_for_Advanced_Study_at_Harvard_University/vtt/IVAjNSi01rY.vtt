00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.950
- It's a very special moment
for me to address people

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.380
in Slovenia-English.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.260
So I hope you
understand it anyway.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.060
I've done about 100
concert tours worldwide,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.010
and in 35 years of being a
conductor, probably thousands

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.210
of concerts.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.620
But usually, I'm
turning that way.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.510
Only when I do
things like Spixody.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.590
So it's a very special
experience for me

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.814

to a general audience.

honored to be here at Harvard.

And I really am--

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.970
I'm flying here, somehow,
from disparate perspectives.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.470
How beautiful work I can do
here in good circumstance,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.810
if sometimes I fly
with my kick scooter.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.480
You know what I mean?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.520
But basically,
what I'm doing here

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.120
is developing a few things.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.420
As Meredith mentioned, I'm
developing a music theater

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.200
project based on something which
I'm going to tell you later.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.020
It is named, called, BABA.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.750
I'm also writing a book about
Choregie, concept and method.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.770
And I'll also develop some other
projects, such as Stabat Mater,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.880
which is inspired with
Mary of Incarnation,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.150
and her "Letters to the Son."

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.240
I mean, I do more
projects simultaneously,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.540
because that's the
way how I work.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.190
But to give you some ideas what
this Choregie actually means,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.290
I would like to share with
you a few previous productions

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.430
to understand how this new music
theater actually is developed.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:57.790
So Choregie is a name which
somehow comes from Greek.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.550
Old Greek tragedies and
chorics are supposed to be

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.350
[? patrons. ?]

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.900
And new music, which
is always together

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.520
with Choregie, new music
theater refers to new music,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.260
which I usually perform.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.910
And it's mostly music of our
time, contemporary music.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.820
But sometimes, new
music is also something

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.260
which is rarely, or maybe even
never heard on our concert

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.540
stages, such as medieval
music, or maybe ethnical music,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.930
or music which was taken for
some different context, such as

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.290
sociological or--

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.870
I don't know, maybe music
by women in monasteries,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.430
or anything like that, which
are not usually at the concert

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.390
programs.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.270
So the theater nowadays is
still very much perceived only

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.250
as drama theater.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.040
So while Indian
theater, Kathakali,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.560
or maybe Japanese theater--

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.320
Noh, for example-- are
structured from dance, music,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.790
choral singing, stylized
rituals, and text,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.140
the main characteristic of
Western theater is that content

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.440
is illustrated by drama--

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.150
acting.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.810
But when people talk
about music theater,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.570
we automatically think of
opera, operetta, or musical,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.880
or music comedy.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.360
So with years of working
with Carmina Slovenika

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.500
and Kebataola--

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.200
these are my two ensembles--

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.820
I developed a new
concept of music theater,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.730
which is sometimes also
called vocal theater

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.090
or theater of voices.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.730
What is Choregie nowadays?

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.470
It represents two fields--

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.170
concept of principles how to
create music theater projects,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.570
and specific method of working
with ensembles, choirs,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.280
orchestras, actors, conductors.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.970
So for idea about
Choregie, I would like

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.690
to share with you one clip now.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.350
It is one of my
earliest works named

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.360
"From Time Immemorial," which
was performed, for a change,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.070
with opera--

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.100
chorus and opera, orchestra
and opera soloists--

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.220
which is quite a rare occasion
for music theater pieces,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.620
because as you know,
opera houses tend

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.360
to keep their museums
with Verdi and Puccini.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.680
And contemporary music is only
sometimes on the repertory,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.420
just to be big.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.740
So please-- "From
Time Immemorial."

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.734

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.740
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.020
So Choregie is composed of
elements that do not illustrate

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.090
or double each other.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.960
So they somehow preserve
their own identity,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.290
and do not rely on
convention or hierarchy

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.390
of elements in theater.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.590
I can explain this like
that-- if you have a dish,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.160
like a piece of meat,
maybe, and music,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.110
and you can put some side dishes
as a garnish, a little bit

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:06.400
of vegetables-- that light, a
little bit of potato costumes.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.070
That's the way how, very
often, music theater projects

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.330
are conceived.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.940
So we have like a major
thing, or maybe in drama,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.150
you have texts, and then you
add movement, or whatever.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.580
But for Choregie,
it is important

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.380
that all elements are equal.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.350
So we don't have a main
dish and side dishes.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.140
In music, the score is in
direct control of the musician.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.830
So the reception of the
execution of a music piece

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.679
depends only on
musician initiatives.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.570
But this doesn't apply for
music in Choregie gear projects,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.030
because this music
requires from musician

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.810
and the audience a completely
different experience--

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.700
namely, the intensive radiation
of heard music or word

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.630
is complemented with
culture of the scene--

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.770
the culture of the eye, the
feeling of external form.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.330
So music becomes interesting
in a different way

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.830
as it gets these references
in non-musical world.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.030
Why I'm telling this?

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.600
Because this music
was not composed

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.770
to be performed in opera, or to
be performed as a staged music.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.390
It's concert music,
which is staged.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.720
That's why this adding
of other elements

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.000
gives the music
different dimension.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.490
Another thing which is
interesting for Choregie

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.560
is that performers are a
little bit different than we

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.930
used to have them in opera.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.450
They used to use different
vocal techniques, not only

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.050
Bel Canto, also ethnical,
extended vocal techniques.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.030
Musicians can be different.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.540
Another aspect for Choregie
is that we perform it

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:06.260
not only in opera houses
and concert halls,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.740
but also in industrial
halls, in monasteries,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.550
in completely different
sociological environments.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:22.410
I think for me, Choregie is
a really, really good field

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.900
and place for exploration.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:30.180
And it's a playground
for researching new music

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.740
and new theater expressions.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.300
So I would like to make clear--

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.610
Choregie, or music, new
music theater is not--

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:44.490
is not opera, is not
musical, and is not operetta.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:51.160
So how did all this started?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.120
I was conductor of
Carmina Slovenica

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.000
Ensemble and some others for--

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.730
Meredith already
mentioned-- for many years.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.240
We did a lot of
competitions, concert tours.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.140
And I start to add some other
elements to my performances.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:16.150
And I actually start to use
movement as a first element.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.490
Because in ethnical
music, in folk,

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:23.680
folklore music, movement
and singing and instruments

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.200
are so naturally connected.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.310
And it was the first
contact with me

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:33.940
how to change this classical
formation of choirs

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.340
who were always kind of relics
of past, who stand in four rows

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.190
into something
more communicative.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.390
So first thing was ethnical
music and movement.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.830
And second thing was, of
course, Greek tragedy,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.910
and the role of choir
in Greek tragedy,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:59.020
where chorus was about 20
to 50 people, of 20 people

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.920
performers.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.670
They sing.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.920
They recite.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.950
They move.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.310
So they were part of the
performance, can make comments,

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.770
who was the mirror
to the audience.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.570
And above all, they
serve as one entity.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.190
It was not a group
of many people,

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.240
but they become one personality.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.930
So there were my two
first inspirations.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.530
And one of the
first such projects

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.530
where movement was
incorporated into music,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.220
which is kind of ethnical
or new-age ethnical,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.762
was "Adiemus," which we
can see a little bit of it.

A little bit weak, because
it's very old recording.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.720
But I would like to add
that this orchestra behind

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.030
is international
orchestra, consists of

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.300
only female, young
girls from entire region

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.950
in central Europe.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.150
Because I was very much
inspired with [? Hospidalya ?]

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.200
[? Veneziane. ?]

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.520
I don't know if you're
familiar with this--

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.660
that in old Venice there were
charitable institutions where

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.660
they have female orchestras,
girls' orchestras,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.380
and girls' choirs,
who were there,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.850
who were abandoned children--
those who don't have parents--

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.450
orphans.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.370
So I was inspired with these.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.922
That's why we actually
established this formation.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.330
Another very important
thing in my work

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.050
is collective experience.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.090
Because it seems
that these crowds

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.890
carry in themselves a
power and characteristics

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.000
which by far exceed the mere sum
of psychological and physical

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.950
characteristics of
individuals in it.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:54.000
As you can see, I always
work with big groups.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.540
But the voice of the
collective we really like best

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.800
is the voice of choir.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.430
Because choir is the only
bigger group activity

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.580
that is not driven by any
ideology or economical,

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.470
political, military,
or religion reasons.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.110
So choir is really a special
formation of human activity.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.300
And I am very fascinated
about one voice who

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.650
becomes part of this
body of other voices,

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.080
or all these bodies
together which become

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.870
one body and one entity only.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:36.890
So choir has a very special
role and special power.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.362
Of course, it's
also very difficult

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:40.070
to work with the choir,
because there are

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.780
so many different characters.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.480
And you really have to work
a lot on team building.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.670
But at the end, when you manage
the established ensemble, which

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.030
is a really strong
organism, then it really

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.710
speaks very loud.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.210
So I would like
to share with you

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:03.590
"Raua," just for a impression
of power of collective.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.578

- [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.980
I would just like to add that--

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.563
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:49.563 --> 00:18:52.220
--they are singing
without being conducted.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.250
That's the very, very,
very special thing,

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:00.080
to have 50 people being
so tuned emotionally

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.010
and musically that they can
perform this complex music

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.700
without being conducted.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.380
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.824
- [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.130
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.080
Thank you.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.810
And the third very important
thing is, of course, voice.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.890
Because voice is always
center of my exploration.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.970
And voice in the
performance is impersonated,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:07.250
and really becomes a very,
very important manifestation.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.570
Actually, for me, it
becomes personality or more

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.010
personalities.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:18.340
So I think that voice
has a special power

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:23.380
to link to some specter of
emotions which we are not

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.200
even aware that we carry in us.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.780
Some psycho-analytical
language is

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:34.150
established when voices
make these soundscapes,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.280
and control the stage.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.780
But to understand the
voice better, of course,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.230
you need to research it, to
make a voice laboratorium,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.680
to really work on
every aspect of voice--

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.360
not only of beauty of the voice
like Bel Canto is, but also

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.150
extended vocal
techniques to learn

00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:00.250
how other cultures use a
voice, from Eskimos to Balkan.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.740
So there are different ways
how you place your voice.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.150
But not only how to sing,
but also how to scream,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.210
cry, and all kind
of uses of voices.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.470
That's a really big
laboratorium which never ends.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.334
Maybe we can see Prasonata, just
a little bit how we actually--

00:21:18.334 --> 00:21:19.000

[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.210
- So that was example of
sound poetry, actually.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.400
So how Choregie
projects are conceived--

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.730
about process a little bit--

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.540
the creation of
making these scores

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.180
brings musical notion of
composing to all aspects.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.540
How we conceive of the piece,
how we perform it, of course,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.100
and stage it.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.670
So in Choregie, one
meta composition

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:59.950
is created by positioning
different music, text, drama,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.240
and all kinds of visual elements
into one bigger composition.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.560
So treatment of all these voice,
text, movement, light, image,

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.740
sound, gesture, and
all the elements

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.510
of theatrical production is
based on musical principles

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.760
and compositional techniques.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.580
That means that musical
thinking actually

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.830
applies to the performance as
a whole, not only to music,

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.870
as somebody would think.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.690
That's why relations
between elements

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.110
is, let's say
musical vocabulary--

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.610
polyphonic, imitation,
monophonic, homophonic,

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.050
polyrhythmic, polytonal.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.955
So this musical thinking
is part of the process.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.340
Somehow, I can say that Choregie
is performance in no man's

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.120
world, because it's
not the world of music,

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.480
or world of drama, or dance.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.990
It's kind of adventure,
scenic adventure.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:11.860
Sometimes musicians ask
me if music is not enough,

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.540
why do we stage it?

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.350
We don't stage any music.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.440
When I get a score
or musical idea,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.900
I start to think
simultaneously--

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.410
visual things, whatever
is part of the project.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.670
And if other elements
are organically here,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.530
then I go for Choregie project.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.050
If they're not here,
we do a concert,

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.050
classical concert in a
hall, beautifully dressed,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.970
and normal thing.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.890
But contemporary
music, early music--

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:50.410
they are very inspirative
for other elements

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.120
to be part of the production.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.070
So I think that music becomes
interesting in other ways

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.910
when it gets these references
in non-musical world.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:06.190
So inside of this field, when
music and non-music meets,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.770
then some different
dialogue starts.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:15.430
And because music and non-music,
they have different meanings,

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.440
and coexistence somehow
brings new, third meaning,

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.490
which is actually what
I'm interested in.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.620
But Choregie project--
that doesn't bring story

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.300
in classical sense.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.150
So there is no
dominant story as we

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:38.530
are used to have it in
opera, operetta, and musical.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.940
Of course, there is some
theme which was inspiration,

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.470
but we don't have this
classical protagonist

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.390
as we have it in opera.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.900
And there is no drama
between two protagonists.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.710
Nobody's killing, and
nobody's dying here.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.890
So there is no--

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:04.090
dramatic is not-- we
don't get this dramatic

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:09.090
from classical acting,
but from the way how

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:13.270
music and other
elements are performed,

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.780
and how they are understood.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.960
That's this dramatic
element, not the story

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.700
and relationships.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.580
And we don't really have
some major protagonist

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.290
who get all the attention
of the audience, what

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.350
he's going to do.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.920
Usually, the main
protagonist is chorus.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.310
Even if there are five
people, a chamber group,

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.260
they are not individuals.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.010
They are some part
of collective.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.960
That's why I mentioned that
collective is very important.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.670
So drama theater-- uh-huh.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.700
OK, how do I conceive
these things?

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.100
As I mentioned, I develop
all elements simultaneously.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.890
So for example, for my project
which I'm developing here,

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.250
I already make some paintings.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.850
Because these are basis
for visual elements.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.500
I already think how is
going to be set design,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.800
how is going to be movement.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.930
So all elements are
organically developed together.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:27.230
It's not only music, and
then, OK, now we know music--

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.420
huh, what can we do?

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.010
Shall we put some blue light?

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:36.430
No, because light I understand
not as a source for light

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.580
to be seen, but as a message.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.140
So all elements are
part of the score.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.580
Is that clear?

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.500
Yes, cool.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.940
So ideas-- what's first?

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.780
Sometimes, it's
a piece of music.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.740
Sometimes, it's
some question which

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.380
I channel, which
I carry in myself,

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.260
and I don't quite understand it.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.000
Usually, these are questions
which I don't understand.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.180
And as I have like
50 projects, I

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.490
don't really understand
much things in the world.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.820
But I like to do
things which don't

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.970
have only one direct meaning.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:26.200
So I like to have
this open field

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.310
for different interpretation
and for different receptions.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:35.290
So it's very challenging
to bring familiar things

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.980
in new dress, and
in the new context,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:45.760
and give audiences and
performance as well a chance

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:53.900
to interpret how they want,
which is somehow a big freedom,

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.920
but as well, also,
big responsibility--

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.780
to have this chance to
decide how to understand

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.600
the piece, the project.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.470
So it seems exciting to allow
these familiar materials

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.380
on which Choregie is
built the possibility

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.280
to be discovered in new
ways again and again,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.080
and in new perspectives,
in various levels, and even

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.100
various layers.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:27.050
You can always find,
and always uncover.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:33.410
So for example, here is
one piece-- just wait--

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.120
Placebo, or Is There
One Who Would not Weep.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.670
This piece was based on very
well-known work Stabat Mater

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:48.110
by Pergolesi,
Baroque composer, one

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.100
of the most beautiful,
beautiful pieces in the history.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.620
And is based on medieval
texts about Mary,

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.190
who is crying under
the cross when

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.440
her son, Jesus, was crucified--

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.080
so very well-known
medieval text.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.080
What we did is we made
new orchestration.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.270
So we don't have a
string orchestra,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.080
but we have one accordion,
and cello player,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.490
which is different
acoustical environment.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:22.610
And we re-question,
actually, mother Mary more

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:28.030
than the situation of her
suffering below a cross.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.490
We question Mother Mary
as a social construct,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.030
and as an instrument of
supervision and control,

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:40.490
or Mary as a symbolic construct
in which femininity is confined

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.700
within the limits of
maternal, or Mother

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.670
Mary as an object
of imaginary love,

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.070
as a substitute of
suppressed male libido.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:54.140
So the Stabat Mater
which is so well known

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.981
was somehow in new dress.

00:30:57.981 --> 00:30:58.480
Please.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.300
- What is-- what is it to call?

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.270
- Some-- on the one hand,
some non-believer will say,

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.450
just calling.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.320
That's mentioning a
name, just calling.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:13.940
That's a call.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.537
Others will say, well,
the fact that I called--

00:31:17.537 --> 00:31:20.531
- [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:05.350
- Well, I don't go to church on
Sunday, don't get on my knees

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:12.850
to pray, don't memorize
the books of the Bible.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.152
I got my own special way.

00:33:17.152 --> 00:33:27.400
Well, I know Jesus loves me
maybe just a little bit more.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.206
I've fallen on my
knees every Sunday

00:33:31.206 --> 00:33:35.250
at Ghirardelli's candy Store.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.420
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.700
- Another project, which
was quite interesting,

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.150
because it happened just in
the moment of this Charlie

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:50.220
Hebdo and all this interesting
historical moments,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.430
was "Toxic Psalms,"
where we research,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:59.720
again, this collective
operation, and especially

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.650
what happens when collective
gets infected with ideology.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:09.940
So through the research
of Hannah Arendt,

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.340
and her observations
in Jerusalem,

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.330
and similar experiments,
such as Milgram experiment,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:21.820
and Lucifer effect, and all
kind of banality of evil,

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.730
we brought a project
which was actually somehow

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:29.080
a reflection of Palestine,
Syria, Pussy Riots,

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.610
and all these situations around
the world where religion is

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:37.510
becoming the main reason of
murderous violence in today's

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.080
world.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.400
So it was kind of reflection
of human brutality,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.850
and man killing for the
glory of their Psalms.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.540
I never want to be agitator.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.880
We have to do something.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.010
I don't like this role.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:57.340
But again, the message was
that we probably should not

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.580
be hiding behind a big Other.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.038
So that's "Toxic Psalms."

00:35:04.038 --> 00:35:07.020
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:19.942 --> 00:35:22.924
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.500
Actually, this was
premiered in New York.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.390
That's American premiere.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.160
While this is running,
music was very

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.620
diverse, from Rachmaninoff,
to contemporary music

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:28.320
from Nordic countries,
to some early music,

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.690
even medieval polyphony.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.070
So it was very, let's
say, eclectic musically.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.630
- So I'll tell you everything.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.140
Now, Sid [INAUDIBLE] one
of us, but he is also--

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.920
you know.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.610
You can tell, right?

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.180
Right?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.650
You can tell.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:50.920
But sometimes, you can't tell.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.000
You think someone's one of
us, but then they got to him,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.820
and he wasn't anymore.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.800
And then we got to him,
and he was one of us again.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.735
But still, he has to look like
he isn't, that is, like he

00:38:03.735 --> 00:38:05.690
already looks like he is.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.010
But then they got wise to him.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.645
And now he isn't again and he
has to look like he isn't, or

00:38:11.645 --> 00:38:13.385
we'll get wise.

00:38:13.385 --> 00:38:14.876
And that [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:35.750
[CHORUS SINGING]

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.885

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.440

that you continue.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.090

that you continue.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.450
As I told you, I am very
interested in early music,

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.400
and of course in
contemporary music.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:07.580
And I found one
interesting French medieval

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.420
Gesamtkunstwerk,
actually, the first one

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.950
in history, "Roman de Fauvel."

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.910
The story is about a very
ambitious ass, horse,

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:25.700
who was very greedy, and has
all these terrible, terrible

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.160
characteristics--

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.530
egotism, hedonism, hypocrisy,
and all this kind of sin,

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.210
and corruption.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:40.730
And this-- Fauvel is his name--

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:47.180
was the piece which was staged
in Basel opera, Basel Theater.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.600
And it was kind of
transparent curtain

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:57.900
behind listeners can follow
events from this 14th century.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.920
But I think everybody
was aware that it was not

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.860
the right time of the action.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.770
Because this Fauvel
was serving kind

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:13.470
of as a metaphor for
actual political happening

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.150
across Atlantic, from
European perspective.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.243
"Fauvel."

00:42:18.243 --> 00:42:21.141
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[CHORUS SPEAKING]

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.240
[SINGING]

00:43:29.745 --> 00:43:37.500
OK, so I hope that you get a
little bit of impression what

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.550
Choregie is, or
how deep love can

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.490
be to the choirs,
and this big love,

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:49.470
and can be also very
problematical love.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.360
Because it's always
a lot of people

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:59.830
with different characters,
with different problems.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.550
So it's a very
special work to work

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:05.370
with these big groups,
especially when you

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.910
work on contemporary music,
which is not easy to study.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.000
And early music is also
difficult to memorize

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.590
and to digest.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:18.330
But I think that when things
are studied and done, then

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:22.450
it gives a really
special experience.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.370
And I really like doing it.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.470
Thank you.
