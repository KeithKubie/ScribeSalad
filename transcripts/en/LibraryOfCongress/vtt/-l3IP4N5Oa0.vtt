I'd also like to draw your attention

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.520
to a new Hispanic themed
podcast series

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.400
that the library's Hispanic
division has recently launched

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.600 position:56%
in the last week in conjunction with
National Hispanic Heritage Month.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.940
It is fabulous, and it's a great
insight into recording archives

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.200
of Hispanic literature
and culture as well

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.630
as the physical archives
here at the library.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.920 position:56%
Without further adieu, thank you for
being here and thanks to Discovery

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.660

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.480
and we look forward to seeing
you at the end of the event.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.280
Thanks.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.360
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: So I
have a couple questions prepared

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.620
for Barbara Tenenbaum, and
Michela, and please feel free to --

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.450
at any point if you want to ask
a question or would like them

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.740
to develop any further
to just jump in.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.240
There might be a microphone
somewhere around here.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.560
If not, just raise your hand,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740
and I think we're close
enough that we can hear you.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.710
Thank you so much for allowing
us to show this documentary here.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.480
I would -- the movie
begins in [inaudible].

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.900
So we're already -- the
conflict's already started.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.290
And later on one of
the speakers mentions

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.710
that Benito Juarez was
democratically elected president.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.200
Can you, Barbara and Michela also
as well tell us a little bit more

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.100
about Benito Juarez and
his rise to presidency?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.880
How did he get there?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.180
I know it's a big question,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.880
but [crosstalk] background
and context for her.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.780
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum:
It's an amazing story,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.650
and one that Mexicans
cherish very much.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.480
Benito Juarez was from the state
of [inaudible] in the south,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.230
which is an indigenous state.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.320
He was Zapotec Indian both sides,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.510
although interestingly enough
the Mexicans don't consider him

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.480
to be an Indian because
culturally he was not.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.910
At the age of three,
he was orphaned.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.670
He lost both his parents.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.840
And he basically walked from
his little village to the city

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.470
of Oaxaca, and apprenticed
himself to a lawyer,

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.950
and he ultimately became a lawyer.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.420
The mythology says that he
married the lawyer's daughter,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.840
but that's under dispute
at the moment,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.200
but he certainly married Margarita,
and he went on from there.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.030
He became governor of
the state of Oaxaca,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.430
and he was an avowed opponent
of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.810
who you probably have heard of.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.550
And Santa Anna exiled him.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.090
And he was in the United
States in New Orleans

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.770
where he was a reader
in a tobacco factory.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.380
Tobacco factories in
those days had --

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.560 position:56%
while people were making the cigars,
they would have a reader read

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.080
to them from books or the
newspaper or whatever,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.510
and he performed that function.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.300
As soon as the revolution of
Ayutla in 1854 was declared,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.780
Juarez and a lot of other
Mexican exiles left the U.S.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.250
and went back to Mexico.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.730 position:56%
Santana resigned from the presidency
the following year in 1855

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.650
and Juarez became the Minister
of Justice in the cabinet

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.980
and he is responsible for
a law called the Le Juarez

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.930
in which the church and the army
lose their special privileges,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.710
which was one of the
first blows struck

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.360
against the church in that period.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.130
Then very -- the head of the
government, Juan Alvarez,

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.010
resigned in favor of
Ignacio Comonfort

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.250
so everybody changed a
little bit their positions

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.220
and ultimately Juarez became
the head of [inaudible]

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.420
and then seated to the presidency.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.210
But Mexico goes through a
horrible period from 1858

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.640
when the government was taken
over by conservatives until 1867,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.310
which you saw in the film when
they throw out the French.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.320
And from that point on except

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.760
for a very small interlude
during the revolution,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.860
the conservatives never ever
take power again in Mexico

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.160
or at least not by [inaudible].

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.650
You can make your own
judgments about that.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:59.180
Benito Juarez died in
1872, and when you go to --

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.790
I'm not going to say if,
when you go to Mexico City,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.740 position:56%
you will see [inaudible] there is
what is called the [speaking foreign

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.840
language], which is
dedicated to Benito Juarez.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.970
This was put together
by his successor,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.090
Porfirio Diaz who was
also from Oaxaca.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.390
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Would you

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.980
like to add anything
to that, Michela?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.360
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Yes, I
mean, what I want to add is

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.270
that [inaudible] Espanol, we
are always looking for subjects

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.220
that are relevant to
our Hispanic audience

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.130
and 2017 marks the
150 year anniversary

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.200
of the restoration of the republic.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.040
And we always had wanted to do
something about Benito Juarez

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.250
because he's like a national
hero, a national icon in Mexico.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:55.140
He has become a single Mexican
nationalist and also a symbol

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:02.870
of resistance to foreign
intervention, and he is also --

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.790
you were mentioning he's
considered one of the propellers

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.710 position:56%
for the [inaudible] reform changes
that took place in the 19th century.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.780
So it's still very
relevant in present days,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:21.260
and he's the only president
that has a public holiday.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.820
His birthday is a public
holiday in Mexico, March 21.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.080 position:56%
And but also what I think -- I
think Mexico love a lot about him is

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.470
that he fought for equalitarian
rights, obviously had to fight

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.690
against a lot of prejudice
to become the leader

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.650
of the country being a
Native American himself.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.560
There were so many fascinating
things about this character.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.310
That's why we wanted
to tell a story,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.540 position:56%
and I think we found the right angle
with this historical anniversary.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.060
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
There was a question I had

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.670
because of all the events
that you could have chosen

00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:01.680
to address [inaudible] Benito
Juarez, you chose this year,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.150
this very particular
year for the docudrama.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: One other
reason why we chose this [inaudible]

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.310
because we thought it was a very --

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.480
he's not that well known like
[speaking foreign language]

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.430
and other things that just
came a couple of years before,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:24.060
but it's a very decisive moment for
Mexican history and it's the end

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.430
of foreign intervention,
and it's a second --

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.240
it's like a second
struggle for independence,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.940
almost a second defeat
of European power.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.670
So it's significant, and I
think it's a beautiful story.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.480
Republic [inaudible]
ran for four years

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.050
and so I think that's why
we chose this story of --

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.290
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: And
I want to congratulate you

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.560
for the lovely film that you made.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.100
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Thank you.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.580
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: It
really is an important story

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.010
for the Hispanic public
to see and also

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.400
for the non-Hispanic public to see.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.790
And you did a beautiful job.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.090
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli:
Thank you very much.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.100
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: You even
gave Maximillian red hair.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.400
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli:
That was difficult.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.870
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: I was so
shocked because I said to myself,

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.480
"They're not going to do that."

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.690
And there it was.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: One of the
images that really captured my mind

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.770
as a librarian and as an
archivist want to be probably is

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.320
that the film opens up with
the archive and it closes

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.620
with the archive as well.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.570 position:56%
It's an important -- it plays an
important role throughout the movie.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.120
So I would like you both to address
the archive as a narrative choice.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.490
Why did you choose it to be so?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.610
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Well for us
it's like a late motif of the film.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.380
He sees himself as probably the
guardian of the nation as a way

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.740
of defending the nation, and
it's interesting obviously

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.900
for budget reasons we
couldn't visualize that,

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.390
but he left with 11
wagons of documents,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.720
among them the declaration
of independence.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.470
So we just thought it
was a beautiful way

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:20.530
of showing his patriotism
for Mexico.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.000
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Well,
he should be the patron saint

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.550
of historians at least for
Mexicans because I can hardly think

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.320
of any dissertation or book
that could have been written

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.150
about Mexican history
without the archive.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.630
And so we are incredibly indebted,
and the archive has moved in many,

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:44.420
many ways, many places
in Mexico City.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.200
In fact, it's now housed in a
prison [speaking foreign language],

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.760
and it's sinking.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.600
So there's going to have
to be another rescue.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.820
I don't think we're going
to have to take the archives

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.950
to Chihuahua, at least I hope not.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:05.730 position:56%
I had to laugh because of course
Benito Juarez had to go to Chihuahua

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.670
and [speaking foreign language],
but the thing that's so funny

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:14.350 position:56%
about it is to somebody from the
south and even from the center to go

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.740
to Chihuahua, I mean it's like --

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.040
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Desert.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.670
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: You can't
possibly imagine what that means,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.850
and Chihuahua -- there's
a lot of desert there,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.140
and it's not exactly considered --

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.950
I mean, when you say
[inaudible] Chihuahua,

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.110
I mean that gives you a sense
of how they feel about it,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.180
and I love the part in the movie
where it shows U.S. on this side

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.280 position:56%
and Mexico on the other side because
if he had set foot in the U.S.,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.870
that would have been the end,
and he knew it very well.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.210
And the movie conveys
that extraordinarily

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.230
that he couldn't get
any further north.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.240
Now of course, he could have.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.750
He could have gone to the west
and go into Baja, California.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.220 position:56%
But luckily he never had to do that.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.470
But then how would he have
gotten -- I'm trying to think --

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.290
yeah, he would have had to
cross into the United States

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.150
in order to get the archives.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.240
So luckily depression stirred up
trouble just at the right moment.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.330
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
How is the research process

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.810
for a documentary like this made?

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.110
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Yes.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.230
Once we define the topic, we
hire a historical consultant

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.870
and in this case it was one
from the [inaudible] de Mexico.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.170
And then --

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.470
&gt;&gt; Erica?

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.770
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Yeah, correct.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:49.710
And then we did pre-interviews
with all the experts,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.830
different specialties, some people

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.540
from the specialty
of the second empire.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.950
We had there a military historian
[speaking foreign language].

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.690
So the different disciplines,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.750
and we did a pre-interview
with all of them.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.400
Once we had the pre-interview,
we write a script.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.810
Then we do the official interview.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.820 position:56%
We recorded the interview with the
official already recorded interview.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.880
We do the recreation
so we know exactly --

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.180
we have already chosen certain
moments we want to visualize,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:30.210
and after that, we have again the
consultant reviewing everything is

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:35.090
fine and even doing the recreation
obviously for all the costumes,

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:41.590
the location, we have [inaudible]
involved in the project.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:46.920
And then doing the postproduction
[inaudible] but it's process

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.060
that takes three to six
months to preproduction.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.420
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Can you talk a little bit

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.040 position:56%
about the effectiveness of docudrama

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.760
versus a more traditional
[crosstalk].

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.780
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: I mean, I
love traditional documentary,

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:05.380
but I do see an advantage of
doing docudrama for the viewers.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.630
It's a very engaging
way of telling a story

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.170
and also I think you can
humanize your character better.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:18.360
In the case of Benito Juarez, many
people have seen a picture of him,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.050
the photograph that we see here,
and there's a lot of stature,

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.980 position:56%
but in this case we really wanted
to show him as the man of the family

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.180
and father and husband, and
you could only have done it

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.360
through dramatization, and I
think it's a very engaging way

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.750
of telling the story.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.880
You take some freedom sometimes,
but that makes it more accessible

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.260
for our viewers, and we love
to make history accessible

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.260
and entertaining to all the views.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.560
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Barbara,

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.060
you have studied extensively the
relationship between the U.S.,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:03.150
Mexico and we see that the U.S.
plays an important role even

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.180 position:56%
in this -- during this intervention.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.260
Could you elaborate
a little bit on it?

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.110
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Well, I
would like to be able to say

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.980
that this was the last
intervention into Mexico.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:18.200 position:56%
But unfortunately, the United States
intervened twice in the 20th century

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:26.980
in Mexico, once to -- it's a
very confusing story that needs

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.610
to be really written
more extensively.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.610
Once in [inaudible] where we were
there for probably almost a year

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.000
and the other was when [inaudible].

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.040
Yes, went into Columbus, New
Mexico and shot up the town

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.980
and killed some people and
so General Pershing went

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:52.490
with General Patton as his
[inaudible] into Mexico

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.350
which was a dress rehearsal
for World War I

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.530
for the U.S. intervention
into World War I.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:03.780
On the other hand, to put in a
note, a positive note for a change,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.210
about the United States and
Mexico, if it hadn't been

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.530
for Woodrow Wilson, Lord knows
what would have happened to Mexico

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.750
because Woodrow Wilson
refused to accept [inaudible]

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:20.880 position:56%
who was a conservative as president
because he had gotten the presidency

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.550
through assassination
and thanks to his refusal

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.760
to recognize [inaudible] fell

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.590
and so Mexico became a
democratic state again,

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.620
and it's really quite remarkable.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.020
Mexico is a very remarkable place.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.210
For example, and this is something
that people don't make enough hay

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:48.160
about as far as I'm concerned,
in 1920 -- excuse me in 1829,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.050
President [inaudible]
abolished slavery in Mexico.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:57.210
Now you can see there's a big
difference between 1829 and 1865

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.980
when the United States did it.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.510
Now for sure, there were a
lot fewer slaves in Mexico

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.420
but still it's the concept.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.500
And if you think about
it hard, you'll realize

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.270
that it cost Mexico ultimately
55 percent of its territory

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:20.170
because the Texans were not going
to accept a nonslave republic

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:26.040
and so they won their
freedom in 1836.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.880
Now, so the relationship
with the United States --

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.960
Porfirio Diaz famously
said poor Mexico,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.350
so close to the United
States and so far from God.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.350
And he had a point.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.350
But on the other hand, Mexico had

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.800
as the United States
some superb leaders,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.580
and in this particular case,
they were at the same time.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.770 position:56%
So you had Lincoln in the United
States and Juarez in Mexico and both

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.620
of them saved the nationality

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.050
of their respective republics,
and that was wonderful.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:08.120
Now the fact that the United
States -- you see it in the film,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.330
President Johnson says
America for the Americans.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:17.410 position:56%
What he meant was the south of the
United States for the United States.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:25.690
But he did help in important
ways to save Mexican sovereignty,

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.890
and that was a very big
and wonderful thing.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.190
So --

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Did Benito
Juarez ever visit the United States

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.140
as President of Mexico?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.390
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Well, I mean
he was there during his exile,

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.270 position:56%
but he wasn't president at the time.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.140
No, he did not, not as president,

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.990
the United States as
president, no, no.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.960
And he never met with
President Lincoln,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.330
although a lot of people
think he did.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: I have two
more questions, but I want to see

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:00.960
if someone else has
questions for our specialists

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.750
and our executive producer
from the audience?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.690
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: While
you're thinking of questions --

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.110
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Don't be shy.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.630
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Let me
tell you about Cinco de Mayo.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.740
Many, many people --

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.410
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: We did that --
by the way, we did a documentary,

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.450
a docudrama about Cindo de Mayo.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.750
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Oh, you're producing it?

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.670
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum:
I want to see it.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Excellent.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.580
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Now many
of you or maybe none of you think

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.970
that Cinco de Mayo was
Mexican Independence Day.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.960
It is not.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:41.460
Cinco de Mayo represents a
battle that took place in 1862

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.610 position:56%
between the Mexicans and the French.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.450
And in this case, Ignacio Saragosa
[assumed spelling] who was head

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:54.550
of the Mexican Army and by the way
born in Texas, defeated the French.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.130
It was one of those few cases

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.000
in which a Latin American power
defeated a European power.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.410 position:56%
And that is why it is celebrated in
California and in the United States.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.960
Usually it's an opportunity
for us to have tacos and beer,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.810
neither of which is a bad thing.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:20.560
But it commemorates something
very, very serious and important.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.600
In Mexico, of course,
they don't commemorate.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.970
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Could you tell us something

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.110
about that documentary
that you're producing.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.850
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Yeah, we did
it for the 150 year anniversary

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.260
of [inaudible], and we
used very similar --

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:42.120
we sort of took a couple of the
military both from the French side

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.710
and the Mexican side to humanize
the story, and then we --

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:51.210
it was a coproduction
with the state of Puebla.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:56.940
So we had 200 army at our
disposal for the scenes.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.060
It was a military -- it
was more of a battle.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:06.380
So it was -- it was every
single different moment

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.840
of the battle were visualized.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.800
So it was a different
document than this one.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.390
It covered less time, but
it was very effective,

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.340
and it did very well
with our audience.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Excellent.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.020
How does Discovery
choose their topics

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.940 position:56%
for the documentaries and for the --

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.460
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli:
Documetnary or --

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.770
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
What is docudrama?

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.440
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Well,
generally we look at anniversaries

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.900
because it's always good to
be talking about something

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:43.230
that is relevant with the
present, and we try to find sort

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:48.800
of meaningful anniversary
for our Hispanic audience.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.170 position:56%
We have done two specials already
in [inaudible], one about the attack

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.800
of Columbus that you were
just mentioning before.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.780
It was on last year.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.910
We did something about a conspiracy

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.240
of the assassination
of Pancho Villa.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.560
That was -- we did
[speaking foreign language].

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.660
We did something about independence
for the 200 year anniversary

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.750
of the independence of Mexico.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.940
And we did -- that was
a little more difficult.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.170 position:56%
We did a biography on Porfirio Diaz.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.020 position:56%
It was difficult because he's a
very controversial figure in Mexico.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.320
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Oh yes.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.260
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: And so we
had to really balance the story

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.180 position:56%
and we started from the present
because there's a movement in Mexico

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:35.130
that would like his body
to be returned to Mexico

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.870
because it's buried in Paris.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.330
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: In
the [inaudible] cemetery.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.630
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Yes.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.230
So we look for fascinating
stories relevant,

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.190
and they have been
working very well,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.930
especially with our Mexican
Hispanic audience here

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.550
in the U.S. I particularly
love to do them.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.340
I learn a lot.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.810
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Is
there a docudrama that you would

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.080 position:56%
like to produce that you're thinking
this is a moment we need to --

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.490
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli:
There is a lot of them.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.790
I have a long list.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.380
I would love to do the history
of Maxilimillian and Carlota

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.990
from their perspective about
this moment of history.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.340
I think that's fascinating too.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.670 position:56%
Something about the Mexican American
wars will be interesting too.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.350
We have never done
something specifically

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.890
about the revolution of Mexico.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:26.330
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: There's a
lot of stories for the revolution.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.630
That's for sure.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.230
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Very many stories to tell.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.530
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: Can I --

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:35.780
I'd like to make a note
here about two effects

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.260
of the French intervention
that were permanent.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:48.150 position:56%
One of them is that that term Latin
America comes from the Napoleon III.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.140
It is an imperialist term.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.870
So if you call yourself Latino and
Latina, you should think about it

00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:01.110
because that -- Napoleon
said after all,

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:06.070
the western hemisphere
is mostly Catholic

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.650
and Romance language speaking so
therefore it's Latin American.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.540
The other thing is
really quite funny.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:21.130
When you think of Mexico, there are
several things that come to mind.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:27.800
Tequila, for example, but also
what comes to mind are mariachi,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.370 position:56%
and the mariachi is -- there's a
lot of dispute but there is a school

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.580
of thought that says the
mariachi came from marriages

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.620
that were performed
during the empire,

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.110
and the French word
marriage became mariachi.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.350
So and that has stuck.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.900
So when you see a guy playing
an instrument whose got silver

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.190
up his leg, remember
that might have come

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.670
from a French wedding
somewhere in Mexico.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.970
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Good story.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.770
Maybe a story of the
mariachi [inaudible].

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:11.210
Before we go, Barbara, why
don't you tell our audience

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.520
of the marvelous -- you were the
Mexican specialist for many years

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:22.030
at the library and our
holdings have so many treasures.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.680
Would you like to tell
them a little bit

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.690
of our collection in the library?

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.460
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: I mean,
our collection in the --

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:34.680
the wonderful thing about
the Library of Congress is

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.090
that it's a vehicle for surprise.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.870
You say to yourself, oh they
can't have something on that.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.040 position:56%
And you look it up, and yes they do.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.340
My favorite of those
is when I was --

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.290
we had to do something
about -- oh yeah.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:55.190
We had to do something about
the [inaudible] and the Spanish

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:59.160
versus the indigenous and I
said, "They don't have anything

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.270
on Santiago de Compostela
the pilgrimage route

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.840
that people are still
taking to go to El Camino."

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.590
And low and behold in our rare
book division, there's a piece

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:17.410
of parchment that says you have --

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:22.750
because you have walked
the pilgrimage route,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.710
it's a Santiago de Compostela,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.650
you will receive the
following indulgences,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.670
and it stays in the 13th century.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:36.570
It's just amazing the
stuff that you could find

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.370
in the Library of Congress.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:45.970
For Mexico, we have a book for
example that was a legal case

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.060
that the founder of La
Paz Baja, California.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.960
His wife was trying
to get a noble title,

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.230
and there's a [inaudible]
piece that's in four colors

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.470
in gold leaf dating
from the 17th century.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:07.960
The amount of materials that
we -- we have, for example,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:16.100 position:56%
a poem by Pabo [inaudible] that was
written on the remnants of the linen

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:21.650 position:56%
from shirts during the Spanish Civil
War because they didn't have paper

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.220
so they had to use this linen.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.160
It's just absolutely amazing
what the Library of Congress has.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.190
We have a gift in the reading room.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.300
Come see the Hispanic Reading Room.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.600
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
We have a picture

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.900
of Benito Juarez in
our reading room.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.200
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: We have
a picture of Benito Juarez

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.160
that was given to us by
President [inaudible] in the 70's.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.250
We have the only murals in the
Library of Congress that were done

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.760
by a Brazilian artist, [inaudible].

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.960
That, of course, I don't
say this in front of her,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.870
but that's because Nelson
Rockefeller was paying,

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.600
and he wasn't going
to let Diego Rivera,

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.000
God forbid, paint the murals.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.100
And of course if Diego Rivera
had painted the murals,

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.170
we would have lines around
the block waiting to see.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.800
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Come on.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.100
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: We would.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.400
We would.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.700
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.000
Having [inaudible] murals is
absolutely fantastic, and Michela,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.680
you should come and
see them definitely.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.980
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: I will.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.280
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: and
the portrait by Benito Juarez.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.990
It's wonderful because
people walk in --

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.760
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: I
have a question for you.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.440
Do you know if it's true

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.870
that Bernito Mussolini was
named after Benito Juarez?

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.290
Have you ever heard this story?

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.590
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: No.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.890
I don't think that's true.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.390
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: His
parents were socialists and --

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.220
I don't know, it's just I heard
this story, and I wondered if --

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.530
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenebaum: I'm going
to ask the Italian specialist.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:40.840
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli:
Okay, thank you.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.520
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Is it
something you've heard then that --

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.820
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum:
I've never heard it.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.860
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: I heard these
rumors, and I was just curious.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.160
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: I doubt it.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.890
But I will check on it for you.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.190
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Thank you.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.490
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
Interesting.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:54.790
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum:
You have to give me --

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.090
did you give me your card?

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.390
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: I will.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.690
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Do
we have any questions from --

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.030
oh, there's one, one
all the way to the back.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.330
There's a microphone.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.970
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: I can't see.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.450
&gt;&gt; Do you have any comment about
Hollywood's version of Juarez,

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:17.590
the film Juarez that was made
in 1930 starring Paul Mooney?

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.960
And how inaccurate
or accurate was that?

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.240
I know it wasn't based on
primary sources and everything,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.780
but the film Juarez
starring Paul Mooney.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.680
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli:
I haven't seen it.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.350
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum:
I haven't seen it.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.290
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez:
I haven't seen it.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.000
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: I
heard, but I know the --

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.690
we didn't see it for this.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.730
&gt;&gt; Barbara Tenenbaum: No.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.840
None of us have seen it.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.140
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman Gonzalez: Sorry.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.440
Anyone else?

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.740
Catalina?

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.280
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about
where the scenes --

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.250
the docudrama scenes are filmed.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.640
Did you guys go to Mexico
to the different places

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.440
or did you have a set here?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.670
&gt;&gt; Michela Giorelli: Yeah,
I mean, we did most of them

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:18.930
in the area close to the effect,
some of the colonial haciendas

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:23.340
and for the desert sequence,
we went to which is not too far

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:29.140
from Mexico City also,
Hidalgo and there is a couple

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.120
of scene in the area of Pueblo.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.420
So [inaudible] is one, but
they were just around the --

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.720
not to far from the effect.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.020
Yes.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.350
