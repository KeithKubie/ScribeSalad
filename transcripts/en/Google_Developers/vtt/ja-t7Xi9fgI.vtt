&gt;&gt; PETERSON: So, good morning, everybody.
My name is Dan Peterson. I'm a product manager

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.200
for Google Wave. I'm primarily focused on
the platform APIs and the underlying Federation

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.639
Protocol. So, glad to have everybody here
today. It's a big crew. We've got a lot of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.880
stuff we can hopefully hack on. It's definitely
been a wild ride over the last seven weeks.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.700
I think we've seen a lot of people experimenting
and prototyping with some of the APIs we have

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.210
available. We've also given out more than
6,000 accounts at this point, and we have

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.649
20,000 more requests in the pipe we're working
through over the next--in the next month or

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.769
so. We've also heard a lot of feedback about
the general usability of Wave itself as well

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.940
as sort of people who are starting to grok
the way it models. Certainly, things are very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.399
early with Wave in particular. So, we're open
to lots of feedback and are iterating as we

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.409
go. We just want to involve everybody else
as we iterate to make this the best platform

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.649
possible. So, general flow for the day, well,
and--general flow for the day, we have--David

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.340
will be giving an API overview shortly and
Dan Marcelo will come up and do a tutorial

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.979
about the Java Robots API, and then we'll
take a quick break for lunch and bathroom

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.219
breaks and that kind of thing. And then we'll
do a panel for Q and A about the APIs and

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.810
maybe Google Wave in general if you have questions
like that. One logistical note, if you don't

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.579
already have your accounts--where is Allan?
So, first of all, double check your spam folders

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.200
because everybody in this room should have
gotten accounts. Allan Green was standing

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.780
over there or maybe he is--oh, there you go.
Allan over there in the blue shirt, if you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.780
don't yet have your accounts, hunt down Allan
later. He's friendly. And let's see, at the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.659
end of the day, after we sort of get in to
the hacking time, we'll have some time for

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.810
people to demo what they have been building,
some of the earlier prototypes and that kind

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.530
of thing. So, just a heads up for that and
we'll have beer arrive and that kind of thing.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.340
So, next up, we actually have Lars Rasmussen
joining us from Sydney for quick announcement.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.340
Know that it is 3AM in Sydney.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.560
&gt;&gt; RASMUSSEN: Yes, hello. Good morning.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.340
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: There you are.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.310
&gt;&gt; RASMUSSEN: Hello, good morning. I don't
actually have anything to say. I think Dan

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.519
just really likes the idea of me being up
until three in the morning.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.379
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: You said you're going to be in
pajamas.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.150
&gt;&gt; RASMUSSEN: I was going to--oh, I'm wearing
pajamas. You just can't--the cameras just

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.760
couldn't zoom in too much. So, you know, you
guys, welcome, thanks for coming. I know it's

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.049
a lot of your time to come here for a full
Monday. I wanted to share a little bit about

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:56.049
our short term plans for Wave. So, you guys
are all on Wave Sandbox as part of our developer

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.230
preview. On September 30th, so in a little
bit more than two months, we're going to move

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.489
our preview from that separate sandbox build
onto the main Wave index on wave.google.com

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.760
that we're actually using now for dark footing
[ph] inside of Google and then we're going

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.760
to extend the scope of the preview beyond
developers. So we'll invite around about a

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.890
hundred thousand users starting, of course,
with you guys. By then, we'll have some tens

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.310
of thousands of developers in the Sandbox.
But we'll take, we have a lot of requests

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.099
from wave.google.com, from people that offered
to help find bugs and so on. And so we'll

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.430
invite them on board so that we'll have around
about a hundred thousand users starting on

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.430
September 30th. And what we're going to spend
our time on between now and then is three

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.370
things--well, four actually. It's speed. You
have noticed that you tried the Sandbox and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.230
we've carefully have ordered the trap of premature
optimization. So, we're going to be working

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.230
on that a lot. It's reliability. We are going
to be, roughly speaking, taking it from the

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.659
alpha level quality that you are filling now
to something more like a beta so that mostly

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.620
you'll be able to get through a day's work
without any crashes. And then usability. There's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.270
a good deal of usability problems that you
guys are facing, in particular, how to keep

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.410
your inbox calm and useful. And so those are
the things we'll work on. And one of the reasons

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.310
that we're sharing this--we don't normally
do this at Google, we don't normally share

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.060
plans for the future and so on--well, one
of the things we learned from back in the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.550
maps days was in particular when you want
to get developers involved, which we obviously

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.550
do, it's a helpful thing to share future plans.
So, we hope we'll do well with this and we

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.810
need your help as well. We'd like to be able
to by September 30th maybe highlight some

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.360
of the things that you guys are building.
And so we've started seeing some early examples

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.050
of what people have built with Wave and it's
very exciting and so on, but they tend--of

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.600
course, this is still very early, to be fairly
small in scope. And so we're looking forward,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.770
of course, to seeing really ambitious things.
We'd like to think that Wave can be used to

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.770
build really big and meaningful collaborative
applications. And if you guys are planning

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.280
something like that, so beyond what you can
build in a few days, let Dan and his team

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.280
know, and later we'll feature your extension
or your site imbedding Wave as part of this

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.900
whole thing of extending the preview at the
end of September. And so I want to say, and

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.100
we have done a few of these hackathons, and
I always emphasize that we want you guys to

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.620
be really ambitious and we want you guys also
to be demanding of us. We want that if you

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.349
build a site and embed Wave, then the Wave
should feel like a natural part of your site.

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:11.120
And if you build extensions for Wave, that
those extensions should feel to the Wave user

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.639
as if they were a first class citizen, a native
part of Wave. And we know that we don't have

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.160
all the hooks in place in the APIs to do this.
And, so, whenever you find yourself building

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.410
something that feels a little clunky, it doesn't
quite feel like it's part of Wave or it doesn't

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.220
quite feel like the Wave is part of your site,
let us know. Help us construct the right APIs

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.220
to make this possible. I know Dan and his
team loves nothing more than demanding developers

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.759
wanting more. Right, Dan?

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.289
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:50.289
&gt;&gt; RASMUSSEN: Thank you. So, we're also going
to work on, of course, on the API. We're going

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.810
to--the actual installation flow for user,
installing the extension--I think we've just--just

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.220
today actually put some more code in the Sandbox
for that, but we're working on that. We'll

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.220
also build a gallery-like experience so that
users can find the extensions without necessarily

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:18.970
having to have them shared in the Wave with
them. And the last thing, I wanted to just

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:25.970
mention--we get asked this a lot about monetization.
So, we're keen to make Wave a viable business

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:32.599
both for us and for you guys. And one thing
that many people have suggested is whether

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:39.599
we could build some sort of applications store
where you guys could find different ways of

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.919
monetizing the things that you build. And
this is something we're thinking about. I

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:46.379
don't have anything to announce. I just want
you guys to know that it is something we're

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:53.379
thinking about. And with that, I'll hand it
back to Dan. You guys have a great time hacking

00:07:54.409 --> 00:08:01.409
through the day. Who knows, maybe I will be
awake again by the time you guys end. Thank

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:06.430
you.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:12.949
&gt;&gt; PETERSON: Good night, Lars.

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:17.610
&gt;&gt; RASMUSSEN: Indeed. Thank you.
