so when I read about these outbreaks of

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
so when I read about these outbreaks of
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.190
so when I read about these outbreaks of
bacteria in the newspaper you know in

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
bacteria in the newspaper you know in
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900
bacteria in the newspaper you know in
the cereal industry and the alfalfa

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
the cereal industry and the alfalfa
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.499
the cereal industry and the alfalfa
industry tomatoes hamburgers my feeling

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
industry tomatoes hamburgers my feeling
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.019
industry tomatoes hamburgers my feeling
of course is the same as as yours it's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
of course is the same as as yours it's
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.939
of course is the same as as yours it's
dangerous right I don't want to eat that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
dangerous right I don't want to eat that
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.849
dangerous right I don't want to eat that
tomato because I don't have any special

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
tomato because I don't have any special
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189
tomato because I don't have any special
property that makes me better at dealing

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
property that makes me better at dealing
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200
property that makes me better at dealing
with bacteria than you so I have that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
with bacteria than you so I have that
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.580
with bacteria than you so I have that
reaction the same reaction I think

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
reaction the same reaction I think
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.519
reaction the same reaction I think
anyone has when they read about those

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529
anyone has when they read about those
 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.630
anyone has when they read about those
except that I think the reaction that I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
except that I think the reaction that I
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.510
except that I think the reaction that I
don't have is the one where people think

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
don't have is the one where people think
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160
don't have is the one where people think
everything's getting worse there's all

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
everything's getting worse there's all
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380
everything's getting worse there's all
these pathogens you know that's not true

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
these pathogens you know that's not true
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510
these pathogens you know that's not true
these pathogens have been on this earth

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
these pathogens have been on this earth
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.520
these pathogens have been on this earth
or these bacteria for billions of years

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
or these bacteria for billions of years
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.190
or these bacteria for billions of years
and the reason we read about them in the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
and the reason we read about them in the
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.229
and the reason we read about them in the
newspaper is not because the bacteria

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
newspaper is not because the bacteria
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.690
newspaper is not because the bacteria
have changed and gotten worse it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
have changed and gotten worse it's
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.389
have changed and gotten worse it's
because technology or industry or the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
because technology or industry or the
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.760
because technology or industry or the
environment has changed and we're coming

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
environment has changed and we're coming
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610
environment has changed and we're coming
in contact with a bacterium that's just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
in contact with a bacterium that's just
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.049
in contact with a bacterium that's just
been hanging around for billions of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
been hanging around for billions of
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.439
been hanging around for billions of
years

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
years
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.810
years
and then but we're in contact with it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
and then but we're in contact with it
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759
and then but we're in contact with it
and our immune system doesn't know how

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
and our immune system doesn't know how
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590
and our immune system doesn't know how
to deal with it and so I think a coli

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
to deal with it and so I think a coli
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780
to deal with it and so I think a coli
o157 is a great example of that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
o157 is a great example of that
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.200
o157 is a great example of that
it used to be if a farmer's cow you know

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
it used to be if a farmer's cow you know
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.230
it used to be if a farmer's cow you know
ate e : e coli o157 and the cow got

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
ate e : e coli o157 and the cow got
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.490
ate e : e coli o157 and the cow got
infected and the farmer and his family

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
infected and the farmer and his family
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190
infected and the farmer and his family
ate it it would be unfortunate but it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
ate it it would be unfortunate but it
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380
ate it it would be unfortunate but it
didn't end up in a thousand hamburgers

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
didn't end up in a thousand hamburgers
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660
didn't end up in a thousand hamburgers
you know all over the country you know

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
you know all over the country you know
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969
you know all over the country you know
that's that's because industry's changed

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
that's that's because industry's changed
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.910
that's that's because industry's changed
right and so so these sort of blips that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
right and so so these sort of blips that
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.550
right and so so these sort of blips that
we see are not because the bacteria are

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
we see are not because the bacteria are
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620
we see are not because the bacteria are
getting worse and that's the thing I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
getting worse and that's the thing I
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240
getting worse and that's the thing I
think that most people don't understand

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
think that most people don't understand
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649
think that most people don't understand
when they read in the newspaper about

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
when they read in the newspaper about
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.219
when they read in the newspaper about
the Salmonella e.coli it's just that in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
the Salmonella e.coli it's just that in
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740
the Salmonella e.coli it's just that in
the technology has changed it's smacked

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
the technology has changed it's smacked
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.230
the technology has changed it's smacked
us up against them right and I'm not

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
us up against them right and I'm not
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179
us up against them right and I'm not
saying we shouldn't fix it we should but

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
saying we shouldn't fix it we should but
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.469
saying we shouldn't fix it we should but
I just wish people would say that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
I just wish people would say that
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.789
I just wish people would say that
bacteria aren't getting worse and worse

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
bacteria aren't getting worse and worse
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.399
bacteria aren't getting worse and worse
that's not what's happening right he's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
that's not what's happening right he's
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.110
that's not what's happening right he's
just been going on for billions of years

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120
just been going on for billions of years
 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.560
 
I think that I don't think that I would

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
I think that I don't think that I would
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.610
I think that I don't think that I would
never there's a whole editorial on how

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620
never there's a whole editorial on how
 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.010
never there's a whole editorial on how
we grow b4n things like that right which

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020
we grow b4n things like that right which
 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.500
we grow b4n things like that right which
is not my expertise at all you know

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510
is not my expertise at all you know
 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.600
is not my expertise at all you know
that's a so each of us makes personal

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
that's a so each of us makes personal
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.070
that's a so each of us makes personal
decisions about the food we want to eat

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
decisions about the food we want to eat
 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.140
decisions about the food we want to eat
based on those things but I think that

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150
based on those things but I think that
 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.940
based on those things but I think that
that you know we're not going to go back

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950
that you know we're not going to go back
 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.790
that you know we're not going to go back
to subsistence farming right I mean it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800
to subsistence farming right I mean it's
 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440
to subsistence farming right I mean it's
gonna be industrialized and so I do

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
gonna be industrialized and so I do
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.110
gonna be industrialized and so I do
think that there are rather easy

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
think that there are rather easy
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.550
think that there are rather easy
Prevention's of the you know by

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560
Prevention's of the you know by
 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.950
Prevention's of the you know by
monitoring and spending money on

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960
monitoring and spending money on
 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.390
monitoring and spending money on
surveillance and monitoring that can can

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
surveillance and monitoring that can can
 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.090
surveillance and monitoring that can can
fix for the most part these problems and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100
fix for the most part these problems and
 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.620
fix for the most part these problems and
so I think that each time that we have

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630
so I think that each time that we have
 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.310
so I think that each time that we have
these unfortunates episodes in fact it

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320
these unfortunates episodes in fact it
 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.230
these unfortunates episodes in fact it
does except for the hysteria that

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240
does except for the hysteria that
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.360
does except for the hysteria that
happens it does actually help us to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370
happens it does actually help us to
 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.780
happens it does actually help us to
strengthen the infrastructure to have

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
strengthen the infrastructure to have
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.330
strengthen the infrastructure to have
better quality healthy food and there's

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340
better quality healthy food and there's
 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.280
better quality healthy food and there's
certainly a movement you know people

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290
certainly a movement you know people
 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.930
certainly a movement you know people
aren't going to tolerate that right and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940
aren't going to tolerate that right and
 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.520
aren't going to tolerate that right and
so I think that all of that works

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530
so I think that all of that works
 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.310
so I think that all of that works
together and the problem with it is that

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320
together and the problem with it is that
 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.410
together and the problem with it is that
the bacteria get the blame you know as

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
the bacteria get the blame you know as
 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.400
the bacteria get the blame you know as
opposed to you know how we humans are

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410
opposed to you know how we humans are
 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.800
opposed to you know how we humans are
choosing to process food and so that's

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810
choosing to process food and so that's
 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.900
choosing to process food and so that's
the only to me like misconception about

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910
the only to me like misconception about
 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.270
the only to me like misconception about
where the blame should land

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
 
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.340
