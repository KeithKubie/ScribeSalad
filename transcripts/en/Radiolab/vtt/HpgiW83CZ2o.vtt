You are listening to radio lab radio lab

S. E. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.860
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab podcast.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.650
And today on the podcast, something a little different.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.860
A little while ago we happened to find ourselves on the stage of symphony space,

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.270
which is a theater in Manhattan in New York City.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.300
And we were doing a show with selected shorts,

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.180
which is a radio show that's produced out of our home station,

10
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.890
w NYC hurdled across the country.

11
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.690
And they had asked us very generously to curate an evening of stories.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.880
And so we chose a bunch of stories with the staff.

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.880
Got Some really unbelievably wonderful actors, like a who,

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.710
who is their main curtain with clear curtain Metta Story. Um,

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.820
Kara Cedric was there. Yeah. And, and leave Shriver read his story,

16
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.340
which you're going to hear. So we just want to play you that story,

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.550
which made up the second half of the show, uh, for this podcast.

18
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:00.710
And here's how that one began.

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.013
<v 1>Hello.</v>

20
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.050
<v 0>Okay, we are back for part two. Um,</v>

21
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.460
this next story could use a little bit of setup. We think, uh,

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.870
I don't know how many of you know this, but uh,

23
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.410
there is a theory but 25 years old now that explains how the Earth got a moon

24
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.360
and a, it goes like [inaudible].

25
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 2>Yes. So about four and a half billion years ago,</v>

26
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.250
the earth was no fresh new planet was going around the sun and the solar system

27
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:35.510
was having a sort of a fire east sort of chaotic period and into the mix.

28
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.880
A very large planetoid about the size of Mars kind of went rogue and began

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830
bumping around and there was a hit on collision between the earth and this

30
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.830
planet and the two one [inaudible] and the,

31
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
the incoming one melted much of the earth.

32
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.240
The earth became sort of vaporous and everything on the earth just went to gas

33
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.930
and it sort of flew up and then the earth just became sort of an unsolid for

34
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.040
awhile. When it cooled,

35
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.240
the earth fell back into place and there was this extra thing very,

36
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.700
very close by that we call [inaudible]

37
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.410
<v 0>the moon. But ever since that, that moment, these two celestial orbs,</v>

38
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:14.250
the earth and the moon have been very gradually, very,

39
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:18.630
very slowly drifting away from each other at a rate of,

40
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.130
and this is interesting, one nanometer per second, which is not a lot.

41
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:24.660
It's about a, just for practical,

42
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.010
practical sort of analogy that's about the speed that your fingernails grow. Uh,

43
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.010
but imagine your fingernails growing for four and a half billion years and

44
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.050
you've got a pretty long fingernail.

45
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.710
<v 2>Yes. And are there are further away me? Yes.</v>

46
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.640
So this is a story from Italo Calvino I'm just doing the FM radio.

47
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.720
I don't know how he really is. He's a Cuban born writer. He moved to Italy,

48
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.400
grew up there. They fought the Nazis for the end of World War II.

49
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.210
Wrote a book about that. Then what are many other books? And among them,

50
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.310
he created a series of stories called cosmic comics. Um,

51
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080
they'll mostly have the same Matt narrator,

52
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.420
mysterious character called yes. What's he going?

53
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.470
Keep, keep, keep a quick,

54
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.550
<v 0>you're having a whole debate and backstage about how to say this.</v>

55
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.050
How do you spell it? You spell it.

56
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.780
[inaudible] F W F Q. Kief. Yeah. Cliff.

57
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.480
Cute paperwork for hell. You have to wait for it. [inaudible] the hill. Yeah,

58
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.940
yeah, yeah. The guy sort of that. So this uh, this fellow, he's very ancient.

59
00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:24.810
He tells stories. Yeah.

60
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.020
<v 2>Uh, it, the story is concluded the origin of the universe,</v>

61
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.970
the beginning of time. So, uh,

62
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.840
<v 0>and I should say it, it will be read for you today by an incredible actor,</v>

63
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.960
director, producer, screenwriter,

64
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.450
and a man who flew for the last decade.

65
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.530
Would you say has been a Roberts unrequited boy crush?

66
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.020
Yeah, one sided, Bro. Man, it's not, it's not like sexual anything.

67
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.590
It's just like, but it is, it is a thing

68
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.050
<v 1>because I</v>

69
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.003
know

70
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.020
<v 2>he just pops out.</v>

71
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.750
We have come down under the stage and he hands me this little piece of paper

72
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.270
sort of pretending like he's handing Robert his phone number. But yeah,

73
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.950
definitely not. There's no way.

74
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.890
<v 1>I was, I was watching it</v>

75
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.200
<v 2>play once, this is many years ago called don't look back.</v>

76
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.050
And there was an actor in it named Jane Alexander, just amazing actress.

77
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.060
And she walked onto the stage in this play and she just dropped some luggage on

78
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:22.760
the stage and looked around and sh,

79
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.870
and in that moment she hadn't said anything yet. There was like a,

80
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.670
there was a history there. Uh, uh,

81
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.560
there was so much information before there was any sound.

82
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.390
I never saw that again until a few years ago in a view from the bridge.

83
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.540
VM Schreiber was, um, a longshoreman. He was just sitting.

84
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.310
The play begins and there's a guy sitting in chair reading a newspaper.

85
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.340
I think he turned a page. And so I'm sitting there and I'm seeing,

86
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.050
uh, an entire universe of a person.

87
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.570
And I don't know how he did it.

88
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.490
You may know his work from Glen Gary, Glen Ross, the loudest of the Mamet plays,

89
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:07.600
and he's on TV and stuff. I simply think he's, this is the Cressey Pie.

90
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.180
I think he's like the best living actor.

91
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.330
<v 1>No, no pressure or anything.</v>

92
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.020
<v 0>Yeah. And he has to say per foot book. Uh,</v>

93
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.941
it is a tall order.

94
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:27.560
Here he is to read a Italo Calvino's the distance of the moon. Liev Schreiber

95
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.663
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

96
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.510
<v 2>the distance of the moon by Italo Calvino at one time.</v>

97
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:54.130
According to Sir George H Darwin, the moon was very close to the earth.

98
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.160
Then the tides gradually pushed her far away.

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 3>The tides that the moon herself causes in the earth's waters where the earth</v>

100
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.740
slowly loses energy. How well,

101
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.000
I know old food

102
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.893
<v 1>crime.</v>

103
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.150
<v 3>The rest of you can remember, but I can, we had her on top of us all the time.</v>

104
00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:22.830
That enormous moon when she was full, Nikes is brightest day,

105
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:26.910
but with a butter colored light. It looked as if she were going to crush us.

106
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.140
When she was new,

107
00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:32.610
she rolled around the sky like a black umbrella blown by the wind and when she

108
00:06:32.611 --> 00:06:35.760
was waxing, she came forward with her horn so low.

109
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:39.600
She seemed about to stick into the peak of a promintory and get caught there.

110
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.130
But the whole business of the moon's phases worked in a different way then

111
00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:48.480
because the distances from the sun were different than the orbits and the angle

112
00:06:48.481 --> 00:06:50.900
of the something or rather, I forget what.

113
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.740
As for eclipses with Earth and moon stuck together the way they were,

114
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.170
why we had eclipses every minute.

115
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.610
Naturally those two big monsters managed to put each other in the shade

116
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:06.870
constantly. First one, then the other orbit, oh elliptical.

117
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:11.130
Of course for a while it would huddle against us and then it would take flight.

118
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:15.600
For Awhile. The tides, when the moons swung closer, rose so high,

119
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:20.280
nobody could hold them back. There were nights when the moon was full and very,

120
00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:25.281
very low and the tide was so high that the moon mist a dunking in the sea by a

121
00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:29.130
hair's breath. No, let's say a few yards. Anyway,

122
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.610
climb up on the moon. Of course we did.

123
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.560
All you had to do was roll out in a boat when you're underneath,

124
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.550
prop a ladder against her and scramble up

125
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.850
the spot where the moon was lowest as she went by was off the sink cliffs.

126
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.360
We used to go out with those little rowboats they had in those days round and

127
00:07:48.361 --> 00:07:52.840
flat made of Cork. They held quite a few of us. Me, Captain [inaudible],

128
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.570
the hid his wife, my deaf cousin, and sometimes it'll XL licks.

129
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.040
She was 12 or so at the time. On those nights,

130
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:05.830
the water was very calm, so silvery.

131
00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:09.310
It looked like mercury on the fish in it. Violet colored,

132
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:13.180
unable to resist the moon's attraction, rose to the surface,

133
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.010
all of them and so did the octopuses and the saffron Medusas.

134
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.210
It was always a flight of tiny creatures, little crabs,

135
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:27.211
squid and even some weeds light and fill me in coral plants that broke from the

136
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:32.671
sea and ended up on the moon hanging down from the lime white ceiling or else

137
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:36.670
they stayed in midair, a phosphorescent swarm.

138
00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:39.940
We had to drive off waving banana leaves at them.

139
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.670
This is how we did the job in the boat. We had a ladder.

140
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.020
One of us held it,

141
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:51.160
another climb to the top and a third at the oars road until we were right under

142
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:53.890
the moon. That's why there had to be so many of us.

143
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.440
I only mentioned the main ones,

144
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.460
the man at the top of the ladder as the boat approach,

145
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.650
the moon would become scared and starts shouting, stop, stop.

146
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.180
I'm going to Bang my head.

147
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.520
That was the impression you had seeing her on top of you or mentioned or rough

148
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:13.380
with sharps spikes and jagged saw tooth edges. It may be different now,

149
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.110
but then the moon or rather the, the,

150
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.960
the bottom or the underbelly of the moon,

151
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:21.750
the part that pass closest to the earth and almost scraped.

152
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.900
It was covered with a crust of sharp scales.

153
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.640
It had come to resemble the belly of a fish and the smell too, as I recall,

154
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:31.710
if not downright fishy,

155
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.830
was faintly similar like a smoked salmon.

156
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.440
In reality, from the top of the ladder, standing erect on the last rung,

157
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:43.320
you could just touch the moon if you're held your arms up.

158
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.570
We had taken the measurements carefully.

159
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:48.480
We didn't yet suspect that she was moving away from us.

160
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.770
The only thing you had to be very careful about was where you put your hands.

161
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.830
I always chose a scale and that seemed fast.

162
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.890
We climbed up in groups of five or six at a time.

163
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.590
Then I would cling first with one hand,

164
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.300
then with both and immediately I would feel ladder and boat drifting away from

165
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:10.230
below me and the motion of the moon would tear me from the earth attraction.

166
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.150
Yes, the moon was so strong that she pulled you up.

167
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.230
You realize this, the moment you passed from one to the other,

168
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.730
you had to swing up abruptly with a kind of somersault, grabbing the scales,

169
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:27.570
throwing your legs over your head until your feet were on the moon's surface

170
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.191
scene from the earth.

171
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:31.260
You looked as if you were hanging there with your head down,

172
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:35.160
but for you it was the normal position and then the only odd thing was that when

173
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:36.210
you raise your eyes,

174
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:40.710
you saw the sea above you listening with the boat and the others upside down,

175
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:45.480
hanging like a bunch of grapes from the vine. My cousin,

176
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:49.290
the death one showed a special talent for making those leaps,

177
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.710
his clumsy hands. As soon as they touched the lunar surface,

178
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:54.510
he was always the first to jump from the ladder.

179
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.150
Suddenly became deft and sensitive.

180
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.950
They found immediately the spot where he could hoist himself up. In fact,

181
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.760
just the pressure of his palm seemed enough to make him stick to the satellites

182
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:09.750
crust. Once I even thought I saw the moon come toward him.

183
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:11.100
As he held out his hands,

184
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.830
he was just as dextrous and coming back down to earth and operations still more

185
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:21.000
difficult for us. It consisted in jumping as high as we could.

186
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:25.260
Our arms upraised scene from the moon. That is because seen from the earth.

187
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:27.840
It looked more like a dive or like swimming downwards,

188
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:31.800
arms at our sides like jumping up from the earth. In other words,

189
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:35.490
only now we were without the ladder because there was nothing to prop it against

190
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.100
on the moon, but instead of jumping with his arms out,

191
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:40.050
my cousin bent toward the Moon's surface,

192
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:45.051
his head down as if for a summer sold then made a leap pushing with his hands

193
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.351
from the boat.

194
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:50.820
We watched him erect in the air as if he were supporting the moon's enormous

195
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:54.460
bowl and we're tossing it, striking it with his palms.

196
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.500
Then when his legs came within reach,

197
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.960
we managed to grab his ankles and pull them down on board.

198
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.720
Now you will ask me what in the world we went up on the moon for.

199
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.580
I'll explain it to you. We went to collect milk

200
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.340
with a big spoon and a bucket. Moon milk was very thick,

201
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.110
like a kind of cream cheese.

202
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.150
It formed in the crevices between one scale in the next through the fermentation

203
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.840
of various bodies and substances of terrestrial origin,

204
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:31.810
which had flown up from the prairies and forests and lakes.

205
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:33.190
As the moon sailed over them.

206
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.180
It was composed chiefly a vegetable juices,

207
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.160
tadpoles by human lentils, honey starts crystals, sturgeon,

208
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:46.660
eggs, molds, Pollins, gelatinous matter worms, resins, pepper,

209
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:48.910
mineral salts, combustion residue.

210
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.620
You had only to dip the spoon under the scales that covered the moon scabby

211
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:56.860
terrain and you brought it out, filled with that precious muck,

212
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.680
not in the pure state. Obviously there was a lot of refuse in the,

213
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.830
in the fermentation which took place as the moon passed over the expanses of hot

214
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.950
air above the deserts, not all the bodies melted.

215
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.570
Some remains stuck in it. Fingernails and cartilage bolts,

216
00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:18.850
seahorses, nuts and peduncles, shards of Crockery fish hooks at times,

217
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:19.720
even a comb.

218
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.900
So this paste after it was collected had to be refined, filtered,

219
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.640
but that wasn't the difficulty.

220
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:31.810
The hard part was transporting it down to the earth. This is how we did it.

221
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:37.390
We hurled each spoonful into the air with both hands using the spoon as a

222
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:42.130
catapult. The cheese flew and if we had thrown it hard enough,

223
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.090
it stuck to the ceiling, I mean the surface of the sea.

224
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.630
Once there it floated and it was easy enough to pull it into the boat.

225
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.740
And this operation to my deaf cousin displayed a special gift.

226
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.540
He had a strength and a good aim with a single sharp throw.

227
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.880
He could send the cheese straight into a bucket.

228
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:04.480
We held up to him from the boat. As for me.

229
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:09.481
I occasionally misfired the contents of the spoon would often fail to overcome

230
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:12.190
the Moon's attraction and would fall back into my eyes.

231
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.450
I still haven't told you everything about the things.

232
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:21.370
My cousin was good at that job of extracting lunar milk from the moons scales

233
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:24.520
was child's play to him instead of the spoon.

234
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:28.390
At times he had only to thrust his bare hand under the scales or even one

235
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:33.100
finger. He didn't proceed in any orderly way, but went to isolated places.

236
00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:36.820
Jumping from one to the other as if you were playing tricks on the moon,

237
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.770
surprising her or perhaps tickling her and reverie, put his hand,

238
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:44.770
the milk spurted out as if from a nanny, goats tits.

239
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.670
So the rest of us had only to follow him and collect with our spoons.

240
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:52.040
The substance that he was pressing out first here, then there,

241
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:54.590
but always as if by chance. Since the death ones,

242
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:59.120
movements seem to have no clear practical sense. There were places,

243
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:02.210
for example, that he touched merely for the fun of touching them.

244
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.570
Gaps between two scales,

245
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.730
naked and tender folds of lunar flesh. At times.

246
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.731
My cousin pressed Scott only his fingers about in a carefully gaged leap his big

247
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:16.814
toe,

248
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.840
he climbed onto the moon barefoot and this seemed to be the height of amusement

249
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.710
forum.

250
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.340
If we could judge by the chirping sounds that came from his throat as he went on

251
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.174
leaping.

252
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.820
The soil of the moon was not uniformly scaly,

253
00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:35.020
but revealed irregular bare patches of Pale, slippery clay.

254
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:40.690
These soft areas inspired the deaf one to turn somersaults or to fly almost like

255
00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:44.560
a bird, as if he wanted to impress his whole body into the moon's pulp.

256
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.640
As he ventured farther on his way, we lost sight of him.

257
00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:50.770
At one point on the moon.

258
00:15:50.771 --> 00:15:54.940
There were vast areas we had never had any reason or curiosity to explore,

259
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.640
and that was where my cousin vanished.

260
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.010
I suspected all those somersaults and nudges he indulged in before our eyes.

261
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.900
We're only a preparation,

262
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.700
a prelude to something secret meant to take place in the hidden zone.

263
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.590
We fell into a special mood on those nights, off the zinc cliffs gay,

264
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:20.210
but with a touch of suspense, as if inside our skulls instead of the brain,

265
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.990
we felt a fish floating attracted by the moon,

266
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.270
and so we navigated playing and singing. The captain's wife played the harp.

267
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:34.271
She had very long arms silvery his eels on those nights and armpits as dark and

268
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:39.590
mysterious as sea urchins. And the sound of the harp was sweet and piercing,

269
00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.540
so sweet and piercing.

270
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:46.220
It was almost unbearable and we were forced to let out long cries,

271
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.390
not so much to accompany the music as to protect our hearing from it.

272
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.840
Transparent Medusas rose to the sea's surface throb there a moment,

273
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.700
then flew off, swaying toward the moon. Little Exelixis sucks,

274
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.600
amuse herself by catching them in midair, though it wasn't easy.

275
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.570
Once as she stretched her little arms out to catch run,

276
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.120
she jumped up sightly and was also set free. Then finished.

277
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:13.954
She was,

278
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.540
she was an ounce or two short of the weight necessary for the earth gravity to

279
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.360
overcome the moon's attraction and bring her back.

280
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.430
So she flew up among the Medusa's, suspended over the sea. She took fright,

281
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:27.800
cried then laughed, and started playing,

282
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:30.140
catching shellfish and minnows as they flew,

283
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.450
sticking some into her mouth and chewing them.

284
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.360
We rode hard to keep up with the child.

285
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.640
The moon ran off in her lips dragging that swarm of marine phone or through the

286
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:41.474
sky,

287
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.600
and a train of long entwined seaweeds and excellent sticks hanging there in the

288
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:51.210
midst. Her two wispy braids seem to be flying on their own,

289
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.040
outstretched toward the moon.

290
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.600
But all the while she kept wriggling and kicking at the air as if she wanted to

291
00:17:57.601 --> 00:17:59.970
fight that influence and her socks.

292
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.890
She had lost her shoes and the flight slipped off her feet and suede attracted

293
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:08.490
by the earth force on the ladder. We tried to grab them.

294
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.750
The idea of eating little animals in the air had been a good one.

295
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.700
The more weight Exelixis gained, the more she sank toward the earth.

296
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.780
In fact, since among those hovering bodies,

297
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:28.020
hers was the largest mollusks and seaweeds and plankton began to gravitate about

298
00:18:28.331 --> 00:18:32.740
her. And soon the child was covered with salicious little shells.

299
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.520
Chitnis carapaces and fibers of sea plants.

300
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.340
And the farther she vanished into that tangle,

301
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.630
the more she was freed of the Moon's influence until she grazed the surface of

302
00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:45.550
the water and sank into the sea.

303
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.000
We rode quickly to pull her out and save her.

304
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.350
Her body had remained magnetised and we had to work hard to scrape off all the

305
00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:57.520
things in crusted on her tender corals where roundabout her head.

306
00:18:57.521 --> 00:18:59.470
And every time we ran the comb through her hair,

307
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.140
there was a shower of crayfish and sardines.

308
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.970
Her eyes were sealed shut by limpets cleaning to the lids with their suckers.

309
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.140
Squid's tentacles were coiled around her arms and her neck and her little dress

310
00:19:11.141 --> 00:19:14.470
now seemed woven only of weeds and sponges.

311
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.300
We got the worst of it offer,

312
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.250
but for weeks afterwards she went on pulling out fins and shells and their skin

313
00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:25.130
dotted with little diatoms remained effected forever.

314
00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:29.720
Looking to someone who didn't observe her carefully as if it were faintly dusted

315
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:30.830
with freckles.

316
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.310
This should give you an idea of how the influences of earth and moon practically

317
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.920
equal fought over the space between them.

318
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.380
I'll tell you something else.

319
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.900
A body that descended to the earth from a satellite was still charged for awhile

320
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.420
with lunar force and rejected the attraction of our world,

321
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.470
even eye big and heavy as I was. Every time I had been up there,

322
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.030
I took a while to get used to the earth's ups and its downs and the others would

323
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:02.920
have to grab my arms and hold me clinging and a bunch in the swing boat while I

324
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:06.310
still had my head hanging in my legs, stretching up towards the sky,

325
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.370
hold onto us, hold onto us.

326
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.750
They shouted at me and in all that groping sometimes I ended up by seizing one

327
00:20:13.751 --> 00:20:15.760
of Mrs v Hidden visits breasts,

328
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.770
which were round and firm and the contact was good and secure

329
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.630
and had an attraction as strong as the moons or even stronger,

330
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.310
especially if I managed as I plunged down to put my other arm around her hips

331
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.510
and with this I passed back into our world and fell with a thud into the bottom

332
00:20:34.511 --> 00:20:38.860
of the boat where Captain Vaudeville had brought me around throwing a bucket of

333
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:39.880
water in my face.

334
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.470
This is how the story of my love for the captain's wife began and my suffering

335
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.670
because it didn't take me long to realize whom the lady kept looking at

336
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:55.420
insistently. When my cousin's hands clasped the satellite,

337
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.100
I watched Mrs Vid, Vid,

338
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.260
and in her eyes I could read the thoughts that the deaf man's familiarity with

339
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:07.261
the moon were arousing in her and when he disappeared and his mysterious lunar

340
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:11.860
explorations, I saw her become restless as if on pins and needles,

341
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:17.080
and it was all clear to me how Mrs [inaudible] had become jealous of the moon

342
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.690
and I was jealous of my cousin. Her eyes were made of diamonds.

343
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.250
Mrs [inaudible],

344
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.940
they flared when she looked at the moon almost challengingly as if she were

345
00:21:28.941 --> 00:21:31.060
saying you Shan't have him.

346
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.720
And I felt like an outsider.

347
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.510
The one who leased under served all of this was my deaf cousin.

348
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.740
When we helped him down pulling him, as I explained to you by his legs,

349
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.770
Mrs [inaudible] had lost all her self control,

350
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.830
doing everything she could to take his weight against her own body,

351
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.780
folding her long silvery arms around him. I felt a pang in my heart.

352
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.830
The Times I clung to her, her body was soft and kind,

353
00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:04.240
but not thrust forward the way it was with my cousin while he was in different

354
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:06.550
still lost and whose lunar bliss.

355
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.750
I looked at the captain wondering if he also noticed his wife's behavior,

356
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.890
but there was never a trace of any expression on that face of his eaten by Bryan

357
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.780
marked with tare wrinkles.

358
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.260
Since the death one was always the last to break away from the moon,

359
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.110
his return was the signal for the boats to move off.

360
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.840
Ben With an unusually polite gesture.

361
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.470
They had picked up the harp from the bottom of the boat and handed it to his

362
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:33.010
wife. She was obliged to take it and play a few notes.

363
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.640
Nothing could separate her more from the death one than the sound of the harp I

364
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:40.630
took to singing in a low voice.

365
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.040
That sad song that goes every shiny fish is floating,

366
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.950
floating, and every dark fishes at the bottom,

367
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.190
at the bottom of the sea and all the others,

368
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:53.830
except my cousin echoed my words

369
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.120
every month. Once the satellite had moved on,

370
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.020
the deaf one returned to his solitary detachments from the things of the world.

371
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.770
Only the approach of the full moon aroused him again.

372
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.000
That time I had arranged things so it wasn't my turn to go up.

373
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.130
I could stay in the boat with the captain's wife,

374
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.930
but then as soon as my cousin had climbed the ladder, Mrs [inaudible] said,

375
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:22.350
this time I want to go up there to this had never happened before.

376
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.570
The captain's wife had never gone up on the moon,

377
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.340
but for hid vid made no objection. In fact,

378
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:31.960
he almost pushed her up the ladder,

379
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:36.961
bodily exclaiming go ahead then and we all started helping her and I held her

380
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:39.004
from behind

381
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.990
and filter round and soft on my arms and had to hold her up.

382
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:50.780
I began to press my face in the palms of my hands against her and when I felt

383
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:55.310
her rising into the moon's sphere, I was heartsick at that last contact.

384
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.680
So I started to rush after her saying,

385
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.360
I'm going to go up for a while too to help out.

386
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:09.170
As I was held back as if in a vise you stay here, you have work to do later.

387
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:13.160
The captain commanded without raising his voice. At that moment,

388
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:18.190
each one's intentions were already clear and yet I couldn't figure things out.

389
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.580
Even now, I'm not sure I've interpreted it all correctly.

390
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.990
Certainly the captain's wife had for a long time been cherishing the desire to

391
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:30.830
go off privately with my cousin up there or at least to prevent him from going

392
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:32.210
off alone with the moon,

393
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.990
but probably she had a still more ambitious plan,

394
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.890
one that would have to be carried out in agreement with the death one.

395
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.460
She wanted the two of them to hide up there together and stay on the moon for a

396
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.070
month, but perhaps my cousin deaf as he was,

397
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:53.420
hadn't understood anything of what she had tried to explain to him or perhaps he

398
00:24:53.421 --> 00:24:58.340
hadn't even realized that he was the object of the lady's desires and the

399
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:02.390
captain. He wanted nothing better than to be rid of his wife.

400
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.480
In fact, as soon as she was confined up there,

401
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:10.481
we saw him give free reign to his inclinations and plunge into vice and then we

402
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:13.940
understood why he had done nothing to hold her back.

403
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.280
But how do you know from the beginning that the moon's orbit was widening?

404
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.800
None of us could have suspected the death one perhaps,

405
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:28.310
but only he and the shadowy way he knew things.

406
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.350
He may have had a pre sentiment that would be forced that he would be forced to

407
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:35.060
bid the moon farewell that night.

408
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.920
This is why he hidden his secret places and reappeared only when it was time to

409
00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:41.360
come back down on board.

410
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.750
There's no use for the captain's wife to try to follow him.

411
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.910
We saw her across the scale, each zone, various times, length and breadth.

412
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.200
Then suddenly she stopped looking at us in the boat as if about to ask us

413
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:59.000
whether we had seen him. Surely there was something strange about that night.

414
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.130
The sea's surface instead of being taught as it was during the full moon or even

415
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:09.131
arched of it toward the sky now seemed limp sagging as if the lunar magnet no

416
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:14.090
longer exercised its full power and the light too,

417
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.760
wasn't the same as the light of other full moons.

418
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.460
The Nice shadows seemed somehow to thickened our friends up there must have

419
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:24.680
realized what was happening. In fact,

420
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:28.820
they looked up at us with frightened eyes and from their mouths and ours at the

421
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:32.480
same moment came a cry. The moon's going away.

422
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.480
The cry hadn't died out. When my cousin appeared on the moon running,

423
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.560
he didn't seem frightened or even amazed. He placed his hands on the terrain,

424
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.230
flinging himself into his usual summer sold,

425
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.960
but this time after he hurt himself into the air,

426
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.620
he remained suspended as little excellent Dick's head.

427
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.890
He hovered a moment between moon and earth upside down.

428
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.120
Then laboriously moving his arms like someone swimming against a current.

429
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.450
He headed with unusual slowness toward our planet

430
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.730
from the moon. The other sailors hastened to follow his example.

431
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.330
Nobody gave a thought to getting the moon milk that had been collected into the

432
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:15.120
boats, nor did the captain scold them for this.

433
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.980
They had already waited too long. The distance was difficult to cross by. Now,

434
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.670
when they tried to imitate my cousin's leap or his swimming,

435
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.420
they remained there groping, suspended in midair, cling together.

436
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:30.780
Idiots clean together. The captain yelled at this command.

437
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:32.340
The sailors tried to form a group,

438
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.420
a mass to push all together until they reached the zone of the earth attraction.

439
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.370
All of a sudden,

440
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:42.600
a cascade of bodies plunged into the sea with allowed splash.

441
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:48.150
The boats were now rowing to pick them up. Wait, the captain's wife is missing.

442
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:51.420
I shouted. The captain's wife had also tried to jump,

443
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.540
but she was still floating only a few yards from the moon.

444
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.990
Slowly moving her long silvery arms in the air.

445
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.160
I climbed up the ladder and in a vain attempt to give her something to grasp.

446
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.280
I held the harp out toward her. I can't reach her.

447
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:10.281
We have to go after her and I started to jump up brandishing the harp above me.

448
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:14.190
The enormous lunar disc no longer seen the same as before.

449
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.080
It had become much smaller.

450
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:21.650
It kept contracting as if my gays were driving it away and the emptied sky gaped

451
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:26.520
like an abyss where at the bottom the stars had begun multiplying and the night

452
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:31.380
poured a river of emptiness over me drowned me in dizziness and alarm.

453
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.420
I'm afraid. I thought I'm too afraid to jump. I'm a coward.

454
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.760
And at that moment I jumped.

455
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.340
I swam furiously through the sky and held the harp out to her and instead of

456
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:45.180
coming toward me,

457
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:49.800
she rolled over and over showing me first her impassive face and then her

458
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:53.160
backside hold tight to me.

459
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:57.630
I shouted and I was already overtaking her, intertwining my limbs with hers.

460
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.770
If we cling together,

461
00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:03.390
we can go down and there was concentrating all my strength on uniting myself

462
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:08.391
more closely with her and I concentrated my sensations as I enjoyed the fullness

463
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:11.790
of that embrace. I was so absorbed.

464
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:15.960
I didn't realize at first that I was indeed tearing her from her weight,

465
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:19.380
this condition, but was making her fall back on the moon.

466
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.160
Didn't I realize it or had that been my intention from the very beginning before

467
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:29.670
I could think properly, a cry was already bursting from my throat.

468
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.640
I'll be the one to stay with you for a month or rather on you.

469
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.750
I shouted in my excitement on you for a month

470
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.340
and at that moment our embrace was broken by our fall to the moon's surface

471
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.420
where we rolled away from each other among those cold scales.

472
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.250
I raised my eyes as I did every time I touched the moon's crust.

473
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.010
Sure that I would see above me, the native sea,

474
00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.090
like an endless ceiling and I saw it. Yes, I saw it this time too,

475
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.830
but much higher,

476
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.220
much more narrow bound by its borders of coasts and cliffs and prominent Tories

477
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.780
and how small the boats seemed now and familiar my friends faces and how weak

478
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:18.420
their cries. A sound reached me from nearby Mrs Vid.

479
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.590
Vid had discovered her harp and was caressing it. Sketching out a chord is sad,

480
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.720
is weeping along month again.

481
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.150
The moon turns slowly around the earth on the suspended globe.

482
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.550
We no longer saw our familiar shore, but the passage of oceans is deep.

483
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.760
As a business in deserts of glowing Lapilon lie and continents of ice and

484
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:47.260
forests riding with reptiles and the rocky walls of mountain chains,

485
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:52.630
Gash by swift rivers and swampy cities and stone graveyards and empires of clay

486
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.220
in mud. The distance spread a uniform color over everything.

487
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:03.150
The alien perspectives made every image alien herds of elephants and swarms of

488
00:31:03.281 --> 00:31:08.281
locusts ran over the planes so evenly vast and dense and thickly grown that

489
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:10.330
there was no difference among them.

490
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.190
I should have been happy because I had dreamed I was alone with her.

491
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.690
That intimacy with the moon I had so often envied my cousin and with Mrs v Hid

492
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.350
vid was now my exclusive prerogative.

493
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.090
A month of days and lunar nights stretched uninterrupted before us.

494
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.100
The crust of the satellite nourished us with its milk whose tart flavor was

495
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:37.600
familiar to us. We raised our eyes up to the world where we had been born.

496
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.050
Finally traversed in all its various expanse,

497
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:46.090
explored landscapes no earth being had ever seen or else we contemplated the

498
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.423
stars beyond the moon.

499
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.750
Biggest pieces of fruit made of light ripened on the curved branches of the sky

500
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:58.120
and everything exceeded my most luminous hopes and yet,

501
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.680
and yet it was instead exile.

502
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.340
I thought only of the earth.

503
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.410
It was the earth that caused each of us to be that someone he was rather than

504
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:14.710
someone else up there rested from the earth.

505
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.140
It was as if I were no longer that I know she, that she for me,

506
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.450
I was eager to return to the earth and I trembled at the fear of having lost it.

507
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.220
The fulfillment of my dream of love had lasted only that instant when we had

508
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:35.140
been United, spinning between Earth and moon torn from its earthly soil.

509
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.530
My love now knew only the heart-rending nostalgia for what it aware of

510
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:45.170
surrounding a before and after.

511
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.740
This is what I was feeling, but she, as I asked myself,

512
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.780
I was torn by my fears because if she also thought only of the earth,

513
00:32:56.781 --> 00:33:01.370
this could be a good sign, a sign that she had finally come to understand me.

514
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.670
But it could also mean that everything had been useless,

515
00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:08.780
that her longings were directed still. And only toward my deaf cousin.

516
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.810
Instead, she felt nothing.

517
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.110
She never raised her eyes to the old planet.

518
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.400
She went off pail among those wastelands, mumbling,

519
00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.810
dirge and stroking her heart as if completely identified with her temporary.

520
00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:25.660
As I thought lunar state

521
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.250
did this mean I had one out over my rival? No,

522
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.060
I had lost a hopeless defeat because she had finally realized that my cousin

523
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:42.581
loved only the moon and the only thing she wanted now was to become the moon,

524
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.200
to be assimilated into the object of that extra human love.

525
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.980
When the moon had completed its circling of the planet,

526
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.590
there we were again over the zinc cliffs.

527
00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.020
I recognize them with this may not even in my darkest provisions that I thought

528
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:04.580
the distance would have made them so tiny in that mud puddle of the sea.

529
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.080
My friends had set forth again without the now useless ladders,

530
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.820
but from the boats, Rosa kind of forest of long poles.

531
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:18.080
Everybody was brandishing one with a harpoon or a grappling hook at the end,

532
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.550
perhaps in the hope of scraping off the last bit of moon milk or of lending,

533
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:24.800
some kind of help to us retches up there,

534
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.630
but it was soon clear that no pole was long enough to reach the moon and they

535
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:31.400
dropped back ridiculously short,

536
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.210
humbled floating on the sea and in that confusion,

537
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.060
some of the boats were thrown off balance and overturned,

538
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.870
but just then from another vessel, a longer pole,

539
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.040
which until then had been dragged along on the water's surface began to rise.

540
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.500
It must've been made of bamboo of many,

541
00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:52.460
many bamboo poles stuck one into the other. And to raise it,

542
00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:56.450
they had to go slowly because thin as it was, if they let it sway too much,

543
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:57.290
it might break.

544
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.210
Therefore they had to use it with great strength and skill so that the wholly

545
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:04.460
vertical weight wouldn't rock the boat.

546
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.150
Suddenly it was clear that the tip of that pole would touch

547
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.710
the moon and we saw it graze. Then press against the scaly terrain,

548
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:13.730
rest there a minute,

549
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.450
give a kind of little push or rather a strong push that made it bounce off

550
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:18.050
again.

551
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:22.430
Then come back and strike that same spot as if on the rebound then move away

552
00:35:22.431 --> 00:35:23.264
once more.

553
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:29.140
And I recognized we both the captain's wife and I recognize my cousin.

554
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.820
It couldn't have been anyone else. It was playing his last game with the moon,

555
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.970
one of his tricks with the moon on the tip of his pole as if he were juggling

556
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:43.971
with her and we realized that his virtuosity had no purpose aimed,

557
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.200
no practical result. Indeed you would've said he was driving the moon away,

558
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:50.640
that he was helping her departure,

559
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.640
that he wanted to show her to a more distant orbit.

560
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.430
And this too was just like him.

561
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.900
He was unable to conceive desires that went against the moon's nature,

562
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.940
the moon's course and destiny.

563
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.500
And if the moon now tended to go away from him and he would take delight in this

564
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:11.760
separation just as till now he had delighted in the Moon's newness.

565
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.080
What could Mrs v hit for hit do in the face of this?

566
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.040
There was only at this moment that she proved her passion for the deaf man

567
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.580
hadn't been a frivolous whim, but an irrevocable vow.

568
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.520
If what my cousin now loved was the distant moon and she too would remain

569
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:31.320
distant on the moon.

570
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.810
I sensed this seeing that she didn't take a step toward the bamboo pole,

571
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.170
but simply turned her heart toward the earth, high in the sky,

572
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:44.580
and pluck the strings. I say I saw her, but to tell the truth,

573
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:48.210
I only caught a glimpse of her out of the corner of my eye because the minute

574
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:49.800
the pole had touched the lunar crust,

575
00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:53.340
I had sprung and grasp it and now fast as a snake,

576
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.350
I was climbing up the bamboo nuts,

577
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.500
pushing myself along with jerks of my arms and knees,

578
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.630
light in the rarefied space,

579
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.290
driven by our natural power that ordered me to return to the earth.

580
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.970
Oblivious of the motive that had brought me here or perhaps more aware of it

581
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:13.971
than ever and if it's unfortunate outcome and already my climb up the swing pole

582
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.780
had reached the point where I no longer had to make any effort but could just

583
00:37:18.781 --> 00:37:23.781
allow myself to slide headfirst attracted by the earth until in my haste,

584
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:28.020
the pole broke into a thousand pieces and I fell into the sea.

585
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.160
Among the boats

586
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:34.260
I return was sweeped by home refound,

587
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:40.340
but my thoughts were filled only with grief of having lost her and my eyes gazed

588
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:42.780
at the moon forever beyond my reach.

589
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.690
As I sought her and I saw her,

590
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.450
she was there where I had left her lying on a beach directly over our heads and

591
00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:54.840
she said nothing. She was the color of the moon.

592
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.790
She held the Harper at her side and moved one hand now and then in slow

593
00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:03.720
Arpeggios I could distinguish the shape of her bosom,

594
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.010
her arms, her thighs, just as I remember them now,

595
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:12.870
just as now when the moon has become that flat remote circle,

596
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.560
I still look for her as soon as the first sliver appears in the sky and the more

597
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.490
it wax is, the more clearly I imagine I can see her or something of her,

598
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:28.710
but only her in a hundred a thousand different vistas.

599
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:34.130
She who makes the moon the moon and whenever she is full sets the dogs to all

600
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.120
night long

601
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.170
<v 5>and me with them.</v>

602
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.080
