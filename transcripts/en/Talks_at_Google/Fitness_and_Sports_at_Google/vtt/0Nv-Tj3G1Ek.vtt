JON JAKLITSCH:
I'm Jon Jaklitsch,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.160
I'm gonna be your host.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.340
In today's Talks
at Google session,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.200
we're very excited to
welcome pro footballer

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.740
and current head coach of
New York City FC-- everyone

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.300
please give a warm welcome
to Mr. Patrick Vieira.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.680
 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.090
Pleasure to have you.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.090
 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.537
Patrick, welcome to Google.

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:30.620
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.453
Thank you very much.

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:33.130
Good afternoon.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.695
I was quite really
excited to come

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.950
to Google-- a little bit
less now, because I seen too

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.775
many Red Bulls shirts.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:41.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.347
 

00:00:42.347 --> 00:00:44.680
But the good thing is that
they are sitting at the back.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.180
So it's OK.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.642
 

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:48.100
JON JAKLITSCH: So
Patrick, I think

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.490
there's a lot of interest
here about your playing career

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.480
and also about your
transition to being a manager.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.010
But I thought we'd start off
to talk about your early years.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.700
Can you tell us, how did
you first get into football?

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.870
PATRICK VIEIRA: Football
always been part of my life

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350
since I was seven,
eight years old.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.600
I grew up in Senegal.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.520
And from Senegal,
we moved to Paris

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.500
when I was eight,
nine years old.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.910
And honestly, football
was and still a easy way

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.880
to get out of poverty.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:30.190
And growing up with cousins,
uncles, brothers, life

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.950
wasn't that simple.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.520
But we always managed
to get what we needed.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.350
And growing up, find out that I
had a small talent in football.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.740
And I was more concentrate
on the sports side

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.110
than on the academic side of it.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.410
And I wanted to use a talent
to really do something

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.330
really interesting, and
something that I love,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.970
and something that will help my
family to have a better life.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.590
And I was quite, quite lucky.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.900
Because every year that I was
involved in the football club,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.010
I always had somebody to support
me, somebody to guide me,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.000
to make me realize how important
it is, to make a sacrifice.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.740
And those peoples really
contribute massively

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.952
on who I am today.

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:30.410
JON JAKLITSCH: Can you tell
us more about your role models

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.340
growing up?

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.870
PATRICK VIEIRA: But when I
grew up in France in '84,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.960
you had a really
successful national team.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.685
We used to call them
the [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:42.560
I think the French people
who are in the room

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.860
will know who I
am talking about.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.130
We had the players like
Platini, Tigana, Alain Giresse,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.000
and Luis Fernandez.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.130
There were the heart of
the French National Team

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.140
at that period.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.900
And Luis Fernandez, who
was an example for me,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.360
because he was playing
in the same position.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.430
And he was an idol.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.972
He was somebody that
I was looking up.

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:07.680
And I was really lucky,
because I had him

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.490
as a manager when
I was in Cannes.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.360
And he was the coach that
made me play my first game

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.963
in the professional level.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:20.120
JON JAKLITSCH:
That's great, Patrick.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.990
Switching now into your
professional career,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.480
you've had a lot of great
achievements in your career.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.017
What would you
rank, looking back,

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.350
as the one you're most proud of?

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.125
 

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:35.750
PATRICK VIEIRA: I've
been really lucky,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.490
because I achieve more than
what I was dreaming of.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.350
And I've been really
successful, because I

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.710
was at the right place
at the right time.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.860
I make the right decision
at the right time,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.900
because when I was 17, the
club that I was playing for

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.732
went into a bankrupt.

00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:00.440
And when the club's
going into a bankrupt

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.020
we became a free agent, so
I had different options.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.130
And I was really lucky to
make the right choices.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.170
Because that choices
helped me to grow up,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.540
and to improve myself,
and to be a better player.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.350
But you know, what is
important is that football

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.040
was and still a big passion.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.830
And I fell in love
with the game.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.310
And even today, it is a passion.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.740
And it is a love for the game.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.910
But to answer your
question that I forget--

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.830
JON JAKLITSCH:
So accomplishment

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.900
that you're most proud
of in your career?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.250
PATRICK VIEIRA:
But you know what?

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.220
Winning the World Cup in '98
with the French National Team

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.050
is a big, big achievement.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.840
Because we won the
World Cup in France.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.410
And at that time,
France was going

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.256
through a really
difficult period

00:04:57.256 --> 00:05:02.540
of crisis-- identity, racism.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.582
So to win the World
Cup, I think we

00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:05.790
send a really strong message.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.880
Because that period,
the French National Team

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.290
had a massive reflect
on the society.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.830
The diversity of the
French national team

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.890
was the French society.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.030
So it was really strong message
that we sent to the world.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.340
And that was a really
proud moment for me

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.200
to be part of that team.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.660
And of course, signing my
first professional contract

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.235
was a massive
success, because that

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:40.360
is what I was dreaming about
since I was eight years old.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.956
And of course, going
through with Arsenal

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:47.150
through a season unbeaten
was a good achievement.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.840
And being coach as well, because
during my playing career,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.316
being a coach wasn't
part of my plan.

00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:56.690
If you was asking
me, do you want

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.430
to be a coach when you retired,
I would said, no chance.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.190
And just life is
full of surprising.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.770
JON JAKLITSCH: Tell me
more about the World Cup

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.950
when you won in France in '98.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.500
What do you remember most
about what happened afterwards?

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.002
How did it change your life?

00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:17.460
PATRICK VIEIRA: It
changed my life,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.200
because that put me there
with the rest of the players

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.600
in the international level.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600
Winning the World Cup
WITH the team that we had

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.870
was unbelievable.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.450
I don't think the
French National Team

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.530
will have the team that we had.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.460
Because that team
was unbelievable.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.700
We had the best player in
the world of Zinedine Zidane.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.520
We had one of the
best goalkeeper

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.770
at the time with Fabien Barthez.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.130
We had one of the best
defender in the world

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.970
with Marcel Desailly, the best
outside back with Lizarazu

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.660
and Lilliam Thuram.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.496
And just those player
was unbelievable.

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:02.870
And that time, we
had everything.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.450
We had talent.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.710
We had experience.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.750
We had desire to compete.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.090
Everything was there
to win the World Cup.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.162
And to do it in France was
a fantastic achievement.

00:07:15.162 --> 00:07:16.370
JON JAKLITSCH: That's great.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.250
That's great.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.080
And you talked a little bit
about your unbeaten season

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.210
at Arsenal.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.780
Looking back on that
season, is there

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.870
any particular moment
you remember most

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.601
from that season, maybe a time
where you thought, you know,

00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:32.850
oh, this is the end, it's
not gonna to happen anymore,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.300
or this was my favorite
moment from that season?

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.930
PATRICK VIEIRA: It's really
difficult to pick up a moment.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.480
But what I would
during the season

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.790
is that we knew
that was our moment.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.160
Because every time we went
through a difficult period,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.710
it was somebody was doing
something different.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.770
It was Dennis Bergkamp
was doing something

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.390
that was unbelievable.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.380
It was Thierry Henry was going
to score the goal by himself.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.890
It was Robert Pires
was making a good play.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.810
It was the goal keeper was
making an unbelievable save.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.220
We was going losing
two-nil at half time.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.010
And we will manage to get back,
because we had the spirit.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.270
We had the quality up
front to score the goal,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.470
so not to concede the goal.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.000
But I think that generation
was really complete,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.040
because in every line,
we had leadership.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.900
We had talent.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.350
And we had, for me, what
was really important,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.829
the same goal, the common goal.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:37.620
JON JAKLITSCH: Mm.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.000
PATRICK VIEIRA: And
that was fantastic.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.010
And of course, the
relationship between us

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.372
as well was really good.

00:08:45.372 --> 00:08:46.581
It's a really special moment.

00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:48.955
That's what I was saying early
on that I was quite really

00:08:48.955 --> 00:08:49.560
lucky.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.920
Because I really play for teams
where we had talents, yes,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.626
but where we really live
together really well.

00:08:59.626 --> 00:09:03.150
Because to achieve, or to
win something, or to do well,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.990
you need more than a talent.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.570
And at Arsenal, at
Juventus, or even

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.030
with the French National Team,
we had more than the talent.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.430
And this is the reason why
we have been successful.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.596
JON JAKLITSCH: I've heard
you talk a lot about what

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.180
makes a great team.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.470
I've heard you say that it's not
necessarily having, you know,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.810
a great player and
then not caring

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.020
about let's say the goalkeeper
or the defenders, right?

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.619
It's having balance
within a team.

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:30.160
Would you say that
was something that

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.380
was very common in the
best teams that you played?

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:32.810
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yes, yes.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.700
It was really common.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.230
Because what was
really important for us

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.660
is to understand what
is your strength,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.410
and what can you do
to help the team?

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.646
Like myself, if I was trying
to be Zinedine Zidane,

00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:48.146
we never going to
win the World Cup.

00:09:48.146 --> 00:09:49.415
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:55.520
If you build a team to
have 11 Zinedine Zidane,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.550
you're will not going
to win the World Cup.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.230
I think you will need to
mix the team regarding

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.900
the quality of the players and
what the teams really need.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.680
And it's important for
players to identify themself,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.510
to know themself, and to
know what is their role

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.180
and the responsibility
on the field.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.260
And when you have a talent
in the team and everybody

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.800
respecting each other,
then you have more time

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.174
to succeed and to be successful.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:25.340
And the French National
Team, that's was a strength.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.050
At Arsenal, that
was our strength.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.120
Thierry Henry knew
that his strength

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.740
was to score the goals.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.700
His strength was to run
behind the back four.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.540
Zidane was the mind of our team.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.200
He was the creative players.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.890
You have architect.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.360
And you have builders.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.955
So when the builders
try to be the architect,

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:49.370
we're having a problem.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.330
And I think in every kind
of business, it's the same.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.240
And at Arsenal at the time, if
I was try to be the architect,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.006
then it will be a problem.

00:10:58.006 --> 00:10:59.880
JON JAKLITSCH: We talked
about this a little

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.355
before we came on stage.

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:05.420
But you were actually very
excited to come to Google

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.660
to learn how we work
together and how

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.560
we build great teams,
which is something

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.537
I thought was very interesting.

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.620
Do you want to maybe talk
a little bit about that?

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.970
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah, I find
it quite really interesting,

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.591
because you are
international brand.

00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:18.340
And I think you have
people who are coming

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.155
from all around the world.

00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:21.530
And it's quite
really interesting

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.360
to see how you put in
this kind of differences

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.412
together to be
really successful.

00:11:27.412 --> 00:11:29.620
And when you look at in a
dressing room in our world,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.995
in football, it's
quite the same.

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:33.073
Because we have players
coming all around

00:11:33.073 --> 00:11:36.150
the world, different background.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.770
But the objective
still the same--

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:43.360
how can we put our difference
on the side but working together

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.820
to be successful?

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.520
And what I find quite
really interesting

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.240
is that when we came
inside the building,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.588
I find it quite really fresh.

00:11:50.588 --> 00:11:52.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.520
There's colors everywhere.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.770
And I think what make it
really successful brand

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.450
is the fact that when you
come in in the building,

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.970
you want to stay
in the building.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.220
You want to work
in the building.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.782
It's a good place to be.

00:12:05.782 --> 00:12:06.990
I know that the food is free.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.073
That's one of the reasons.

00:12:08.073 --> 00:12:09.564
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:10.500
 

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.370
JON JAKLITSCH: I don't
know if you've heard.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.120
But we're hiring if
you want to work here.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.580
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.090
But it's true.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.290
It is really nice
place to spend time.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.460
Because you spend more time here
than at home with your family.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.700
And that is what we need
to create in our world,

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.080
in football is we want
players to come and spend

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.280
time in our office-- in
the office, you can say.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.670
We want players
to come and spend

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.920
time in the training ground.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.610
So it's important for us to
make it nice, to make it really,

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.100
really nice to spend time.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.840
And I find it-- I do
understand one of the reason

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.390
that you guys been
really successful.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.400
And I think that is quite
really interesting for us

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.469
to take back to our world.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:52.760
JON JAKLITSCH: And we hope
you can get some ideas when

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.430
we do the tour.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.260
Have that later.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:54.760
Thanks.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.930
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yes.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.700
JON JAKLITSCH: Changing
subjects a little bit,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.230
still talking about
your playing career now,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.730
you've had the chance to captain
a few teams in your career.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.602
Tell me what it takes
to be a good captain.

00:13:09.602 --> 00:13:11.060
PATRICK VIEIRA: I
think it's always

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:17.010
the same question is are
you born as a leader,

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.830
or you become a leader?

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.593
What do you think?

00:13:20.593 --> 00:13:21.519
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.001
 

00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:23.834
PATRICK VIEIRA: Huh?

00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:25.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.650
PATRICK VIEIRA: You
become a leader?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.250
I don't agree.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.860
 

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.610
But that is what is
interesting is that we

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.540
have a different point of view.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:44.540
But with my experience is that
I believe that in football,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.830
to be successful, everybody
has to take leadership.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.997
We need 11 leader on the
field to be successful.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.572
 

00:13:53.572 --> 00:13:54.530
And it was quite funny.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.570
Because when I was spending
time in Manchester City,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.310
people will say that Mario
Balotelli is not a leader.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.810
 

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.760
But I disagree.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.440
I think he's a leader--
in a different way--

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.747
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:10.830
--but he's still a leader.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.810
Just to give you an
example, we were playing

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.330
the game against Tottenham.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.400
And we was losing two-nil.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.340
And we managed to
get back to the game.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.540
It was a two-two.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.410
And it was a last
minute penalty.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.150
To take that responsibility,
the last kick off the game,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.860
to take that responsibility,k
you have to be--

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.757
--you understand?

00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:35.090
Your mind has to be a bit crazy.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.440
But it's part of being a leader.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.210
 

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.650
And for me, him taking the
ball in front of Sergio Aguero,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.590
put it, and then
scored the goal is

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.280
for me is a sign of leadership.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.570
And then after,
you have this type

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.300
of leader, what, like
Tony Adams at Arsenal.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.040
He was really vocal,
really strong.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.020
They didn't stop talking.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.270
And he was a proper leader.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.530
And I was a different
type of leader.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.500
I was more leading by example.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.050
The way that I will
conduct myself on the field

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:16.500
wasn't really vocal,
but I was tackling.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.600
I was running.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.800
I was-- that is a different
type of leadership.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.920
So that's why I
believe that we all

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.860
have a little bit of
leadership in ourself.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.435
And it's important
in any things that we

00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:32.896
are doing to show that
we are quite strong.

00:15:32.896 --> 00:15:35.020
JON JAKLITSCH: Did you
feel throughout your career

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.380
that you ever had to adjust
your leadership style

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.194
to match the people
you were working with?

00:15:41.194 --> 00:15:42.150
PATRICK VIEIRA: Um--

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.983
JON JAKLITSCH: Or do
you feel the team kind

00:15:43.983 --> 00:15:46.080
of morphed more around the
captain and the leader?

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.621
PATRICK VIEIRA: I
think as a captain,

00:15:47.621 --> 00:15:50.630
I was always tried
to be a positive.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.260
 

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.940
And it was important for me
was that, yes, I was a captain,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.530
but it doesn't give
me the right to make

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.840
all the decision by myself.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.432
When I was at Arsenal, I was--
Dennis Bergkamp, Martin Keown,

00:16:09.432 --> 00:16:14.640
[INAUDIBLE], Seaman, or--
before making any decision,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.440
I was talking to them, because
it was a team decision.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.250
So they was really part of the
decision that I was making.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.176
Being a captain doesn't
give you the right

00:16:25.176 --> 00:16:27.320
to make the decision
by yourself.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.300
You have responsibility, but one
of the biggest responsibility

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.610
is to bring everybody together.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.250
So making a decision
with other players

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:41.730
I think give them a little
bit of captaincy as well.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.250
So it was important for
me to make them understand

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.459
that captain is
just the hand band

00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:48.000
that you're putting
around your hand.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.712
But the team is more important
than just a captain on himself.

00:16:54.712 --> 00:16:55.920
JON JAKLITSCH: Great, great.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.770
Now sticking with the concept of
teammates, I'm curious to know,

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.380
throughout your career, who do
you think the best player you

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.880
played with throughout
your career--

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.088
and I'm putting you on the
spot a little bit, I know.

00:17:08.088 --> 00:17:09.270
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.520
But just to be
diplomat, I will say it.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.740
What do you think
a good player is?

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.020
JON JAKLITSCH: Ooh, I'm
getting interviewed here.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.310
PATRICK VIEIRA: I'm just going
to test him a little bit.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.680
JON JAKLITSCH: I'm
going to change it back.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.324
I think it's someone who
listens to their captain.

00:17:20.324 --> 00:17:20.824
No--

00:17:20.824 --> 00:17:22.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.890
I think-- and relating
this back to Google

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.790
and what I think
we've seen internally,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.140
I think it's ability to
listen to your teammates,

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.760
understand maybe what
some of their strengths

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.820
are, what some of
their weaknesses are,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.940
and kind of play
into that, not trying

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.880
to be someone else
that you're not,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.820
and sticking with your
core strengths as a person.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.790
But I think treating the
team above the individual

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.950
is what I would say.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.932
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:17:50.932 --> 00:17:52.471
And completely,
I agree with you.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.220
And this is why when
people asking me that

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.670
question, two names always up.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.730
One is Zinedine Zidane and the
other one is Dennis Bergkamp.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.690
And the reasons being
every single players

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:09.000
who played around those
players has been fantastic.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.770
What I like about
both of them is

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:16.100
that they're making the
people around look good.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.614
And for me, this is a sign
of a top class player.

00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:22.360
There's a lot of good
players, but there's just

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.890
a little bit of top players.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.450
And for me, Zidane with
the French National Team--

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.264
you can tell them-- Henri,
Berg-- Anelka, [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:32.264 --> 00:18:33.070
Dugarry.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.100
All those players who
played around Zidane

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.770
expressed themselves
really well.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.095
And the same at Arnsenal--
Bergkamp played with Henri,

00:18:41.095 --> 00:18:43.670
played with Anelka,
Overmars, Pires.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.230
All those players look
really good because Bergkamp

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.030
makes them look really good.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.190
So for me, this is a
sign of special players.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.590
JON JAKLITSCH: Now how
about the best player

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.420
you think you played
against in your career?

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.810
PATRICK VIEIRA: Against?

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.659
I would say Roy
Keane from-- yes.

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:09.575
JON JAKLITSCH: I thought
that would come out.

00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:12.170
 

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.670
PATRICK VIEIRA: I would say Roy
Keane because-- because it's

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.300
funny because we are sharing
the same type of vision

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.440
of the game, of leadership.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.840
He has a really strong
mind, he's a fighter,

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.050
he's a team player, and
he likes to compete,

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:34.880
and he, as well, has a
psychology mind that he

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.500
likes to use in the game.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.330
That, I quite like as well.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.160
So we are quite similar.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.770
And to be honest, every time
we play against each other,

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.730
it was tough, it was
really difficult,

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.800
and that's why I have a
massive respect for him

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.968
because he's been
a fantastic player.

00:19:54.968 --> 00:19:56.360
JON JAKLITSCH: Great.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.490
Now let's switch over to
your managerial career now.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.830
You mentioned that if we asked
you, when you were younger,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.240
you would have said, no way
would I ever be a manager.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.200
So why now?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.000
And, I guess, what changed
since you were younger?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.164
PATRICK VIEIRA: I think
because I never put myself

00:20:15.164 --> 00:20:16.080
on the other the side.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.430
When I stopped playing
for Manchester City,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.480
I didn't really
know what I really

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.540
wanted to do because I had been
playing football, and focused,

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.060
and concentrating about
football for 15 to 17 years.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.960
So when I decided to stop,
it was really difficult

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.199
for me to find my
way, I would say.

00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:39.240
So I was really lucky
because at Manchester City,

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.380
there was one of the directors,
called Brian Marwood.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.680
And Brian had a vision
of me that I even

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.290
didn't have for myself.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.840
So that's why it's
really important

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.940
to believe and to
listen to people

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.406
because sometimes people can
come with a really good idea.

00:20:56.406 --> 00:21:01.160
So Brian offered me
to spend two years

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.790
in the staff in Manchester
City and to spend time

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.260
in different departments
in the football club.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.362
I knew that I wanted to
stay involved in football

00:21:09.362 --> 00:21:11.570
because this is what I love,
and this is what I know,

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.240
and this is what I do best.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.420
But in which department?

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.690
I really didn't know at all.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.000
So I spent time in the Academy,
I spent time in the finance,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.720
I spent time with the
sporting director,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:28.060
I spent time in recruitment,
in the community.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.490
I tried to understand where
I can feel comfortable

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.700
or where I can
bring my experience.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.660
And sitting in the
office wasn't something

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.260
that I was feeling
really comfortable with.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.050
And when I spent time
in the Academy, the fact

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.300
that spending time with
the young players--

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.760
the way they were looking at
me, the way they were taking

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.780
into consideration the
message I was sending to them,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.340
I felt really
comfortable about it.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.900
At the same time, I
was doing my badges.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.110
And I just fell in love because
I put myself in a situation

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.670
that I never been before.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.400
And doing that allowed me
to know more about myself

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.140
and I felt in love
with coaching.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.950
And I did my badges, and I
worked for two and half years

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.772
with the under 21 in
Manchester City, and I love it.

00:22:16.772 --> 00:22:17.980
JON JAKLITSCH: That's great.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.521
That's great.

00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:19.980
And you've had a
chance, obviously,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.230
to play for a lot of great
managers over the years.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.520
Is there anyone in
particular that you feel

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.390
like has influenced you most?

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.534
Or do you think it's
a bit from each one?

00:22:29.534 --> 00:22:30.700
PATRICK VIEIRA: All of them.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.020
All of them because
I've been really lucky.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.400
I had some of the best
managers in the world.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.650
And I spent time with them,
I've been listening to them,

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:47.440
and, of course, I'll take
a little bit of something

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.210
off each one of them.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:54.110
Like Arsene Wenger--
spending nine years with him.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:23:00.440
The freedom that he gives to the
players, his calmness, the fact

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.140
that this office is always
open for conversation, the way

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.160
that he's managed
to turn your head

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.040
around was really interesting.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.280
Because Arsene--
you can say, OK, I'm

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.250
going to go to his office.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.140
I'm going to tell him
that he was wrong.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.400
You come back from his office
and you say, no, he was right.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.500
He was really good on
turning and changing people

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.850
and players' minds.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.762
This is something that I
find really interesting.

00:23:28.762 --> 00:23:30.470
The fact that I spent
time with Mourinho,

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.220
where he was really strict
and with a really clear idea

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.940
about what he wants,
what he expects.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.450
The information he was
given to the players--

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.570
that was really, really good.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:48.150
I had Capello when I was 18
years old, when I was in Italy.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.590
The way that he's
managing the group,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.070
his tactical knowledge--
I've been really lucky.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.840
So I learned a little
bit off of all of them.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.020
But I think what is
important and if I really

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.330
want to be successful,
I have to know who I am.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:13.450
I have to coach with my
personality and my philosophy.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.560
If not-- if I try to be
Mourinho, Wenger, or Capello--

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.684
I'm not going to have any
chance to be successful.

00:24:21.684 --> 00:24:23.850
JON JAKLITSCH: If we were
to ask your players today

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:29.210
to describe you as a manager,
and you said, I need to be me--

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.730
who are you as a manager?

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.780
PATRICK VIEIRA: That's
a really good question.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.730
I think I am in the process
of learning who I am

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:44.440
because I am a young manager.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.340
I spent two years
with a developing

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.160
squad and a developing squad is
at a different level from where

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.940
I am now-- because for
two years I was working

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.720
with the development squad.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.730
And the developing
squad, winning or losing,

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.479
it doesn't matter.

00:24:59.479 --> 00:25:02.830
What is important is to
develop players for the future.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.790
And now I went to
a different world

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.070
where it is all about winning
and winning with style.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.780
And I'm facing some situations
that I've never been in before.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.120
And I'm in a certain
situation that I still

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.850
learn a lot about myself--
how to deal with a situation,

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:25.700
how to deal when we're losing
7-0 against the other team.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.510
That type of situation
makes me learn about myself,

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.850
about how to deal with the
pressure because being a player

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.050
and being a coach is
completely different.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.576
When I was a player, I was
concentrated about myself.

00:25:37.576 --> 00:25:39.270
Players, in general,
we are egoistic

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.370
and we're always
thinking about ourselves.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.724
I was preparing myself
during the week to be fit,

00:25:44.724 --> 00:25:46.890
and to be mentally prepared,
and tactically prepared

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.660
for the game on the weekend.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.780
And when you are a
coach, you become last.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.220
You're thinking
about other people

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.700
before thinking about yourself.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.440
So the transition is
completely different.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.430
And the transition
was difficult.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.480
So I'm in the situation
that I'm still

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.940
learning about myself and
knowing about myself, about who

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.662
I am, as a coach.

00:26:06.662 --> 00:26:07.579
JON JAKLITSCH: Great.

00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:08.995
You also mentioned
that you wanted

00:26:08.995 --> 00:26:11.930
to bring your philosophy
towards the game-- kind of how

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.780
you think about strategy.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.580
Can you tell us how you
think about strategy

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.340
towards the game?

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.887
And how you try to implement
that at New York City FC.

00:26:19.887 --> 00:26:20.720
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yes.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.930
I have a clear philosophy
and a clear way

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:28.250
that I want to play in
position or out of position.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.560
We're watching the
opposition team.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.030
And then the way
we are preparing

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.600
ourselves is that
we analyze what

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.570
is the strength and the
weakness of the opposition team.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.420
And during the week,
we work on that.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.790
Normally, what we
are doing is we

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.180
spent two days regarding
how can we really hurt them

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.530
and two days about
how we can control

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.080
the strength of the
opposition team--

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.860
what to expect from
the opposition team.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.700
And then we get the time
where we focus on ourselves,

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.440
about how can we improve from
one game to the other game.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.960
All the training that
we are doing is filmed.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.870
And then we do a lot of
videos before training,

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.030
after training.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.360
Players do an individual meeting
with the coaches regarding

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.290
the position because
what we find out

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.720
is that some players are
really learning faster

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.970
and the message is more clear
when they are on the field.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:31.420
And for other ones, it's
when they are in the room.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.010
And the game is really tactical.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.680
So that means it's
important for us

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.900
to really spend time on
the tactical side of it

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.200
because games can be
losing and winning

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.965
in a tactical
aspect of the game.

00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:45.840
JON JAKLITSCH: Sure.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.090
And turning now to New York
City FC and kind of this season,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.960
obviously, you've set very
high expectations for the team,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.300
as any good manager should
going into the season.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.790
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.730
you think the has team has
fared versus those expectations?

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.800
And maybe anything that
needs to change for the team,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.510
moving forward?

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.620
PATRICK VIEIRA: There's
been some ups and downs

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.520
during the season.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.890
There's a lot of frustration
because I believe

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.830
that we play some
really good football

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:22.526
and we're not getting
awarded with the way we've

00:28:22.526 --> 00:28:23.650
been playing at the moment.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:30.890
We create a lot of chances when
we played, we're scoring goals,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.660
but I strongly believe that
we should score more goals.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.970
We should have more
points than what

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.770
we're having at the moment.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.640
But on the other
side of the game,

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.410
the fact is we're conceding
a lot of goals as well.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.020
How to find the
balance is something

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.986
that we really need to work on.

00:28:48.986 --> 00:28:50.860
To be honest, I'm really
pleased with the way

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.590
we're playing at the moment,
but, on the other side,

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.290
I'm not really happy
with the points

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.623
that we're having at the moment.

00:28:57.623 --> 00:29:00.160
We should have more points
than we're having now.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.590
There's still a lot
of work to be done.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.240
At the same time, we
have to be patient

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.390
because the team is
only two years old,

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.530
the club is only two years.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.500
But in our world,
there's a lot of pressure

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.410
and we don't give too much
time to work and to develop

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.400
ourselves.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.230
So I need to figure it
out as soon as possible.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:25.030
But I'm happy with
the way that we

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.661
try to play football
because that's

00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:29.910
what's really important for
me and is really important

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.880
for the club.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.330
We want to win.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.784
And we want to win playing
the right football.

00:29:35.784 --> 00:29:37.170
JON JAKLITSCH: Got it.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.620
Now let's turn a little
bit to the MLS, in general.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.777
I know you're a bit
newer to the MLS.

00:29:42.777 --> 00:29:43.610
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yes.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.300
JON JAKLITSCH: Tell us--

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.920
PATRICK VIEIRA: And it's
completely different.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.080
JON JAKLITSCH:
Very, very different.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.621
And that was going
to be my question.

00:29:48.621 --> 00:29:51.580
What do you think the hardest
part about winning in the MLS

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.700
is, say, versus the
European leagues

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.210
where you played in the past?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.585
PATRICK VIEIRA: I think is
really different because we're

00:29:58.585 --> 00:30:02.270
talking about the MLS who had
only 20 years of existence.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.740
It's really difficult
to compare the MLS

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.010
with the European league.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.580
 

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.990
But I believe that
they will get there

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.920
because-- when you look at the
number of games that have been

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.565
shown on TV now, you look
at the number of fans

00:30:19.565 --> 00:30:20.940
that you have at
the stadium, you

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.356
look at the number
of kids who are

00:30:22.356 --> 00:30:25.490
playing football-- the game
is going up in the country.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.020
But, of course,
they are far away

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:32.590
from what they have, at
the movement, in Europe.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.290
It's really difficult to
because-- as a coach, what

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:41.700
I find really difficult
is that in Europe, you

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.140
play your first game,
at a professional level,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.090
between 16, 17 to 19 years old.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:52.280
And in the US, a young
player played his first game,

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.570
at a professional
level, between 20 to 22.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.870
And that is really late.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:03.460
So I believe that the
grassroots football

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.340
has to improve a lot in the US.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.980
The number of hours that young
players spend on the field

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.740
has to be much more than what
it is now because there's

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.610
a massive difference of hours
of practice between Europe

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.526
and in the US.

00:31:21.526 --> 00:31:23.400
JON JAKLITSCH: And why
do you think that is?

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.530
So let's turn a little bit,
maybe, to the culture of sports

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.667
in the US versus in Europe.

00:31:29.667 --> 00:31:31.500
What do you think the
biggest difference is?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.540
Obviously, soccer is
not the number one sport

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.000
in the US versus Europe.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.290
Do you think it's just the
games aren't on TV as much?

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.610
As you mentioned, there's
not as much grassroots.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.220
PATRICK VIEIRA: I think it's
a little bit of everything.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.624
When you're going
to college here,

00:31:48.624 --> 00:31:50.290
when you look at the
college competition

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:55.700
here-- the football in college--
you're training twice a week

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.680
and you play four
months of competition.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:04.340
And this is between
16, 17 to 22.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:10.190
And this is a crucial period
of your development in Europe.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.930
And that period--
this is where you

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.980
make it or you don't
make it, in Europe.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.630
And to develop those
players, in the US,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:26.830
and that age gap is too late.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.620
And they will need
more coaches, they

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.320
will need more
grassroots training,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.860
they will need more
facilities as well.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.090
But it will take another 20
to 30 years to be better.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.730
But I think they are doing
the right stuff at the moment

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:50.670
because everywhere we're going,
there are fans at the stadium,

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.830
there are kids who
are playing football.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.820
And I think the future looks
bright for the US National

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.473
Team.

00:32:57.473 --> 00:32:58.200
JON JAKLITSCH: That's great.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.658
And everyone in
the audience, we're

00:32:59.658 --> 00:33:02.040
going to open it up for
Q&amp;A in a few minutes.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.690
So if you have a question,
feel free to line up

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:05.501
along the podium.

00:33:05.501 --> 00:33:08.310
 

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.140
So you mentioned 20 to
30 years down the road.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.474
That seems like a long ways off.

00:33:12.474 --> 00:33:14.014
PATRICK VIEIRA: It
is a long way off.

00:33:14.014 --> 00:33:16.270
JON JAKLITSCH: It's a
long ways off for us here.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.880
Do you think it'll take
that long for the MLS,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.130
say, to be on par with some
of the European leagues?

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.200
Or do you think that
will come sooner?

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.190
What is it going to
take, essentially?

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.940
PATRICK VIEIRA: I think
it will take time.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.380
It will take time because the
league is completely different.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.920
I'll just give you an example--
we played in Portland.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.280
From New York to Portland
is seven hours-- six hours

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.300
and a half, seven hours flight.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.290
When you're in
Europe, six, seven

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.690
hours is the period you're
taking to go to holiday.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.860
So you're not traveling six,
seven hours to play football.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.670
So the traveling is a
massive problem in the MLS.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.470
And you have to deal with it.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.850
So you have some
problems in the US

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:02.740
that you don't have in Europe.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.790
So they just need to
find the right way

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.880
to deal with those issues and
I think things will be OK.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.770
But I'm not worried
at all about it

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.150
because when you look at
where soccer was 10 years ago

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.510
and where it is now,
in the next 10 years,

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.052
it will be even in
a different level.

00:34:21.052 --> 00:34:21.926
JON JAKLITSCH: Yeah.

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:23.489
And then even in
the last five years,

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.322
I've noticed a huge
difference in the number

00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:28.179
of people who are interested
in the World Cup, MLS.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:29.600
You can definitely see it now.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.183
PATRICK VIEIRA: It
would be fantastic.

00:34:31.183 --> 00:34:35.159
And what they really need
is the US to do well.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:39.030
If they do well and if
they have one player who

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:44.100
can be an example or a role
model for the young players,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.315
that would be even better.

00:34:45.315 --> 00:34:47.440
JON JAKLITSCH: What do
you classify as doing well?

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.260
I'm curious because we did
fairly well in the last World

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.489
Cup-- as the US making it
out of the group of death,

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:54.440
making it to the round of 16.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.489
Do you think winning the finals?

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:57.406
What do you classify--

00:34:57.406 --> 00:34:58.738
PATRICK VIEIRA: You have to win.

00:34:58.738 --> 00:35:00.190
JON JAKLITSCH: You have to win.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.407
This is a tough guy over here.

00:35:03.407 --> 00:35:04.740
PATRICK VIEIRA: You have to win.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.170
 

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.370
This is the society
where we are living.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.150
You need to win.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.770
You need to win, you need
to have a role model,

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.460
like basketball.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.310
Basketball carries one of the
best players at the moment

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.920
and he's an example
for the young players.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.870
And they always need
this kind of person

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.050
that can lead the sport.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:37.650
And this is what they don't
even find yet in football.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.510
If they find that person
who can be the role model

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.590
and be one of the best
players in the world,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.386
then you will have
more young players

00:35:45.386 --> 00:35:46.760
who will play
soccer because they

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.467
will want to be that player.

00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:50.800
For us, growing up in France--
and for the young players

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.240
in France-- it's really easy
because we had Michel Platini

00:35:54.240 --> 00:36:00.240
before, and then we had Zinedine
Zidane, now you have Pogba.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.690
In France, we always managed
to have one player who

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:10.220
is part of the best
players in the world

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.570
and he was a good role
model for the young players.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.070
And I think, in
the US, if you have

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:17.819
that, that will help to develop
the game in the country.

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:19.694
JON JAKLITSCH: Hopefully,
that's sooner than

00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:21.659
20 to 30 years, but we'll see.

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:22.950
PATRICK VIEIRA: I hope so, too.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.950
JON JAKLITSCH: Anyway,
that's going to conclude

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.460
the informal chat portion.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.710
By the way, we wanted
to give you a Google

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.670
shirt for coming today.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.374
Anyway, here you go.

00:36:33.374 --> 00:36:35.290
PATRICK VIEIRA: I was
hoping for a free lunch.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.155
 

00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:39.530
JON JAKLITSCH:
Tough guy, again.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.560
PATRICK VIEIRA:
Thank you so much.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.643
JON JAKLITSCH: Of course.

00:36:41.643 --> 00:36:51.530
 

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.210
And we'll start with
the Q&amp;A session,

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.402
if you want to go first?

00:36:54.402 --> 00:36:54.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.299
Is this on?

00:36:55.299 --> 00:36:56.377
Oh, great.

00:36:56.377 --> 00:36:57.710
Thanks, Patrick, for being here.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:02.791
I'm a lifelong Arsenal fan,
so it's great to have you.

00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:06.030
My question is around
how football has changed

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.020
and how that would
change the way you think

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.195
about things going forward.

00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:12.970
So If we could take a 18
year old Patrick Vieira

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.600
and put him into a team
today, working for a manager

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.960
today-- because you know Arsene
Wenger and Arsenal are very

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.412
different now as they were
10, 20 years ago-- where

00:37:23.412 --> 00:37:24.370
would you want to play?

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.130
And who would you
want to play for?

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.190
And why is that?

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.540
 

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.900
PATRICK VIEIRA: The game
changed and I don't think

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.960
the game changed for good.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.690
I think, honestly, it
became a little bit more

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.310
difficult because I believe
that the gap is going up

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.660
between fans and players.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.880
And one of the reasons being is
that young players, I believe,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:56.540
today are earning
too much, too early

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.930
with not showing too much.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:01.554
And this is what the
problem is in football.

00:38:01.554 --> 00:38:03.220
But I don't think
it's just in football,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.890
I think it's a problem that
we are facing in our society.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:12.520
Young players or a young
person wants the job

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.180
with doing nothing.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.590
And this is a problem
of the society.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.210
And this is what we
have to deal with.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.800
And I think clubs--
we have a massive part

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.550
to play because
to earn something,

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:32.120
you need to deserve it,
you need to work for it.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.570
And we need to change that.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.980
If not, I believe that it
will get worse and worse.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:43.620
And if I'm 18
again and if I have

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.100
to choose a manager that
I would like to play for,

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.620
I would say Pep Guardiola
because of the vision

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.496
that he had and the way
that his team is playing.

00:38:53.496 --> 00:38:56.410
 

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.419
I think I would enjoy it.

00:38:58.419 --> 00:38:58.960
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.740
Cool.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.320
Thank you.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.420
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.628
JON JAKLITSCH: Let's take
a question from over here.

00:39:03.628 --> 00:39:04.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.604
So you mentioned earlier
the greatest players

00:39:07.604 --> 00:39:08.270
you played with.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:15.250
And, obviously, the level of
top quality is unbelievable.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.140
I have two questions
that relate to that.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.210
One, how do you think is the
best way for those players

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.840
to come here?

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.200
At they start or in the
middle of their career,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.150
as opposed to what we've
seen over the course

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.880
of the past decade, where
the top players come here

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.580
towards the end of their career?

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:37.600
And two, how has your
transition been here,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.420
given that you've played
on the highest of levels

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.390
and you've come here,
where it's probably not

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.962
on that same level?

00:39:45.962 --> 00:39:47.920
PATRICK VIEIRA: You're
asking me that question.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.380
You want to be in trouble
with the [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.646
we have in our team?

00:39:50.646 --> 00:39:52.574
JON JAKLITSCH: Tough question.

00:39:52.574 --> 00:39:54.240
PATRICK VIEIRA: That's
a tough question.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:01.312
No, but I think you have--
I'll try to be a diplomat here.

00:40:01.312 --> 00:40:02.270
AUDIENCE: Please don't.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.190
 

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.830
PATRICK VIEIRA:
You have stepped--

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:07.954
you understand what I mean?

00:40:07.954 --> 00:40:11.190
You have, step by step--
I think when they created

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.670
the MLS, what was really
important for the people

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.640
from the MLS is, how
can we show to the world

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:25.340
that we want to build a
really successful league?

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.980
And I believe that
the first step

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.180
was to bring players
with a big name

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.040
because you want to make
the world aware of what

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.420
we're trying to do here.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.900
And you're going to
a different step.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.310
And I think, in our football
club, it was the same.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:43.050
We bring players who were
marginally well known,

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:47.050
but we bring players to
our football club who

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:50.045
won everything in
Europe, but they still

00:40:50.045 --> 00:40:53.090
have desire to compete,
to be successful,

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.620
and to win something
with the club.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.500
And I think, in the
next four, five years,

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.320
the MLS has to move
to a different level.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.970
A different level is to
bring young, talented players

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.860
from Europe.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.720
And I think Giovinco
is a perfect example.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.990
But before you bring in
these young talented players

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:21.520
from Europe, you have to be
established as one of the best

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.810
leagues in the world.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.140
And I don't think
the MLS is there yet.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.180
And to bring these young players
to the US is really difficult.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:36.195
Because when you are 21 years
old, you've played in Europe

00:41:36.195 --> 00:41:40.480
and you're still hoping to
play in your national team.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.080
And the best way to go
to the national team

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.970
is to play for
the European team.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.720
And I think, as a nation here--
US-- we are not there yet.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.520
So it's really
difficult to convince

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.540
because we don't have
all the tools yet

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.460
to change the mind of
a 21 year old player

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.910
to come to play in the US.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.060
And that will happen, I believe,
in the next five to 10 years.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.342
 

00:42:08.342 --> 00:42:09.050
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.022
JON JAKLITSCH: Great.

00:42:10.022 --> 00:42:10.897
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:42:10.897 --> 00:42:12.734
I hope I answered your question.

00:42:12.734 --> 00:42:13.485
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:13.485 --> 00:42:14.110
Thanks so much.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:14.830
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.830
JON JAKLITSCH: Next question.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.371
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:16.371 --> 00:42:19.793
I'm a huge fan, and I
really respect your work,

00:42:19.793 --> 00:42:22.108
and I think you're
an amazing player.

00:42:22.108 --> 00:42:24.640
So you had a very
interesting point

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:30.240
when you mentioned
the team in 1998,

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.740
where you said it was
representing the society.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.730
And you really sent
a clear message,

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.786
saying that, hey,
even though we come

00:42:41.786 --> 00:42:46.670
from different backgrounds, we
are here together, as a team.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.510
So I guess my first
question is, do you

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:55.630
think this is still true
with the current French team?

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:59.609
Like for instance, Benzema
not being chosen and attacking

00:42:59.609 --> 00:43:00.400
the coach for that.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.815
PATRICK VIEIRA: You are trouble.

00:43:02.815 --> 00:43:05.713
You are trouble.

00:43:05.713 --> 00:43:10.750
AUDIENCE: So what do you
think is the secret recipe

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:17.019
to make a team, like to
have all the players as one?

00:43:17.019 --> 00:43:19.263
And my last question
is, who do you think

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.471
is going to win the Euro Cup?

00:43:20.471 --> 00:43:22.018
 

00:43:22.018 --> 00:43:23.393
PATRICK VIEIRA:
I think I'm going

00:43:23.393 --> 00:43:25.940
to start by answering
the second question.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.070
I hope France will
win the Euros.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:31.950
And I think they will
have a massive chance

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.310
to win it because of the
young, talented player

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.640
they have in the team.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.310
And, of course, in all
the big competitions,

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.250
if you want to have a chance
of winning the competition,

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:46.520
your best player has to be
at the peak of the game.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.620
So for France to win the Euros,
Pogba has to be at his best,

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.180
Griezmann has to be at his
best, the goalkeeper, Lloris,

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.880
has to be at his best,
and all the other players

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.400
have to perform as well.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.250
But you are not going
to win a competition

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:06.300
if your best players are
not at the best level.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.820
So hopefully, they
will be at their best,

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:13.700
so they can have a chance
of winning the Euros.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.470
Answering your
first question-- I

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:22.180
don't think-- knowing
Didier Deschamps the way

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:29.865
that I know him,
he didn't pick up

00:44:29.865 --> 00:44:34.950
Benzema or Ben Arfa because
there wasn't a space for them

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.030
in the national team.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.370
And I strongly believe
that it's based on what

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.220
they are doing on the field.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.710
And then we can all agree,
saying, yeah, but he's good,

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.270
he's not good.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.720
But what is important
for the people

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.630
to understand is that
you are choosing people

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:56.300
and you are making the team
not just for what's going on

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.600
on the field, you're
making the team

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.770
regarding, as well, how
they're going to live together

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.450
and how they're going to
conduct themselves together.

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:08.270
And Didier Deschamps was
the captain of the '98

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:13.230
and was the captain of
the European Championship.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:18.414
And he managed, at that period,
to bring everybody together

00:45:18.414 --> 00:45:19.580
in the French National Team.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:24.940
So he knows what it takes
to win a competition.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.720
And if he makes that decision,
that is the best for the team

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.230
because you're not just
playing-- you live together.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.720
And sometimes you have to make
a tough decision not just based

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.030
on the football aspect
of it, but the outside

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.652
is as important as what's
going on on the field.

00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:43.610
JON JAKLITSCH: Thanks.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.590
For you.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.802
AUDIENCE: So as an athlete, when
you're struggling on the pitch,

00:45:47.802 --> 00:45:49.510
or when you were
struggling on the pitch,

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.170
or when your players
are now struggling

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.080
and they make a mistake
or two mistakes, what do

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.380
you do, or teach to do,
so that they successfully

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.180
forget about it, and they're
able to focus on the next play,

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.622
and able to perform, mid-match,
so that they can still perform

00:46:04.622 --> 00:46:06.205
well, even after
making a few mistakes

00:46:06.205 --> 00:46:07.434
and stay mentally tough?

00:46:07.434 --> 00:46:11.831
 

00:46:11.831 --> 00:46:13.330
PATRICK VIEIRA: The
best coach I had

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:15.440
for that was Arsene
Wenger because I remember,

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.130
when I was at Arsenal,
I made a few mistakes.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.780
 

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.980
One of the actions
coming in my mind,

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.100
it was when we were playing
the semifinal of the FA

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.752
Cup against United
where I missed the pass,

00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:31.960
and the guy got the ball,
played it forward to Giggs,

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.726
and Giggs scored.

00:46:34.726 --> 00:46:36.600
Before that game, I was
making a few mistakes

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.182
and we could see the
goal straight away.

00:46:39.182 --> 00:46:41.140
But what was really
important-- and the message

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:47.080
was from Arsene to me-- was
keep doing what you believe

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.980
is right for the game.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.420
And that, for me,
was really important

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:57.110
because it wasn't about-- it
was a technical mistake that I

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.780
made, but the ideas
behind it were right.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.297
And that message, for
me, was really strong

00:47:03.297 --> 00:47:04.880
because that gave
me confidence that I

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.963
was doing the right thing.

00:47:05.963 --> 00:47:09.140
So in training, of course,
I needed to practice more

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.160
about this range of passes.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.880
And that really
gave me confidence

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.130
to try it again and try it
again until I became successful

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.520
on that.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.840
And that is a message that I've
tried to send to the players--

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.490
mistakes are part of the game.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.270
Mistakes are part of the game.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:30.730
And I want them to
try to do it, if this

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.540
is what the game was required,
if that was the right play

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.500
to do.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:41.330
And, of course, what we're
doing in New York is,

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:44.600
regarding the
period of the week,

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.020
we're doing some
individual training.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.630
And we have five or six coaches.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.710
And we always take three,
four players and we

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:59.256
make them work on their
weakness or their strength--

00:47:59.256 --> 00:48:00.380
it's dependent on the week.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.770
And we make them practice,
and practice, and practice.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.260
Because I strongly believe
the more you practice,

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.377
the less mistakes you're making.

00:48:07.377 --> 00:48:08.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:09.293
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:48:09.293 --> 00:48:11.464
 

00:48:11.464 --> 00:48:13.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.320
So thank you for being here.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.154
And you named the best
players you played with.

00:48:18.154 --> 00:48:20.300
You said Zidane,
you said Bergkamp.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.250
And you said that
the best players

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:27.620
had this a spark or something
that brought the team together.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.810
And Bergkamp, and
Zidane, and you

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.370
have all become
managers as well.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:39.097
Is that the same talent there?

00:48:39.097 --> 00:48:40.430
PATRICK VIEIRA: Being a manager?

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.500
AUDIENCE: Being a manager.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.950
So the talent to be a manager
and the talent of having that

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.824
spark on the field that
makes everyone else

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.490
look good-- because
it seems like that's

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.057
your job as the manager--
make everyone else look good.

00:48:52.057 --> 00:48:52.890
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yes.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.431
AUDIENCE: And that's
what Zidane did.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.561
And that's what Bergkamp did.

00:48:56.561 --> 00:48:58.024
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:48:58.024 --> 00:48:59.690
Being a manager is
completely different.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:00.398
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:49:00.398 --> 00:49:05.210
PATRICK VIEIRA: And it's not
because you were a fantastic

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.240
player that you will
be a fantastic manager.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.770
It is a completely
different world

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:18.460
because when I was
working with the EDS--

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.790
it was between the
ages of 16 and 19.

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:24.180
And they had some
pictures of me playing

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.770
and they knew what I'd
achieve on the field.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:33.040
And it was good, but,
at the same time,

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.460
it was really bad because
the first contact with them,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.570
they were really looking
at me with big eyes.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:42.760
And I was telling
them, jump 10 times.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.710
They would jump 10 times.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:49.750
But what was really important
for me is the message that I

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.720
was going to send to them
because the message has

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.180
to be clear, it
has to be simple,

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.950
and it has to be consistent.

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.330
Because being a good
player and being

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.660
a coach straight away
after, it gives you

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.780
a little bit of credibility.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:08.610
And the credibility can be one
week, 10 weeks, two months.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.370
And then after, when players
lose a little bit of confidence

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:16.360
on the manager or on the coach,
you having been a player or not

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.201
a player-- it doesn't
make any difference.

00:50:19.201 --> 00:50:20.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.340
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.150
JON JAKLITSCH: So
unfortunately, we

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.820
have to wrap up
soon, but let's just

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.750
take one last question maybe?

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:28.375
PATRICK VIEIRA: You can't do it
when he's wearing a City shirt.

00:50:28.375 --> 00:50:29.500
JON JAKLITSCH: Oh.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.480
PATRICK VIEIRA: You
didn't do it to him

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.410
when he was wearing
the New York shirt.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:32.600
JON JAKLITSCH: We did.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:32.680
We gave one Red Bull fan--

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.180
AUDIENCE: Thank
you, Patrick, really

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.640
appreciate it as somebody who
was an early, early, NYC FC

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.222
member.

00:50:37.222 --> 00:50:38.680
Thank you for being
here at Google.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.150
PATRICK VIEIRA:
Thank you very much.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.608
AUDIENCE: We welcome
you very much.

00:50:40.608 --> 00:50:42.170
Thank you for being at NYC FC.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.840
I actually had two
questions, but I'm

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.180
going to get to
the main question.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.720
What do you think
about the state

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.011
of our defense in the last
three games, minus the big game,

00:50:52.011 --> 00:50:52.510
of course.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:54.990
PATRICK VIEIRA: That should
be our last question.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.650
You should have cut it before.

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:56.900
You should have cut it before.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.770
JON JAKLITSCH: You
asked for this side?

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:03.262
AUDIENCE: As a fan, actually,
it does matter to all of us.

00:51:03.262 --> 00:51:05.630
There's some similarities
from last season.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.050
Our defence has
been a little leaky.

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:10.630
You mentioned it came
down to a little mistakes.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.544
Last game-- we were
there yesterday.

00:51:13.544 --> 00:51:14.460
But what do you think?

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.340
What can we do to
improve our defense?

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.770
We have some new
signings this season.

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:19.720
They're doing well.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.679
I like them, personally,
but what do you think?

00:51:21.679 --> 00:51:23.844
PATRICK VIEIRA: To be honest,
about the new signing,

00:51:23.844 --> 00:51:25.590
we didn't really start
talking about it,

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:28.930
but, obviously, the window
will be open in July.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:31.190
And with Claudio, our
sporting director,

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.460
we're going to start talking
about what is the plan

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.320
and what can we do
to improve the team.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.570
Because, obviously,
when we are facing

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:43.030
the situation where we are,
we need to improve the team.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:50.360
And what is really difficult
to convince the fans

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:56.310
and the people of is that, when
you look at our game from last

00:51:56.310 --> 00:52:01.930
night-- after a game like that,
you or the majority of the fans

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:06.040
think that the massive
problem we had was in defence.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.870
Yes, we conceded the goal,
but you guys are just

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.330
looking at the goal we
conceded, but you're not

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:13.990
looking at the number of
chances that we created.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:15.050
AUDIENCE: But we did.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.880
I don't mean that
we did not convert.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.381
It was--

00:52:17.381 --> 00:52:18.255
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:52:18.255 --> 00:52:20.460
But if we scored all the
chances that we created,

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.180
especially in the
first half-- 3-0.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.000
The game is over.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.510
AUDIENCE: True.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.926
PATRICK VIEIRA:
And then we're not

00:52:25.926 --> 00:52:28.990
going to concede the goals that
we conceded in the second half.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.140
Yes, we have to
improve defensively

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.530
because we're giving
too many goals away,

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:40.130
but, for me, I believe that
what is important in football

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:42.234
is always to create
more than we concede.

00:52:42.234 --> 00:52:43.900
And when you look at
the game yesterday,

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.210
we created more chances
than we conceded.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:49.800
So if even we scored half
of the chances we created,

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.400
we would be winning the game.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.895
You will be happy,
I will be happy.

00:52:52.895 --> 00:52:53.830
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:54.580
Thank you so much.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.371
PATRICK VIEIRA: You
understand what I mean?

00:52:56.371 --> 00:52:59.640
So yes, we have to
improve defensively,

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.750
but, for me, the main
concern I have at the moment

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:05.460
is that we need to score
more of the chances

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.830
that we are creating.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.024
And when we concede
the goals, it's

00:53:09.024 --> 00:53:10.940
not just about the back
four because I believe

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.320
that it's about the team,
it's about the unit,

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.470
it's about the 11
players on the field.

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.560
And we have to make it
a little bit more easy

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.340
for the back four.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.910
So that means the
back four are not

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:22.410
going to be exposed so much.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:24.640
So the front players in
front of the back four

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.320
have to do better work.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.280
The front players have
to do better work.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:34.290
So it's teamwork, more than
individual or just a unit.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.210
But yes, we have to improve
our defensive record.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:39.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.165
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:53:41.165 --> 00:53:42.540
JON JAKLITSCH:
Should we do one?

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.810
I know you've been waiting.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.769
Let's just-- if you
can do it quick.

00:53:45.769 --> 00:53:46.310
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:46.810
Hi, Patrick.

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:47.976
PATRICK VIEIRA: How are you?

00:53:47.976 --> 00:53:49.625
AUDIENCE: I'm also
French and I was

00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:51.070
6 when you won the World Cup,
so it's great to see you here.

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.300
PATRICK VIEIRA:
Thank you very much.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.300
[INAUDIBLE], by the way.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.330
AUDIENCE: In '98, the
World Cup was in France,

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.398
France was having
some difficulties,

00:54:01.398 --> 00:54:03.796
there was lots of talent.

00:54:03.796 --> 00:54:06.047
And the situation is not
that far away from today--

00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:07.630
the Euro Cup is going
to be in France,

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:10.908
I think France is also having
some problems right now,

00:54:10.908 --> 00:54:12.310
there is also lots of talent.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:15.203
Maybe there's not as much
experience with the players,

00:54:15.203 --> 00:54:16.650
like Pogba or Griezmann.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:19.709
 

00:54:19.709 --> 00:54:23.240
Do you see many similarities
to the team in '98?

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.865
Or what are the main
differences that you see today?

00:54:25.865 --> 00:54:27.240
PATRICK VIEIRA:
I think, when you

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.850
look at the social
situation in France,

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.700
I will say this is quite
the same type of situation

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.820
that we were in '98
that we are facing now.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.860
This is why I really hope the
French team will win the Euros,

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:47.390
so we can send a strong
message to the country.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:50.246
France is all about diversity.

00:54:50.246 --> 00:54:55.460
And our diversity is a
strength of the country.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.750
What I feel really confused
and really frustrated

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:05.250
is about politicians
using football and getting

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:08.296
involved in what's happening
on and off the field.

00:55:08.296 --> 00:55:10.670
| do understand this is their
responsibility because they

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:15.820
are politicians,
but, in the same way,

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.920
football people should
deal with the problems

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.840
that football are facing.

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.270
And I don't think
that politics should

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:27.900
be involved in any kind
of football decision.

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.910
And this is why football
is above everything.

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:35.800
And I hope that they will give
a really good representation

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.170
of the game, and they will
send a strong message,

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.170
and a positive message.

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:47.290
Because I believe that football
can have a massive impact

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.622
in the world and, especially,
in France as well.

00:55:50.622 --> 00:55:52.390
AUDIENCE: Well,
let's hope they win.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.131
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you.

00:55:54.131 --> 00:55:55.380
We can take the last question.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.262
He was waiting.

00:55:57.262 --> 00:55:59.030
AUDIENCE: Merci.

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:02.210
PATRICK VIEIRA: Am I
going to get a free lunch?

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.820
AUDIENCE: So my
question is going

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.840
to bring you back to '95, '96.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.689
I'm a AC Milan supporter.

00:56:07.689 --> 00:56:08.480
PATRICK VIEIRA: OK.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.105
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
to know, were you

00:56:10.105 --> 00:56:12.480
there at the wrong time
and the wrong place?

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.430
And what was the key learning
of your experience in AC Milan?

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.475
PATRICK VIEIRA: '95, '96,
when I was at AC Milan?

00:56:17.475 --> 00:56:18.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.685
 

00:56:20.685 --> 00:56:22.560
PATRICK VIEIRA: It was
a positive experience.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.410
I left Cannes and
I went to AC Milan.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:26.880
I was 18 years old.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.700
And at 18 years
old-- at that time,

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.700
you were only allowed to
have three foreign players

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.140
in the team.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.580
And when I signed for AC
Milan, I was the number six,

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:44.560
so I was behind Boban,
Savicevic, Desailly, Weah,

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.980
Paulo Futre, and
then it was myself.

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:54.960
So to have the chance to play,
four of them has to be sick.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.480
So it was really
difficult because they

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.990
were at the peak of the game.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.500
AC Milan was at the peak
of the game at the time.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.250
But, for me, this
is where I learned

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:12.710
how to be a professional
because I opened my eyes.

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.190
And I looked at how they
conducted themselves,

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.470
how they were
training in the week

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:21.790
to be fit, and prepared
mentally and physically

00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:22.990
to play the game.

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:27.076
And that was a fantastic school
for me because, at that time,

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:28.950
the Italian league was
the best in the world.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:31.120
And it was really competitive.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.040
All the best players in the
world were playing in Italy.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.360
So to spend only
one year in Italy

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.310
helped me to be the
player that I was.

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.964
So that was a
fantastic experience.

00:57:45.964 --> 00:57:46.880
JON JAKLITSCH: Great.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.738
And that's a wrap, everyone.

00:57:48.738 --> 00:57:49.779
PATRICK VIEIRA: Thank you

00:57:49.779 --> 00:57:51.820
JON JAKLITSCH: Thank you
again so much, Patrick.

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:59.560
 

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.585
Let's get you your
free lunch now.

00:58:01.585 --> 00:58:02.460
PATRICK VIEIRA: Yeah.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:04.230
But before-- I was hoping
for the free lunch,

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:05.563
that's why I brought you a gift.

00:58:05.563 --> 00:58:06.900
JON JAKLITSCH: Oh.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.370
PATRICK VIEIRA: Don't worry,
it's not a Red Bulls shirt.

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:11.807
JON JAKLITSCH: So nice of you.

00:58:11.807 --> 00:58:14.015
PATRICK VIEIRA: So it's just
to show the appreciation

00:58:14.015 --> 00:58:16.350
and to say thank you very
much for having us here.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:19.340
We just brought you a shirt
signed from our [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.940
JON JAKLITSCH: This is great.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.310
The other side.

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:25.510
That's amazing.

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:27.310
Thank you very much
for coming again.

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.460
I appreciate it.
