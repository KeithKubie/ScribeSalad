context more than anything else so if

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
context more than anything else so if

scientific data and that out there now

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
scientific data and that out there now
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.929
scientific data and that out there now
that shows us that our brains will work

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
that shows us that our brains will work
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.750
that shows us that our brains will work
up to 31% more effectively if we're in a

and if I intentionally put you in a good

and if I intentionally put you in a good
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060

effectively and that already begins to

increase the chances that you're going

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
increase the chances that you're going

to collaborate me with me you'll be

to collaborate me with me you'll be
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080
to collaborate me with me you'll be
smarter and you like me more at the same

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
smarter and you like me more at the same

time now upward and downward inflection

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470
time now upward and downward inflection
 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.050
time now upward and downward inflection
downward inflection is often used to say

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
downward inflection is often used to say
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730
downward inflection is often used to say
you know this is the way it is there's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
you know this is the way it is there's
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.200
you know this is the way it is there's
no other way and I will say it exactly

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
no other way and I will say it exactly
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359
no other way and I will say it exactly
like that if there's a term in a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
like that if there's a term in a
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399
like that if there's a term in a
contract that there's no movement on and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
contract that there's no movement on and
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830
contract that there's no movement on and
I want you to know it and feel it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
I want you to know it and feel it
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690
I want you to know it and feel it
without me having to say there's no

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
without me having to say there's no
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.719
without me having to say there's no
movement on this which you know maybe

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
movement on this which you know maybe
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.100
movement on this which you know maybe
you want to yell at somebody and that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
you want to yell at somebody and that
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.960
you want to yell at somebody and that
that's ineffective because that triggers

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
that's ineffective because that triggers
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.190
that's ineffective because that triggers
a different part of the brain and makes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
a different part of the brain and makes
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980
a different part of the brain and makes
people angry and they want to fight and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
people angry and they want to fight and
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.560
people angry and they want to fight and
I've done this in contract negotiations

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570
I've done this in contract negotiations
 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.700
I've done this in contract negotiations
I've said things like we don't do work

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710
I've said things like we don't do work
 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.880
I've said things like we don't do work
