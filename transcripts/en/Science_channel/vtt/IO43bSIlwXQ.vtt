UTILIZING 187 ROLLS OF DUCT TAPE

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:13.434
TO MAKE 2,000 FEET OF ROPE
AND A CANOPY OF 500 SQUARE FEET.

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:18.167
IT'S BEEN
A MONUMENTAL UNDERTAKING.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.334
Adam:
BUSTER'S OFF THE GROUND.

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:23.033
AND THIS
IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.868
WILL A DUCT TAPE PARACHUTE...

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:25.868
THREE...

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:26.934
...SAVE YOUR LIFE?

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:31.367
...TWO, ONE, GO.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:33.601
HE'S RELEASED.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.667
IT'S OPENING.
IT'S OPENING.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.000
-IT OPENED!
-OH, MY GOD.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.734
-OH!
-IT'S OPEN!

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.567
-OH, MY GOODNESS.
-OH, MY GOSH!

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:44.834
Narrator: INCREDIBLY, BUSTER
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.067
-OH!
-THERE WE GO.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.934
THE DUCT TAPE
PARACHUTE IS WORKING?

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:54.033
♪♪

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.434
-OH, MY GOODNESS.
-OH, MY GOD!

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.167
-OH. OH.
-OH, OH, OH, OH.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.634
OH, NO.
OH, NO.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.234
OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:07.167
THAT WAS UGLY.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:14.801
♪♪

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.567
Valerie: WE JUST DID OUR
DUCT TAPE PARACHUTE TEST,

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.100
AND, MAN.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.734
Elijah:
DO YOU THINK BUSTER SURVIVED?

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.934
Valerie:
NO, I THOUGHT HE WAS EITHER
GONNA GO PERFECTLY OR HORRIBLY

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:26.133
AND BOTH THINGS HAPPENED.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.868
OH, OH, OH, OH!

00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:29.667
IT WAS AWESOME.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.567
I'M NOT GETTING A PULSE.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:38.234
Adam:
SO I WANT TO CONFIRM ON THAT
LAST DROP THAT BUSTER DIED.

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:40.434
HE LANDED AT ABOUT
28 MILES PER HOUR

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.100
WHICH IS EQUIVALENT
TO FALLING OUT OF

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.901
A FOURTH-
OR FIFTH-STORY WINDOW.

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:46.067
SOME PEOPLE IN HISTORY
HAVE SURVIVED SUCH A DROP.

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:47.968
MOST DON'T.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:49.567
BUT THAT DROP DID YIELD

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.334
ONE PIECE
OF VERY COMPELLING DATA,

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.534
AND THAT IS,
ONCE THE CHUTE OPENED,

00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:55.767
AND IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY OPENED,

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.567
EVEN IF IT WAS FOR
A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME,

00:01:57.567 --> 00:01:59.634
THE SPEED AT WHICH
BUSTER WAS DESCENDING

00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:01.734
WAS 13 MILES PER HOUR.

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.667
PRECISELY THE NUMBER
THAT VALERIE'S MATH SAID

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.367
HE SHOULD BE FALLING AT.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.901
I WISH
WE COULD DO IT AGAIN.

00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:10.734
ACTUALLY THERE'S NO REASON
THAT WE CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.968
YOU GUY'S WANT TO GO
FOR ANOTHER RUN?

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:13.767
-YES.
-EXCELLENT!

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.701
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.801
I GOT TO TELL YOU --
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED.
