00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.770
Well, let's look at the pattern.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.614
In five hours we made 5
times 10 which was 50,

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:09.740
in 10 hours we made 10
times 10 which is 100.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.925
So, in x hours we'll make 10 times x, or

00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:18.330
10x dollars, and
just to make sure this makes sense,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.600
we can plug a 5 in for
x and we'd get 10 times 5.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.840
Which is 50 or we can plug a ten and
would get 100, so that makes sense.
