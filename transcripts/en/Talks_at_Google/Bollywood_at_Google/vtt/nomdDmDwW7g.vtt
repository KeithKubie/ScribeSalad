VIKAS MARWAHA: Hey, guys.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.680
Welcome to Google.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.680
Today, August 15, it's
Indian Independence Day.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.480
Happy Indian Independence
Day to everyone here.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.440
It's an honor and privilege
to have at Google today

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.170
soulful singer Kunal Ganjawala.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.210
Kunal is here in
the Bay Area today

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.970
to support a a noble
SAI Global Mission

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.230
in its charitable fundraiser.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.710
This organization implements
free food and medical camps

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.210
over 250 villages.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.310
It reaches over 400,000
people annually.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.350
I would like to
share a quick video

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.080

-Service is often considered
a privilege rather than

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.415
an essential duty
towards a society.

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:57.375
In this fast-moving world,
despite our busy lives,

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.345
it is important to
have focused interests,

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.820
to benefit the
poor and the needy,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.132
to uplift remote
villages to help

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.130
that section of the society,
which struggles even

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.880
for the basic necessities of
life, such as food, water,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.866
medical care, and shelter.

Providing a simple meal
to a starving person

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.440
is a valuable service.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.210
We started the food distribution
services in October 2006.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.358
By June 2008, we could
benefit 12,000 people.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.527

to 200 villages in five states

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.320
-They need a lot of care on
primary health, like anemias,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.684
ordinary fevers,
diabetes, hypertension.

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:57.530
These are the areas where they
don't know what is happening.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.330
-At the facilities
in the villages where

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.450
we have attended,
almost all the villages

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.010
in the [INAUDIBLE]
district don't have

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.626
any proper medical facilities.

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:12.460
-They just lined up to
the outpatient department

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.930
here, saying that
they are [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.250
Then on examination at
random, you find that sugar,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.780
it is high, or very low.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.640
Sometimes their blood
sugar is so high,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.520
I wonder how they are able
to sustain it for long.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.500
-If they want to go
and see a doctor,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.000
they do need to travel along,
a least six to seven kilometers

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.370
far from their place.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.990
-So naturally, we
are concentrating

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.300
on this basic principle of
treating common conditions.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.290
We do have [INAUDIBLE]
other hospitals

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.660
in other areas where
we refer patients

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.000
as far as [INAUDIBLE] surgery.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.710
We'll be really
happy to know that we

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.990
have done a cardiac
catheterization on a girl, 10

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.210
years [INAUDIBLE]
where she had a ASD.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.097
And now we have corrected it,
and she can lead a normal life.

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:37.960
-We know that prevention
is better way than cure.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.180
We have planned some
culturally appropriate programs

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.230
to create awareness among people
about their health, hygiene,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.060

difficult to travel.

First of all, wishing you
all a very happy India

like to welcome Mr. Kunal
Ganjawala, Mr. Rajesh Uppalapu,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.540

Arvind Thiagarajan.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.480
Professionally I'm an inventor
and serial entrepreneur,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.470

the former president of India.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.340
I have a video
compression company,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.550
but I promise not to
talk about that today,

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.090
but maybe some other
time at Google.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.310
Today I'm wearing the
hat of our foundation,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.390
called SAI Global
Mission, where we

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.210
are doing a lot of service
activities in India.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.700
And we believe
this is going to be

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.240
part of the
nation-building mission

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.940
through free health
care, education, as well

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.250
as nutrition.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:44.360
It started off in the year
2006, when actually we

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.900
were part of a village
service program.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.100
And during a village visit,
we found a very old man,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.000
70-plus-year-old man, and when
we started talking to him,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.150
we found that he was making
less than seven rupees per day,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.350
which is almost like $0.10.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.860
And all he could afford to
eat was just rice and salt.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.280
Now, you heard that correct.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.600
It's rice and salt. If
he had a chili in a week,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
he considered himself
extremely lucky.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.440
That's how bad he was.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.950
And because of the
excess of rice and salt,

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.539
he developed diabetes
as well as hypertension.

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:23.080
And these are two diseases you
cannot treat by giving medical

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.290
care once every six
months or a year.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.300
He needs to have continuous
monitoring and follow-up.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.020
So that's why we developed
this weekly model,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.770
and with inspiration from
great leaders in India who

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.690
have really struggled
for our freedom

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.860
and emphasized the need
for selfless service

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.190
to the society, we
started these activities

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.660
on a very noble day,
which is our father

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.490
of the nation, Mahatma
Gandhiji's birthday on 2

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.230
October, 2006.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.650
And I'm proud to stand here and
say that for the last 10 years,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.360
not a single day has been
missed in terms of these service

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.190
activities.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.030
Every week, rain or
shine, our volunteers

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.990
have gone to these
remote villages.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.700
It started off with one
village, in Uttar Pradesh,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.360
and today it's expanded
to more than 250 villages.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.290
Every week we have
been providing

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.190
free health care and free food.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.330
Now, you wouldn't believe--
you may think, what is this one

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.950
meal a week going to do?

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.320
But that one meal
a week is going

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.690
to really substitute for their
nutrition and other aspects

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.800
that they require.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.740
And that creates a lot of
goodwill in these villages,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.899
that somebody is coming
in, providing us free food.

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:30.440
And then that's the best way to
invite them for participating

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.250
in these medical care programs.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.120
And a lot of times
we find diabetes,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.830
hypertension is the
number one, number

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.400
two problems in our country.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.552
And a lot of times we also
find body pains and so on.

00:10:40.552 --> 00:10:42.010
And when we
investigate further, we

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.530
find that the water
is contaminated

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.970
with flouride content.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.990
Because of that, they have a
lot of problems, and so on.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.670
And some of these villages are
so remote that these villagers

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.220
don't even know that there
is a hospital existing,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.390
even 10 kilometers away.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.530
They can't afford it, because
if they miss that day's work,

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.560
they lose their seven
rupees, and they won't

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.050
have food for the next day.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.240
So it's really bad.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.020
And for some of
these villages, we

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.900
had to develop a different
approach, using technology,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.650
to go reach them out.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.120
And what we do here is
we actually maintain

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.966
patient booklets for
each and every villager

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.090
so that when they come the
next week, even if there

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.964
is a different doctor,
he knows what medicine

00:11:19.964 --> 00:11:21.131
was given the previous week.

00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:22.464
So there is a continuous follow.

00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:24.220
And we actually
computerized all the data.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.780
It's available on the cloud,
and a doctor sitting in the US

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.480
can actually monitor what's
happening to that patient.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.840
But that was just not enough.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.610
We had to go develop
better technologies

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.860
to go reach out to
these remote villages.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.890
So last year we
launched a technology

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.550
which is really the world's
first mobile delivery

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.650
solution, which is a
bus called SAIWHEELS.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.810

Advancement and Improvement

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.680
by Water, Health Care,
Education, Energy, Through Love

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.750
and Service.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.920
And this bus was the
world's first integrated bus

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.650
which had solar panels
on top of it, which

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.926
can generate electricity.

00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:00.800
There is mobile clinic
and then there is also

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.280
a mobile classroom with
a library and so on.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.100
And then there is
also a water purifier.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.460
Now, you can see in this
image, some of these kids

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.740
have never, ever stepped
into a school in their life.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.170
This is the first time they
get experience to learning

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.120
something with state-of-the-art
multimedia equipments

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.620
and things like that on the bus.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.520
So that really triggers
the interest in them.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.320
We go there only once a week.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.820
It's not enough to give them
just once a week education.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.660
But it triggers
interest in them.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.640
That's what drives them to go
to school, or do better in life.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.500
Otherwise these kids wander
around doing nothing.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.789
And they're struggling for food,
struggling for basic water,

00:12:37.789 --> 00:12:38.580
and other problems.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.640
We actually went to a village
near Raipur in Chhattisgarh,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.220
and this village
is called Persada.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.530
We were shocked because
we went to this place

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.030
where there's a lake.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.450
The buffaloes are bathing there.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.565
People are washing their
clothes over there.

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:52.190
And guess what?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.119
The children came and started
drinking that same water.

00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:56.410
Now, we live in Silicon Valley.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.450
How can we accept this?

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.390
So that's where-- this bus
actually has a water purifier,

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.210
so when it goes to the
village, it actually

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.750
delivers pure drinking
water to the villages.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.560
And we encourage the villagers
to fill up a 20-liter can

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.566
so that is good enough
at least for a week.

00:13:10.566 --> 00:13:11.940
If you give them
pure water, that

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.320
cuts down half of the
health care problems.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.800
So we are also collaborating
with Stanford University.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.500
We actually hosted a conference
called Science for Society,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.220
using which we are coming up
with an ideal village program,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.450
where using energy, it's
going to self-sustain

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.571
all these activities
moving forward.

00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:28.820
But that alone was not enough.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.250
We found a lot of children
having heart diseases.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.110
And I'll give you an example.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.280
This one little baby, her
name is [? Twinkle Sahu. ?]

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.030
And she actually
had a heart problem.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.000
Her parents knew
about it, and they

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.910
knew that she was almost dying.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.090
Literally, her
days were counted.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.310
But these parents were making
less than $100 a month,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.200
and a heart surgery in India
cost much more than $5,000,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.350
$10,000.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.880
And they just
couldn't afford it.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.440
I mean, in our
country here, even

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.610
if our pet is
affected by a problem,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.590
we all worry about it so much.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.460
But here they know that
the child is going to die.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.770
What can they do?

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.200
And that's where we
started supporting

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.120
a completely free hospital.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.710
It was built in the
shape of a heart

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.300
in a place called Raipur,
Chhattisgarh, which

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.574
is really the heart of India.

00:14:18.574 --> 00:14:20.490
If you look at the India
map, that's literally

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.420
where exactly the heart is.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.100
And this hospital was
inaugurated in 2012

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.400
in November, and it
has been providing

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.610
heart surgeries completely free
of cost for these children.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.320
And since their
inception, this hospital

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.310
has benefited so many people.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.880
And early this year, our
prime minister Modiji

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.690
came and visited this hospital.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.730
This is really evolving into
one of the state-of-the-art

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.640
hospitals serving all the
communities from all over

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.580
India.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.590
And this was built in a
record less than nine months

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.480
time frame.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.130
And on the first
day of integration,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.880
there were surgeries
actually performed.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.550
So this actually
provided the gift of life

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.330
for so many children.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.440
And while we can talk
about the numbers in terms

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.970
of how many people came
from each and every state

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.900
to go through a
free heart surgery,

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.140
but for us, more
than the numbers,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.340
the true victory
was this child here.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.960
He was actually
asking the doctor,

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.226
it seem, when will
my surgery be done?

00:15:18.226 --> 00:15:19.350
When we my surgery be done?

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.516
And the doctor is surprised.

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:22.959
Usually the children are
scared about these surgeries.

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:24.250
But the doctors were surprised.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.910
Why this guy is so anxious
to get his surgery done?

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.390
But my friend here told me
that apparently this child

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.950
actually wanted to finish
the surgery fast so that he

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.010
can become healthy,
go to school,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.140
learn, and become a doctor
and come back and serve

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.850
in that same hospital.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.780
To us, that is true success.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:50.610
So again, we have actually
done close to 2,382 surgeries

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.900
completely free of cost,
and 6,517 children screened,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.490
and so many patients in the
outpatient screening is done

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.930
and so on.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.760
Now, the need is so much,
the demand is so much,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.090
it's not enough if you
have only one hospital.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.220
So we're building another
new hospital in New Delhi,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.670
and that's going
to be inaugurated

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.140
on 26 of November 2016.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.586
The land has been purchased.

00:16:13.586 --> 00:16:15.210
The building is
already up and running.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.210
And we're going to install with
all the equipments and so on.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.470
And we're hoping and
praying that Prime Minister

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.130
Modiji will come again and
integrate this facility.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.630
So that is the main
awareness we are

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.170
trying to create through
this event today.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.320
And from the US,
we want to really

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.490
be closely involved,
because this

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.390
is going to be a milestone
not only for our country,

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.267
but for the entire region,
because not only patients

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:39.100
from India are going
to come and visit this,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.020
but people from all over other
countries in subcontinent,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.770
as well as even
in Africa, people

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.094
are going to come for free heart
surgeries in this hospital.

00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:48.760
So this is going to
be a real milestone.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.426
It's going to be an
international center

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:54.070
for cardiac care at New
Delhi, near New Delhi.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.561
Now, moving on to
free education,

00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:59.060
apart from giving them health
care, which is great, but then

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.990
we are to give them the gift
of-- carry a gift of life,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.349
gift of education,
character building.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.240
So that's where we're starting
schools completely free

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.740
of cost.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.880
It actually provides
free education.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.470
We've already set up 13 schools
in the state of Karnataka,

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.430
and the plan is to have
up to 30 schools, one

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.660
in every district in Karnataka.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.460
So some of the school
campuses you can see

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.450
are really wonderful buildings.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.126
And students can come
there and stay there.

00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:27.500
There's boarding provided,
and completely free education.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.420
And the focus is really
on character building.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.150
And we're also proud
to say that there

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.270
is specific initiatives being
done for providing education

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.520
to girls.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.390
And that is something-- such an
ignored aspect in our country,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.894
or several other countries.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.310
But these girls have to be
empowered with better education

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.060
to give them a better life.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.450
So that's where we're
building-- all this goes.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.220
And as I said, the focus
is truly building them

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.330
as better citizens.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.390
And that is what can really
help in nation building.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.670
And I can stand here and
talk much, much more,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.542
but I'm sure everybody
wants to hear

00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:03.750
the wonderful musicians here.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.320
But the fundamental
point here is

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.180
that if we give them
the gift of life,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.060
and then the gift
of education, you

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.070
are truly gifting our
nation with better

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.720
citizens for the future.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.760
And I still remember meeting
our former president, Dr. Abdul

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.430
Kalam, who was my mentor.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.240
I was reluctant when
I had to move to US.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.300
I used to ask him,
sir, is it OK for me

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.130
to move back, move to US?

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.240
He said, Arvind, it's OK to
be NRIs, nonresident Indians.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.290
But it's not OK to be
not responsible Indians.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:41.220
So my friends, the only way
we can make a difference

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.380
is by breaking our indifference.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.170
These are our own people, and
they require our self service,

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.930
and we all should come together.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.480
So it's not only our mission.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.780
It's everyone's mission.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.620
So we thank Google once again
for giving us this opportunity,

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.320
and we thank [INAUDIBLE]
for coming here and being

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.120
part of this wonderful event
celebrating India Independence

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.080
Day, as we move on to 70th year.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.220
So please join us this
evening and support

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.270
this wonderful cause.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.162
Thank you.

00:19:09.162 --> 00:19:11.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.460
VIKAS MARWAHA:
Thank you, Arvindji.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.310
This is really amazing,
and it's very, very

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.460
Sufi and human of what
you guys are doing.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.400
I'd like you guys to have
a big round of applause

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.140
for this noble mission.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.514
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:41.400
And with this, I would like
to invite our guest today,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.700
the celebrated singer,
playback singer,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.140
from "Bheege Honth Tere"
who won the Filmfare

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.620
award for best playback singer,
male, Mr. Kunal Ganjawala,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.352
here at Google.

00:19:52.352 --> 00:19:54.208
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.060
KUNAL GANJAWALA: This is fine.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.410
Good morning, and
happy Independence Day

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.670
for all the Indians.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.920
It's a proud moment for me
to represent my country.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.780
It's not often that we get an
opportunity to be representing

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.430
your country, because
we're not sportsmen,

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.320
or corporates who get a chance.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.990
But we do music all
the time globally.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.540
But we're representing our art
form more than our country,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:37.580
consciously, though we sing or
play music from the country.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:45.140
I'm very proud and honored to
be part of Sai Baba's service

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:51.930
mission, and have been
very closely seeing it

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:57.310
as a human being, as
a devotee, and have

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.660
been a very minuscule part of it
in the last four or five years.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.570
And let me tell you, it's very
enriching, very satisfying,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.030
because what
divinity teaches you

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.230
is that love is the
strongest weapon,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.910
and love is the biggest healer.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.850
No point having angst or
anger against anybody,

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:28.900
because love heals the deepest
wounds, and love heals-- love

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.460
is the greatest weapon.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.390
And that's why Sai
Baba always said

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.790
that Jesus came with
the Sacred Heart,

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.800
he came with the love
weapon 2,000 years ago,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.450
and healed the world, and
so did all the messiahs.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.370
And so when he came
and walked the earth,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:54.480
90 years since this day, he
too healed everybody's hearts

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.740
with love.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.110
And he often said that
love in action is service.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:04.900
And it's only through service
that we can redeem ourselves,

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.190
about being selfless as
opposed to being selfish

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.320
and about giving
more than receiving.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.010
And I have-- Brother
Arvind, Dr. [INAUDIBLE],

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:24.080
who have been part of Swami's
service mission for far longer,

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.650
and this hospital
that we just saw,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.420
which Brother Arvind showed
us, in Chhattisgarh, it's

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.040
no short of a miracle.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.030
It's no short of being a temple,
a church, a mosque, a gurdwara,

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.040
because when you go there,
you see little children,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.602
some are 1 month old,
some are 6 months old,

00:22:46.602 --> 00:22:48.310
who have been through
multiple surgeries.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.229
And everything is free.

00:22:51.229 --> 00:22:52.520
And I don't mean to exaggerate.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.630
It may sound like is Kunal nuts?

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.600
What's he talking about?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.840
This hospital doesn't
have a cash counter.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.160
None of Sai Baba's hospitals
have cash counters.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.760
Everything from admission to
prescreening to postrecovery,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.960
and the operation itself,
and the operations

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.900
that will follow,
and medicine, is all

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.630
administered free of cost.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:25.190
So anybody listening,
not just in this room,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.730
but anybody who is going
to be seeing this video,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.690
may think, so where's the catch?

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.700
What do you want in return?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.500
What am I missing here?

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.300
Nobody's missing anything.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.270
All that is expected of fellow
human beings all over the globe

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.740
is to partake in this
mission individually,

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:51.730
at an individual level, by
sitting back and thinking

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:57.130
that I want to make a difference
to my family, to my community,

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.490
to my country.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.890
And it's about sharing
and being selfless.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.380
It's about saying,
OK, I earn one rupee.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:10.820
I'm going to give 25% of that
to whichever form of service

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.910
that I want to.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.840
And it's about the
change from within.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.450
It's about a paradigm
shift in how we think,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:26.260
moving on from me, me,
me, me, me, to community,

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.640
and eventually that kind of
uplifting our consciousness

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.400
and taking us inwards,
as opposed to, wow,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.890
so Gucci is on sale today.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.030
Oh, it's Christmas time.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.050
It's that time of the year
where American stores give

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:44.872
maximum discounts.

00:24:44.872 --> 00:24:46.830
I forget what-- my sister
is on the East Coast,

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.020
and I've got an aunt in
Baltimore and a nephew

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.670
here at Google.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.060
So I know there are many
holidays where big sales,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.750
and 60% and 70% and 80%.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.770
So that's fine.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.810
We're all in the material world.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.790
But the idea is to kind of
make that shift from within

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.980
and say, OK, I've done
enough for myself.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.130
What can I do for society?

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:15.050
And all these miracles that you
see can happen with all of us.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:19.100
And we can all be part
of such beautiful things,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.920
in a way, in a
percentage that we want.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.410
It's up to us.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.550
And I invite all the
people watching to come

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.040
and partake in this joy of
giving, in this joy of sharing,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.360
and in this joy of
feeling that we're

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.970
living our lives in a
worthwhile way, and in a way

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.310
that we can, at the
end of our lives, say,

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.900
damn, I did something.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.961
And we can all peacefully go.

00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:48.460
Thank you.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.822
God bless.

00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:51.255
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:53.130
VIKAS MARWAHA: That was
quite a soulful talk,

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.533
so Kunal, I'd like
to-- Kunalji, I'd

00:25:56.533 --> 00:25:59.360
like to invite you for a talk.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.930
We have known you as
a singer, and today we

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.976
got to know you as
a Sufi person who's

00:26:04.976 --> 00:26:07.740
associated for a noble
cause, which is great.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.820
So I'd like to--
it's a privilege

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.790
that you are here at Google.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.164
So let's just start
some conversation.

00:26:15.164 --> 00:26:16.080
I'll give you the mic.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.626
So Kunalji, welcome to Google.

00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:27.750
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Thank you.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.875
VIKAS MARWAHA: Is this your
first time in Bay area?

00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:32.900
KUNAL GANJAWALA: No, I've come
here about four or five times.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.610
But I'm excited.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:34.920
I'm happy to be at Google.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.190
Thank you for being so
helpful with all our questions

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.090
and queries-- weird ones, too.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.430
VIKAS MARWAHA: You said
your nephew is a Googler.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.080
Are you also an avid user
of the Google technology?

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.570
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Yes,
unfortunately, or fortunately.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.015
The thing is, when
we didn't have Google

00:26:53.015 --> 00:26:55.290
or when we didn't have
these search stations,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.570
I don't even remember how
we got some of our answers.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.910
But we would go
into-- I don't know.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.190
It's not a thing that we
look for in a dictionary.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.560
But yeah, you can't
even remember.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.420
That's how much Google's brought
onto the table, so thank you.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.560
VIKAS MARWAHA: So any
of your favorite Google

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.794
products that you use, or--

00:27:15.794 --> 00:27:17.460
KUNAL GANJAWALA:
Whenever I have a query

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.800
or when I'm searching for
things, it's always Google.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.420
So I'm taking back a big
consignment of microphones

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.830
from America, and it
was through Google

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.630
that I reached this
boutique microphone

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.010
shop, which is all American.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.900
And it was amazing how Google
led me to their website,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.690
and it's a phenomenon.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.720
You guys are doing
great work, and I really

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.900
thank you for all the
information and all the help

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.400
that you provide people who
are looking out for things.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.640
VIKAS MARWAHA: Thank you.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.297
So are you comfortable?

00:27:51.297 --> 00:27:52.380
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.838
VIKAS MARWAHA: OK.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:59.980
So I would love to know
how you went into singing.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.670
Tell us your journey
into singing.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.240
How did that happen?

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.220
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Well, believe
it or not, I was bullied.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.630
It was a sheer case of ragging.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:14.680
I was completely-- there was no
trace of music or inclination

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.840
to be a singer.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.810
I didn't know I could sing.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.100
So not knowing you
can sing comes first.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.750
Not wanting to
sing comes second,

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.610
because I didn't
know I could sing.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.760
So here I was in the year
1990 in my high school.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.170
And suddenly these
seniors walk up,

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.230
and I was whistling some tune.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.140
It was quite late in
the evening, about 5:30.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.940
And I was sipping on some
tea, and some of these seniors

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.640
came up and said, hey,
you can whistle well.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.230
So I'm like, oh, OK.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.040
So you must sing.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.180
So I said, what's
the connection?

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.160
A lot of people can whistle.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.320
So they said, no, no, no, you
whistle really well in tune.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.390
So it went on for
about five, 10 minutes,

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.570
and then I was trying to
get out of that situation.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.847
So one guy caught
me and I said--

00:29:06.847 --> 00:29:07.930
I was trying to act tough.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.180
I said, hey, get
your hands off me.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.460
So the other guy caught me.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.085
So I was in that
situation, and I said,

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:15.920
OK, I'm suddenly in a film,
and there are these two guys

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.030
trying to hold two of my arms.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.920
And suddenly I
realized that, man,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.560
all the stuff that we see in the
movies is all-- is all a hoax.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.950
Suddenly when two people
catch your two arms,

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.327
you're kind of-- you're
against the wall.

00:29:28.327 --> 00:29:30.160
So then I thought of
all the kung fu movies,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.810
and I said, OK, maybe
I should use my legs.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.530
And these guys
were tall and big.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.030
So I said, hey, OK,
let's cut to the chase.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:37.780
What do you want?

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.050
I don't sing.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.710
I've never sung in my life.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.370
So they said, so sing.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.920
I said, look, do you want money?

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.380
You guys are bullying me,
right, so what kind of bullying

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:46.904
is this?

00:29:46.904 --> 00:29:47.820
You're not hitting me.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.810
You're not whacking me.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:53.372
You're not making me do a funny
thing, putting my pants down.

00:29:53.372 --> 00:29:54.580
I said, what ragging is this?

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.496
What is this, singing?

00:29:55.496 --> 00:29:56.750
What punishment is that?

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.580
But they were
incessantly after-- they

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.929
were obsessed with the
fact that I should sing.

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.470
So they made me
sing, and I said, OK,

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.700
let's get this over with.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.436
And I sang.

00:30:06.436 --> 00:30:09.420
And more than them,
to my own surprise,

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.400
I consciously sang for the first
time, and they all said, see?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.805
They were all giving each
other high and low fives.

00:30:14.805 --> 00:30:15.930
They said see, we told you.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.889
And they gave me a couple
of hits on my head,

00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:19.680
and they said, see, we
told you could sing.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.320
And I was like--
so I walked down--

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.430
it was a long, lonely
road, walking down, taking

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.850
the elevator, going
down to the canteen.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.320
And some of my friends met me
and said, hey, let's go home.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.890
And I said, yeah, OK.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.890
And then before
I went down, they

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.130
took me to the cultural
secretary of the college

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.630
and said, he's going to
be singing next week.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.190
So it was all in those
five 10, 15 minutes,

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:47.590
my entire life just kind
of-- it was like something

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.090
just opened up and,
plop, there was

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.190
a portfolio that just
came in and said,

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.770
OK, this is your road.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.650
VIKAS MARWAHA: This is great
that you opened up that time.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.780
I remember a similar thing
happening with me in college,

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.369
where I had a stage fear, and
my batchmates were after me.

00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:05.660
We want you to sing in college.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.080
I was like, I've never sung.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.730
And they were like, it's not--
we just want you to sing.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:10.910
You can sing.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.150
And I did not sing at that time.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.744
I was scared.

00:31:14.744 --> 00:31:16.410
KUNAL GANJAWALA: I
didn't have a choice.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.014
I had four people
trying to beat me.

00:31:18.014 --> 00:31:19.180
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.680
That's great.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.380
If I had a chance, I would have
loved to hear your whistle.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.430
I know you sing so
well, but should maybe

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.724
ask you sometime to whistle?

00:31:30.724 --> 00:31:33.140
KUNAL GANJAWALA: You've seen
the movie "Guzaarish," right?

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.931
VIKAS MARWAHA: Yes.

00:31:33.931 --> 00:31:38.074
KUNAL GANJAWALA: So
that-- [WHISTLING]

00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:39.240
VIKAS MARWAHA: There you go.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.781
KUNAL GANJAWALA: So
that's on record.

00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:43.800
With the weather and jet
lag, my lips are pretty dry.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.740
I don't know if I
can do that today.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.017
But yeah.

00:31:48.017 --> 00:31:49.600
VIKAS MARWAHA: So
did you, after that,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.970
take any training in
singing, or you just

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.330
went with the flow, just
practiced on your own?

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.390
KUNAL GANJAWALA: No, I
rebelled against the fact

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.690
that my parents encouraged me.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.950
They said, well, you continue
your studies, but how often--

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.150
and this was
pre-private television.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.790
Private television
happened in '92.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.590
So this was 1990, and
my parents encouraged

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:17.130
me, which is rare, because
at that time in India,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.520
everybody just wanted
to be a doctor,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.950
an engineer, the fixed--
but they encouraged me.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.990
They said, you must continue
your education, but you know,

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.820
it's nice.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.430
You can sing.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.680
Why don't you pick up and learn?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.070
So I joined the
[INAUDIBLE] at that point.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.744
And I learned for about
seven or eight years.

00:32:37.744 --> 00:32:38.910
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.700
That's great.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.880
So you started singing jingles,
and I discovered that the doo

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.560
doo jingle, that was one of
my favorite-- doo, doo, doo--

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.830
that became really--

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.199
KUNAL GANJAWALA: I can see.

00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:53.990
VIKAS MARWAHA: Yeah,
I drank a lot of milk.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.599
So--

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:56.890
KUNAL GANJAWALA: [? Punjab ?]
and milk go hand in hand.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:00.820
VIKAS MARWAHA: [INAUDIBLE]
your ad, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.070
that also encouraged us.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.345
A lot of youngsters like,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:06.640
you should drink milk.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.101
That ad was so-- it made
milk look very delicious.

00:33:11.101 --> 00:33:12.100
KUNAL GANJAWALA: It did.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:12.700
It did.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.370
VIKAS MARWAHA: How did
you become a part of that?

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.190
KUNAL GANJAWALA:
There's a composer

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.730
called Lesle Lewis,
who's part of Colonial

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:26.200
Cousins with the great
Hariharan-- wonderful, great

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.420
singer of India.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:32.580
So they-- Lesle gave
me my first jingle.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:37.060
So doo doo was the second
jingle of my life that I sang.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.590
And it was just, I
guess, the cosmos.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.560
And it was just God kind
of putting things together.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.380
And he gave me
that jingle, and I

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.582
was jobless after
that for four years.

00:33:46.582 --> 00:33:47.790
And that was the only jingle.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.200
That was actually my
visiting card, so to say.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.290
But there are and
there have been

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:58.870
so many other better singers
and busier singers in the city.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.930
So it always takes
time for someone new

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.420
to kind of come in,
make their mark.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.380
Firstly, you need opportunities
to prove your prowess,

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.909
if I may so call it.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.120
So it took time.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:18.739
But these are fine
arts, and so I held on.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:23.159
And I had my parents,
who supported me,

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:30.880
because there wasn't really
the pressure to provide

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.320
in the family, so that helped.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.730
But they really
gave me the support

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.909
to go on and not give up music.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.850
And I really thank my parents,
because it's not too often

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.780
that you have parents
that can support you

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:55.250
in a nontraditional career
way back then, 26 years ago.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.429
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:00.130
So who was your singing idol
while you were growing up?

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:10.720
Wow-- so many-- Lataji, Ashaji,
Rafi Sad, Kishore Kumar,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.330
MS Subbulakshmiji, Mandolin
Srinivasji as a musician--

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.130
legend as a musician.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.170
And I've also been
influenced a lot

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:32.570
by great bands and composers
and singers from the West,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:37.560
from America and from
the UK and Europe,

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:44.180
so from Stevie Wonder to Ray
Charles, to the kind of stuff

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.335
Quincy did, to Elvis.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:56.060
And then from Europe,
great bands-- Sting,

00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:03.400
U2, the Bee Gees, all the
legendary-- the Beatles,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.460
like I said.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:10.860
So phenomenal stuff, and great,
great artists, so all of them.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:17.660
I've never really looked upon
any one, because music is--

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:23.130
the way I see music, it's beyond
boundaries and it's-- India is

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.660
a melting pot of great music.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.450
So is the West.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:31.480
Because India brought the
whole concept of fusion music

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:38.120
to the West as well, way back
in the '60s with Ravi Shankarji

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.460
and Shakti, the group.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.540
VIKAS MARWAHA: So growing
up, was there an environment

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.260
in your family with
music, like you used to--

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.260
KUNAL GANJAWALA: No, no.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.000
My father plays the
harmonica, so that

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.260
was the only musical influence.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:01.090
And he would play that whenever
we were traveling on a holiday.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:06.340
And he would play old
Indian songs, film songs.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.146
But that was it.

00:37:07.146 --> 00:37:08.270
And we were avid listeners.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.679
So radio was a very
big medium and very big

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:12.720
influence, because we
didn't have internet radio,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.210
or there was no stuff like that.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.280
There was no internet.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.790
So yeah, no, as such, musical
influence from the family,

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.810
besides my father
playing the harmonica.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.330
VIKAS MARWAHA:
That's great, sir.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.980
So how did you get your
first break in Bollywood?

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.670
KUNAL GANJAWALA:
I'd like to thank--

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.980
there was a very
senior musician,

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:42.990
a female singer called
Poornima, who we all know.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.370
She was a child prodigy.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.680
She sang with Kishore
Kumar, Rafi Sad, Mukeshji,

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.830
as a kid for-- Shankar
Jaikishanji, for RD Burman,

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.850
for SD Burman.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.150
So she picked me up
from a college festival

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:03.500
in '92, around the time-- and
that shift from me not wanting

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.520
to do music and wanting to
take it up professionally

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.680
came around '92, '93.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.750
So she picked me up,
and she introduced me

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:17.660
to Ranjit Barot, who's a very
senior musician in the country.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.150
And Ranjit is a very, very
senior musician, singer,

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.010
songwriter, producer, drummer.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:31.240
And Ranjit influenced me a lot.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:38.500
My career took off after
he endorsed me in Bombay.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.620
And so Ranjit is one
of the finest drummers

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.750
that India has produced.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.230
And he has been drumming
for John McLaughlin

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:53.620
for the last six or seven years,
so he's part of John's band.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.582
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:38:55.582 --> 00:38:59.820
So recently, you have shifted
more into music composition,

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.880
if that's correct.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.130
So can you tell us more
about your recent projects

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.980
you're working on?

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.896
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Yeah.

00:39:05.896 --> 00:39:08.160
I'm getting ready with
all the ammunition,

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:15.400
because the whole model of
singers, composers, and lyric

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.450
writers, these were very
designated departments

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.300
in India from the time
film started in the '50s.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.810
So you had the
great Madan Mohanji,

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.910
SD Burman, Shankar Jaikishan.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.220
You had [INAUDIBLE],
you had [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.770
These were the great poets,
like you had [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.546
and then you had [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:36.546 --> 00:39:39.180
So these with three
very important parts

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.400
of a song, the process.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:48.140
Over the last decade, that has
changed, because what happens

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.430
is inevitably, a song
is known by the singer.

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.580
So you say, this is
a Kishore Kumar song.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.750
This is a Rafi Sad song.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.840
This is Lataji song.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.411
And that's how it is.

00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:01.160
There are very few who
realize that that's

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.670
a a great song by Rafi which was
composed by SD Burman, written

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.870
by [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:13.570
That's only music enthusiasts,
because you have to go beyond.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:20.080
So that started kind of
affecting the composers,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.070
modern composers.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.150
They thought we were
taking away the shebang.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.910
We were taking away all the
limelight off that song.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.450
So what they
started doing, which

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.130
is what record labels in
the West started doing too,

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.561
which is taking away the--

00:40:34.561 --> 00:40:38.710
[PHONE RINGING]

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.213
--which is taking away--

00:40:40.213 --> 00:40:42.380
[PHONE RINGING]

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:47.900
--which is taking
away-- no, that's fine.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.000
Which is taking away the
power from an artist.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.600
Oh, this artist is
becoming very big.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.610
Let's clip their wings.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:56.880
So this was part of that.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.200
So the composers started saying
that, oh, this is my song.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.350
That singer sung it, and he's
making millions out of it.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.020
So the composers started
singing, which is fine.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.940
But don't diss any
part of the food chain,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.600
because we're not
doing this intently.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.950
We're singers, so we sing.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.810
Here's a great mandolin player.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.820
He plays the mandolin.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.140
This is a great piano player.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.932
He plays the piano.

00:41:22.932 --> 00:41:24.723
So we're just sticking
to what we're doing.

00:41:24.723 --> 00:41:25.620
So the model changed.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.700
So the singers was not
getting used as much

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.630
as they were 10 years ago,
because the composers started

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.660
singing, or the composers
started getting people they

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.540
know who they could control.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.060
So it's a blessing, actually,
because every invention

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.065
comes out of necessity.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.550
That made us-- being
kind of not as busy

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.570
as we used to be till five
years ago made us look within

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.847
and say, OK, so now I need to
write my songs and sing them,

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.680
because the guys who
are composing the songs

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.100
are singing them.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.670
So that shift had to
happen from within.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.490
And if we can interpret
composers' songs,

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.076
then we can write our
songs, too, we thought.

00:42:10.076 --> 00:42:11.200
It can't happen every time.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.190
A great composer can
be a great singer.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.800
A great singer can be
a decent songwriter.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.950
But we're trying.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.170
So that's what we're trying.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.628
And that independence
is fantastic,

00:42:19.628 --> 00:42:23.690
because I did pray
to the god within.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.450
When I was a new kid on the
block, 12, 13 years ago,

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.150
I said I don't want to depend
on anybody for my happiness.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.030
So I'm glad that I have
my little home studio

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.954
and that I can write my
music and hit the road.

00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:39.120
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:39.661
That's great.

00:42:39.661 --> 00:42:42.350
So are there any recent
projects that are coming along?

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.850
KUNAL GANJAWALA:
It's not that easy.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:48.010
I may be a big name,
so to say, as a singer,

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:53.790
but I think I'm happy to do
independent music, which is not

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.190
connected to films, because
when you have to do films,

00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:00.410
you have to be going back
and meeting the producers,

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.450
and that's not a
road I want to take,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.980
because YouTube and independent
music is really big now.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.260
I just want to keep writing
good music, by God's grace,

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.990
and want to collaborate
with great musicians who

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:21.290
have traveled on this trip and
do some music which kind of

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.971
makes me sleepless.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.950
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.560
So you have also
been really popular

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.480
in the Kannada film industry.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.240
So are you focusing in that
space in in parallel, too?

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.550
KUNAL GANJAWALA: I've sung
about 250 songs in Kannada.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.920
But what happens is the Kannada
industry feeds on the Bollywood

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.960
industry.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.890
All the industries feed
on the Hindi industry.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.667
So automatically, all
my contemporaries,

00:43:49.667 --> 00:43:51.250
whether it's
[INAUDIBLE], whether it's

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.530
Shaan, whether it's KK, whether
it's Mohit, who came after us,

00:43:54.530 --> 00:44:00.042
Mohit Chauhan, all of us-- the
quantity of work has gone down.

00:44:00.042 --> 00:44:01.500
But we have enough
of a repertoire.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.290
I've got about 1,200-plus songs,
including my Kannada songs

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.420
and Bengali songs and Punjabi
songs and Hindi songs.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.210
So we have enough
for this lifetime

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.590
to pass by without
really knocking

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.990
on the doors of a
composer saying,

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.140
can you give me a
couple of more songs?

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:17.660
Let's party.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.750
Let's hang out.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.630
I can't hang out with people.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.150
There's got to be
dignity in work.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.830
And I'm old school.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:32.310
I'm sorry, I don't like to--
I let my profession speak.

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.100
If I don't have the credentials
workwise, don't hire me.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.290
But I can't suck up to you.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:42.716
VIKAS MARWAHA: So did you learn
Kannada to sing Kannada songs?

00:44:42.716 --> 00:44:44.090
KUNAL GANJAWALA:
I can understand

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.210
when people speak Kannada,
because every time I

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:49.350
write a Kannada song or a Tamil
song or a Telugu song-- yeah,

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.740
you heard Telugu, but I can't
sing Telugu, because this

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.370
is Telugu land, Silicon Valley.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:57.750
So my brother-in-law,
my nephew, his father

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.950
is Karnataka, so my sister
is married into Karnataka.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.350
But I can understand
conversational Kannada.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.430
I can't speak it.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.860
But I would write down--
I would break down

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.190
every line-- in
every language that I

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.950
sing in which I
don't understand,

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:17.040
I would write down what
the line means word by word

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.050
so that I could kind of
express what I'm singing.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.260
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.570
So I know you already
touched base on this,

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:29.130
but you've been in
Bollywood music industry

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.947
for more than a decade, and
you've seen a lot of changes.

00:45:32.947 --> 00:45:35.280
What do you feel about the
current music being produced?

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.060
What are you hoping--

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.226
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Some of
the music that's coming out

00:45:38.226 --> 00:45:39.200
is fabulous.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.380
There's a singer
called Arijit Singh,

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.230
and I think he's phenomenal.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:48.631
He's a great gift to the lineage
of all the great singers,

00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:49.880
composers, that have happened.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.150
And I'm very happy that someone
good is singing, because he

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.360
can sing in a lot of genres.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.170
He's a very potent singer,
very competent singer.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.760
He's got a great heart.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.100
He's got a great vibe.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.710
There's another singer
called Benny Dayal.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.440
Benny is wonderful, too.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.830
He sings the whole R&amp;B thing.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.630
That's his thing.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.580
He sings R&amp;B, essentially,
and he's wonderful.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.750
So these two singers
really, really-- I

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.880
like listening to their music.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.770
So there is a good crop and
some very nice songwriters.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.890
There was a period till
about two years ago where

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.010
melody was-- there's
another singer,

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.392
a composer called
Jeet Ganguly, who's

00:46:32.392 --> 00:46:33.600
writing some fabulous melody.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.230
So melody is back.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.910
And if you don't have melody,
you can keep making noise.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.970
You can use all the gadgets,
possibly, that are available,

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.000
and all technology, but
if there's no melody,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.390
there's nothing that can
hook you and hold you back.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.594
So it's a great time in
the Hindi films, as well.

00:46:49.594 --> 00:46:50.760
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.510
As [INAUDIBLE] said, we
had Benny Dayal and Arijit

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:55.800
Singh for Talk at Google, too.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.016
I hosted Benny Dayal,
so that's great

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:01.550
that you talked about them.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:05.150
So finally, sir, you're
performing tonight

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:09.560
at ICC Milpitas for a very noble
cause you talked about earlier.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.980
So what songs can the
audience expect from you

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.480
that will be joining you today?

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.190
KUNAL GANJAWALA: I have
about 45 chart-toppers,

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:24.420
so I can't do 45 chart-toppers
in 1 and 1/2 hours.

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:31.510
But I'll do an amalgamation
of-- I'll club as much as I can.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.540
I'll do [INAUDIBLE], and
I'll do "Bheegey Hont."

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:41.530
I'll do at least 20 of
my chart-toppers, some

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.360
of them half, some of them
full, some of them as a medley.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.340
And hope you guys are
happy and satisfied.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.260
If you're not, I'll send
you my manager's number

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.340
and we'll come back.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.905
But I'm honored to be sharing
the stage with Mandolin U.

00:47:57.905 --> 00:48:02.510
Rajeshji and
[? Harmit. ?] I think

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:06.190
I'm very lucky to be on
the same stage as them,

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.700
because I really,
honestly feel they

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.970
bring so much more to my music.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.600
And it's a pleasure.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.250
It's been a couple of years
since we've known each other,

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:17.779
and it's fabulous.

00:48:17.779 --> 00:48:19.320
I look forward to
today, because what

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.050
I'm going to do today, before
I bring in the Bollywood set,

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.890
I haven't done-- I haven't done.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:29.812
So we look forward to those
butterflies in my tummy.

00:48:29.812 --> 00:48:31.020
VIKAS MARWAHA: This is great.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.300
I also look forward to
your concert tonight.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.529
And now I'd like to open
the questions to Googlers

00:48:37.529 --> 00:48:39.445
that we have here, if
they have any questions.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:46.602
KUNAL GANJAWALA: No Googlese.

00:48:46.602 --> 00:48:48.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming here, sir.

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:52.930
In the recent, let's
say, five or seven years

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.940
there's been a big
trend in Bollywood music

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.600
to use synthesizers and so on.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.690
Every time you see or
you listen to a song

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.450
where they've used either
an orchestra or at least

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:05.310
real, acoustic
instruments, it just

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:06.780
sounds completely different.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.310
Why is this trend changing?

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.980
Why aren't we still
doing pure music

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:11.630
like we did in the old days?

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.620
KUNAL GANJAWALA: We've always
looked towards the West.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.570
We've always looked at the
music that's happening in the US

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:23.460
and in Europe and UK.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.915
So the trends are
changing there,

00:49:24.915 --> 00:49:31.250
and our pop music has
a style quotient, also.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.790
We've always looked at
the West, unfortunately.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.460
And that has caused--
because there's

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.330
a lot of noise
happening even here.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.740
You have great artists who
are not cutting records,

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.510
and you have a lot of
production, so to say,

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:50.440
produced, like you said-- just
lots of gear, but no melody.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.150
There's lots of stuff
you hear-- and I

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.720
don't mean to diss
any of the music,

00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.070
but you go back just 25
years or even 15 years

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.190
and you still had melody.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:05.020
So we're like that.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.170
We always look and say,
ah, that's happening.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:11.210
We have great artists
like-- singers like Beyonce.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.349
She's a fabulous singer, but
her producers are not even

00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:16.640
writing stuff for her, which
she wrote in her first two

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.210
albums, Destiny's Child.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.110
There were melodies.

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.680
Even something that
she wrote seven,

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.950
eight years ago,
still had melody.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.110
But that's all changing.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.020
And I think we as
consumers are to be blamed.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.320
So if more responsible
people like you

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:36.620
start asking this question, stop
downloading music, paid music,

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.720
I think they'll
get their answers

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.430
and they'll start moving
and making a shift.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:46.197
So we need to not
consume crap musically.

00:50:46.197 --> 00:50:47.780
AUDIENCE: So as
someone who's creating

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.154
stuff that people
are paying for,

00:50:49.154 --> 00:50:52.574
do you see a market for
pure or really [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:52.574 --> 00:50:53.740
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Absolutely.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:58.440
See, India, even our pop music
two, three years ago was noisy.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.740
There was a shift, three
or four years of confusion,

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.420
whether we should have it
more electronic or what.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.920
And suddenly, Jeet Ganguly
and Armaan Malik came in,

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.900
and they've brought melody.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.160
So it's bound to happen.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.320
And also, unfortunately,
record labels

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.930
control the artists too
much, and the songwriters.

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.030
They think they know what
sells, because they just

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:21.890
want to see the jacket.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:25.220
They just want to see money.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.870
And that's not going to change,
because every artist that

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.030
starts rebelling
gets thrown away

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.410
in the darkness,
like the greatest,

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:36.840
like Michael Jackson or
George Michael, from modern,

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.210
from current times.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.960
And that's why Stevie's
not writing albums

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.670
after having written so many.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.460
He wrote his last album
about 10 years ago.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:48.770
So if you try to
fight the system,

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:53.880
the system just throws you--
chews you and throws you.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.060
So it's upon consumption.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.360
So if there is no demand,
there will be no supply.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.660
So we have to
control the demand.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.047
Yes, please.

00:52:12.495 --> 00:52:13.370
AUDIENCE: Hello, sir.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:14.157
I'm [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:14.157 --> 00:52:14.990
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Hi.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.531
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:16.738
I'm a big fan of yours.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.180
What industry you like--
Kollywood, Bollywood,

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.042
or Dollywood, which
language, and which language

00:52:27.042 --> 00:52:27.750
you want to sing?

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.450
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Actually,
I just love doing music,

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.840
so language is something--
and we are lucky that India

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.710
as a country, as small as
it is if you compare it

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.650
to the continents
and the landmass,

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:42.080
we have so many languages.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.470
So I'm just lucky that I was
born in a country with so much

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:48.680
diversity and so much culture.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.850
And for me, one of my
aunts-- one of my uncles

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.275
is married into [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:57.036
A sister is married
into Karnataka.

00:52:57.036 --> 00:52:58.160
My wife is from Tamil Nadu.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:04.280
The other sister is
married into Sindh.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.920
So our home has been like--
my mother is from Maharashtra.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.830
My granny was from Maharashtra.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:12.840
And we are Gujaratis.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.510
So we were already having
six or seven languages

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.670
within the family,
so it was fantastic.

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:20.500
It was like learning at home.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:26.630
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So it
was a natural inclination.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:29.840
So I love singing--
singing, per se.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.520
I love music.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.852
So language is not a problem.

00:53:32.852 --> 00:53:34.547
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:53:34.547 --> 00:53:36.130
KUNAL GANJAWALA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.089
thank you, yes.

00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:38.130
AUDIENCE: Talking to you.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.760
Thank you.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.884
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Thank you.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.730
I'd leave the
microphone now to you

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.754
to speak to the other artists.

00:53:49.754 --> 00:53:51.170
VIKAS MARWAHA:
Thank you, Kunalji.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.130
KUNAL GANJAWALA: I'm
horribly jet-lagged.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.640
VIKAS MARWAHA: It was a
pleasure hosting you today.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.260
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Thank you, sir.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.990
It was a pleasure being here.

00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.400
VIKAS MARWAHA: Thank you.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.170
Thank you once again.

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.960
KUNAL GANJAWALA: Thank you.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.654
Thank you.

00:53:58.654 --> 00:54:00.362
VIKAS MARWAHA: I'd
like you guys to have.

00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:02.672
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:11.120
Well, so it's a
pleasure today that we

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:14.950
have two notable artists today
on the same day at Google.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:18.980
Today we first had
Kunalji, who you all heard,

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.250
and now we have a very
famous mandolin player

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.570
of India, Mandolin U. Rajesh.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.480
He is an exponent in
his craft and a leader

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.380
in pioneering world music.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.630
He's composed several superhit
ensemble albums, including

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.810
"Following my
Heart," and performed

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:39.420
on John McLaughlin's
Grammy-nominated album

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.115
Floating Point.

00:54:40.115 --> 00:54:43.639
A big round of applause in
welcoming him to Google today.

00:54:43.639 --> 00:54:46.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:02.100
So Rajeshji, welcome to Google.

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.440
It's a pleasure that
you're here today among us.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.810
Is this your first
time in Bay Area?

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:09.184
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
No, I've been

00:55:09.184 --> 00:55:13.730
coming for 15 years, at
least, to the Bay Area.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:15.190
VIKAS MARWAHA:
That's great, sir.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:18.670
And this is the first
time you're probably

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:22.247
performing with Kunalji, right?

00:55:22.247 --> 00:55:24.330
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: It's
a first-time combination.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.750
I'm really looking
forward to that.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:26.600
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.141
That's great.

00:55:27.141 --> 00:55:29.660
He really looked excited
working with you.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.280
Will be great.

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.560
So, sir, as you know, Google
is a technology company.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.380
And I would like to know,
since technology is playing

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.530
an increasing role
in everyone's life,

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:41.830
how do you see technology
impacting the reach

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:45.330
and impact on the mandolin?

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:48.410
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: Of
course, my instrument

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:52.560
is completely dependent on
technology, electric mandolin.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.000
But technology is like
a pickle in the food.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.990
It's not mainstream.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.390
It gives added value.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.310
But you should not
completely depend on it.

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:05.990
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's true.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:13.090
So there have been-- so are
you using YouTube as a medium

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:15.910
to promote your music,
like a lot of artists,

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:17.360
independent artists these days?

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.940
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: YouTube
is an amazing thing,

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.830
which it's like a blessing,
because those days, you want

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:24.610
to listen to different
kind of music,

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.470
you have to go
personally buy, search.

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.550
Now you just keyword
and you can see.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:30.880
That's a blessing.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.500
VIKAS MARWAHA: I mean, do you
have your own YouTube channel?

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.000
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
Yeah, of course.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.359
We do have YouTube channels,
and it's a great way to--

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:39.900
VIKAS MARWAHA: It's a great way
to connect with the audience.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:42.720
Yeah, that's right.

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.860
And so you have played
with a number of bands,

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.690
with international musicians,
including Pete Lockett, Bickram

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:50.020
Ghosh, and Stephen Devassy.

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.650
In this way you have
been a pioneering wave

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.210
of fusion music.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.360
That's great.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.870
I would love to know, how
do you define fusion music,

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:00.740
and what are your thoughts
in its growth in popularity

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.450
over the past several decades?

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.950
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
Well, life changes.

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:06.930
Change is permanent.

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:11.580
Fusion in music is-- there's
nothing called fusion music.

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.746
It's just trying to--
it's like food, you know?

00:57:14.746 --> 00:57:17.535
You have cuisines,
multi cuisines.

00:57:17.535 --> 00:57:21.470
Now we have every cuisine
in our house cooking.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.320
We just have some fried rice.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.790
Likewise in music.

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:29.400
It's nice to collaborate,
and it's basically conversing

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.700
in a different language.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.840
Fusion is nothing but two
languages trying to talk,

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.820
and we come to a point where we
get understanding the language.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.130
That's fusion music.

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:40.670
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's true.

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:44.610
So we all know your late
brother, U Srinivas,

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:48.270
who was an undisputed
wizard on the mandolin.

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:51.705
Can you share with us more about
his influence on your music?

00:57:51.705 --> 00:57:53.080
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
Of course, he

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.730
is the person who
brought this instrument

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:57.690
to the Indian classical music.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.390
He was the first person,
and he is everything

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:03.912
for me-- inspiration.

00:58:03.912 --> 00:58:04.495
He is my guru.

00:58:04.495 --> 00:58:05.170
He's brother.

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.010
He is my guiding
light, everything.

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:11.530
And without him, I would have
not been a musician at all.

00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:13.740
I just wanted to become
a pilot, actually.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:19.040
So it's karma or accident
that incident just happened.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.110
And he's just a great blessing
to our Indian classical music,

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:29.190
because what he did is--
Indian music has been there

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:34.980
for thousands of years, but
he brought a new instrument,

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:41.280
and then brought the old format
of music to the world again.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.180
And he made Western
people go, wow,

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.470
because mandolin is more
a romantic instrument,

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:49.740
plays more of harmony.

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:53.400
And he adapted it
and modified it

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.690
to play the mainstream
Indian classical music, which

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:59.299
is very difficult. There's a
lot of long notes, long slide

00:58:59.299 --> 00:59:00.090
notes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:04.880
He's the person who
made the difference

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.070
to Indian classical music.

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:09.107
VIKAS MARWAHA: Did he used to
play mostly electric mandolin?

00:59:09.107 --> 00:59:09.690
Is that right?

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.689
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: He
started with an acoustic,

00:59:11.689 --> 00:59:15.630
then he realized that
Indian classical music needs

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:20.630
more sustained notes, so he
added the element of pickup

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:23.150
and made it more electric.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.670
VIKAS MARWAHA: I've been
following recently [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:29.040
He plays electric
version of a sitar,

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:35.060
so this is amazing, how you guys
are bringing the Indian music

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:40.010
through instruments like these
with beautiful harmonies.

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:43.940
So sir, how did your
training happen?

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.040
Tell us more about how many
hours you put into training,

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:50.250
and how did you used to train?

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.000
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
Let me be very honest.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.515
I was not-- wanted
to be a musician.

00:59:54.515 --> 00:59:55.640
I wanted to become a pilot.

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.210
And when I was six I
started learning it

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:02.230
because my dad is a strict
dad and I have to learn it.

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:05.760
If not, I'll get nicely whacked.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.480
But when I was 10
or 11 years old,

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.240
I met this great saint Indian.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.430
He lived for 100
years, [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:20.850
And he said no
piloting, only music.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:24.490
Because they don't talk
much, very few words.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:29.330
And that was the day I performed
first, like my brother.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:32.530
And my life's
changed from there.

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:34.870
It all started like that.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:36.210
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's so great.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:40.150
So you're involved with efforts
to groom the next generation

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.750
of classical
musicians, including

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.275
at the Srinivas Institute of--

01:00:43.275 --> 01:00:45.650
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: [INAUDIBLE]
Institute of World Music,

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.770
and we teach music for free.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.160
VIKAS MARWAHA:
That's great, sir.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.830
And how many
students do you have?

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:53.330
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
We have students

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:56.450
all over the world--
probably 150, 200 students.

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:58.630
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.890
Do you guys have any plans
of opening the institute here

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:02.390
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.000
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: Yeah.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.280
We're planning to open
it in East Coast first,

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.104
and then Bay Area later.

01:01:07.104 --> 01:01:08.270
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:09.480
Looking forward to it.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:15.050
So what has been your experience
imparting the learnings

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.540
to the next
generation, and can you

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.060
tell us about the next
generation of mandolin

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.332
minstrels that are coming out?

01:01:21.332 --> 01:01:23.290
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
Speaking about generations,

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:24.930
I'm still young.

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:26.650
VIKAS MARWAHA:
Oh, yeah, I agree.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:27.290
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
I've been talking

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.373
about the next generation.

01:01:31.327 --> 01:01:33.410
We don't need to be worried
about the generations,

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.690
because as long as your music is
pure and perfect and very good,

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:39.040
it just keeps going on.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.889
That's what my brother believed
in, and it's still going on.

01:01:42.889 --> 01:01:44.680
VIKAS MARWAHA: Sir, I
know you have brought

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.750
your mandolin here,
and everyone here

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:50.509
would love to hear you play.

01:01:50.509 --> 01:01:52.550
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: I will
just play a little bit

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:55.510
and just show you the
changes which my brother did.

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:58.680
--sounds, and what
is the changes.

01:02:13.151 --> 01:02:16.145
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:25.127
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:29.618 --> 01:02:32.113
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:25.506
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.942
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:37.994 --> 01:03:40.410
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's amazing
how you stayed on that note,

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:42.110
like the latter you played.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.010
That was mind blowing.

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.006
Great.

01:03:45.006 --> 01:03:47.000
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:50.310
VIKAS MARWAHA: I'll open
up to audience questions

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.230
for Rajeshji.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.195
People are mind blown, man.

01:04:02.195 --> 01:04:04.870
They're really looking forward
to seeing your performance

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:06.450
tonight.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:08.010
That's great.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.970
Thank you, Rajeshji,
so much for coming.

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.200
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH: It's my
pleasure to be here to Google,

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.140
and thank you for inviting.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.420
And we are very
honored and blessed

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.530
to be here for that
SAI global organization

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:21.700
for doing this wonderful
fundraiser for Swami's

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.820
hospital.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:25.150
Thank you all and, hope
to see you all there.

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.650
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:26.816
VIKAS MARWAHA: That's great.

01:04:26.816 --> 01:04:28.085
I guess we got a question now.

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.340
AUDIENCE: This is a little
bit of an oddball question,

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.980
and hopefully you
have an opinion.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:42.400
But ever since I've been
watching music, and especially

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.330
musicians in India, I rarely
see women come forward.

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:51.930
There are a few, but there's
certainly a lot more men

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.480
that are famous in this field.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.230
Why is that?

01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:00.690
MANDOLIN U. RAJESH:
That's a tricky question.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:04.790
You should ask women,
not me, because-- there

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:07.080
are a lot of women
learning the instrument.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.190
Probably women are
created by God,

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:12.660
because there's beauty, this
so much, you forget everything

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.230
when you see the beauty.

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:18.740
And men trying hard to be
listened and take the place.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.030
It's just a tricky question.

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:22.370
I don't see that women are less.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:25.260
Everywhere, if you see in
rock, pop, [INAUDIBLE],

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.590
there are a lot of women
singing and playing instruments.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:31.520
I don't see less women in
here in this profession.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.830
I mean, that's my opinion.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.670
I may be wrong.

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:34.503
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.530
VIKAS MARWAHA: Well, thank
you, Rajeshji, again.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:44.700
It was a pleasure.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.840
And thank you all for
coming for today's event.
