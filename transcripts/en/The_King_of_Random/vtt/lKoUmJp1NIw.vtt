00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
Hey guys.

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.840
We are here at the Dome

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.920
with Brian Brushwood from
the YouTube channel The Modern Rogue.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.800
Hey man. 
This is The King of Random Channel,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.260
which means I need to see
something melt or blow up immediately.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.320
How about both?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.780
You make a compelling argument.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.140
Today, we are going to follow up
our Aluminum in Clear Ice experiment,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.520
and see what happens

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.880
if we do the same thing using molten 
copper rather than molten aluminum.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.300
So what's the difference
with copper versus aluminum?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900
So aluminum melts at
a lower temperature than copper.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.600
Copper melts at almost
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.440
so it may cool down and just start to 
harden in a way that aluminum didn't.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.340
If that does happen, there are
a couple other things that may occur.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.840
We might just cast copper inside
the tunnel that we drilled into the ice.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.980
That wouldn't be the coolest reaction,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.480
but it would still be fairly neat.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.760
It's also possible that
there will be some steam,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.060
but not the explosive amount
of steam that we saw before,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.640
and it could launch our molten copper
up out of the top of the block of ice.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.020
Man, there are no
wrong answers in Science.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.280
Something cool is going to happen.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.640
It's time to find out what.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.811
Alright, so where do we begin?

00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.100
We've got to melt down 
some copper, right?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.780
Yes.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.720
We've got our foundry.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.740
We've got propane.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.640
We've got a bunch of copper ingots,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.900
and we are just going to get
those going in the foundry.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.340
It'll probably take 30-ish minutes
for those to get nice and melted down.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060
We want a nice, thin, pourable copper liquid,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.340
which at that point,
is going to be glowing beautifully.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.340
And while we do that,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.920
we can get a hole drilled in our ice,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.800
and get it set up under our pouring device.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.380
Awesome.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.200
Let's, we can't start fast enough.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.120
Let's go.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.700
Here we go.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.720
Oh, what a great thunderous sound.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.300
So the flame's coming out the top.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.620
They have a greenish hue to them.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.800
Yeah. So the cup we're melting this in
has been used for melting copper before,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.780
and as it gets hit with the high heat,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.700
some of the copper starts oxidizing.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.700
Oxidizing copper
has a tendency to turn green.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.020
It's not because it's not haunted?

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.140
It's also haunted.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.380
Okay there, that makes sense.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.140
Yeah.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.440
Alright, so how deep do
we want to go in here?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.530
We want to go 2/3 to almost 3/4
the way down through the ice.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.240
We want to make sure there's
like a really good nest down in the ice

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.640
where the copper can settle.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.300
And do we want it to be wide
at the top or thin all the way down?

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.720
We'll go thin all the way down,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.320
and then after we have
the tunnel carved into it,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.860
we'll widen the top just so
we're better able to pour the copper in.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.880
We don't have to aim quite so precisely.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.660
Got it.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.100
It's snow.
I'm from Texas, I'm easily amused.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.920
I think that's good.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.860
And this block of ice,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.620
which when I picked it up,
it was completely clear,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.720
is now full of these little micro cracks
or tubes, or something like that.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.340
And I don't really know what they are.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.380
&gt;&gt; But it looks cool as heck.
&gt;&gt; It looks amazing.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.980
Well, it's open.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.540
I'm just going to drop
some copper pipes down in there.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.780
Oh, that's wild.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.380
Oh, look at that.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.880
There it goes.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.780
That' amazing.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.840
Very, very heat
conductive.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.600
Yeah, dude.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.120
The heat goes from
the liquid into the solid copper,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.660
&gt;&gt; Just that fast.
&gt;&gt; really quickly.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.800
This is really gonna be impressive.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.320
Oh, that looks amazing.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.800
That is pretty heavy.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.819
Copper is...

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.819
That was scary.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.120
Is that leaking at the bottom?

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.400
Nope, part of the ground
is made of sawdust.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.220
Got it.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.849
Hopefully, I can carry this with these tongs,

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.840
and stay close to the ground.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.060
Look out.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.540
It's very close.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.520
This rock is gonna work
as a wedge to hold our cup in.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.040
Alright.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.760
Let's go.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.120
Oh.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.260
Three, Two, One.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.200
That looked awesome.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.680
Well, it still does look awesome,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.110
but it's not exploding.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, I think we just cast something gorgeous.
&gt;&gt; There is iron melting down

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.380
through that block of ice.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.620
That is amazing.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.480
Did you see how fast it
traveled through the block?

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.640
Oh, Steve.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.540
Now, it's melted all
the way down through the bottom,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.960
and it's pouring
the boiling water out.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.080
That's, that's extraordinary.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.680
It think we're probably
safe to go in at this point.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.700
Are you
sure?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.520
No, we're pretty sure.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.960
That copper is not that hot
anymore.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.380
Wow, look at this.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.620
That poured straight through.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.160
That just destroyed that block.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.330
Not in the same way 
we were expecting but...

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.900
That is nuts.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.900
Oh, it's still encased in a block of ice.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.660
I can see what we cast in 
the ice, its just down at the bottom.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.140
We made art.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.280
Oh, that
looks awesome.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.520
That is a weird little copper ingot.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.540
It's a wicked copper worm.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.940
I'm just gonna set this
on top of our block of ice.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.560
It's still so hot.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.480
It's tunneling.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.780
Oh, that's amazing.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.360
I did not expect there
to be so much of a heat reservoir.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.520
Yeah its still melting its way through.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.560
What a surprising result.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.940
That just tore through that block of ice.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.720
Look at this. Come see on the bottom of it.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.560
You can see that it fell down,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.600
and then went sideways,
and just popped right out.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.800
So Brian, the result you were expecting?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.980
I mean, there's no
wrong answers in Science,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.540
but now I have a better question.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.750
All I want to know is how far down
would it tunnel through just a stack of ice.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.380
I mean, all the way down?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.880
That would be interesting to test.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.960
And this clear ice I have actually comes
in a block about three to four feet high.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.800
I smell a follow-up.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.000
I smell a follow-up.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.680
It would be a very good thing to test.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.960
I said that they were three
possibilities that I could think of.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.940
This is sort of one them.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.600
But even the one where I said
we would cast copper in the ice,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.000
it's not really what it did.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.660
It cast the copper and then it just decided,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.720
"Nah, I'm out of here."

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.900
And drilled its way all the way through.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.640
It's interesting.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.580
The little hints of what was
happening as it was bubbling and cooling

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.520
as it went through, but I can't believe
what a reservoir of heat it remained,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.460
even after it tunnelled
through that block of ice.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.740
Brian, our block of ice didn't explode,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.740
and I actually have a little bit of extra.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.440
Oh man, what should we do with it?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.460
Good question.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.160
Go golfing?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.660
Yeah.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.220
Three. Two. One.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.240
Yeah.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.280
That felt good.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.060
Everything hurts in my hand.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.180
That was
awesome.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.060
Three, Two One.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.980
Nice.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.280
Oh, yeah.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.680
That was great.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.340
Definitely feel the
shock up to about your elbows.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.560
Wow.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.280
&gt;&gt; That was very satisfying.
&gt;&gt; That was fantastic.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.580
Wow, look at how, this looks gorgeous.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.960
That felt great.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.080
This is art.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.860
Brian, what are you guys working
on over on The Modern Road?

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.980
We just made a perfect copy
of my co-host, Jason Murphy's face.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.840
We're making a
ballistics-gel version of his head,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.870
and we're gonna fire
projectiles point-blank at it.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.290
It's going to be amazing.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.180
I bet he's really happy that
you're using an analog of his head,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.360
and not his real head.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.530
I mean, there's a reason
I insisted he have the fun experience

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.800
of getting his face copied.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.340
Very cool.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.040
Guys, go check out
Brian's channel, The Modern Rogue.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.060
They update new videos every Friday.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.060
It's a ton of fun.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.200
Hey guys.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.320
Grant jumping back in for
just a second to remind you

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.920
we're giving away a
Nintendo Switch and Mario Kart 8.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.440
There's a link down
in the description right now.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.810
You can click and
get your name on the list.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.240
We're doing a random drawing
for subscriber appreciation.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.370
And we're also sending
you the gift receipt because

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.540
if you don't want the Nintendo,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.480
you can take it back
and get the cash instead.
