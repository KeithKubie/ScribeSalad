00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.840
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.500
think about how we can take
the derivative of an expression

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.900
that can be viewed as a
product not of two functions

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.990
but of three functions.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.750
And we're going to
do it using what

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.202
we know of the product rule.

00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:12.660
And the way we
could think about it

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.730
is we can view this as
the product, first, of two

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.530
functions, of this
function here and then

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.220
that function over there.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.960
And then separately
take the derivative.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.430
So if we just view the
standard product rule,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.340
it tells us that the
derivative of this thing

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.880
will be equal to
the derivative of f

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.720
of x-- let me close it with a
white bracket-- times the rest

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.480
of the function.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.435
So times g of x--
let me close it

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:53.600
with the-- times g of x
times h of x times plus just

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.230
f of x times the
derivative of this thing.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.320
Times the derivative
with respect

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.713
to x of g of x times h of x.

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:15.070
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.010
But what is this thing right
over here going to be equal?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.380
Well we can apply the
product rule again.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.660
So here, I'm just focusing
on this part right over here.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.400
The derivative of
this is just going

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:39.440
to be g prime of x
times h of x plus g

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.610
of x times the derivative
of h, times h prime of x.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.020
So everything that
we had the derivative

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.570
of g of x times h of x is
this stuff right over here.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.960
And so we're going to
multiply that times f of x.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.120
So let's rewrite all
of this stuff here.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.250
So this first term right
over here we can rewrite.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.760
So all of this is going to be
equal to f prime of x-- that's

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.650
that right over
there-- times g of x

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.930
times h of x plus--
And now we're

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.380
going to distribute this f of x.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.520
So it's f of x times this
plus f of x times this.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.590
So f of x times this is f
of x times g prime of x,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.595
the derivative of g, g
prime of x, times h of x.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.290
Let me do that in
that white color.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.010
And then finally,
f of x times this

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:53.780
is just f of x times g
of x times h prime of x.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.609
And this was a
pretty neat result.

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.650
Essentially, we can view
this as the product rule

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.360
where we have three,
where we could

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.090
have our expression viewed as
a product of three functions.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.880
Now we have three terms.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.230
In each of these terms, we
take a derivative of one

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.630
of the functions and
not the other two.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.210
Here we took the
derivative of f.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.920
Here we took the
derivative of g.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.439
Here we took the
derivative of h.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.980
And you can imagine, if you had
the product of four functions

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.340
here, you would have four terms.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.300
In each of them you'd be
taking a derivative of one

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.008
of the functions.

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.910
If you had n
functions here, then

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.360
you would have n terms here.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.180
And in each of them you would
take the derivative of one

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.920
of the functions.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.480
So this is kind
of a neat result.
