1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.420
Elite athletes.
How many of them actually want to fight?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.130
Who's the most elite athletes in the UFC?
I think y'all Romero.
Yes.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.550
100% and he's a wrestler.
Cuba and Cuban.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.260
It's either boxing or wrestling.
Yeah,
but remember you.
Al Romero is a freak in.

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:21.070
So amazing because he came to MMA at what?
35 yeah.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.710
30 oh zero is going to be 62 years old.
Walking on the beach with a Dick,

7
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.220
like a fucking Quaker oats box.
Hey,

8
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.750
between his direct dude,
he's fighting a fucking homeboy.

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470
The other Diana's Paula Costa.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.630
Eddie Bravo that says the fucking tweet that day.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.170
What did he say?
He just sent it to the list,
but it's hilarious.

12
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:48.760
Some private shit.
I didn't make that.

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.140
It was,
I mean you don't mind me than I know,

14
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:54.870
but still we got a little room to Jamie right now.
It's fucking great.

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.000
I just make the meme up.
Who is this guy?
You never take JW Kaiser.

16
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.610
I don't do meetings.
He some guy's about to get fucked up.

17
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:06.160
Brian don't need to download his information.
Yeah,
the guy coming up.

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.220
Jack Swagger's the guy you should probably take notice.
Okay.
I'm not happy.

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.910
I'm not mad at the bell tour.
Girls not mad at all,
dude.

20
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:15.450
Mercedes not mad at at all.
My,
yeah.
Wow.

21
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.940
Paula Costa and your Yoel Romero for sure have the best body

22
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.540
pulling another pound.
Yeah,

23
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.700
but Luke Rockhold is longer and thinner is beautiful and all that bottle is

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.760
beautiful,
but there's a big difference.
He doesn't want the gorilla look at this.

25
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.940
[inaudible]

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.940
it's a fucking great.
Eddie said that just today.
We're fun outright.
No,

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.050
but she said [inaudible] not make that didn't make it fucking with it.

28
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.880
I agree with it.
I sent it
to the UFC.

29
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.980
I agree with it.

30
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.410
I don't even want to know what to say right now.
I'm fucking,

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
let me say that Shit.
You stay up there.
I'm trying to get fired.

32
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.340
[inaudible] call me in this week to do fucking the breakdown.

33
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.890
Shit.
Fight breakdowns.

34
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.850
I think you shot a test tube and I think that you've got a belt or tattoo in his

35
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:19.530
back.
Oh shit he does.
