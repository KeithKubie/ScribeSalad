EVAN RAPOPORT: Hello everyone.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.550
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.870
We are going to go over
the Views from Everywhere,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.660
how we're bringing the world's
largest photo library to you,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.110
our developers, and to
those of you who have not

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.360
stayed at the World Cup to
watch the last few minutes.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.870
So thank you for coming.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.840
I'm Evan Rapoport.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.340
I'm a product manager on the
Street View in Google Maps

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.030
team.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.500
And this is Luc Vincent,
engineering director

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.130
for Street View and
trekker extraordinaire.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.110
So I used to live in Hawaii,
and we had this great tradition

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.407
back here that I'm trying
to bring everywhere I go,

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.740
especially when it's cold--
even though it's summer here

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.980
in San Francisco.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.870
And that was where as a
speaker, I would say "Aloha,"

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.650
and the entire room
would scream back

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.150
"Aloha" with this
vigor that made

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.990
you feel like it
was 80 degrees out.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.580
And kids did this really well.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.910
I used to teach in schools,
and everyone really enjoyed it,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.910
and it was a lot of fun.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.640
So we're going to
do it right now,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.056
and we're going to try to make
sure it feels a little warm

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:05.160
here in San Francisco.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.540
So, aloha!

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.999
AUDIENCE: Aloha.

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:09.040
EVAN RAPOPORT: Wonderful.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.510
Ah, every time, I love it.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.260
Thank you so much.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.180
I really appreciate that.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.454
So today this is what
we're going to go over.

00:01:15.454 --> 00:01:17.870
We're going to talk about how
over the last several years,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.910
we've been creating the world's
largest geolocated photo

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.210
library through our efforts
in Street View in Google Maps.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.950
We're going to talk about
how you can add your imagery,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.617
just in case we've missed places
that you really care about.

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:31.200
And then we're going
to talk about how

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340
you can access all this
data, including your own,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.580
using our APIs and our viewers,
all at Google-scale serving.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.760
So why are we doing this?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.845
I hate to be cheesy,
but it's kind of-- it's

00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:46.720
this beautiful world
out there, and we really

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.250
want to help you explore it.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.660
We really feel, at
the Google Maps team,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.500
that it's our opportunity,
and it's actually

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620
almost are our
mandate, to make sure

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.700
that you have better real-world
experiences as you travel,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.730
as you make local decisions,
as you go somewhere

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.660
on the weekend.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.620
And so we really want
to be the team that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.139
can help you have better
experiences in the real world.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.690
And we care so
much about photos--

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.090
as you can tell by one of
the world's largest cameras

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.010
sitting next to me-- that we
believe photos can inspire us.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.280
We see photos like this and it
says, hey, I want to go there.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.130
Where is that?

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.020
Who hasn't seen that in
a post on social media?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.960
Where was that photo?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960
I want to go there.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.940
This happens to be the
Sydney Harbour Bridge,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.810
and I wouldn't suggest
hiking to the top

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.130
during a lightning storm.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.870
But these are the kind of
things that inspire us.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.490
We see a photo like this and
we say, hey, to your family,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.640
let's go on a safari.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.620
Let's travel the world.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.300
Photos have this
opportunity to inspire us.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.320
And when they're on maps, it
tells us exactly where they are

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.470
and where we can go.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.200
And we're really
excited about this.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.612
So without further ado,
I'd like to pass it over

00:02:51.612 --> 00:02:54.070
to Luc to talk about what we've
been doing with Street View

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.500
to bring you imagery
all over the world.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.704
LUC VINCENT: Thanks, Evan.

00:02:57.704 --> 00:02:59.870
This is me in this picture
wearing this contraption,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.767
and this is me wearing
it right now live.

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:02.850
I love wearing this thing.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.130
We'll tell you more
about it later.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.400
What is our mission
in this team?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.570
We would like to bring
imagery to our users,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.350
our billions of
users, everywhere.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.900
And we want to collect it,
organize it, make it useful.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.180
Our guiding principle really
is to be comprehensive,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.340
be everywhere, be useful,
obviously, and be accurate.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.004
Imagery that we collect
around the world

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:28.420
should be well
geolocated in order

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.990
to be useful in our products.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.756
So this is our mission.

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.380
And I will tell you a little bit
about how we're going about it

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.650
and how we want make it
useful not just to our users

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.940
but to developers worldwide.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.370
So how do we go about
collecting this imagery?

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.510
Well, as you probably
well know, we

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.020
have already satellite
imagery that we've

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.240
had in our products
for about a decade.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.080
And this imagery is,
in fact, very accurate.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.700
Even the clouds are accurate.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.790
If you use the new Google Maps,
the cloud cover is real-time.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.090
Zooming in further,
we have also collected

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.740
and we are actively pursuing
collection of aerial imagery

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.450
around the world.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.180
And we use this oblique
imagery to create 3D cities, so

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.020
3D models of urban
areas around the world.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.410
We have hundreds of them now,
also making a map more useful.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.260
You can see here
one of the stadiums

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.400
we collected in Brazil
for the World Cup.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.260
We have all of them, I believe,
collected in 3D [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.830
And zooming even further, you
will see a familiar area here,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.540
the Bay Area.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.080
And in the new
Google Maps, we have

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.230
made imagery much
more prominent.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.160
We have what we call
the runway, which

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.170
is this bar of pictures at the
bottom, which shows you imagery

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.090
that's most relevant
to your current view.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.615
Imagery that's meant to be
useful and representative

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:49.920
of what you're
interested in looking at.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.790
We have imagery,
as you may notice,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.992
from-- we have
photos from users.

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:55.450
Photo spheres--
and I will tell you

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.200
more about photo
spheres in a minute.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.870
We also have a lot
of street imagery.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.520
Street View remains the largest
corpus of geolocated photos

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.610
that we have in
our maps, and it's

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.350
something we've been working
on for almost a decade.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.750
So speaking of Street View,
let me tell you a little bit

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.030
about how we got started
with this crazy mission, what

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.760
we're doing about it
today, and then we'll

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.045
talk about our sort of expanding
community efforts in the Street

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:25.160
View space.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.680
So Street View started
actually over a decade ago.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.820
It was an idea by
our CEO, Larry Page,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.480
who felt really that
street-level imagery should

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.940
be useful to our users.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.280
And he really wanted
to make [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.050
accessible and useful.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.510
So he himself collected imagery
using a camcorder in the Bay

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.620
Area and used the
footage he collected

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.290
to bootstrap research, early on
at Stanford University and then

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.410
at Google.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.122
And in 2005, a group of
googlers, which I was part of,

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:58.330
decided it was really time
to do something about this

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.860
and to make this real.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.290
So we developed a bunch of
computer visual algorithms

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.590
and built a platform
to collect imagery.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.930
You see here in 2006,
we built these very

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.320
large and crazy-looking vans
full of cameras and equipment,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.590
which we sort of took around
the US-- in the Bay Area,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.080
in particular-- and
collected imagery.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.850
Enough imagery, and we were
able to process it enough,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.350
to actually launch a product.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.060
We launched Street View
in 2007 in Google Maps

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.300
in first five cities.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.890
And there was so much
interest and sort of traffic,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.850
we couldn't believe it.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.433
So we thought we had
something useful,

00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:37.000
and so we worked hard to grow
this product and scale it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.410
So you see here, over the
course of 2007 through 2008,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.380
we actually expanded
our coverage in the US.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.637
This is coverage
expanding rapidly here.

00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:48.720
And then we essentially
expanded the whole product

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.980
around the world,
and we're still

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.392
busy doing this right now.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:54.850
In the process of
doing this, we've

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.370
hit just about any kind
of issue you may imagine.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.500
Unique problems
happened at scale.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.440
For example, this one.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.810
This is co collected imagery
in the Amazon, in Brazil,

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.720
and frogs jumping on the camera.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.380
How many of you
here, photographers,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.540
have had frogs jump
on your camera?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.880
Not very many, right?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.674
So we've had that.

00:07:12.674 --> 00:07:14.590
We've had other encounters
with other animals,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.330
like donkeys in some parts
of the world, what have you.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.490
So anything can happen,
and has happened.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.320
So we've learned in the process.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.790
We've refined our processes.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.956
We've refined our algorithm.

00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:26.100
We've refined our cars,
our approach to it.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.020
And you know, today
we're very proud to have

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.860
build a really global platform
for imagery collection.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.875
This is our latest car.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:33.250
You've probably
seen them roaming

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.230
the Bay Area and
wherever you live.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:40.320
We have them in lots of places,
and we're busy expanding.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.660
In fact, we have realized,
not that long ago,

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.250
that you couldn't just do this
only with cars, obviously.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.890
The most beautiful
parts of the world

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.250
are not accessible by cars.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.230
Imagine castles, parks, museums.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.950
So we've built a
variety of platforms

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.690
derived from the
Street View car.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.790
You see we have
put it on a boat.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.740
We have designed
this tricycle that

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.320
can be mounted on various
other parts, like on a train,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.690
or it can be used by itself,
like here at Stonehenge.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.394
We have also a snowmobile.

00:08:10.394 --> 00:08:12.560
And we even have a partner
called the Catlin Seaview

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.730
Survey that's built a rig that
goes underwater to capture

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.690
coral reefs, and
they use our platform

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.670
to publish the imagery.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.800
We started launching
these special collections

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.440
of unique heritage
sites a few years ago,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.145
and when we launched
Pompeii-- as you see here

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:36.465
on the left in this picture--
the Italian heritage

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:37.840
authorities actually
told us they

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.870
had noticed an increase
in foot traffic

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.260
to Pompeii, 25% increase.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.530
And we've noticed similar
kind of increased traffic

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.520
in some museums.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.250
So we take this as
sort of evidence

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.440
that our imagery is not
just for couch potatoes.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.000
It's imagery that not just
lets you travel virtually,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.680
but inspires you to travel
physically and go to places

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.760
and explore the world.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.700
So we're very happy about this.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.830
So more recently, we've
built this Trekker, which

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.874
I'm currently wearing,
and we've taken it also

00:09:05.874 --> 00:09:07.540
to lots of places
where you can't really

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.230
go other than by foot.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.380
Here you see we've had a group
of googlers go to the Galapagos

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.670
to capture a few of the
unique sights there.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.980
All this imagery is up in Maps.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:26.030
And also was lucky enough to
go be part of the Grand Canyon

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.500
rafting trip, where we took
these trekkers on two rafts

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.670
and captured the entire
length of the Grand Canyon.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.420
And the imagery is now
live in Street View

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.990
as well, on Google Maps.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.300
And this was really my
best business trip ever.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.320
So it's really imagery
that not everybody

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.140
would be able to
capture themselves.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.290
So we like to bring it to people
who couldn't travel there.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.230
So where are we now?

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.980
Here's our status.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.640
We have driven--
we have launched

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.810
imagery in about 56
countries-- give and take,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.570
because some countries
don't necessarily count.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.580
We have over five
million miles live,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.140
and that's about 20
times the descent

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.840
from the Earth to the moon,
to give you a reference.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.120
We have imagery on
all seven continents.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.900
So we have been busy,
and we've learned a lot.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.307
But in fact, we have
even more than that,

00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:13.890
because we recently,
a few months ago,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.680
launched what we call Street
View Time Machine, which

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.080
doesn't just let you explore a
place by moving geographically,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.402
but lets you explore in time.

00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:25.110
So we added the fourth
dimension, really,

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.230
to Street View and we help tell
the story of a place over time.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.820
If you go in Street View,
you will find lots of places

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.000
in Asia, where there's
frenetic construction.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.300
You will see the story of
construction over time.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.310
And you can explore at each sort
of time slice geographically,

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.640
as well.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.580
Sometimes, sadly, this is
also a story of destruction,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.580
like here in Japan,
following the earthquake.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.190
We have, actually,
imagery before and after.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.560
In fact, in many cases,
we found that Street View

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.920
is the only photographic record
of places before disaster,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.770
which is amazing to us.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.400
However-- so we
have done all this.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.900
We have built this
amazing platform.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.170
We have millions
of miles of imagery

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.590
captured in lots of countries.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.500
But we still need help.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.000
Why?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.625
Why is that so?

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.580
Well, turns out if you really
wanted to capture imagery

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.160
everywhere, you would
need trillions of images.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.570
We only have billions,
so we have a ways to go.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.210
In addition, we can't just
take our cars and sort

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.700
of drive everywhere
all the time, right?

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.060
We can't take our Trekkers
and sort of go everywhere.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:25.900
We need some help.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.870
We can't do it without your
community involvement, right?

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.880
And this is where I
think you guys fit in.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.479
Not only can you help us by
building amazing apps that

00:11:34.479 --> 00:11:36.520
can actually make the
imagery more useful to more

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.090
people in more contexts,
as Evan will talk about,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.160
but you can also help by
encouraging more people

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.760
to go and help collect
imagery, in ways that Evan will

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.370
talk about, and make it useful
in the content of these apps.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.600
So without further ado,
I'll pass it over to Evan,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.140
who will talk
about these efforts

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.232
and how we are hoping
to engage everybody.

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.200
Evan.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.050
EVAN RAPOPORT: Thanks, Luc.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.560
All right.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.860
So I'm really excited today
to talk to you about ways

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.550
in which you can create Street
View-like experiences yourself

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.910
and then bring them into your
apps with your own imagery

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.340
or with ours.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:16.110
So we find from user surveys
that people really just like

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.060
using Street View to
know where they're

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.470
going, to see it in advance.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.780
This is one of the top
uses that we see for it.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.020
And what more
appropriate way to do it

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.529
than this example of Walgreen's
using the Android Maps API,

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:29.570
to make sure that you know
what their store looks

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.830
like as you're driving there?

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.720
It's pretty straightforward, but
it works exactly as promised.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.900
When you're on your way
there to Walgreen's, they've

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.983
made sure that you know
what the place looks like.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.330
So who here has planned a
running route or a biking route

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.221
or a hiking route
using Street View?

00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:50.270
All right, I see a
good number of hands.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.280
So thanks to apps
like Runtastic--

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.150
which you can see out
there on the floor,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.816
if you want to go
talk to them-- they're

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:58.850
using the Android Maps API to
integrate Street View directly

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.524
into their app so
you can understand

00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:02.440
what your running route
is going to look like.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.880
Is it a place
that's safe to run?

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.300
Is it a lot of elevation?

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.120
Things like that.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.930
You can get a really
good idea of the place

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.870
and plan it, right
there in Runtastic.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.790
OK, who's ever used Street
View while you were running?

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.320
Not expecting too
many hands here.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:17.820
Good.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.910
OK, thanks to Icon
Fitness, they've

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.640
built this treadmill that
allows you to sort of virtually

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.450
run through Street View as
you're on the treadmill.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.850
It syncs to the speed
you go, and you probably

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.150
could see how this
would be a lot of fun,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.870
especially if you're in a sweaty
gym or a basement or something

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.800
like that.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.440
Using the JavaScript
Maps API they

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.950
built this Street View viewer
that syncs to your speed.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.081
And so now, unless you're
some crazy, crazy runner,

00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:43.580
I don't think you're going to
run out of Street View to see.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.454
As Luc mentioned, we
have five million miles.

00:13:45.454 --> 00:13:49.150
So start your running right now.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.200
Speaking of sort of these
virtual experiences,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.590
who here is excited
about Cardboard?

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.140
All right.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.880
I expected lots of hands there.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.400
So I love Cardboard.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.100
I'm really, really
excited about what

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.570
this is going to do to
bring virtual reality-type

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.256
experiences to everybody.

00:14:03.256 --> 00:14:05.630
All of the Street View data
that we're talking about here

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.180
is available to you
to use in Cardboard.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.400
So if you head over
to g.co/cardboard,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.726
you can learn more about that.

00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:14.100
Additionally,
we're going to talk

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.120
about photo spheres and
user-contributed panoramas,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.290
and how you can immediately
capture your own imagery

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.600
with Android, 360 panoramas,
and then put them directly

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.746
into your Cardboard apps.

00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.120
So those of you who have been
playing around with it, you

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.930
probably see a little thing
called Photo Sphere right there

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.710
in your Cardboard UI.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.440
That's a great way
and a great example

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.870
to show how you could bring
photo spheres into Cardboard.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.290
So I'm really
excited to see what

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.450
you're going to do with this.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.680
Let's see what you can do.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.710
So if we don't have
imagery where you want it,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.870
it doesn't matter how
much imagery we have.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.180
And so we've really wanted
to open up our platforms

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.050
to everyone, so I'm going to
talk about a few of those.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.270
The first is the
Trekker Loan program.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.910
As Luc is showing here,
this is the Trekker

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.540
that we have been sharing with
partners, at no cost to them,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.220
to go where they want to go.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.822
In the past with Street
View, it was always us going.

00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:06.280
So our employees would go on
these wonderful business trips

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.600
and collect spots, and if
it was raining that day,

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.730
that sucked for us.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.550
That was the day we
had film permits.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.090
With this program, we've
partnered with organizations

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.120
like travel authorities
and nonprofits

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.850
and educational groups, and been
sending our Trekkers to them,

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.259
and they go where they want
to go when they want to go.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:23.800
Because who knows
these places better

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.909
than the people who actually
live and love these locations?

00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:28.450
And so our first
partner we announced

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.650
last year was the Hawaii
Visitors and Conventions

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.151
Bureau.

00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:33.441
And they went and they hiked
the most of the Big Island

00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.030
and all of the
hiking trails there,

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.617
and now they're doing
the same thing on Oahu.

00:15:38.617 --> 00:15:40.200
Here's an example
of imagery that they

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.210
collected in Volcanoes
National Park.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.110
You can now walk through
an active volcano virtually

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.140
in Street View.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.580
Again, they've done this
all at no cost to them.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.000
We gave them the Trekker.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.750
We gave them a bunch
of FedEx envelopes.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.454
They just mailed
disks back to us.

00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:55.120
And we just keep it
going, and they just

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.449
keep going on trekking.

00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:58.240
It's a really wonderful
program, and if you

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.200
work with any travel
groups or anyone who

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.310
would be interested
in the Trekker,

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.250
I encourage you to
go check that out.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.870
Here's a great
example of closing

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.480
the loop of how the Hawaii
Visitors and Conventions

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.860
Bureau launched all this data
directly in their website,

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.910
using the JavaScript Maps API,
so that when you're planning

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.280
your trip on gohawaii.com, you
can actually see this Trekker

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.815
imagery.

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:22.190
So again, they
collected it, they

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.850
went where they wanted to
go, and they published it.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.500
We host it and we serve it,
and it's available to them

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.530
through the API.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.900
It's a really great
way to plan your trip.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.460
So if you're interested,
there's the URL, g.co/trekker.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.300
Sign up.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.340
Again, we're looking
for people that

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.964
are like tourism groups,
non-profits, companies--

00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:44.130
people that could get film
permits for the locations

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.210
that they want to go.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.580
We're really excited to
talk to you more about that.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.270
If you have indoor places
that you care a lot about,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.330
Trekker doesn't really
work too well indoors.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.970
And so we have a program
called Google Business View.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.500
What this does is lets
you go into restaurants

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.930
and small businesses and hotels
and things like that, all

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.819
around the world, and with
trusted photographers who we've

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.630
worked with, they can go
into these businesses.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.960
They sell their services and
they create virtual tours

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.000
for these restaurants
and businesses.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.520
We've seen a huge amount of
success with this program.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.560
People are really
excited about it.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.220
And we've been growing this
program really, really quickly.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.250
So again, all of this
data goes into Google Maps

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:29.000
and becomes available to you
developers as part of our APIs.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.740
Additionally, the imagery is
really high-quality and very,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.790
very consistent, because these
are trusted partners or trusted

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.960
photographers.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.540
And so we've made
it very prominent,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.930
right there in Google Maps.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:43.270
So you'll see a See Inside
label on some of this imagery,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.980
and you can just click right
in and go right into that.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.470
And it's also really
prominent on Google Search.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.780
So if you want this
beautiful search listing,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.160
this is a great way for your
clients, for your businesses,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160
to ensure that you have this
really beautiful listing there.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.380
And the click-through
rate is very, very high

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.600
on that imagery, as
you might imagine.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.256
Here's the URL where you can
find out more about this.

00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:06.880
Again, this talk is
all being recorded.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.470
You could go back
to those later.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.178
But just search for
Google Business View.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.770
All right.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.260
So who knows Photo Sphere?

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:17.820
All right.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.270
I expected this audience would
be a big round of applause.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.770
Come on.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.834
No, just kidding.

00:18:22.834 --> 00:18:24.125
LUC VINCENT: Yay, Photo Sphere.

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:24.600
EVAN RAPOPORT: Woo-hoo!

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.910
I love Photo Sphere.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.420
I spin in circles all the
time, capturing photo spheres.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.580
You can ask my wife.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.030
So Photo Sphere started
off a couple years

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.530
ago with the Android team,
where we launched on the Nexus 4

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:39.170
and we created this way to make
Street View-like imagery as

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.300
easy as possible.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.110
You just simply
held up your phone

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.090
and spun around
and captured 360s,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.930
just like you've
seen in Street View.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.640
We've since grown a lot more.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.140
And just recently, we announced
the Google Camera app,

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.220
available for KitKat.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.460
Who's got the Google Camera app?

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:54.990
All right.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.740
Everyone should get
the Google Camera app.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.281
It's really, really cool, and
if that's not the sexiest URL--

00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:01.200
g.co/camera-- I
don't know what is.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.690
So go get that app.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.740
And in that, you can create
50-megapixel photo spheres.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.050
Street View is
about 75 megapixels,

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.560
so we're getting up
there with Photo Sphere.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.520
Again, all of this done
right there with your phone.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.270
We've built a viewer for photo
spheres into Play Services.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.770
So as Sundar
mentioned yesterday,

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.320
well over 90% of users
can get these viewers

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.730
and can see photo spheres.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.790
And there's an API for you to
hook up to that in your app.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.450
And we've created
an open metadata

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.730
standard for Photo Sphere.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.200
We've seen that panoramas
were just not growing

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.490
at the rate in the world
that we knew that they could,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.710
and so we created an open
standard, which I'll talk about

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.210
in a minute.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.840
So 50 megapixels, that's big.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.420
But I just want to give you
a really clear understanding.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.060
So that's the photo
sphere, and there's

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.840
the zoom-in of the detail that
you can get with these images.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.280
Again, all this captured with
my Nexus 5, no post processing

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.310
or anything like that.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.490
Uh, I'm from Hawaii.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.610
Come on, I had to show a
little bit of eye candy.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.202
This is a morning in Waikiki.

00:20:01.202 --> 00:20:02.410
I captured this photo sphere.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.427
This is now available
on Google Maps.

00:20:05.427 --> 00:20:08.010
And if you come down to Mountain
View and you're on our campus

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.440
there at Google, you can see
some amazing places like this.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.340
Again, Photo Sphere
can work well indoors.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.970
Just a little bit of practice
keeping the phone close to you,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.520
and we can create these really
amazing indoor panoramas

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.130
and experiences that you can
use in your apps and published

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.820
maps.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.650
So I mentioned the
metadata standard.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.380
This is a really
important thing for us,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.870
and it's been a huge success.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.050
We didn't want this to just
be a closed thing, where

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.670
photo sphere was something that
only Google Apps can create,

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.910
so we made it open.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.100
And as a result, we've
seen some of the world's

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.400
top panoramic stitching
softwares adopt this standard.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.910
So when you save out an
image from this software,

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.210
it'll have the photo
sphere metadata in this.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.390
It uses Adobe's XMP, which
is kind of similar to Exif,

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.800
but it's XML-based and it's
very easy to understand.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.970
Its human-readable.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.020
And you can use
this in your images,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.500
and that way they'll work
on Google+, on Google Maps,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.990
on Street View on Android, on
all the Google products that

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.760
support it.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.740
So we've also seen the
one click 360 cameras,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.652
like the Ricoh Theta if
anyone has seen Ricoh Theta.

00:21:06.652 --> 00:21:07.610
Who's seen Ricoh Theta?

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.862
I'm just kind of curious.

00:21:08.862 --> 00:21:10.820
All right, this is a
really cool little device.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.682
I see even one over there.

00:21:12.682 --> 00:21:13.390
You hold this up.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.720
You take a picture.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.290
It has two fish-eye
lenses and it

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.640
captures the entire
scene in one click.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.530
It's a really,
really cool device.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.120
And it uses the Photo
Sphere metadata,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.947
so you can add those
directly to Google Maps.

00:21:24.947 --> 00:21:27.530
And I run around like this with
these over my head and capture

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.310
pictures while my
wife goes like this.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.250
And then there's a number
of these devices coming out

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.840
on Kickstarter soon, or
that are on Kickstarter,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.050
that you may have seen, that
are launching this year.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.260
These are, again,
one-click 360 cameras

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.270
that are going to create
Street View experiences

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.740
and have used the Photo
Sphere metadata standard.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.024
So really exciting
year for all of us

00:21:47.024 --> 00:21:48.190
that are excited about 360s.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.570
We also had a great
collaboration with the Auto

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:54.980
Awesome team in Google+.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.670
So if you don't know how to
add metadata into JPEGs--

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.400
and let's face it, most of
us don't-- just upload these

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.640
images to Google+.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.300
It recognizes that
it's a 2x1 panorama.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.160
It notices that the edges are
kind of matching each other.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.720
And it'll Auto Awesome and give
you back a copy of your image

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.390
with the metadata in it,
that you can immediately put

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.385
into Google Maps or
share on Google+.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.920
So let's talk a little bit
about how we can actually

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.599
get Photo Sphere
into your products.

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:25.390
I want to dive into
some code really quick,

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.140
so I'll talk about how
to actually publish

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.049
to Maps in a minute.

00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:30.340
But let's talk about how to
actually just get these in.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.270
So iframe, not really
that much code.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.800
That's pretty simple.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.300
But I had to start
somewhere, right?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.250
So we have an embeddable viewer.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.680
If you go to Views, which
is a product I'll talk about

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.120
in a minute, you can simply copy
and paste this HTML snippet,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.640
put it right into your
apps or your products,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.480
and you'll be able to view
photo spheres right there.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.700
It uses the same Street
View viewer that we have,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.510
so it's very robust.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.560
And we have no usage
limits for this.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.927
You can customize your
presentation of the image.

00:22:57.927 --> 00:22:59.510
You can tweak
parameters and all that.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.010
And it's a really
great and easy way

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:05.497
to put photo spheres
into your websites.

00:23:05.497 --> 00:23:06.830
All right, a little bit of code.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.350
I wish I could make it
more complicated for you,

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.630
but it's just not complicated.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.300
So it's very, very simple.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.180
If you're familiar with the
JavaScript API for Maps,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.370
there is a Street
View object in there.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.110
And usually you just set
the latitude and longitude

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.770
as to where you want
the Street View panorama

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.130
and we give you the nearest one.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.850
Well, in the case
of Photo Sphere,

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.340
you actually know the
exact image that you want.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.620
And so there's a
property called pano,

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.580
and you just tell
it the panorama ID

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.250
that you're interested in--
which that iframe code that I

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.250
just showed you about has
in it, so you can just

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.990
copy and paste those out.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.870
And then we'll give you
back your photo sphere

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:42.760
directly there.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.980
It's really just that easy.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.270
There's not much more to say.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.270
You could build a gallery
with Photo Sphere,

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.280
using this very, very easily.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.420
On Android, it's
again the same thing.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.140
Instead of specifying
a lat/long,

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.080
you see I have a pano ID
field or a variable there.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.390
That's all you do.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.070
So specify that pano,
and we'll give you

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.450
back that image instead of
the nearest Street View one.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.740
So very, very easy
for you to go,

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.580
with Android, capturing
panoramas and then putting them

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.920
directly back into
your Android app

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.190
without even having to go to a
desktop, if you don't want to.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.960
So I mentioned Views.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.750
Views is a community we created
to make this easier and easier

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.690
for you to publish
panoramas to the web

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.630
and create your Street
View experiences.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.980
So g.co/views, you
can go check that out.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.250
And this is a place
that brings together

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.440
all of our great Street
View special collections

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.260
and our Trekker collections,
but then also content from you.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.170
And then that content
gets shown on Google Maps.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.790
So it's really exciting for us
that when you look at a place

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.170
here, like Half Dome, and
you see all the Street View

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:51.680
paths winding their
way through Yosemite,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.360
the leftmost image there,
the top-ranked image,

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.630
actually happens to be from a
user, and it's a photo sphere.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.590
You'll see only one
Street View panorama

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.710
on this but lots of
user-contributed content.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.600
We've made this content
really, really highly promoted

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.364
because we think it's
the most interesting

00:25:07.364 --> 00:25:08.280
and the most relevant.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.120
As Luc mentioned, the most
amazing things in the world

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.780
usually aren't
seen from the road,

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.560
and so you're able to
contribute these images.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.780
And how cool is it to
have the canonical view

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.510
of Half Dome in Google
Maps be your image?

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.360
I think that's just a
really neat experience,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.810
as a photographer, I guess.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.900
So back to Views.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.040
Views is a place that,
like Google Maps,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.050
lets you browse over an area
that you're interested in

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.320
and see all the
top-ranked imagery there.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.420
So we're looking
at Las Vegas here

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.240
because I was recently
there for a talk.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.160
And all the images
on the right really

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.190
just do match up
to the top spots

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.980
that you would see
around Las Vegas.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.760
We also have a Top Photographers
list at the top of the site,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.750
so you can find
all the people who

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.540
are really active contributors.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.090
And hey, if you're looking to
hire a photographer in a spot,

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.480
this is a great way to find
some photographers, too.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.760
In Views, we also give
you a profile page,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.730
so sort of like a gallery
of your own imagery.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.200
And I really love this.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.620
This is mine, and it
just has all the images

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.577
that I've been capturing
over the last year or so.

00:26:11.577 --> 00:26:13.410
I travel quite a bit
for work, and so you'll

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.860
see a lot of red dots on my map.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.040
This is basically
showcasing my travels.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.750
And I use this
pretty regularly when

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.800
friends ask me, like, what
should I do in Hawaii?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.510
Or what hike should
I do this weekend?

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.477
I actually find the spots
there and then I send that off,

00:26:27.477 --> 00:26:29.560
and I say, great, these
are all the photos spheres

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.979
that I've taken in that spot.

00:26:30.979 --> 00:26:32.770
These would be my
recommendations of places

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.790
that you should see.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.700
It's really helpful.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.320
I'm sure you could
find ways to think

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.440
of how this would be relevant
to your business or your users.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.090
But we know that Photo Sphere
isn't fully Street View yet,

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.590
right?

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.580
It's about connected
experiences, not

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.720
singular one-panorama images.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.990
And so last year in December,
we announced a feature

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.990
that lets you take a bunch
of dots and connect them,

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.070
because it's really
just that easy.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:02.050
So you just dive into
this experience here

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.770
and you connect the dots.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:04.979
That's what Street View is.

00:27:04.979 --> 00:27:06.020
It's connecting the dots.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.650
You fix the locations
a little bit.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.130
You rotate the images
if their compass heading

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.330
wasn't quite on.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.930
And then you go ahead
and you publish that.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:18.890
It's basically from
your phone to this tool,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.982
and then right back
out to Street View.

00:27:20.982 --> 00:27:22.690
It's a very, very
quick and easy process.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.939
You could do the Moscone
Center by the end of the day,

00:27:24.939 --> 00:27:26.030
if you really wanted to.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.440
And if you do, come let me know.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.360
I'll get you a T-shirt.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.230
So everyone does things
for t-shirts, it seems.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.700
So we're really excited
about this, and as a result,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.070
we've seen some amazing things
coming in from our users.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.480
This is a great
user up in Montreal

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.340
who went out in
the freezing cold

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.720
and documented his local
park with 400 panoramas

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.750
in the freezing cold--
as his hands were

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.900
like, you know, barely kind
of able to open anymore--

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.600
and documented the entire
park and published it

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.510
to Google Maps.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.810
And now this experience
is there for all of you

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.540
to use in your apps,
to explore or to look.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.290
And it's just this
pride in the place

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.860
that you live that really drove
him to go out and do that.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.290
So I challenge you to go
out there and find places

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.240
that you care about and
document those, too.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.921
So we've spoken a lot
about how to do things,

00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:19.420
and we've talked a lot about
why you would do it-- you know,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.740
to inspire people to
travel and to help

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.960
them make good decisions.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.460
So I also want to talk a little
bit strategically about some

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.660
of the benefits that this has
for you and for your clients.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.779
So who puts photos
on social media?

00:28:32.779 --> 00:28:34.070
I don't even need to see hands.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.460
That's probably everybody.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.391
So we all put photos
up there, and then we

00:28:38.391 --> 00:28:40.640
know that everyone's going
to see it right now, right?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.800
You publish this photo,
you get lots of engagement

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.350
immediately over a few
minutes, maybe a few hours--

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.160
maybe even a few days,
if you're really popular.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.120
When you put photos
on Google Maps,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.026
people are not going
to see it immediately

00:28:52.026 --> 00:28:53.400
at this really,
really high rate.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.380
What they're in
fact going to see

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.550
is when it's relevant
to them-- when they're

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.010
planning trips, when they're
thinking about travel, when

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.860
they're dreaming of
their next vacation.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.570
And so if that's
important to you,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.220
this is exactly what you
need to be thinking about.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.410
This is where people
go to plan these trips.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.720
They probably don't go look
at a social media channel

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.220
to think about a vacation.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.810
And even the most beautiful
photo you see right there

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.660
might not be actually
the right time for them

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.740
to be thinking about a trip.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.650
And so I like to
think of it this way.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.920
This is a graph--
there's no numbers on it,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.624
it's a concept-- of
total views over time,

00:29:27.624 --> 00:29:29.790
of thinking about how many
views your photo is going

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.240
to get over time and
what kind of engagement

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.390
you're going to expect.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.030
In social media, again, you
get these great spikes and this

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.880
is a really amazing way to get
your message out right now.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.790
Definitely, do that.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.240
It's really, really valuable.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.890
But what we've seen, and as
the data starts to show--

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.550
and I'll show you some data
in a minute-- over time

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.360
you're going to get far more
engagement for relevant places

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.280
and interesting places
when you publish

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.630
content in a
maps-based environment.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.220
Because again, it's
constantly relevant to people

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.510
over and over and over
again throughout time,

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.170
as long as that
place continues to be

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.190
a place that people
are looking at.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.620
Again, Google Maps
has a billion users.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.590
A billion users are going
to see these places.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.240
And so I'm suspecting this
is a skeptical audience that

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.277
wants some data, so let's
show a little bit of data

00:30:15.277 --> 00:30:16.860
just to show how
this has been working

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.080
in the wild for
some of our users.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.970
So here's a user, really
talented panoramic photographer

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.390
who travels the world.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.810
And look at the
type of engagement

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.200
that he's getting here.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.730
In just less than a year, he's
gotten almost six million views

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.520
of the content that he's
published via Google Maps.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.965
But what's even more interesting
is that he only has a few

00:30:35.965 --> 00:30:38.620
hundred followers in
his Google+ Circles.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.510
He's not a celebrity.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.550
He's just an amazing
photographer.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.380
And his work is getting out
there and it's helping people.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.130
Think of that six
million not just as

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.660
six million views, but
six million opportunities

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.640
to inspire someone
to go to a spot

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.890
or to virtually explore a place.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.720
He's getting all
this engagement not

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.597
through social media strategies
or marketing strategies

00:30:57.597 --> 00:30:59.430
or anything like that,
but just by traveling

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.450
to interesting
places and publishing

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:04.040
really useful imagery.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.510
Here's another example.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.982
This is an agency
down in Australia

00:31:06.982 --> 00:31:08.690
that's been traveling
the world, and they

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.940
do lots of panoramic
photography.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.810
They do development
work for clients.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.430
And in just three months-- they
came to me a couple months ago

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.890
and asked what to do,
and I just said, well,

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.080
publish your imagery.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.230
In just three months,
they've built up

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.400
over three million
views on their content.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.780
They have amazing content.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.500
It's really, really beautiful.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.180
And you can see that, again,
they have under 100 followers

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.370
in their Google+ Circles.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.104
This is just really
a type of engagement

00:31:34.104 --> 00:31:35.520
that we don't tend
to think about,

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.200
but they're publishing
content in places

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.920
that matter, in places
that people really look at.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.820
And their tour of
the Eiffel Tower

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.070
is just one of the most
beautiful ones I've ever seen.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.610
So again, really, really
good success story here.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.280
So to get started with
Views, g.co/views.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.720
We've been at this for a while.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.440
We have some really, really
exciting announcements

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.230
coming up in the next few months
that I can't talk about today.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.040
But trust me, you want to follow
along and see what we're doing.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.870
It's going to be a really
fun year for Views.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:06.370
All right.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.800
So to summarize,
today what we've

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.230
shown you is how we've been
collecting the world's largest

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.570
geolocated photo library
using Street View and all

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.996
of our different
products, like Trekker.

00:32:16.996 --> 00:32:18.870
But most importantly,
I think, for this group

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.440
is that when we don't have the
places that you care about,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.630
we've enabled you to collect the
imagery of the places you want

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.120
and to publish it on Google
Maps for everyone to see.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.740
And then for you to use in
your apps and your websites,

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.020
and use all the same APIs
that you know and are

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.590
familiar with for Street
View, but with photo

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.170
spheres and your own content.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.820
And again, why
are we doing this?

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.680
It's really just about
helping everybody

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.030
have an amazing experience
in the real world.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.520
We want to inspire
you to travel,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.680
to see different places.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.810
This happens to be my
favorite place on the planet,

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.750
right there in Hawaii.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.600
And I think that we
have this opportunity

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.680
with imagery and with
maps to help people

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.460
have better real-world
experiences.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.320
We need your help.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.790
We can't do this all ourselves.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.640
People have unique
approaches to how

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.434
they start their experiences
for traveling or for dreaming,

00:33:06.434 --> 00:33:07.850
and that's where
you guys come in.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.450
So we welcome you
to use this imagery,

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.230
to let us know if we're not
providing the right hooks

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.840
and APIs for you to
accomplish what you want.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.770
And I'm really excited to
see what you're going to do.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.550
So thank you very much.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.277
You can learn more about
these products at those URLs.

00:33:24.277 --> 00:33:25.610
I'll leave that up for a minute.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.800
And if you want to give
feedback on the talk,

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.130
that's the QR code.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.570
And we'll take questions
for five, ten minutes.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:32.180
Thank you.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:38.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.420
So if you want to ask
questions, come up to the mic.

00:33:44.314 --> 00:33:44.980
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.935
Hey, Evan, I've actually been
a Google Trusted Photographer

00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:52.750
since 2012 in the Netherlands.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.450
And that lead actually to me
going into the development

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.970
and working with the virtual
tours from Google Maps Business

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.730
View.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.760
So I'm the founder of
TourDash, and we really

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.100
work with all of the imagery
that the Trusted Photographers

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.060
create.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.186
And one of the biggest things
that we run into-- my voice

00:34:09.186 --> 00:34:09.810
keeps dropping.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.560
Sorry.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.310
One of biggest things
that we run into

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.679
is that the Street
View API is not

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.010
as well-supported
on a mobile device

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.412
outside of an application.

00:34:19.412 --> 00:34:21.120
So if you're looking
at the virtual tours

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.040
from within even the
Google Chrome browser

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.179
or any of the other
default browsers,

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:31.424
you're really experiencing
a sub-par virtual tour.

00:34:31.424 --> 00:34:32.840
EVAN RAPOPORT:
Yeah, we're working

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.420
on a better viewer, which
we'll be rolling out soon,

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.700
that will work on mobile web.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.700
AUDIENCE: And I can get
that in black-and-white?

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:39.614
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:39.614 --> 00:34:41.530
EVAN RAPOPORT: I'll give
you it in full color.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:41.880
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.460
Thank you very much.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.293
EVAN RAPOPORT: Yeah.

00:34:43.293 --> 00:34:44.342
LUC VINCENT: Thank you.

00:34:44.342 --> 00:34:45.800
EVAN RAPOPORT: Any
other questions?

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.429
Otherwise Luc and
I'll hang out here.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:49.020
LUC VINCENT: We have one more.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.500
Oh, sorry.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.900
I heard an echo.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.670
I was just curious if there
was a hardware issue, or just

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.420
a choice why there's only
pictures during the daylight,

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.065
or if there's other sensors
intended in the future for--

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.690
LUC VINCENT: For
Street View, you mean?

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:02.860
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:03.970
LUC VINCENT: So typically
we try to get pictures

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.450
when the light is
best, so only daylight.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.320
We have some pictures
of some places at night.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.240
Like we have some Las Vegas,
and some places in New York.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.850
But typically, we don't do that.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.210
Now with the Time Machine
layer, which I talked about,

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.286
it is actually possible
to have pictures

00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:22.160
at night and during the
day, and to have them

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.081
both in the product.

00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:25.080
AUDIENCE: So if they're
user-generated at night?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.610
LUC VINCENT: No problem.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.700
Yeah, we want that.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.390
If they are good,
they'll be surfaced.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.380
They'll be prominent.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.172
EVAN RAPOPORT: And
I think there's--

00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:32.068
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:32.068 --> 00:35:34.080
I work for a major
university, and I'm

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.130
wondering-- what you've
shown seems to be individuals

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:39.520
publishing photos
as that person.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.450
How would you recommend a major
institution publish interiors

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.470
of lots of places, pathways,
that kind of stuff?

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.340
What would we do?

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.010
EVAN RAPOPORT: So
in fact, I showed

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.710
Panedia, which was an agency.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.420
So they're an organization,
not an individual.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.410
So it works just as well for
large organizations using

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.500
a Google+ Page identity, and
you could publish that way

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.290
if you'd like.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.850
For a university, we of course
have university programs,

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.558
where we could bring
a Trekker and things

00:36:04.558 --> 00:36:07.620
like that to your university,
or the Google Business View

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.670
Photographers, as well.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.110
LUC VINCENT: But they
can do it themselves.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.200
EVAN RAPOPORT: Or you
could do it yourself.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:11.620
Yeah.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.494
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:36:12.494 --> 00:36:14.160
EVAN RAPOPORT: Yeah.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.646
So it looks like you're doing
some amazing things right now,

00:36:18.646 --> 00:36:20.395
in terms of going down
to the coral reefs,

00:36:20.395 --> 00:36:22.430
and then Trekkers
who are taking hikes.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.000
Are there particular areas
of the world that you're now

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.090
trying to tackle, or
new unknowns that you're

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.097
particularly keen
on venturing into?

00:36:31.097 --> 00:36:33.430
LUC VINCENT: I think we want
to go everywhere over time.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.096
And we try to start
with the places that

00:36:35.096 --> 00:36:37.540
are the most interesting or
most unique or most remote.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.550
So it's hard to give you
an exact list of places,

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.010
but generally, we
want to go everywhere.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.670
And I think that when we have--
so we, all these partners,

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:49.870
conducting trying to borrow the
Trekker for their own collects,

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.010
we try to prioritize this based
on what we think we need most,

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.290
or areas where we don't have
any imagery, for example.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:58.290
That's what I would say.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.020
Evan, I think--

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.570
EVAN RAPOPORT: And we're
seeing users, photographers,

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.090
businesses all over the world
publishing on their own.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.401
So I think when we say
we want to go everywhere,

00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:08.650
like, Luc and I would love
to go on all these travels,

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.000
and so if you have a
great place, let us know.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.340
But the reality is we can't
go everywhere ourselves,

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.000
and so that's why we've
opened up everything to you.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.420
And I'm seeing all of these
amazing spots popping up

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.940
on the map, as I
look at our data,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.094
that I just never
even knew about it.

00:37:24.094 --> 00:37:25.760
And so that's the
exciting thing, right?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.790
Is seeing that we've enabled
you to go to the places that we

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.290
can't.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.730
AUDIENCE: Just wondering
about aerial imagery.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.005
There's a lot of
drones out there

00:37:40.005 --> 00:37:41.930
and there's obviously
issues with capturing

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.540
the top of the
sphere, whether you're

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.747
able to bring in that
imagery and support it.

00:37:46.747 --> 00:37:48.830
LUC VINCENT: So we don't
have any drones capturing

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.580
imagery right now.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.140
We just have--

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.640
AUDIENCE: Right,
but if users wanted

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.750
to submit their own
drones, it would

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.350
be probably half of a sphere.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.331
LUC VINCENT: Oh, yeah.

00:37:56.331 --> 00:37:58.580
EVAN RAPOPORT: So if you put
the Photo Sphere metadata

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.121
standard in it--
I've seen, actually,

00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:04.620
people hanging like GoPro rigs
from the bottom of a drone.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.760
We have tons of that
imagery already being

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.460
published from users on
Views and on Google Maps.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.860
It's just a panorama, right?

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.920
It gets published.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.867
So it would work just fine.

00:38:13.867 --> 00:38:14.700
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.290
EVAN RAPOPORT: Yeah.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.720
Definitely.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.260
LUC VINCENT: Good idea.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.110
EVAN RAPOPORT: And let
us know if you do it.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.480
I'd love to see it.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:18.980
All right.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.950
Well, thank you very much.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.420
We'll hang around for
a few more minutes.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.780
And enjoy the rest of your day.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:23.363
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:38:23.363 --> 00:38:23.980
Thank you.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.530
