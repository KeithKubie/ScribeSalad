00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.830
So I've drawn an arbitrary
triangle over here

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.430
that we will assume is not
an equilateral triangle.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.050
And let's draw some of
the interesting properties

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.230
of this triangle.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.770
So, let's first start with
the perpendicular bisectors.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.200
So let's say this is the
midpoint of this side

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.040
right over here.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.920
So-- draw a little bit closer
to the midpoint-- looks

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.550
like right about there.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.610
So this length is equal to
this length right over here.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.390
And so let me draw a
perpendicular bisector.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.180
So perpendicular bisector
would look something

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.060
like that for that side.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.560
Now let me do it on this side.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.640
So just trying to
eyeball it, this

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.640
looks roughly like the midpoint.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.990
So this length is going to be
equal to this length, and then

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.020
once again, let me draw
a perpendicular bisector,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.630
so it's going to go
at a 90 degree angle.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.090
I can draw a straighter
line than that.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.610
So that looks pretty good.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.790
And it is perpendicular.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.150
And then you can imagine I
will do it with this side,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.740
with side AB.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.660
That looks like the midpoint.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.360
This length is going to
be equal to that length

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.560
right over there.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.390
And then if we draw a
perpendicular-- my best attempt

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.480
to draw this-- it looks
something like that.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.010
And we've already learned
that these three lines will

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.580
definitely intersect in a unique
point right over there, which

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.520
we call the circumcenter.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.510
So let me write it.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.810
So this right over there
is our circumcenter.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.850
This is nothing new.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.740
Now let's draw the medians.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.490
So, the medians go from
each of the vertices

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.000
to the midpoint of
the opposite side.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.850
So let me draw.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.260
So this is a median, this is
a median, this is a median,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.200
and then this is-- and all
the errors in my drawing

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.060
will start to become
apparent, now that I'm

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.910
trying to do multiple
things with it.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.200
But we know all of the medians
intersect at the centroid.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.150
So this right over
here is the centroid.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.520
Now let's draw the
altitudes of this triangle.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.020
So let's draw the altitude.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.820
So I'm going to drop a
perpendicular right over here.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.740
This is one altitude.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.260
I will draw another altitude.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.060
So remember, it's going
to go down like this.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.730
Draw another altitude that
looks something like that.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.907
And then I can draw another
altitude from this side,

00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:33.240
and we know it's going to
intersect at this unique point

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.640
right over here.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.117
So I'll try to draw
it as neatly as I can.

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:38.700
And this is going
to be perpendicular,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.940
although the way I've drawn
it, it doesn't necessarily

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.160
look that way.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.229
And we know that this
thing right over here

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.270
is called an orthocenter.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.800
Now the whole reason
why I'm doing this,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.420
and this is frankly kind
of a mind-boggling idea.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.730
It's neat enough that each
of these points even exists,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.744
that three altitudes will
intersect in one point,

00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:01.660
that the three medians
intersect in one point,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.326
and they have all
these neat properties,

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:05.202
and that the three
perpendicular bisectors

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:06.160
intersect in one point.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.319
That by itself is neat enough.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.110
But what's really neat--
and it's maybe not

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.443
completely apparent by the
way I drew it, because I just

00:03:12.443 --> 00:03:16.020
drew it free hand-- is that
these three points will

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.530
definitely be on the same line.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.030
If this was an
equilateral triangle,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.860
they would actually
be the same point.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.740
But for any other triangle
there'll be different points,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.995
and they will be
on the same line.

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:29.370
Which is just kind of crazy,
because obviously two points

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.310
define a line, but three
points being on the same line

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.090
is kind of a-- it seems
like a very unlikely thing,

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.340
if you were to just guess it.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.084
And I'm going to try to
draw it as best as I can.

00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:42.250
If you were to draw this
with a straight edge ruler,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.890
it would come out a lot cleaner.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.440
But all three points
sit on this unique line

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.314
that, it seems something
special or magical about it.

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:52.230
And because it's something
special or magical,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.050
there's one famous
mathematician who

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.870
tends to get all of the most
special and mathematical things

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.750
named after him, because
he's the guy who's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.270
really explored these things.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.790
And we call this the Euler line.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.510
And I say that Leonhard
Euler-- that looks like ENTER.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.750
I say that he gets all
of the cool and magical

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.470
mystical things named after
him, because he's also

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.340
responsible for
Euler's identity, which

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.750
is e to the i pi is
equal to negative 1.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.584
And we proved this in
the calculus playlist,

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:33.916
and if none of this makes any
sense to you, don't worry.

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:35.520
We're only in
geometry right now.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.170
But he gets to
have all the-- This

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.440
is a magical thing because e
comes out of compound interest,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.040
and growth and decay,
exponential growth and decay.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.710
i squared is negative
1-- seems a very bizarre

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.820
imaginary number.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.960
Pi is a ratio of
the circumference

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.390
of a circle to its diameter.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.270
And negative 1 is,
well, negative 1.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.870
And so Euler showed that
there's a lot of reason

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.650
to believe that these
four numbers that

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.790
come from all of these different
weird realities of the world

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.400
are connected in
this very tight way.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.150
And he also showed that
these special points

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.750
are all on the same
line, which tells us

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.820
something kind of crazy and
mystical about our reality.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.130
And if that is not
enough for you,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.580
if you were to take the
midpoint on the Euler

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.184
line between the orthocenter--
I'm not going to prove it here,

00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:23.600
I'm just going to give you a
little bit of a tidbit of it.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.290
If you take the midpoint
between the orthocenter

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.060
and the circumcenter--
so let's take this.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.204
So I'm going to try
to look at it roughly.

00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:32.870
So it looks like it's
right about there.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.730
So this length is going
to be equal to this length

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.730
right over here.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.366
This point that sits
on the Euler line

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.240
is going to be the center
of something called

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.430
the nine-point circle,
which intersects

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.650
this triangle at nine points.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.710
And we'll see this kind of
nine interesting points.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.670
So let me label that as well.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.121
So it's cool enough that
these three special points are

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.620
on the Euler line, but there's
actually four special points.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.830
And actually, there's
a few more than that

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.109
are kind of interesting.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:00.650
So that orange point
right over there

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.370
is the center of the
nine-point circle.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.260
And maybe I'll do another video,
another video just on that.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.330
So anyway, hopefully you found
that kind of interesting.
