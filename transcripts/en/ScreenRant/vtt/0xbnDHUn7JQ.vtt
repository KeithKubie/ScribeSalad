00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.210
The Star Wars saga has returned to the big
screen and fans couldn’t be happier.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.450
As the record-breaking box office numbers
indicate, moviegoers have been going to the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.449
theater multiple times to see the new film.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.840
And while the story and performances make
repeat viewings worthwhile, there are also

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.660
a ton of Easter eggs in the movie for audiences
to seek out next time they watch it.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.759
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Amazing Hidden
Details in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.560
The Falcon’s New Dish

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.210
At the end of Return of the Jedi, the Millennium
Falcon gets banged up a little bit, losing

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.600
its circular radar dish in the Battle of Endor.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.500
Some replacements were in order, and they
apparently took place before The Force Awakens.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.010
In the new film, the iconic ship has a rectangular
radar dish, creating a necessary link between

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.890
the original and sequel trilogies.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.710
It only makes sense that the Falcon would
have a new design after being damaged.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.570
It’s a nice attention to detail that honors
the franchise’s history in a subtle way.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.330
If the Falcon looked the same, it wouldn’t
seem right.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.720
Ello Asty

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.070
J.J. Abrams loves the Beastie Boys, incorporating
some of their classic tunes like “Sabotage”

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.580
and “Body Movin’” into his Star Trek
pictures.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.720
Because Star Wars doesn’t take place on
Earth, the rap group couldn’t be worked

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.619
into the Episode 7 soundtrack, but Abrams
still found a way to pay tribute to the musical

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.619
legends.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.170
A Resistance pilot featured in the film is
named Ello Asty, a reference to the Beastie

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.500
Boys’ Grammy winning album, Hello Nasty.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.890
The writing on the side of his helmet reads
“Born to Ill,” which is a nod to the Beasties’

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.439
debut record, Licensed to Ill.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.899
007: Stormtrooper

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.799
It was long rumored that James Bond star Daniel
Craig was going to cameo as a First Order

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.130
stormtrooper in The Force Awakens, a report
Craig himself denied.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.219
But when the film hit theaters, 007 was there
underneath the armor.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.990
He’s the victim of Rey’s Jedi Mind Trick
as she escapes from captivity in Starkiller

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.990
base.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.579
It’s hard to pick up at first, but if you
listen closely, Craig’s voice is unmistakable

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.649
as he follows Rey’s commands to break her
bonds… and drop his gun.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.630
It’s a comedic moment and shows that even
A-list actors will happily take a cameo to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.060
be part of the Star Wars legacy.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.549
FN-2187

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.069
When audiences first meet protagonist Finn,
he’s known only by his First Order call

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.109
signal: FN-2187.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.539
Poe Dameron is the one who combines the letters
to create the name Finn, but the numbers are

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.220
what hold a greater meaning to fans of the
original trilogy.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.900
2187 was the number of the prison cell that
contained Princess Leia on the first Death

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.120
Star in the adventure that started it all.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.400
It’s a clever bit of fan service that doesn’t
hit moviegoers over the head with an obvious

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400
homage.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.750
All it does is service the story while operating
as a fun reveal for those who have been there

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.940
since the beginning.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.400
Luke’s Training Remote

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.739
Going back on board the Millennium Falcon
was sure to be a trip down memory lane, and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.630
Abrams dialed up the nostalgia when Rey and
Finn board the ship.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.099
As the two search through the Falcon’s contents,
Finn pulls the training remote from A New

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.780
Hope out of a bag, giving it a confused look
before he tosses it aside.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.040
It’s only on screen for a brief moment,
but if you don’t blink and miss it, its

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.099
appearance will conjure up images of the scene
where Luke truly starts his Jedi training

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.400
and takes his first steps into a larger world.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.530
How Many Parsecs?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.390
Fans may never truly understand the mythology
of the Kessel Run, since parsecs are a measurement

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.079
of distance, not time.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.099
Still, Han Solo knows he accomplished the
feat in just 12 parsecs, and is very proud

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.099
of that fact.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.450
When he meets Rey and Finn, Rey exclaims that
the Falcon is the ship that completed the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.650
Run in 14 parsecs.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.599
Han is quick to correct her – those two
parsecs making a big difference in his mind.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.620
It’s similar to an aging athlete recalling
a great game, remembering every little detail

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.780
just as it happened.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.950
And for fans, it’s an extra laugh in a movie
full of them.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.950
Ben Solo

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.730
Viewers learn that villain Kylo Ren is actually
Ben Solo, son of Han and Leia.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.561
While the origins of the name are never revealed,
it could be a nod to “Ben” Kenobi, the

00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.269
one partly responsible for bringing Han and
Leia together.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.239
Another interpretation is that Kylo’s birth
name is a reference to Ben Skywalker, the

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.599
child of Luke and Mara Jade in the now discontinued
Star Wars Legends novel series, which are

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.599
not canon.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.380
Either way, it seems like Abrams was tipping
his hat to the series history when he named

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.269
the new movie’s antagonist.

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.269
Voices of the Force

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.329
One of the most talked-about sequences in
the film is when Rey touches Luke’s old

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.969
lightsaber and has a Force vision.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.060
There’s a lot going on, including some vocal
cameos by the Jedi who trained Luke.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.269
Frank Oz recorded some lines as Yoda and both
actors that played Obi-Wan are there as well.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.840
Ewan McGregor’s voice tells Rey that “these
are your first steps,” and clever editing

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.880
allowed the late Alec Guinness to reprise
his iconic role.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.040
Crew members took the actor saying “afraid”
and turned it to “Rey.”

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.970
There may not be any Force ghosts in Episode
VII, but the presence of the old Masters is

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.280
still felt.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.220
BB-8’s Human Voice

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.490
Fans instantly fell in love with new droid
BB-8 thanks to his cute appearance and personality.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.500
A lot of the credit has to be given to the
two human comedians that provided the robot’s

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.500
voice.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.949
Abrams attached his iPad to a talk box operated
by SNL alum Bill Hader, using a sound effects

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.030
app on his device to get the right voice.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.870
Parks and Recreation actor Ben Schwartz also
provided a helping hand, earning a credit

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.870
as a vocal consultant.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.400
Maybe that’s why BB-8 was such a hit with
viewers.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.830
He came pre-packaged with a human touch.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.680
R2-KT

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.520
Star Wars fans are familiar with the story
of R2-KT, the astromech droid that 501st Legion

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.680
member Albin Johnson had built for his daughter
Katie when she was diagnosed with terminal

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.680
cancer.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.580
R2-KT has become a fixture of Star Wars media
ever since, appearing in the Clone Wars animated

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.180
series and attending various fan conventions.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.520
Abrams gave the droid her live-action screen
debut in The Force Awakens.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.840
As Poe reunites with Finn at the Resistance
base, R2-KT can be seen under the pilot’s

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.120
X-wing fighter, a touching moment for those
who are aware of the character’s creation

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.550
and the heartfelt meaning behind it.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.910
Those are our picks for amazing hidden details
in The Force Awakens.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.130
Are there any we missed?

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.690
