00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.180
A good trick, with his name, is to say ‘toy’ in the middle: Dos-toy-ev-ski.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.540
He was born 1821 and grew up on the outskirts of Moscow.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.360
His family were comfortably off – his father was a successful doctor,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.720
though he happened to work at a charitable hospital

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.480
that provided medical services for the very poor.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.060
The family had a house in the hospital complex,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.900
so the young Dostoevsky was from the very beginning

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.120
powerfully exposed to experiences from which other children of his background were usually carefully sheltered.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.320
Like almost everyone in Tsarist Russia

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.680
his parents were devout Orthodox Christians

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.620
and Dostoevsky’s own religious faith got deeper and stronger throughout his life.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.580
At the age of 12 he was sent away to school

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.720
first in Moscow and later in the capital, St Petersburg.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.960
He got a good education, though as a child of the tiny professional middle-class

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.860
he felt out of place among his more aristocratic classmates.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.820
While he was away at school his father died

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.380
possibly murdered by his own serfs.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.180
After graduating Dostoevsky worked as an engineer for a while.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.580
He started gambling and losing money, something that was to plague him all his life.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.880
In his late twenties, he became friends with a group of radical writers and intellectuals.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.160
He wasn’t deeply involved but when the government decided to crack down on dissent,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.100
Dostoevsky was rounded up too and sentenced to be shot by a firing squad.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.160
However, at the last moment – just when the soldiers were ready to fire

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.140
a message of a reprieve arrived.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.360
Dostoyevsky was sent instead to Siberia for four years of forced labour in horrific conditions.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.920
It was only after his return from Siberia that Dostoevsky established himself as a writer.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.760
Starting in middle age he produced a series of major books.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.240
They are dark, violent and tragic – and usually very long and complicated.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.120
He wrote them to preach five important lessons to the world.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.800
Incidentally, the discussion of Dostoevsky’s ideas does involve revealing the plots of some of his novels.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.500
It’s not something that would have worried him

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.840
because his books are written to be read more than once.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.480
But if it bothers you, this is the place to break off.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.300
Dostoyevsky's first big book – Notes from the Underground – is an extended rant

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.560
against life and the world delivered by a retired civil servant.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.860
This civil servant is deeply unreasonable, inconsistent and furious with everyone, including himself.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.900
He’s always getting into rows, he goes to a reunion of some former colleagues,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.600
and tells them all how much he has always hated them.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.140
He wants to puncture everyone’s illusions and make them as unhappy as he is.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.640
He seems like a grotesque character to build a book around.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.520
But he’s doing something important. He’s insisting

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.940
with a peculiar kind of intensity – on a very strange fact about the human condition.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.480
We want happiness but we have a special talent

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.020
for making ourselves miserable.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.280
He asserts.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.980
In the novel, Dostoevsky is taking aim at philosophies

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.400
of progress and improvement – which were highly

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.900
popular in his age, as they continue to be in ours.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.440
He is attacking our habit of telling ourselves

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.600
that if only this or that thing were different,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.820
we could leave suffering behind.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.400
If we got that great job, changed the government,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.460
could afford that great house, invented a machine to fly us faster around the world,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.880
could get together with, or divorced from a particular person,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.100
then all would go well.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.300
This, Dostyevsky argues, is a delusion.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.500
Suffering will always pursue us.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.320
Schemes for improving the world always contain a flaw.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.980
They won’t eliminate suffering,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.820
they will only change the things that cause us pain.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.520
Life can only ever be a process of changing the focus of pain,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.240
never of removing pain itself.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.920
There will always be something to agonise us.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.400
Stop people starving, says Dostoyevsky

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.000
with calculated wickedness – and you’ll soon find

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.860
there’s a new range of agonies: people will start to suffer

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.640
from boredom, greed or intense melancholy

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.240
that they haven’t been invited to the right party.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.280
In this spirit, Notes from the Underground launches

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.780
an attack on all ideologies of technical or social progress

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.700
which aspire to the elimination of suffering.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.900
They won’t succeed because as soon as they solve one problem,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.740
they’ll direct our nature to become unhappy in new ways.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.940
Dostoyevsky is fascinated by the secret way,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.080
in which we actually don’t want what we theoretically seem to seek.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.980
He discusses the pleasure a lot of people get from feelings of superiority,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.780
and for whom, consequently, an egalitarian society would be a nightmare.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.820
Or the disavowed but real thrill we get

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.420
from hearing about violent crimes on the news,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.580
in which case we’d actually feel thwarted in a truly peaceful world.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.300
"Notes from the Underground" is a dark, awkwardly insightful,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.660
counterpoint to well-intentioned modern liberalism.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.940
It doesn’t really show that social improvement is meaningless.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.740
But it does remind us that we’ll always carry

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.660
our very complex and difficult selves with us

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.160
and that progress will never be as clear and clean

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.620
as we might like to imagine.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.140
In Crime and Punishment, we meet an impoverished intellectual,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.140
Rodion Raskolnikov.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.120
Though he’s currently a nobody,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.760
he’s fascinated by power and ruthlessness.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.560
He thinks of himself as a version of Napoleon.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.620
"Leaders of men, such as Napoleon,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.240
were all without exception criminals," we hear,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.140
"they broke the ancient laws of their people to make new ones

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.240
that suited them better, and they never feared bloodshed.”

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.860
Raskolnikov is also desperate for money and so,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.660
aristocratic superiority in mind,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.000
he decides to murder an old woman

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.940
who is a small time pawnbroker and money lender and to steal her cash.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.620
He’s tormented by the mad injustice of the fact

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.720
that this horrible, mean old character

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.160
has drawers full of roubles while he

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.540
– who is clever, energetic and profound – is starving.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.760
He doesn’t spend much time thinking about options

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.500
like taking a job as a waiter.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.400
So Raskolnikov breaks into her apartment

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.700
and bludgeons her to death;

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.760
and, surprised in the act by the woman’s

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.240
pregnant half-sister, kills her too.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.200
But it turns out he’s nothing like the cold-blooded,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.000
rational hero of his own imagination.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.500
He is tormented by guilt and horror at what he has done.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.220
Eventually, he turns himself over to the police

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.280
in order to face the proper punishment for his crime.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.720
We’re probably never going to do what Raskolnikov did.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.400
But we often share a troubling tendency with him.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.620
We think we know ourselves better than we actually do.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.400
Raskolnikov thinks he’s ruthless; actually, he’s rather tender-hearted.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.420
He thinks he won’t feel guilt;

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.380
but he's overwhelmed by remorse.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.880
Part of our life's journey is to engage in the tricky task

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.360
of disentangling ourselves from what we think we’re like,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.760
in order to discover our true nature.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.740
Raskolnikov is especially fascinating because of

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.080
the direction this self-discovery takes.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.840
His striking realisation is that he’s actually a much nicer person

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.520
than he takes himself to be.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.520
Whereas so many novelists delight in showing the sickly reality

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.340
beneath a glamorous or enticing facade,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.340
Dostoevsky has embarked on a more curious but rewarding mission.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.360
He wants to reveal that beneath the so-called monster,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.700
there can very often be a far more interesting

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.600
tender-hearted character lurking: a nice but deluded,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.900
intelligent but frightened and panicked person.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.100
Sticking for the moment with Crime and Punishment,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.120
it’s very significant the way Dostoevsky gets us to like his murderous hero.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.260
Raskolnikov is clearly an attractive person.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.580
At the very start of the book, we’re told:

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.040
Dostoevsky throughout lessens the imaginative distance between ‘us’

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.980
who live mainly law-abiding and more or less manageable lives,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.980
and ‘them’ – the ones who do terrible things

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.940
and wreak havoc with their lives and those of others.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.940
That person, he is saying, is more like you

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.340
than you might initially want to think,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.520
and therefore more accessible to sympathy.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.800
The idea that you can be a good person,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.440
do something very bad and still deserve some compassion

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.740
sounds maybe slight and obvious,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.540
until one has need of this kind of forgiveness in one’s own life.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.760
This is where Dostoevsky wants to enter our inner conversation with ourselves,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.460
and tell us all about his character Raskolnikov,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.660
a serious, thoughtful, good-looking man who did worse

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.540
than we have and still can be compassionately understood,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.720
as we can and must all be.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.720
This is Dostoevsky’s Christianity at work:

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.300
no one is outside the circle of God’s love and understanding.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.460
Dostoyevsky’s next great book, The Idiot,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.860
takes off from his near-death experience before the firing squad.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.340
In the novel, he recounts what that was like.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.800
Three minutes before his expected death he is able to see life clearly for the first time.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.320
He notices the gilded spire of a nearby church,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.060
and how it glitters in the sun.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.300
He’d never before realised how entrancing a glint of sunlight could be.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.260
He is filled with an immense, deep love of the world.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.080
You might see a beggar and think how you would love

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.800
to change places with them so as to be able to continue

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.340
to breathe the air and feel the wind, merely to exist, seems,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.360
at that moment of final revelation, infinitely precious.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.920
And then the revised order comes and it's not over at all.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.580
What would it be like to go through one’s whole life

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.220
in such a state of gratitude and generosity?

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.000
You wouldn’t share any of the normal attitudes.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.660
You’d love everyone equally,

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.960
you’d be enchanted by the simplest things,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.920
you’d never feel angry or frightened.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.940
You would seem to other people to be a kind of idiot.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.560
Hence the title of Dostoyevsky's book.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.600
It’s an extreme version of a very interesting step.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.020
We’re continually surrounded by things which could delight us,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.260
if only we saw them in the right way,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.700
if only we could learn to appreciate them.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.460
Dostoevsky was desperate to communicate the value of existence

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.700
before death would overtake him – and us.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.140
In Dostoyevsky’s final great work – Brothers Karamazov,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.280
which came out when he was nearly 60,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.240
one of the central characters tells a long story-within-a-story.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.700
It’s called The Grand Inquisitor,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.380
and imagines that the greatest event looked forward to by Christian theology,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.320
the second coming of Christ,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.980
has in fact already happened.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.260
Jesus did come back, several hundred years ago.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.960
He turned up in Spain, during the highest period of power in the Catholic Church:

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.920
the organisation established, in theory at least,

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.900
entirely in devotion to him.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.660
Christ is back to fulfil his teachings of forgiveness and universal love.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.740
But something rather odd happens.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.240
The most powerful religious leader, the Grand Inquisitor,

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.940
has Jesus arrested and imprisoned.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.980
In the middle of the night, the Grand Inquisitor visits Christ in his cell

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.160
and explains that he cannot allow him to do his work on Earth,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.060
because he is a threat to the stability of society.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.860
Christ, he says, is just too ambitious – too pure, too perfect.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.060
Humanity can’t live up to the impossible goals he sets before us.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.800
The fact is, people haven’t been able to live according to his teachings

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.880
and Jesus should admit he failed

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.700
and that his ideas of redemption were essentially misguided.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.720
The Grand Inquisitor is not really a monster.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.180
In fact, Dostoevsky portrays him as quite an admirable figure in the story.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.840
He is a guide to a crucial idea,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.700
that human beings cannot live in purity,

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.320
cannot ever be just truly good,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.700
cannot live up to Christ’s message,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.140
and this is something we should reconcile ourselves to

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.280
with grace rather than fury or self-hatred.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.980
We have to accept a great deal of unreasonableness,

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.300
folly, greed, selfishness and shortsightedness

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.020
as ineradicable parts of the human condition and plan accordingly.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.740
And it’s not just a pessimistic thesis about politics

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.400
or religion that we’re being introduced to.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.880
The primary relevance of this thesis is as a commentary on our own lives:

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.540
we won’t sort them out,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.040
we won’t stop being a bit mad and wayward.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.040
And we shouldn’t torment ourselves with the dream that we could,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.640
if only we tried hard enough,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.200
become the perfect beings that idealistic philosophies

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.220
like Christianity like to sketch all too readily.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.100
Dostoevsky died in 1881. He had a very hard life,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.100
but he succeeded in conveying an idea which perhaps

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.440
he understood more clearly than anyone: in a world

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.560
that’s very keen on upbeat stories,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.200
we will always run up against our limitations

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.720
as deeply flawed and profoundly muddled creatures.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.720
Dostoyevsky’s attitude, bleak but compassionate, tragic but kind,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.360
is needed more than ever in our naive and sentimental age

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.000
that so fervently clings to the idea

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.280
which this great Russian novelist loathed

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.100
that science can save us all and that we may yet be made perfect through technology.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.020
Dostoyevsky guides us to a more humane darker truth:

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.560
that – as the great sages have always known –

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.500
life is and ever will be suffering,

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.160
and yet that there is great redemption available

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:32.800
in articulating this message in brilliant and moving, complex and subtle works of art.
