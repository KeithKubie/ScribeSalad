00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.230
A common way of applying QoS for streaming applications is to mark

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.010
the packets as a higher priority, put those packets into a higher

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.040
priority queue, and then schedule that queue so that it's serviced more

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.320
regularly, or more frequently, than traffic

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.160
or applications that are lower priority.
