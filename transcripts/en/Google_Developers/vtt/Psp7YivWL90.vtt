00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:11.770
FELIPE HOFFA: Hi.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.478
I'm Felipe Hoffa.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:15.390
And today we are at NOAA--
the National Oceanic

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.520
and Atmospheric Administration.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.740
Today we're going to visit their
Science on a Sphere project,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.930
where they are able to visualize
all the information, everything

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.720
that is happening around the
world in a giant 3D sphere.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.160
We are going to use this
sphere to take a look at GDELT,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.480
the Global Database of
Events, Language, and Tone--

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.370
an initiative that collects,
classifies, and scores

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.090
every piece of daily news
you can read from anywhere

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.370
in the world.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
In this video, we are going to
see practical examples of how

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.350
to explore GDELT
data with BigQuery.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.030
We are going to meet Amanda
Traud to see how she's using R

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.720
to explore the
ever-changing relationships

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.860
between countries.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.640
We'll also meet Louisa Koch,
the NOAA education director,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.130
to explore the amazing
possibilities that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.640
emerge from combining
GDELT with other data sets.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
But first, let's go
back to NOAA to meet

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.540
Kalev Leetaru, the
creator of GDELT,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.470
to learn more about his
project and how it works.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.720
So this is NOAA Science
on a Sphere Project, where

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.340
we can visualize the
whole planet at once.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.245
Here, for example, we're looking
at the Chilean 2014 tsunami,

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.940
and how it's expanding
all over the world.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.260
But then, can we look at GDELT?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.660
Let's wait for a second
look, and here we have it.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.230
All the products
around the world.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.760
And Kalev, can you
tell us more about what

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.081
we are looking at here?

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.330
KALEV LEETARU: So the idea
of the GDELT project really

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.520
is, how do we create a
dashboard, if you will,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.380
of human society?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.130
If you think about it
today, an earthquake

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.100
occurs anywhere on the planet.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.170
And there's this massive global
sensor grid that's been set up,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.132
and groups like the USGS,
can pick up the fact

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.340
that this earthquake occurred
anywhere on the planet.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.320
They know where it is.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.345
What its depth is.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:57.470
Who's going to be affected.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.019
All within seconds.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.560
But what about the
human earthquakes?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.170
If you think about
it for a moment,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.830
a protest that occurs
anywhere on the planet--

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.540
the ability to create
a data set of that.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.623
And that's really what the
GDELT Project is about,

00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:11.820
is creating essentially a
global catalog of human society.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.340
So imagine scooping up all the
world's news media each day--

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.710
web, print, broadcast,
over 100 languages--

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.684
and processing all that by
computer, second by second.

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:22.600
How do you interact with
that, visualize that,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.980
understand that?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.330
And that, to me, is what's
so exciting about the NOAA

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.480
Science on a Sphere
Project, is this ability

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.842
to take this massive data set of
a quarter of a billion records

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:33.800
and make it accessible.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.310
You think about visualization.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.490
You can't do better than to
display essentially planet

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.260
Earth on a physical
sphere of the planet.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.700
FELIPE HOFFA: While
visiting NOAA,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.050
Louisa Koch, the
Education Director,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.460
joined us to share more about
the mission and her thoughts

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.040
on the GDELT Data Set.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.130
LOUISA KOCH: So NOAA
produces a lot of information

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.588
about the ocean
and the atmosphere.

00:02:54.588 --> 00:02:57.010
We spend billions
of dollars a year

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.680
collecting ocean and
atmospheric data.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.520
But it's really important
for us to also connect it

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.340
to what that means to people.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.710
And GDELT is an
amazing database.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.570
It's so exciting to
see it on the sphere.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.690
Right now, most of the data
sets on a Science on a Sphere

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.190
are the physical
data sets that talk

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.490
about how the
Earth is operating.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.390
GDELT talks about how social
systems are operating.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.820
And can show us a completely
new perspective on the planet

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.064
that we call home.

00:03:28.064 --> 00:03:29.480
FELIPE HOFFA: So
GDELT is amazing.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.910
It's monitoring the world.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.000
But what I want
to learn today is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.797
how we are getting all this
information into GDELT.

00:03:35.797 --> 00:03:36.630
KALEV LEETARU: Yeah.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.040
Yeah.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.581
So that's one of
the tricks is trying

00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:40.800
to monitor the
entire world's media.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.060
And of course, this
is a complex process.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.810
So it's taking this
textual news article--

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.440
this big, massive mess--
and translating that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.800
to a codified record that's
recording what's happening,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.480
where it's happening, who's
involved, the details of it.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.320
And then all that flows through
to the end, where it then

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.740
makes it available as
these CSV files and sitting

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.250
inside of BigQuery.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.300
And then eventually
at the end of each day

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.994
when it processes it, it
generates a file CSV file,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.410
makes it available
on the website,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.951
but then it also
sends it to BigQuery

00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:08.610
using the BigQuery
uploader tool.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.000
And a minute or so later,
it's up in BigQuery.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.130
And it's been added to that
quarter billion record,

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.130
so now you can pull up
BigQuery on your computer

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.110
and suddenly access
the latest material.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.640
FELIPE HOFFA: GDELT already
indexes more than a quarter

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.700
billion rows from the last
35 years of worldwide events.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.870
And it's loaded by more
than 100,000 rows a day.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.400
I sat down with Kalev for
an interactive session

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.120
of exploring GDELT
using BigQuery.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.470
Take a look at what we did.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.219
KALEV LEETARU: What
we're going to do here

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.610
is do a simple
experiment to show

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.310
how do you really
work with data.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.050
So why don't we start
off with Ukraine?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.802
Ukraine's been in the
news, obviously, a lot.

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:48.260
Let's pull, for
example, let's just

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.940
count how many total
events that we're

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.477
getting from Ukraine right now.

00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:53.310
Specifically, let's
look at conflict events,

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.210
since a lot of Ukrainian event.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.710
So what we want to
do, in this case,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.020
we just care about
the number of events.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.880
We don't care about the detail.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.320
We just want to know how
many events are occurring

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.882
in Ukraine by
month, for example.

00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:02.840
FELIPE HOFFA: By month?

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.610
For the last year?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.110
For the last 10 years?

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.151
KALEV LEETARU: Let's do
it for the last 30 years.

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:08.300
Let's go back to 1979.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.052
So we'll start off with
a select count, as usual.

00:05:12.052 --> 00:05:13.760
And what we want to
do is we want to say,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.090
first off, we want to limit
it just to Ukraine, obviously.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.914
And so we're going
to say Action.

00:05:22.914 --> 00:05:24.330
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.020
going to say, where action.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.160
So for each event, it
records a whole bunch

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.250
of different details.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.300
One of them is where
the event took place.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.580
So the physical location
where the event took place.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.680
So we're going to say where
the country code of the action,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.475
where it actually
took place, is UP.

00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:41.940
And don't ask me why UP is
the country code for Ukraine.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.897
And so if we just do
this, and we say, well,

00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:47.230
where are the events by Ukraine?

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.850
But we want to break
it down by month.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.410
So we're going to
come back here,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.350
and we're going to
add in month-year.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.570
And so basically we're asking
it, break this down by month.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.200
Count up the number of events.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.770
And again, group by month-year.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.250
And let's order by month-year.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.650
And so if we run this, what
we should get back here

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.610
is literally by month how many
events it counted in Ukraine.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.355
And actually, I just realized
this will give us everything.

00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:15.480
But this is a good example.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.486
This will give us everything,
not just conflict events.

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:21.800
FELIPE HOFFA: Maybe
we need to-- oh.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.555
There it is.

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:23.944
So what do we have here?

00:06:23.944 --> 00:06:25.610
KALEV LEETARU: So
what we're seeing here

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.090
is by month is how many
events it actually recorded.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.600
So you're seeing in January
1979, it recorded 23 events.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.980
In February, it recorded 11.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.170
And we scroll by.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.754
And let me hop all
the way to the end.

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:40.753
So you notice these are
sitting in the 50 to 80.

00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:42.220
FELIPE HOFFA: 430
different events.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.178
KALEV LEETARU: Exactly.

00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:45.530
If we come to here, we
start seeing like 100,000.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.460
And if I download this-- let me
download this as a CSV file--

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.830
and show you what this
actually looks like.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.900
And let me go ahead
and graph this.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.770
I love visuals, so it
makes it easier to see.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.340
So let's go ahead
and graph this.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.860
And we can see-- wow.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.480
There's not a whole
lot in Ukraine.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.950
And then right as-- you
can see a certain number.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.230
Maybe 100 or so a month or so.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.230
And then of course the
fall of the Soviet Union,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.972
it starts increasing
, increasing.

00:07:11.972 --> 00:07:13.430
We start seeing
some of the others.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.110
Then of course, we
really see things

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.547
skyrocketing in recent times.

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:20.630
But you could say, well,
that kind of makes sense.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.505
I mean there's a
lot of stuff that's

00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:22.950
been happening in the last year.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.410
But the problem that that's
facing is that at the same time

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.434
the total volume of all
news media worldwide

00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:28.600
is increasing exponentially.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.460
And so what you
really want to do here

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.400
is you actually want
to normalize this.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.880
I don't want to
see a raw number.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.338
What I want to see
is I want to see

00:07:38.338 --> 00:07:40.740
that over the entire size
of GDELT on that day.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.640
FELIPE HOFFA: So in order to
normalize the number of events,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.690
we need to know two numbers.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.520
First, the total number
of worldwide events

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.010
in GDELT for each month, which
we compute with a simple count.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.610
And then the number of events
related to the Ukraine.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.440
We can get those adding an IF
condition to our count clause.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.930
Finally, we need to get rid
of this ALL WHERE clause.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.120
Otherwise, our first
count would be incorrect,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.380
since only rows
related to the Ukraine

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.200
will be taken into account.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.810
We could now get the
ratio between both columns

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.190
in BigQuery.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.580
But instead, let's export
them as a spreadsheet,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.250
and produce a monthly ratios
and visualizations there.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.550
KALEV LEETARU: And so now
let's go ahead and just--

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.720
so we mapped Ukraine
before, as we remember.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.720
If we look here, we see Ukraine.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.330
Let's take a look at the total.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.929
So this is all events
found by GDELT.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:39.120
And we can see, obviously,
right around the birth of Google

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.830
News, in particular,
which really

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.589
drove a lot of
web-based news, we

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:44.885
sort of see this
massive spiral forward.

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:50.070
So actually looking
at this, this

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.870
does suggest, indeed, that there
was a big surge in Ukraine.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.130
But the problem is that
this peak is really

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.930
going to be heavily
impacted by the fact

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:02.470
that there's a lot more in GDELT
than there was a long time ago.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.350
So what we want to do is instead
of plotting the raw number,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.370
we want to plot it
as a percentage.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.900
So we basically
want to come in here

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.280
and we simply want to
do a simple dividing.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.440
Number of Ukraine events divided
by total number of events,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.490
make it into a percentage point.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.120
Now if we graph
this, it probably

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.700
will look somewhat similar.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.900
But actually, we
see a lot more here.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.290
So now we start seeing
some interesting things.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.370
And we can see, again,
sort of all events.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.640
So we can see, again, sort of
this rise and sort of interest

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.440
in Ukraine.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.290
But you know, again,
one of the challenges

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.050
here is we're looking at
everything for Ukraine.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.341
And probably what we want is
we want to go more narrow,

00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:40.639
something like protests.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.930
Because again, looking at
everything to do with Ukraine

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.460
is probably less interesting.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.460
So what we want to do is
we want to come in here

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.320
and we want to say-- we want
to limit it to protests.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.180
So if we want to
say protests, we

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.210
want to say there's something
here called Event Root Code.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.650
So remember that there's
300 different categories

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.800
of events in here.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.420
And so all the protest
ones begin with 14.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.790
So if we go back, remember
here, and we look at 14,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.373
we can see there's all different
types of it-- hunger strikes,

00:10:09.373 --> 00:10:11.720
policy, a protest for
a leadership change,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.700
a protest for a rally, a
protest for policy change.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.640
In our case, we just
want to see all of them.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.850
So if we say, with a
Root Code equals 14,

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.030
that captures anything
that's a protest.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.340
So now if we repeat
this, we should

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.130
get something much
more interesting.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.963
This is going through
and finding everything

00:10:26.963 --> 00:10:29.290
that has to do with a
protest across all of GDELT,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.017
coming back, and
then for each month,

00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:32.600
recording how many
total protests were

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.290
recorded in GDELT
for that month.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.616
And then how many were reported
in Ukraine in that month.

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:39.280
FELIPE HOFFA: So
in January 1979--

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.821
KALEV LEETARU: It's
saying they found

00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:42.210
400 protests around the world.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.729
And again, in 1979, there
was less electronic media.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.770
But it didn't find any in
Ukraine and, obviously,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.890
with the Soviet
occupation, a lot less.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.220
So let's say let's download
that as a CSV file.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.860
And let's once again
bring this into Excel.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.140
So this is total protests.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.660
This is Ukraine protests.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.140
And then once again,
percentage Ukraine.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.250
So what this is then,
is-- so let's say

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.640
we want to divide like this.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.000
So what we're going to do here--
so this column essentially

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.470
will be what percentage
of all protest

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.320
events marched in that
month were from Ukraine.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.440
And if we then examine
this, we plot this out,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.364
now we see something that
makes a lot more sense.

00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:32.780
Let me delete this to give us
a little bit more room here.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.480
You can see during the Soviet
occupation, very few protests.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.160
Obviously, the Soviets were
very restrictive on that.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.570
And then, of course,
the protests--

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.537
the great European
revolutions that

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:45.120
began at the fall
of the Soviet Union.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.680
Boom!

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.180
Now all of a sudden you see
a lot of protest activity.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.910
You see spikes.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.410
Crimea.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.177
You see the Orange Revolution.

00:11:52.177 --> 00:11:54.510
And then you see, of course,
you see where we are today.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.530
But you see what's interesting
is that protests have really

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.988
been decreasing in
Ukraine as we've

00:11:57.988 --> 00:11:59.472
been moving towards present.

00:11:59.472 --> 00:12:01.180
And a lot of that,
obviously, is the fact

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.950
that what's occurring
in Ukraine right now

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.190
has really shifted
from protest activity

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.659
to full scale military conflict.

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:09.450
And this raises some
interesting questions.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.840
So for example, let's
go back to this query,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.526
and instead of protests,
let's look at that.

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.400
If we say, well, why
are protests going down?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.530
Isn't Ukraine becoming
more unstable?

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.410
Well, instead of protests, let's
go back and look at conflict.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.520
So fighting, for example.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.337
Let's change from 14 to 19.

00:12:27.337 --> 00:12:28.420
And so now let's run this.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.350
So now what we're
saying is, find me

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.764
all of the active conflict
activities, the actual fighting

00:12:33.764 --> 00:12:35.180
that's occurring
across the world.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.830
And for each month, count
up how many total we see,

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.580
and then, again, how
many were in Ukraine.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.380
FELIPE HOFFA: We continue to
explore the basics of GDELT

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.010
and how to look into the
timeline of each country.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.050
During this trip, I also met
Amanda Traud, a data scientist

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.320
who's been exploring
GDELT at her job.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.670
She works at L-3 Data Tactics,
a specialized provider

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.500
of Big Data Analytics and
Cloud Solutions Services.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.750
They have been
using R to explore

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.660
GDELT data and the
relationships among countries

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.360
and how they change over time.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.940
For this project, she uses
Shiny, a web application

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.410
framework that turns R code
into interactive web apps.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.980
Let's learn more from her.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.510
AMANDA TRAUD: So
Shiny is actually

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.260
a package in R that
allows you to create

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.110
browser-based applications.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.980
And both of these apps
are browser-based,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.772
and anyone can use them
on our Shiny server.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:35.980
FELIPE HOFFA: That's awesome.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.310
So you have a Shiny server
running R Shiny apps.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.170
AMANDA TRAUD: Right.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.380
FELIPE HOFFA: Can you show
me more about these apps?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.600
What have you done--

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:44.890
AMANDA TRAUD: Absolutely.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.310
FELIPE HOFFA:
--with GDELT's data.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.500
AMANDA TRAUD: So my favorite
app is the GDELT Country Network

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.970
Dashboard.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.590
You can put in a date range.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.380
So say I wanted to know what the
connections between countries

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.990
looked like in the last week.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.290
So I select October
15 and October 22.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.290
So again, I put
in my BigQuery ID.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.730
And then I query.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:11.438
FELIPE HOFFA: OK.

00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:13.820
So we have a beautiful
network here.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.570
AMANDA TRAUD: Yes.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.030
FELIPE HOFFA: Can you
show me behind the scenes?

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.100
AMANDA TRAUD: Absolutely.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.980
FELIPE HOFFA: What
is powering this app?

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.410
AMANDA TRAUD: So two
things-- HTML and R. First

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.360
I'll show you the R code.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.680
So R has this amazing
library called Shiny

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.150
that you can use to create
these browser-based apps.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:38.010
So behind the scenes, when I
get my data back from BigQuery,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:44.450
my R function, Shiny
server, is taking the table

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.000
and creating an edge list.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And in a network,
an edge is the line

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.350
that connects the two dots.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.190
So this takes the table that
I get of all the events,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.450
pulls out actor
one and actor two,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.700
decides in the table
which ones are countries,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.230
and takes that subset.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.580
And then says that the
weight on that edge,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.367
how connected they are, is
based on the tone of the event.

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:11.200
FELIPE HOFFA: I see.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.437
And it's all open-sourced.

00:15:12.437 --> 00:15:13.270
AMANDA TRAUD: It is.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.490
It's all on GitHub.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.250
So you can go and you can
download the code if you want.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.609
It on the data tactics GitHub.

00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:19.900
FELIPE HOFFA: That's beautiful.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.980
And you have another
app available, too.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.030
AMANDA TRAUD: I do.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:27.520
The second app will give us a
table of all of the information

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.170
that we could possibly
want with GDELT.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.640
So for the app, we need
to put in-- I've already

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.650
put in a date range.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.440
That is October 1st
through the 22nd.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.830
And put in my project
ID and client ID,

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.100
just like the first one.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.910
And selected an actor.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.280
Now, I can select any
of the possible actors

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.940
in the GDELT database.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.230
I've selected China.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.420
FELIPE HOFFA: So GDELT has
a lot of factors encoded.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.489
Can we take a look of--

00:15:54.489 --> 00:15:55.530
AMANDA TRAUD: Absolutely.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.890
It has--

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:57.890
FELIPE HOFFA: Countries.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.484
It has--

00:15:58.484 --> 00:15:59.400
AMANDA TRAUD: So many.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.340
FELIPE HOFFA: Groups.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.940
So we're going to
look at protests

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.929
in China between October
1 and October 22.

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:05.970
AMANDA TRAUD: Absolutely.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.040
FELIPE HOFFA: And this
app is querying BigQuery--

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.040
AMANDA TRAUD: Through JavaScript
exactly like the other one.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.290
I hit Query, and it goes to
GDELT on the BigQuery database

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.470
and brings me back a table.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.310
And I have a list of
the different columns

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.025
that are available in the data.

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:25.350
FELIPE HOFFA: Yeah.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.016
This is awesome.

00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:28.550
And this is data you
later pick up with Aaron,

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.620
you're able to network.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.661
AMANDA TRAUD: Absolutely.

00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:34.410
So this is the type of data that
I then take into the other app.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.110
In the other app, I use
actor one, actor two,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.036
and average tone.

00:16:39.036 --> 00:16:40.910
FELIPE HOFFA: To learn
more about these apps,

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.660
visit the GDELT block, and
explore the Open Source

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.440
Code at the L-3 GitHub page.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.220
So how did you
discover BigQuery?

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.899
And how did it change
GDELT's project?

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:53.690
KALEV LEETARU: BigQuery
has been incredibly

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.770
amazing to this project.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:00.079
So really, for the first
sort of 3/4 of GDELT's life,

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.120
I could not access GDELT.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.130
I have a quarter of a billion
records sitting in my hands.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.213
But I couldn't look at it.

00:17:04.213 --> 00:17:06.160
I couldn't ask the most
basic of questions.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.430
A simple query
of, give me a list

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.920
of all the events
involving two actors.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.750
That could take a day to compute
in a traditional database.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.569
So oftentimes people
would say, wow,

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.190
could you give me an extract
of all the events in Syria

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.630
that involve a certain actor.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.046
I say, sure. but it's going
to take about a day and a half

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:24.500
for that to extract.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.550
BigQuery really was essentially
taking the lens cap off

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.420
of this incredible data set.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.400
BigQuery is really
changing that bar now,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.910
where the vast majority
of those ideas like,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.870
could we literally take a
period of time right now

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.496
and check all of
world history, and see

00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:43.453
what periods in world
history are most similar?

00:17:43.453 --> 00:17:45.630
2 and 1/2 million correlations,
2 and 1/2 minutes,

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.899
one line of SQL.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.190
FELIPE HOFFA: And what is next?

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.762
Where is BigQuery, GDELT,
the data world going?

00:17:51.762 --> 00:17:53.720
KALEV LEETARU: So that's
the most exciting part

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.880
is you think about GDELT today.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.460
It's out there.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.790
It's processing all
the world's news media.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.612
It's creating this
incredible data set.

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:00.070
GDELT also is
expanding the things,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.070
like academic literature.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.990
Processing all the world's
academic literature

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.770
on social cultural issues.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.410
And from that we
have a citation graph

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.490
of who's most cited in areas.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.014
Now imagine taking GDELT,
what's happening in news today,

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:13.430
combine that with the citation
data of who all the world's

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.380
experts are in an area,
then combining that

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.759
with Google
Freebase, which gives

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.050
all the structural information.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.870
So GDELT knows, for
example, that Barack Obama's

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.570
the President of
the United States.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.520
But Freebase will then tell us,
well, he also attended Harvard.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.210
And then it could tell us, well,
this other person over here,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.336
they also attended Harvard.

00:18:31.336 --> 00:18:33.293
So we start getting those
structural links that

00:18:33.293 --> 00:18:35.084
allow us to combine
with that, and then

00:18:35.084 --> 00:18:37.250
being able to correlate
against other data sets that

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.210
are in BigQuery, things like
the Wikipedia page views.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.850
Being able to say, well, when
all of a sudden this particular

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.680
person's in the news,
and everyone's now

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.540
looking that person
up on Wikipedia,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.470
what are the other
topics they're

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:48.928
looking up at the
same time period?

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:50.794
How is that person or
that political party,

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:52.210
or other thing,
how are they being

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.010
contextualized and understood?

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.690
It's just magic.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.690
You just put the data out there.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.260
It's sort of like
the electricity.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.210
You walk into a room and
you flip the light switch.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.834
You think about how
simple that is, yet

00:19:01.834 --> 00:19:03.480
how incredible that
infrastructure is

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.870
that makes that possible.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.210
But you don't think about that.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.959
You flip your light
switch, and you really

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:10.460
don't worry anymore about
how expensive is that query?

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.550
You just ask the question.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.580
And it's possible.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.027
Whatever you can
imagine, it's possible.

00:19:15.027 --> 00:19:16.610
FELIPE HOFFA: And
that's it for today.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.300
Thank you for joining me
in this exploration journey

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.340
into understanding the world.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.900
It was a pleasure to meet
Louisa Koch and Amanda

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.340
Traud to explore how industry,
academia, government, and end

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.120
users can benefit from this
extraordinary data set.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.330
And of course, Kalev Leetaru,
the man behind GDELT.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.150

at gdeltproject.org.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.860
There's a lot more to discover.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.360
Now it's your turn to
dive into the data,

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.570
write your own queries,

stories from the Big Data

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.990
world.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.900
Stay curious.
