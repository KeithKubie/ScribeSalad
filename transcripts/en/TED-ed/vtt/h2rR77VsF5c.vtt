00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.579
Why is it so difficult to cure cancer?

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:12.300
We've harnessed electricity,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.129
sequenced the human genome,

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.741
and eradicated small pox.

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.940
But after billions of dollars in research,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.121
we haven't found a solution for a disease
that affects more than 14 million people

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:27.061
and their families at any given time.

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.720
Cancer arises as normal cells
accumulate mutations.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.496
Most of the time, 
cells can detect mutations or DNA damage

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:38.862
and either fix them or self destruct.

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:43.117
However, some mutations allow cancerous
cells to grow unchecked

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:45.173
and invade nearby tissues,

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:48.816
or even metastasize to distant organs.

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:54.082
Cancers become almost incurable
once they metastasize.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:57.002
And cancer is incredibly complex.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.873
It's not just one disease.

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:00.872
There are more than 100 different types

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:05.363
and we don't have a magic bullet
that can cure all of them.

00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:06.731
For most cancers,

00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:10.933
treatments usually include 
a combination of surgery to remove tumors

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:16.247
and radiation and chemotherapy
to kill any cancerous cells left behind.

00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:17.507
Hormone therapies,

00:01:17.507 --> 00:01:18.948
immunotherapy,

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:22.370
and targeted treatments tailored
for a specific type of cancer

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.219
are sometimes used, too.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.609
In many cases, 
these treatments are effective

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.270
and the patient becomes cancer-free.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.809
But they're very far from 100% effective
100% of the time.

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:40.540
So what would we have to do to find cures
for all the different forms of cancer?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.060
We're beginning to understand a few
of the problems

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.830
scientists would have to solve.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.379
First of all, we need new, better ways
of studying cancer.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.190
Most cancer treatments are developed
using cell lines grown in labs

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.950
from cultures of human tumors.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.422
These cultured cells have given us
critical insights

00:01:59.422 --> 00:02:01.740
about cancer genetics and biology,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.671
but they lack much of the complexity
of a tumor in an actual living organism.

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:10.871
It's frequently the case that new drugs,
which work on these lab-grown cells,

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:14.502
will fail in clinical trials 
with real patients.

00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:17.431
One of the complexities 
of aggressive tumors

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:23.296
is that they can have multiple populations
of slightly different cancerous cells.

00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:27.067
Over time, distinct genetic mutations
accumulate in cells

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:33.042
in different parts of the tumor,
giving rise to unique subclones.

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:37.061
For example, aggressive brain tumors
called glioblastomas

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:41.713
can have as many as six different 
subclones in a single patient.

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:44.437
This is called clonal heterogeneity,

00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:48.232
and it makes treatment difficult because
a drug that works on one subclone

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:51.123
may have no effect on another.

00:02:51.123 --> 00:02:52.923
Here's another challenge.

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:55.784
A tumor is a dynamic 
interconnected ecosystem

00:02:55.784 --> 00:02:58.543
where cancer cells constantly 
communicate with each other

00:02:58.543 --> 00:03:01.265
and with healthy cells nearby.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:05.052
They can induce normal cells to form
blood vessels that feed the tumor

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.903
and remove waste products.

00:03:07.903 --> 00:03:10.249
They can also interact 
with the immune system

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.196
to actually suppress its function,

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:16.265
keeping it from recognizing 
or destroying the cancer.

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:19.415
If we could learn how to shut down
these lines of communication,

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:23.733
we'd have a better shot at vanquishing 
a tumor permanently.

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:26.024
Additionally, mounting evidence suggests

00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:30.505
we'll need to figure out how to eradicate
cancer stem cells.

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:33.026
These are rare but seem 
to have special properties

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:36.748
that make them resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation.

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:41.486
In theory, even if the rest of the tumor
shrinks beyond detection during treatment,

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:47.654
a single residual cancer stem cell
could seed the growth of a new tumor.

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:49.957
Figuring out how to target
these stubborn cells

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:54.146
might help prevent cancers 
from coming back.

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:57.536
Even if we solved those problems,
we might face new ones.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:00.667
Cancer cells are masters of adaptation,

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:05.938
adjusting their molecular and cellular
characteristics to survive under stress.

00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:08.868
When they're bombarded by radiation
or chemotherapy,

00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:12.779
some cancer cells can effectively
switch on protective shields

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.697
against whatever's attacking them
by changing their gene expression.

00:04:17.697 --> 00:04:21.846
Malignant cancers are complex systems
that constantly evolve and adapt.

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:25.301
To defeat them, we need to find
experimental systems

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:27.333
that match their complexity,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:32.767
and monitoring and treatment options
that can adjust as the cancer changes.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.870
But the good news is 
we're making progress.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.280
Even with all we don't know,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.850
the average mortality rate 
for most kinds of cancer

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.869
has dropped significantly since the 1970s
and is still falling.

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:46.360
We're learning more every day,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.729
and each new piece of information gives
us one more tool to add to our arsenal.
