ELIZABETH CHOE:
Assessment for this class

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.560
was probably the hardest
thing for me, at least.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.220
How to assign a fair
grade to students, because

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.732
at the end of the day,
they're a grade for this.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.940
And it wasn't going to be
an A for effort type thing.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.910
It was actually really
hard because anything

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.690
that requires creative effort--
I talked to you about this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.540
for a long time-- you
don't want to crap

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.560
on people's creative efforts,
even if it's just not

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.720
very good.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.404
CHRIS BOEBEL: It's very hard.

00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.570
ELIZABETH CHOE: Jamie and
I talked a lot about this.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.220
But initially, the rubric was
very plastic elements based.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.190
Like, is this well lit,
can you hear the audio OK?

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.560
And we just kind of scrapped
that, and really went

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.140
with-- there were four sort
of principles to the class

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.660
that I talked about on the
first day, which was spark,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.230
does it foster curiosity,
and that was like a big theme

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.980
that went through every
single assignment,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.560
and how it manifested change
assignment to assignment.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.539
You can see on the rubric.

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.330
Kill your darlings.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.687
Like, is it concise enough.

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:31.770
There are a couple others.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.740
So that's how we
approached grading.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.440
And we assigned them
raw numerical scores,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.180
and we didn't have like, an
A is 20, a B is 10, or 15.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.630
It was in progress was from 0
to 5, and steps moving forward

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.670
was like five to 10, and then
mastery was like 10 to 15,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.540
for instance.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.440
So they would get
numerical grade feedback.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.770
We gave a lot of weight
to their daily reflections

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.870
so that not everyone in the
class would end up with a C.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I
have a question.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.090
Do you think grading should
have been A for effort?

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.690
Because in real life, and
I didn't tell this to you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.850
when we were planning the
course, and I'm sorry.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.470
But in real life, it
almost is A for effort.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.730
If I show up to do voice over
and I'm late and I'm sloppy,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.470
and I don't do a
very good job, I'm

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.740
not going to get hired again.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.520
And part of that is my technical
ability to do voice over.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.630
And part of it is showing
up 15 minutes early,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.163
being professional,
all that sort

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:51.809
of stuff, which does kind
of seem like A for effort.

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:52.350
I don't know.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.100
What do you think?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.420
CHRIS BOEBEL: Well.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.900
So I've had to think
about this a lot

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.750
for the course I teach at MIT.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.532
And it's a huge,
huge issue because,

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:02.990
so who should get
the better grade?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.010
The person who has a huge
amount of talent and experience

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.840
as a filmmaker and
video maker, sluffs it,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.090
just like lays back
throughout the whole course,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.510
but does a really
nice piece at the end.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.820
Or the person who never
has done it before,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.530
doesn't necessarily
have a whole lot

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.670
on the ball, when it
comes to media production,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.670
but just works and works
and works and comes out

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.640
with something that's
kind of mediocre.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.550
Just because by the nature of
it having never done it before.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.610
That's really the issue.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.140
When you're dealing
with non-professionals--

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.640
because I completely
agree with him,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.015
it's the Woody
Allen thing right?

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:41.680
Like most of life is showing up.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.330
And it's totally true.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.810
But when you're dealing with
this huge, huge learning curve,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.220
it becomes very, very tricky.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.910
So what we do, we don't
do quite A for effort.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.070
But we do kind of allow an out
if your final project, which

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.990
is a big part of your grade,
goes completely haywire

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.970
and just falls apart
on you, you can

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.440
write a fairly
substantial paper that

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.270
describes what your intents
were or what your thought

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.784
process was, what
went wrong, why

00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.950
it went wrong, what you
would have done differently.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.950
And so, essentially, you do have
a way supplementing or making

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.130
up for this innate
problem you had,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.671
which was that you didn't know
what the hell you we're doing.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.341
Which is a problem.

00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:27.203
JOSHUA GUNN: It's
fairy innate for me.

00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:29.590
ELIZABETH CHOE: For all of us.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.920
Well, two of the course
values were challenge,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.770
and a lot of that
manifested in the rubric

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.260
in the final project and
the graded assignments,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.060
as is their improvement
from the previous iteration?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.450
Is this person going outside
of their comfort zone?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.390
And then thoughtfulness.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.010
Can you tell that this
person has integrated

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.750
some of the things we talked
about in class, whether it's

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.140
through their blog posts,
or just like office hour

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.820
reflections, things like that.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.970
So that was built
into the final grades,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.180
but then I would also say that
the graded sort of quality

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.890
projects, and the
daily reflections

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.770
were weighted pretty
equally so that if you

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.110
had a student, which we
did, who had the skills,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.190
but didn't do the daily
blogs, their grade would

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.250
suffer a little bit more.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.640
Just as much as someone
who did the daily blogs,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.950
and just could not
host for instance.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.360
In the end it worked out
by doing it that way.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.420
All the students who
I thought deserved

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.540
great grades, because I knew
they worked really hard,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.120
got good grades.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.560
And all the students who
were very technically skilled

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.990
still got decent
grades, but it wasn't

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.240
like they got 100 or anything.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.394
It's always a tough
challenge, though.

00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:00.851
GEORGE ZAIDAN: My
math teacher used

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:03.360
to say-- we'd be like, how are
you going to grade this test.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.540
He'd be like, well I'm going to
blindfold myself, turn around

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.092
and throw darts behind my back.

00:06:08.092 --> 00:06:09.050
And we were like, good.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.554
That's good.

00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:10.970
CHRIS BOEBEL: I
just which I could

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.450
have written a paper in
chemistry class in college

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.174
to make up for the--

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:16.840
GEORGE ZAIDAN: My
experiment went south.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.282
And here's what happened.

00:06:18.282 --> 00:06:20.240
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's hard
because MIT students,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.980
they want to know what
do I need to do to--

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.010
CHRIS BOEBEL: Exactly.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.394
People are very focused on
achievement and doing well.

00:06:27.394 --> 00:06:28.810
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Which is why I was

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.759
very conscious of by creating as
specific of a rubric as I can.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.300
JOSHUA GUNN: That
makes lot of sense,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.890
especially as you said before,
because this is a form of art,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.232
and there is no right or
wrong answer, so how do you--

00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:42.940
ELIZABETH CHOE: But
you can tell someone,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.220
look you didn't change
anything from your first draft.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.230
So you're going to get docked
for points on challenge,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.900
as the rubric says.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.610
Or you straight up didn't
do a blog reflection

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.740
so you're getting a
zero on that section.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.370
But at least I do
think that there

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.150
has to be something
tangible to go back

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.660
to that you can't just sort
of arbitrarily assign a grade.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.220
I will say that, at
the end of the day,

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.840
an assessment, a
great assessment,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.660
should be a reflection.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.690
Or should be there to
help students improve.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.910
And I do think that the value
in assessment and feedback

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.910
came from just sort of one
on one, when you all worked

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.357
with the students directly.

00:07:25.357 --> 00:07:27.940
And that's something that's not
captured on the OpenCourseWare

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.980
class.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.370
But I would stay with
Jamie and our TA Siri,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.989
for at least two hours
every day after class,

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.030
just talking to students.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.320
And you work with them.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.090
And when you and John
came to do the workshop,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.130
you'd just have direct
interaction with the students.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.670
I really think that's where
the most value came from.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.630
I don't know how you
all feel about that.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.130
CHRIS BOEBEL: I thought that
workshop was great, by the way.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.750
I didn't get a chance to
tell you, it was really nice.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.500
JOSHUA GUNN: I mean,
I thought it was just

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.740
great to interact
with the students.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.440
I mean I wasn't immediately
sure how engaged they were,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.360
but I had some sense of
it when I would actually

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.320
just sort of sit down with
them and they would directly

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.130
ask me questions and
there was that sort

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.760
of that direct engagement.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.560
And I guess one would
question how this course could

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.620
be done electronically, or via
some kind of distance learning,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.120
or that kind of thing.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.620
Because that seemed
invaluable to me.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.090
That kind of personal contact.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.840
ELIZABETH CHOE: If you
are teacher in Missouri,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.090
for instance, how can you teach
this course without a Chris,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.160
without a George,
and without a Josh.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.660
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I mean, there
are versions of us in Missouri.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.250
ELIZABETH CHOE: There are.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.580
JOSHUA GUNN: I have an
alter ego in every state.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.400
ELIZABETH CHOE: You
said something nice

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.410
about my home state.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.147
It's on camera, too.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.490
But really, again, you can
watch the OpenCourseWare stuff

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.340
to get a sense of just, I mean,
they're just fundamental facts,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.780
I guess, that you
should become aware of.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.200
But I gave a midpoint
survey to the students

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.680
of what lectures have
you found most helpful,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.390
and they were all
like, all of them.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.060
Like, Chris' was really helpful
because I got his perspective

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.030
as a filmmaker, like as
someone who was, and still is,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.240
in the industry.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.800
And then working with Planet
Nutshell, they were like,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.090
oh I had no idea
how to storyboard.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.420
And it was waving more
helpful than just watching

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.080
a video of someone do it.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.110
We were actually
interacting with them.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:45.790
Your hosting workshop, like how
do you give hosting feedback

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.970
not in real time, not live.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.270
I don't know.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.870
JOSHUA GUNN: I just remember
sitting down with a couple

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.590
students and I think
students were running

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.570
their ideas by both of us.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.880
Maybe me individually,
and John, just

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.510
giving sort of direct
creative feedback.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.890
Well, I think that
could work, but have you

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.390
thought about doing this?

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.260
And then that would spur
them to further sort

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.490
of creative thinking.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.340
That kind of interaction,
that relationship,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.090
seemed invaluable.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.965
CHRIS BOEBEL: And the
one on one interaction.

00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:24.610
I've thought about that too.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.970
I mean maybe the equivalent of
crowd sourcing or something.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.690
But most of the valuable
experiences I had as a student,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.810
and that I think I've had
with students as a teacher,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.090
are really not even in the
classroom, but one on one.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.010
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, I mean, most
of the experiences I remember

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.310
most powerfully are
being at office hours

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.190
and having a teacher asks
me like, so do you really

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.810
think you're going to
be an English major?

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.110
CHRIS BOEBEL: And particularly
in media or video,

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.940
it's like you have this
work, it's a piece of crap,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.110
and someone is going to sit
there and help you turn it

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.030
into something else.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.850
And just to learn what
can be done to a script,

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.040
to something that's been
shot and not edited the way

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.715
it could be.

00:11:17.715 --> 00:11:20.120
It's a really
powerful experience.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.630
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah definitely.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.980
And so I wonder, sorry
to interrupt you, I just

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.870
I just wonder if the balance--
I don't have a complete picture

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.120
of how the course was balanced,
because I wasn't there

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.840
the whole time, but
I wonder if there

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.190
could be more opportunity
for that kind of a one on one

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.240
interaction.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.490
CHRIS BOEBEL: It's very short.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.190
That's the challenge.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.470
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.860
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.980
CHRIS BOEBEL: It's
such a short class.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.210
JOSHUA GUNN: Like some kind
of critique or workshop

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.512
that maybe we all attended
and gave thoughts on?

00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:49.970
GEORGE ZAIDAN: And
for the students

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.840
who worked with us in production
week, that was a lot of one

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.990
on one.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.730
A lot of one on one, or like,
three on one, in that case.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.730
But there again, for
production week it

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.720
was like you don't spend two
hours like, here here's why

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.270
your hosting was not optimal.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.280
You just tell them what
to do to fix it quickly

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.360
so you can get the next shot.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.220
But that still is
valuable because you still

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.720
see how a professional does it.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.340
You're there and
you're doing it.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.780
You're not just
sitting there watching.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.471
Without you, the
show doesn't run.

00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:29.220
Without the student,
the show doesn't run.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.904
So they have to do it.

00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:32.570
ELIZABETH CHOE: A
couple of the students

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.060
who did Science Out
Loud, they waited

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.530
to write their final blog
reflection until after they

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.530
shot.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.080
So they were like, I wanted to
wait to see how different it

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.760
would be from the class.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.480
And even in that one
day, I learned so much.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.980
Like, more than I did in
the two weeks of the class.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.516
Just like being in that
production setting.

00:12:51.516 --> 00:12:52.140
Sorry go ahead.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.264
GEORGE ZAIDAN: That was it.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.780
ELIZABETH CHOE: Something
I wanted to mention,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.930
again, this kind of
thing isn't scalable.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.940
We can't spend one on one
time with 20 students.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.440
It was manageable
because there were

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.254
only seven or eight of them at
any given time, thank goodness.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.420
Initially were like, yeah
we're going to blow it up,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.350
make it like 24 students.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.140
Oh my gosh, no.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.370
It was a struggle to keep
up even though our teaching

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.320
team is huge, just because it
is such an intensive process

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.260
to work with them one on one.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.930
But what I did want to make use
of their peer-to-peer learning

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.820
and support.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.205
And somehow, I
don't know exactly

00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:34.273
know how this got
fostered, but we really

00:13:34.273 --> 00:13:35.740
had a nice class environment.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.135
The students were very
supportive of each other,

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.760
which was really
nice, maybe because it

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.660
was such a small class.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.672
But during the second week,
they would go off in groups

00:13:45.672 --> 00:13:47.630
to shoot each other, and
they would give advice

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.740
to each other.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.810
Which was awesome.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.450
I would overhear are some
really great directorial advice,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.940
but I would also overhear some
advice that would be like, no.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.350
Don't make them have
that intonation.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.790
I wouldn't say
anything because I

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.080
think it's important for
their learning experience.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.380
But that's what
I mean by there's

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.500
only so much you
can do with people

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.480
in the same sort of learning
sphere teaching each other.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.970
JOSHUA GUNN: It's
a very short-- I

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.410
mean so much of what
this class is like,

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.830
is characterized by the
fact that it's so short.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.650
Because the cohort
thing is so important.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.530
And, I mean, as someone
who, I'll confess,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.760
went to art school.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.310
I know, sorry MIT people.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.140
So I went to NYU, the graduate
film program, the three year

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.260
program.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.100
So the first year
of that program,

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.730
is kind of like the first couple
of lectures in your class.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.390
It's all class based, you
feel like your head is

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.880
exploding with all this stuff.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.690
And you're hanging on your
professor's every word,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.190
and it's like kind
of transformation.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.455
After that, it's kind of
pointless to go to class.

00:15:02.455 --> 00:15:04.580
It doesn't really matter
what happens in the class.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.850
It's all about the
cohort, and it's

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.220
all about what you
do outside of class,

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.840
and the help and support
you give each other as you

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.790
make these iterative projects.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.710
So it kind of takes
over and becomes

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.040
the thing, the only thing.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.210
The relationship of the
students with each other,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.800
critiquing each
other's work, working

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.495
on each others projects.

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:28.850
The rest of it, once
you kind of have

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.734
the basics, the basic
conceptual framework--

00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:33.400
GEORGE ZAIDAN: It's
like learn by doing.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.240
CHRIS BOEBEL: Yeah, it's all
learn by doing after that.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.281
ELIZABETH CHOE: The problem
is because it's a two

00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:38.860
week, or three week, class.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.500
Or even a semester,
or even a year.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.490
At MIT, I mean, these students
are nowhere near experts.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.240
Not saying that we are,
right, there's only so much

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.670
that they can be aware
of with each other,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.910
that it was a weird
balance to strike.
