00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:11.784
What would you do if you thought 
your country was on the path to tyranny?

00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:16.091
If you saw one man gaining too much power,
would you try to stop him?

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:20.429
Even if that man was
one of your closest friends and allies?

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:27.331
These were the questions haunting
Roman Senator Marcus Junius Brutus in 44 BCE,

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:31.524
the year Julius Caesar 
would be assassinated.

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:35.779
Opposing unchecked power 
wasn't just a political matter for Brutus;

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:37.470
it was a personal one.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.385
He claimed descent
from Lucius Junius Brutus,

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:45.675
who had helped overthrow the tyrannical
king known as Tarquin the Proud.

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:47.485
Instead of seizing power himself,

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:51.135
the elder Brutus
led the people in a rousing oath

00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:54.777
to never again allow a king to rule.

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:56.003
Rome became a republic

00:00:56.003 --> 00:01:00.239
based on the principle that no one man
should hold too much power.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.763
Now, four and a half centuries later,
this principle was threatened.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:08.384
Julius Ceasar's rise 
to the powerful position of consul

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:10.080
had been dramatic.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.374
Years of military triumphs 
had made him the wealthiest man in Rome.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.777
And after defeating his rival
Pompey the Great in a bitter civil war,

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.540
his power was at its peak.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.301
His victories and initiatives, 
such as distributing lands to the poor,

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:27.138
had made him popular with the public,

00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:32.243
and many senators vied for his favor 
by showering him with honors.

00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:34.832
Statues were built, 
temples were dedicated,

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:40.197
and a whole month was renamed,
still called July today.

00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:42.654
More importantly, the title of dictator,

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:45.957
meant to grant
temporary emergency powers in wartime,

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:50.443
had been bestowed upon Caesar 
several times in succession.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.438
And in 44 BCE, 
he was made dictator perpetuo,

00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:56.882
dictator for a potentially unlimited term.

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:01.772
All of this was too much for the senators

00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:06.628
who feared a return to the monarchy
their ancestors had fought to abolish,

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:09.144
as well as those whose 
own power and ambition

00:02:09.144 --> 00:02:12.036
were impeded by Caesar's rule.

00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:15.786
A group of conspirators 
calling themselves the liberators

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:20.018
began to secretly discuss
plans for assassination.

00:02:20.018 --> 00:02:23.451
Leading them were
the senator Gaius Cassius Longinus

00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:26.928
and his friend and brother-in-law, Brutus.

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:30.616
Joining the conspiracy was not 
an easy choice for Brutus.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:34.432
Even though Brutus had sided with Pompey 
in the ill-fated civil war,

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:38.682
Caesar had personally intervened 
to save his life,

00:02:38.682 --> 00:02:42.890
not only pardoning him
but even accepting him as a close advisor

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.708
and elevating him to important posts.

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:50.399
Brutus was hesitant to conspire against
the man who had treated him like a son,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.454
but in the end,

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:58.185
Cassius's insistence and Brutus's own fear
of Caesar's ambitions won out.

00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:01.707
The moment they had been waiting for
came on March 15.

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:02.840
At a senate meeting

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.166
held shortly before Caesar was to depart
on his next military campaign,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.377
as many as 60 conspirators surrounded him,

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:15.546
unsheathing daggers from their togas
and stabbing at him from all sides.

00:03:15.546 --> 00:03:17.058
As the story goes,

00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:21.627
Caesar struggled fiercely
until he saw Brutus.

00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:25.183
Despite the famous line, "Et tu, Brute?" 
written by Shakespeare,

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:28.509
we don't know Caesar's actual dying words.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.077
Some ancient sources claim
he said nothing,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.852
while others record the phrase, 
"And you, child?",

00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:39.522
fueling speculation that Brutus may have
actually been Caesar's illegitimate son.

00:03:39.522 --> 00:03:43.072
But all agree that when 
Caesar saw Brutus among his attackers,

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:46.739
he covered his face and gave up the fight,

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.681
falling to the ground 
after being stabbed 23 times.

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:52.984
Unfortunately for Brutus,

00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:57.208
he and the other conspirators 
had underestimated Caesar's popularity

00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:58.856
among the Roman public,

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:01.284
many of whom saw 
him as an effective leader,

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.621
and the senate as a corrupt aristocracy.

00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:08.764
Within moments of Caesar's assassination,
Rome was in a state of panic.

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:11.264
Most of the other senators had fled,

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:14.853
while the assassins barricaded themselves
on the Capitoline Hill.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:17.895
Mark Antony, 
Caesar's friend and co-consul,

00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:20.498
was swift to seize the upper hand,

00:04:20.498 --> 00:04:24.250
delivering a passionate speech 
at Caesar's funeral days later

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.229
that whipped the crowd into a frenzy 
of grief and anger.

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.564
As a result, the liberators 
were forced out of Rome.

00:04:31.564 --> 00:04:35.287
The ensuing power vacuum 
led to a series of civil wars,

00:04:35.287 --> 00:04:40.629
during which Brutus, 
facing certain defeat, took his own life.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.639
Ironically, the ultimate result

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.104
would be the opposite of what
the conspirators had hoped to accomplish:

00:04:46.104 --> 00:04:47.480
the end of the Republic

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.648
and the concentration of power 
under the office of Emperor.

00:04:51.648 --> 00:04:55.735
Opinions over the assassination of Caesar 
were divided from the start

00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:57.388
and have remained so.

00:04:57.388 --> 00:04:58.715
As for Brutus himself,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.701
few historical figures have inspired 
such a conflicting legacy.

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:06.990
In Dante's "Inferno," he was placed 
in the very center of Hell

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.198
and eternally chewed by Satan himself
for his crime of betrayal.

00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:14.148
But Swift's "Gulliver's Travels"

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:18.522
described him as one of the most
virtuous and benevolent people to have lived.

00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:22.994
The interpretation of Brutus as either
a selfless fighter against dictatorship

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:25.291
or an opportunistic traitor

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.378
has shifted with the tides 
of history and politics.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:31.330
But even today, over 2000 years later,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.338
questions about the price of liberty,

00:05:33.338 --> 00:05:37.646
the conflict between 
personal loyalties and universal ideals,

00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:42.173
and unintended consequences
remain more relevant than ever.
