of Android and remain active even if you
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.020
of Android and remain active even if you
navigate away from your app and then

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
navigate away from your app and then
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.250
navigate away from your app and then
come back the second is a set of system

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
come back the second is a set of system
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560
come back the second is a set of system
UI visibility flags now the difference

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
UI visibility flags now the difference
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.819
UI visibility flags now the difference
with these flags is that they're only

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
with these flags is that they're only
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979
with these flags is that they're only
available in newer versions of Android

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
available in newer versions of Android
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.610
available in newer versions of Android
since about Android 4.0 or later

additionally these flags are clearable

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
additionally these flags are clearable
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060
additionally these flags are clearable
by the system so if for example you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
by the system so if for example you
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.650
by the system so if for example you
navigate away from your app and then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
navigate away from your app and then
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899
navigate away from your app and then
come back these flags will be cleared

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
come back these flags will be cleared
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.840
come back these flags will be cleared
and you'll have to reset them so the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
and you'll have to reset them so the
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.240
and you'll have to reset them so the
first of these new flags is low profile

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
first of these new flags is low profile
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340
first of these new flags is low profile
and this simply dims the status and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
and this simply dims the status and
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399
and this simply dims the status and
navigation bars when it's set the second

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
navigation bars when it's set the second
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890
navigation bars when it's set the second
is the fullscreen flag and this behaves

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
is the fullscreen flag and this behaves
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570
is the fullscreen flag and this behaves
basically the same as the window manager

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

is the big difference between immersive
 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.000
is the big difference between immersive
mode and just setting the hide

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
mode and just setting the hide
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.240

navigation flag so one important point

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
navigation flag so one important point
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.039
navigation flag so one important point
here is that swiping from the top of the

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049
here is that swiping from the top of the
 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.800
here is that swiping from the top of the
screen clears those flags so if you want

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
screen clears those flags so if you want
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.259
screen clears those flags so if you want
to say hide them again after say three

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269
to say hide them again after say three
 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.750
to say hide them again after say three
seconds you can set up a system UI

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
seconds you can set up a system UI
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.310
seconds you can set up a system UI
visibility listener which we'll talk

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320
visibility listener which we'll talk
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.860
visibility listener which we'll talk
about in a second and then three seconds

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
about in a second and then three seconds
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.650
about in a second and then three seconds
later cause a or set the flag again to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660
later cause a or set the flag again to
 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.960
later cause a or set the flag again to
hide them so let's look at some code

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
hide them so let's look at some code
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.810
hide them so let's look at some code
first we'll use our windows root view or

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820
first we'll use our windows root view or
 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.180
first we'll use our windows root view or
the decor view as the anchor for system

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190
the decor view as the anchor for system
 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.060
the decor view as the anchor for system
UI visibility you can use any view so

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
UI visibility you can use any view so
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.130
UI visibility you can use any view so
long as it's visible now the next thing

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140
long as it's visible now the next thing
 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.870
long as it's visible now the next thing
you should do whenever you use system UI

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
you should do whenever you use system UI
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.029
you should do whenever you use system UI
visibility flags is you should set up a

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039
visibility flags is you should set up a
 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.290
visibility flags is you should set up a
listener to watch for changes

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
listener to watch for changes
 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.909
listener to watch for changes
because the system can actually clear

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919
because the system can actually clear
 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.409
because the system can actually clear
these flags in response to user

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419
these flags in response to user
 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.600
these flags in response to user
interactions you want to be kept aware

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610
interactions you want to be kept aware
 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.719
interactions you want to be kept aware
of when that occurs now in this case we

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
of when that occurs now in this case we
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.520
of when that occurs now in this case we
simply show or hide additional UI

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530
simply show or hide additional UI
 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.189
simply show or hide additional UI
controls such as video playback controls

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199
controls such as video playback controls
 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.839
controls such as video playback controls
when the system bars are shown or hidden

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849
when the system bars are shown or hidden
 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.809
when the system bars are shown or hidden
and now keeping all of your UI controls

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819
and now keeping all of your UI controls
 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.119
and now keeping all of your UI controls
in sync with the system bars is the best

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129
in sync with the system bars is the best
 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.809
in sync with the system bars is the best
practice

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819
practice
 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.460
practice
to minimize the number of states that

fullscreen hide navigation and what that

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400
fullscreen hide navigation and what that
 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.920
fullscreen hide navigation and what that
will do is that I'll actually show the

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930
will do is that I'll actually show the
 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.860
will do is that I'll actually show the
bars and generally you'll want to auto

you may think of just using a simple

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250
you may think of just using a simple
 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.309
you may think of just using a simple
click listener now the problem with this

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319
click listener now the problem with this
 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.709
click listener now the problem with this
is that click listeners are fired even

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719
is that click listeners are fired even
 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.570
is that click listeners are fired even
if you drag your fingers across the

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580
if you drag your fingers across the
 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.480
if you drag your fingers across the
content after pressing down you probably

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490
content after pressing down you probably
 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.760
content after pressing down you probably
don't want to do that

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770
don't want to do that
 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.080
don't want to do that
instead you probably want to use a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090
instead you probably want to use a
 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.330
instead you probably want to use a
gesture detector like shown here and

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340
gesture detector like shown here and
 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.680
gesture detector like shown here and
handle the on single tap up event this

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690
handle the on single tap up event this
 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.619
handle the on single tap up event this
makes sure that if your users finger

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629
makes sure that if your users finger
 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.999
makes sure that if your users finger
moves more than just a little bit during

of temporarily visible system bar state
 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:37.100
of temporarily visible system bar state
is intended to be very transient and

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110
is intended to be very transient and
 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.899
is intended to be very transient and
your app should basically be completely

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:38.909
your app should basically be completely
 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.779
your app should basically be completely
unaware of this and last but not least

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:41.789
unaware of this and last but not least
 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.300

the system will not actually clear this

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310
the system will not actually clear this
 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.189

flag so when you when the user swipes

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199
flag so when you when the user swipes
 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.050
flag so when you when the user swipes
down from the top of the screen those

down from the top of the screen those
 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.610
down from the top of the screen those
flags will stay there they won't be

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620
flags will stay there they won't be
 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.159
flags will stay there they won't be
cleared and this gives this flag the

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169

other flags mentioned before now you
 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.719
other flags mentioned before now you
don't have to worry about the system

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:05.729
