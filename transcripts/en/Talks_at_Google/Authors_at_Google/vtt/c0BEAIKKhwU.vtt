00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.899
&gt;&gt; Cliff: All right. Good afternoon, everyone.
We're very

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.790
pleased to welcome Dr. Eric Isaacs from the
Argonne

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.540
National Laboratory. He's joining us for a
green at

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.309
Google presentation on energy policy and the
latest

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.740
breakthroughs and research to come out of
Argonne lab. In case you're

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.039
not familiar which all of us probably are
given our technical backgrounds, Argonne is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.800
one of the
world's foremost centers physics and materials

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.419
research.
Also home of the famous white deer. Dr. Isaacs

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.450
is professor
of the University of Physics in Chicago and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.030
he comes from storied career both with Bell
Labs and the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.510
Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne.
And so he's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.360
going to review for us today some of the basic
scientific

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.199
research and the game-changing energy breakthroughs
that

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.010
are happening right now at Argonne with the
goal of

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.379
finding revolutions in the energy sector,
whether that's

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.930
through Thorium or the batteries for the Chevy
volts.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.640
I'll leave Eric to paint the picture. And
we'll have

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.660
time for some question and answer at the end
for the use

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.750
of the Q and A mic. But without further ado,
please join

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.370
me in welcoming Dr. Isaacs to Google.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.370
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.820
&gt;&gt;Isaacs: Thank you Cliff. Also I want to
thank Cliff for

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.390
arranging this opportunity for me. So I would
like to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.570
talk about energy as Cliff said, but in the
context of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840
really what it takes to let's call it change
the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.740
game; something of course Google has done
in many ways

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.570
and certainly the automobile has done. It
changed the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.760
game until the U.S.. So I'd like to talk about
what game

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.060
changing means. Of course you'll see my natural
tendency is to come out as a materals physicist,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.200
condense matter physicist and talk a little
bit about the cool stuff behind the technology.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.850
So I
thought I'd start off with analogy which is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840
of course
football. Whether or not you knew it I didn't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.369
know this
until a few days ago. Football wasn't originally

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.840
prolated. It was
spherical and the game was invented effectively

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.340
so college men could
get out and practice sportsmanship, teambuilding.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.009
They could practice
essentially military like activity without

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.090
getting too badly hurt,
without getting shot at. It turn out they

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.190
also got
brutalized a little bit. But there were real

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.870
game
changers and when I say game changer I don't

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.200
mean
winning a game like we see at Stanford University.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.750
I
mean really changing the game. What changed

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.100
the game in
football was going from spherical to prolate.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.960
All of
a sudden it we object from a game that was

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.470
kind of slow
maybe a little bit violent to one that was

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.610
extremely fast
and very violent. In fact, it got so violent

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.770
that in
1905, 18 players, college players died and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.270
it cause president, a few
years later President Teddy Roosevelt to come

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.110
out and say
either change the game or stop playing it.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.360
And the point
of saying that is sort of technilogical change

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.450
from spherical
ball to prolate ball which really did change

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.180
the game.
But also there was political intervention

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.960
when you talk about energy you can't
talk about one without the other. And you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.450
can ask me
what's more important politics or let's call

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.820
it strategy
versus technology. And of course in the end,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.950
the real change in the
game was now it's a multibillion dollar industry

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.190
for the
colleges. It's a multibillion dollar industry

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.440
in
general. It's no longer just a game for a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.150
bunch of hacks to
play in a field somewhere in the back of a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.560
school. It's a really a serious sport. So
that's one analogy for what changes. Let me

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.210
tell you a
little bit about one that's a little closer

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.640
to my heart,
which is change in technology. Many of you

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.320
will
recognize this. This just a charred couple

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.000
device. It's
one that this one is a reasonably recent one.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.430
Just
the story of how this changed the game. This

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.450
is two guys
who actually two years ago won the Nobel prize.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.450
Unfortunately the guy on the right here, George
Smith, just

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.640
died. But Smith and Boyle were working really
as individual researchers in a lab at

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.790
Bell Laboratories and they came up with an
idea for

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.880
memory. At the time they were competing for
something some of

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.700
you may remember here called bubble memory.
And there

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.690
was a decision at Bell Labs to cut this program,
which

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.200
was to make it solid state memory instead
of bubble

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.090
memory. And these guys figure, "What the hell
else can

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.110
we do with this if were not going to make
a shift register

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.450
and the memory to go with it." And they ended
up deciding "Hey, we have an idea. We can

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.680
use the optical properties of the material
and make it into a camera." Make

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.610
it into something that could image. And they
did. And

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.890
they actually saved their funding to do that.
This is

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.900
just an example of the first device. And it's
a cool

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.940
device. It is a shift register basically,
but it's

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.030
what's behind the charge couple device that's
the silicon. And here's

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.850
the first image to give you an idea what it
looked like. What's

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.780
really important though in the story about
changing the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.730
game is that it did start off as this really
PI kind of

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.530
program, a couple of guys in a laboratory.
But very

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.620
quickly, who adopted it first? It wasn't a
big product

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.340
at first. It wasn't in your iPhone at first
of course.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.721
It was actually adopted by the military. It
was

00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:43.870
first adopted for spy satellites. This was
invented in

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.560
1969. By 1974, this device was orbiting the
earth taking

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.980
images of places like Afghanistan, a place
we still want

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.160
to take images of. This of course I just retrieved
yesterday off Google. And you guys know this

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.200
place very
well. But any of us now can use these charged

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.590
couple
devices in space and of course on your body

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.970
you have it
on your telephone. So that I call game changing.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.540
Actually there were two early adopters. One
was the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.360
military to do this kind of satellite imaging
down to the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.220
meter now but of course there was the astrophysicists.
So there were scientists in the game even

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.310
in the mid-70s realizing
very quickly no longer do you need film, you

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.420
can do some
stuff much more clever by using charged couple

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.220
devices.
The point here was it was a big game and it

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.570
was changed.
It was changed by two guys at first who didn't

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.040
know they were
going to change the game. It was really just

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.591
two people
who ended up starting that revolution. But

00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:38.470
it also took
many years, many years 5,6,7,10, 15

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.981
years to ultimately change the way many of
us live our lives. So

00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:46.050
changing the game can take a long time. And
so, now I want

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.060
to talk about in that context energy technologies
and

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.370
thinking about how are we going to change
the game with

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.970
energy technologies? Just you know simple
fact is today

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.980
still we rely almost entirely on fossil fuels.
Solar

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.960
energy, which we all love to talk about. I
know you guys

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.170
have a solar automobile, is still less than
.1% of

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.730
energy production in this country or anywhere
in the

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.420
world. It's still a long way from being game
changing.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.740
It's exciting to talk about, but it ain't
game changing

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.280
yet. So, of course, the challenge is obvious.
This is another image taken from the sky,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.130
taken from earth. It's of course a time sequence
picture. And really the point of

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.080
showing this, two reasons to show it one just
to say

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.690
that we're using a tremendous amount of energy
on the

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.200
earth. The electricity associated with this
is about 15

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.280
terawatts. The U.S. consumes a quarter you
are of that, maybe a little more than a quarter

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.180
of that.
And you can see also a lot of dark regions

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.680
which are soon
to be developed. So the growth, not only do

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.960
we
consume a lot today, but by 2015, we're looking

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.790
at a
doubling in the consumption of electricity.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.020
So this huge
growth. And of course that's electricity which

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.110
today
across the world is mostly generated by fossil

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.860
fuels. So
that means we're also producing carbon. Many

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.600
of you have
seen diagrams, like this a a famous wedge

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.330
diagram. Today we're
spewing about 30 gigatons of carbon into the

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.900
atmosphere. What
does that mean? Thirty gigatons naturally

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.480
occurring carbon
in the atmosphere is about 700 gigatons. So

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.400
it's about 5% a year. In 20 years we're
doubling the amount of carbon. Unless it's

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.810
absorbed or
unless the earth is adapting. So we don't

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.830
know what's going to happen. This is the chart
that

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.910
the International Energy Agency where they
project

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.120
out on current conditions. So business as
usual. And you can see

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.020
that essentially there's growth in the carbon
production

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.030
roughly speaking with the growth of electricity
consumption because there's a direct growth.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.190
What's interesting about this is the IEA also
suggests

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.410
that there are ways we can start thinking
about bringing

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:45.370
this curve down. Business as usual I would
argue is

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.410
unacceptable. But one could argue there's
a lot of

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.050
things you could do and the first and easiest
thing is energy

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.680
efficiency. It doesn't sound very glamourous,
very sexy but even in this

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.630
country over half of the energy we use is
wasted as heat.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:04.440
These lights you have here, probably more
efficient than most, but 20% of the electricity

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.580
in this country is used for lightbulbs and
lighting. And of that more than half of it

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.230
is wasted
simply as heat. So there's a lot waste. So

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.370
if you can
imagine solid state lighting, etcetera, you

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.580
all hear about, you do a tremendous amount
just in

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.990
suppressing the amount of carbon we produce.
And there's other things here, renewables,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.570
and I'll
focus on a few of these as I go forward. Just

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.060
as a
summary, there are many things and you guys

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.660
are all
familiar with the types of alternative energies

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.800
here:
wind, solar. Again solar is a tiny piece of

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.039
what we
produce today. Wind's a little bit larger

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.740
than solar.
It's a few percent, but not much larger. We

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.300
of course
still have nuclear in this country. Twenty

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:45.260
percent of our
power is nuclear. What are we going to do

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.030
with those?
And of course if you're going to do things

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.820
like biofuels
or continue to use fossil fuels thinking about

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.150
carbon
sequestration is critical. But one of my main

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.210
points here is that every one of these is
not a done deal

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.080
yet. None of these are major adoption. Except
for

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.600
nuclear, none of these have been adopted in
a major way

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.310
into our system. What makes the game change
with any of

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.150
these alternative energies? We talk about
them; we'd love to see them happen but they're

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.880
far away from happening yet. So one of the
places where we're thinking

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.000
a lot about this and Cliff introduced me as
being the

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.620
director of Argonne National Labs. I'm not
going to

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.290
spend a lot of time talking about national
labs, but I

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.730
just want to tell you how we're different
from academia

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.350
and how we're different from industry in what
when he do.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.370
But there's a huge difference in the kind
of research we do.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.080
It's mission-driven. So it looks a lot more
like a

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.880
Google or an AT&amp;T doing Bell Labs or like
an IBM doing Yorktown Heights doing research,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.490
fundamental research but with the idea maybe
not tomorrow maybe not in 5 years but 20 years

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.070
down the road
we want to make that game change. We want

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.251
to be able to
innovate, whether it's in nuclear, whether

00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:55.800
it's in solar,
whether it's in biofuels we want to make the

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.210
discoveries, the fundamental
discoveries that will impact. And that's what

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.430
I mean by
mission-driven. And, of course, at Argonne

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.970
we have over a thousand Ph.D.
researchers, smaller than probably the number

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.540
of
engineers that you have here. But still all

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.380
working in force
in science to deliver that mission. We do

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.029
a lot of cross-discipline work.
So another thing that distinguishes us from

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:19.640
for example
University is we aren't PI, singly, only PI

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.020
driven. Like you guys we have
a lot of meeting rooms, we have a lot of people

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.860
working together. So we
have material scientists working with computer

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.610
scientists
working with chemists and working with engineers

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.460
because
we also have a lot of engineering to try to

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.980
solve some of
these problems. It's somewhat different. There's

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.680
a
different imperative at a place like Argonne

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.752
than there is say at a
University. We have major facilities and I'll

00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:41.280
come back
to this later. Kinds of facilities we have

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.800
include
synchrotrons. Major accelerators that generate,

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.300
that allow us to study
materials and chemistries at the nano scale

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.430
that you
don't have anywhere else. They're open user

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.899
facilities. You
have one down the road at Stanford which you

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.620
can go and
you can use a free electron laser to do material

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.030
science for
example with very, very, very high resolution.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.960
And then we have
research networks. So one of the things we're

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.770
looking to
do, one of the reasons I'm happy to be here

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.540
today is to
talk about our networks. We work very hard

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.390
and not
in an insular way. We're working hard with

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.899
industry and we work
hard certainly with regional efforts. But

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:13.820
our
collaborations. We have people come into the

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.090
lab from
all around the country and internationally

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.470
as well. So
we have a very large set of networks that

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.589
we rely onto
solve some of these bigger problems. So we

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:25.410
could
probably sit here all day and brainstorm and

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.510
say, "what
would be game changers in energy? These are

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.390
a list of a few that I put
down last night, room temperatures superconductors.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.440
I'll come back to this. If we had a metal
that conducted

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.399
electricity without any loss at room temperature,
you'd

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:41.480
have a perfect transmission line for example,
and I'll come back to this one. If you could

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.620
create a
one penny per mile battery. Today we're talking

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.270
about
something that's almost 100 times more expensive.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.220
So that's why
the Volt is a great automobile, but it's got

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.390
a 15
kilowatt battery and that car costs 15,000

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.540
dollars. It's
a large fraction of the cost of the car. It's

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.660
also a large
fraction of the weight of the car. So one

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.180
cent per mile
battery is a game changer. Five cent a kilowatt

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.700
solar,
today its cheapest is 20 cents and that's

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.649
subsidized. So
it's really 50 cents to a dollar per kilowatt

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:11.390
hour.
Compared to for example what I pay at Argonne

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.060
for
electricity to power my big machines. I pay

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.510
5 cents a
kilowatt hour so it's got to be fully adopted

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.270
unless
you want to subsidize it which is something

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.130
California
has tried. You really have to get to make

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.490
something
transformational, you have to be at the 5

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.970
cent level.
The Internet-like power grid people talk about

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.430
all the time if
you have solar and wind and nuclear. Nuclear

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.890
is a
constant. Solar is very variable. Wind is

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.029
very variable. You really like to manage
the country's energy grid like you manage

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:40.131
the Internet.
The country is broken into three grids. There's

00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:43.670
the west
grid, east grid and then there's Texas believe

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.860
it or not.
But even within those grids, it's broken up.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.560
If you go
to the southern part of Illinois and look

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.640
over the border
of Kentucky, you'll see a 110 volt line running

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.160
across
someone's backyard to another backyard. You

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.350
can't
possibly share power. And in fact, that means

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.090
in
Illinois where we have a lot of nuclear, we

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.130
have a glut
of power. That's why I can pay so little for

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.891
it and why here
you're paying more than I'm paying. You're

00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:05.890
getting it
from a little bit farther away. The point

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.960
is if you could manage the grid like you
do the Internet, you could have a modern grid

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.339
and you
could do all, you could add all these renewables

00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:15.260
to it.
And the last I mentioned here we can debate,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.661
but fuels.
This is sort of fuels from sunlight. It's

00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:20.450
actually a
project that CalTech and Berkeley are working

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.830
very hard on now.
It's a great idea. The idea we want to mimic

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.459
a photosynthesis. We want to take CO2, H2O,
simple,

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:31.000
very simple molecules and with a photon from
the sun

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.990
produce alcohols; sugars, alcohols, ultimately
even sophisticated drop in

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.760
biofuels like biodiesel. If you can do that
at scale you'd

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.920
have something important. And we can debate
whether you

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.141
can do that or not. So what I thought I would
do is just

00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:47.171
start with an example of some of the stuff
we do. But I

00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:49.980
think also reflects on what I think as game
changing;

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.209
trying to change the game anyway. And that's
really

00:13:52.209 --> 00:13:56.100
thinking about 21st century transportation.
The U.S.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.610
just for some more numbers, the U.S. consumes
20 million

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:03.709
barrels of oil a day. Ok? If you could wean
all of our

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:06.970
transportation from using petroleum, using
gasoline to

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.980
electrifying it meaning you go from filling
a gas tank

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.230
to powering your vehicle with a cord. We've
estimated, and these are numbers we'll talk

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.649
about that in a minute, that you'd reduce
the consumption of oil by a third.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:20.660
That's about 7 million barrels a day. That's
a huge

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.630
change. So if you're talking about energy
independence,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.180
that's a good move. It's a good thing to do.
At the same time because so much of

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.430
the carbon produced comes from automobiles,
you save

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.020
about 25% of the carbon we produce. So both
really good things. We did this. We actually

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.270
have what
we call life cycle analysis at Argonne. We

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.950
did this for
the country. We've also done it for China.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.970
So if we did it
for the United States, we reduce the carbon

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.160
footprint by
25%. You could ask the same thing about China.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.990
This is an interesting point. If you take
China and ask,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.850
well let's say if we electrify and they have
goals

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.670
now to reach 10 million by 2025. Tell me an
electric vehicle ask does that reduce the

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.860
carbon footprint? The answer is no. It turns
out

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.260
because China is 80% coal powered plants.
Just by

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.490
shifting the power generation back to the
power plants,

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.029
you can say, "oh," you assume because you
have a battery

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:10.820
operated car, you're doing better. You don't.
In this country, we do because 20% of our

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.029
electricity is nuclear.
There's a large fraction that's natural gas,

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:18.279
10% is natural gas. There is a
lot of coal. There is a lot of fossil fuel

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:21.550
in there.
But the point is that you have to ask the

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.830
question.
It's a systemic question at the system level.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.769
And if you
don't ask that question you can't just assume

00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:29.930
well, doing
electric cars is a good thing. Well we think

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.430
it's a good
thing because in the U.S. we could have a

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.370
significant
impact on energy independence and on carbon

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.110
footprint.
What is one of the major challenges, and this

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.230
is where Argonne
spends a lot of its time, is how to store

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.320
energy in compact
spaces? This is really a chart to give just

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.810
meant to give you a sense of
where we are today and where we need to be.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.230
This is a funny chart, theoretical versus
practical specific

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.510
energies. Specific energies is just the amount
of energy I can pack per

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.050
kilogram of battery, okay? So just as a reference
I have

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.540
octane gasoline. Gasoline we're way far away
from

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.560
gasoline today, okay? And gasoline so if I
want to

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.830
power a car 400 miles, right? If I want to
move a car

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.130
400 miles on a single charge for example with
an electric

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.320
car. Today because I'm using lithium ion at
best, I

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.360
need a battery that's ten times the mass of
gasoline that

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.649
I put in my tank. So that's why, if you look
at the

00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:29.960
Chevy Volt, which I showed in the last slide.
If you

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.421
look at the battery in the Chevy Volt, it's
this massive

00:16:33.421 --> 00:16:38.769
thing underneath the car that weighs actually
more than 500 pounds and that

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:42.100
gets you 40 miles. If you want a factor of
ten, the battery has to be ten times

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.060
bigger and this is the reason: you just can't
get

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.209
enough energy per kilogram. So what we're
doing is

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:52.430
thinking about what's next. So batteries are
here,

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.630
lithium ion and all of the things you hear
in the

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.959
press about lithium ion. If we do great stuff
and we

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:00.410
are going to do great stuff we get a factor
of two in

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.779
energy density. The dot is actually spherical.
And

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:06.029
we're sort of at the bottom of that red oval.
So we get

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:08.779
a factor of two if we push really hard which
means that

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:11.569
the technology has to change. You can't use
lithium ion

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.010
to do what you really want to do, Americans
in

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.049
particular. China, if you're driving around
Beijing, you

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:19.209
might get away with a 40 mile vehicle but
in this

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:21.759
country, California, certainly in the Midwest
you're

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:24.169
not going to get away with a 50 mile vehicle
won't do it.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.630
You need a 400 mile vehicle. To do that, you
need to go

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.799
to these brand new technologies which I'll
talk about in

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:31.080
a minute. Lithium Air, Lithium Sulfur a new
way to

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.640
think about a battery. It's actually a battery
that

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.640
breathes oxygen and is able to get much higher
densities.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.359
There is by the way from a physicist's point
of view and I'm a physicist, a lot of room

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:45.410
at the top. Even if
I look at octane. Hydrogen bonds and octane

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.179
are what
store the energy. When we burn them that's

00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:49.940
what we
break. You get a lot of energy out of octane.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.919
But
octane isn't the theoretical limit. The theoretical

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:56.480
limit
on paper is about a factor of 100 greater

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.850
than todays batteries
and a factor of ten greater than even the

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.820
dream I have up
here to replace gasoline. And it's actually

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.230
getting down
to quantum devices which I won't talk about,

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.179
but from a
physicist's point of view there's a lot of

00:18:09.179 --> 00:18:11.649
room, a lot of
head room, meaning a lot of cool research

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:14.950
which is what
we're about. I just wanted to point that out.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:20.919
So here's just an example of a future battery.
We haven't built it yet. I would call this

00:18:20.919 --> 00:18:23.299
a known unknown. Because we don't know how
to

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:25.960
do it yet, but we know if we could build this
kind of

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.059
battery, we could get to the energy densities
that could

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:30.919
get you that 400 mile vehicle. I won't get
through the

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:34.220
details but it involves a different way to
think about batteries. Batteries always look

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.309
this way, there's a
cathode and anode. And the anode and cathode

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:41.730
are
differently charged. And lithium in a lithium

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.509
battery
shuttle back and forth usually through a liquid.

00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:47.350
When
you charge it, the lithium go over to this

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.450
cathode. And
when you discharge it, the lithium filters

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.859
back into the
anode. When you charge it back up like in

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.940
a lithium
battery, you drive the lithium back over into

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.879
the cathode
side. And that's how battery cycles. It's

00:18:57.879 --> 00:19:01.619
very simple.
And this is an advanced idea that we're working

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:04.690
on which
involves different kinds of cathodes and anodes.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.369
But
fundamentally it breathes. And it breathes

00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:10.150
because it
takes the lithium ion and combines it with

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.009
oxygen and
makes lithium peroxide. The challenge there

00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:14.659
it's
great because actually you get a lot of energy

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:17.120
out of
that bond. So you can get it out of that battery.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.039
But
the problem is breaking it. That's why we

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:22.850
need catalysts
to break lithium oxide and oxide bonds. But

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.720
if you made
a battery like this, the reason it's called

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.470
is because it
actually breathes. The oxygen comes in, burns

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.019
the
lithium, and goes out again. You have to be

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:33.149
able to have
it go out again. By the way, the problem,

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:37.929
that's a chemistry problem, breaking lithium
oxide. It's the same chemistry problem

00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:40.919
or similar to the one I need to make CO2,
H2O and

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:44.519
sunlight into sugar. So there's a lot of commonality
in

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:46.929
fundamental science we have to solve to make
these

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:49.539
exciting things happen. So this will give
you the energy

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:51.639
density. Just one other example is about nano
science. I know you guys

00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:54.559
have heard about nano science. This is just
a nano

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.730
science example. This is not for energy density
although

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.659
it gets high energy density. Using nano, you
can

00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:01.799
actually do fast charging. So one of the other
problems

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:04.419
when you think about range anxiety is, if
it takes eight

00:20:04.419 --> 00:20:06.600
hours to charge your car and it can only go
30 miles,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.159
what do you do when you get to work and how
do you get

00:20:09.159 --> 00:20:11.350
home? We have to think very differently about
how to

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.519
structure the batteries. And this is a way
to think

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:17.340
about it. You have to have a lot of porous
material that are dense. And it turns out

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.350
you can use a lot of things like this, which
is using a patterned array of these

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.490
titanium oxide tubes. The tubes are hollowed.
The

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.989
lithium can get in and out. It can do all
kinds of

00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:28.470
things. So you can actually do clever things
and we're

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.320
starting to think about using nano technology
also to

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.489
drive the speed and the density. So you're
combining

00:20:34.489 --> 00:20:37.350
these things. So this is just one example.
I'm talking

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.539
about energy density, I'm talking about speed
of charging. But in the end,

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:44.460
this is what we want. It's green. It's got
everything

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.289
we want. Creating an artificial leaf would
really be a dream.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.899
Today when you look at a leaf, this is green.
As my

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:54.259
Friend, Nate Lewis at CalTech would tell you,
if a leaf were really

00:20:54.259 --> 00:20:57.720
efficient at absorbing sunlight, it would
be black. The

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.600
fact is that a leaf is not very efficient
at taking

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.909
sunlight and converting it to sugars which
provide it

00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:06.159
with life. It's not efficient because it doesn't
need to

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:08.210
be. It's really interested in reproduction.
It's not

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.159
interested in producing at scale lots of material
lots

00:21:11.159 --> 00:21:14.159
of ethanol that we would like to have. So
we're

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:16.440
working. Lots of people are working on the
idea of

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.720
really taking a leaf. But there are many other
problems

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.510
like this. But taking a leaf and making fuels.
Learning

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.419
how it works. Learning how proteins work etcetera.
So this

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:29.529
is a very interesting problem, it's yet to
be solved.

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:32.409
One other point I'll make is just in case
you have a

00:21:32.409 --> 00:21:35.190
conversation at a cocktail party about biofuels
because

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.479
you all hear about it. I want to make one
point. The

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:43.179
average solar influx or flux on the surface
of the earth is about

00:21:43.179 --> 00:21:45.650
200 watts per square meter. So if you take
a square

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.669
meter and you ask how much sunlight do you
get, you get

00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:54.179
four or five light bulbs, good light bulbs.
And that's actually a lot. It

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:56.960
turns out that, if I want all the electricity
the U.S.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.559
uses, it's about three terawatts. If I take
the state of

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:02.249
Kansas, there's no one from Kansas here I
hope. I took the

00:22:02.249 --> 00:22:06.809
state of Kansas and I plastered it with solar
photovoltaics, I'd have enough electricity

00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:09.549
for the
entire country if I converted it roughly 50%

00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:13.150
with efficiency. The problem with
the leaf and even all the biofuels you hear

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.979
about, if it
take that same meter and say I grow grass

00:22:18.979 --> 00:22:22.239
and I want to
convert that grass to biofuels, like to swtichgrass

00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:26.269
or cellulosic materials. And I want to convert
that to fuel and then burn that. How much

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:29.659
energy do I
get? Remember, this thing is only about 0.1%

00:22:29.659 --> 00:22:32.190
efficient at converting that energy. So I'm
only using

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:37.429
about .1% of that 200 watts per meter squared.
So you ask me as physicist, I'd say you're

00:22:37.429 --> 00:22:40.480
much better
off with photovoltaics than biofuels. The

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.590
problem with
photovoltaics of course is that you have to

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.019
store the power. It's
automatically used. And that gets back to

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:46.830
the smart
grid. If you can bring it into the grid right

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.789
away
either by storing it in big batteries or actually

00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:53.629
using power generated
in southern California using it in places

00:22:53.629 --> 00:22:56.750
like Nevada --
or maybe Nevada has their own, or maybe sending

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:02.149
it up to Seattle.
That would be a dream. If you look at solar,

00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:04.499
I think in
the end its the answer but we're far away

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:07.860
from it
because we just don't have the solutions yet.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.820
So now I
want to talk a little bit about game changing.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.590
This is where I get
into my perspective as a condensed matter

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.399
materials physicist where
the game change and the technology begins.

00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:20.820
Everything
I've talked about whether it's a leaf or it's

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.350
a battery
involves fundamental materials, new materials.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.940
And I
just showed you the CCD really just involved

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.799
silicon. So
let me start off by reminding you what really

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:36.489
started the
revolution everyone in this room lives on

00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:39.669
which is, of
course, Moore's Law for Silicon Technology.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:44.109
The idea that
we all know Moore's law, right? Doubling every

00:23:44.109 --> 00:23:48.769
few years of the density of chips. And that
keeps going on and on.

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:50.799
And that's great. But you got to understand
that, before

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:56.940
we even got to the first 1k of processor or
the, you

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.229
know, the 404. I personally remember the 886.
I

00:24:00.229 --> 00:24:04.029
remember the first in college, that was what
I had. But

00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:09.019
that's been a metronome only because we understood
silicon at its deepest level. We understood

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:13.149
silicon way
back even before 1960 we understood what silicon

00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:16.529
was
like. We understood its electronic properties,

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:18.879
we
understand its optical properties, and we

00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:21.379
understood its
very fundamental science. So we were able

00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:25.440
to then with great
predictability take the risk of building a

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.590
billion dollar
manufacturing plant. Intel could do it and

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.929
easily just
say we'll invest the billion because we know

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:32.639
where we're
going to be in ten years. We know exactly

00:24:32.639 --> 00:24:34.350
where we're going to be. Moore's law is of
course not a

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.139
law, it's a conjecture. But the fact is that
we knew a lot about

00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:40.259
the material. The problem with most the other
things I've

00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:44.299
been talking about, all the energies stuff,
we don't know what the answer is. The

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:46.620
materials are more complicated than silicon,
the systems

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.269
are much more complicated than a transistor
built on

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:53.479
silicon. And so, what I have on this little
patch, I applogize, it's pretty

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:57.320
cryptic. It shows a road map for batteries.
We're right down

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.359
here today. We're with lithium metal oxide
anodes and

00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:09.479
graphite anodes, so it would be an anode and
a cathode. And this shows you by the time

00:25:09.479 --> 00:25:11.809
you get
out to about 2019, we don't even know what

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:14.830
kinds of
anodes you're going to get based on the kinds

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.629
of energy densities
that road map projects. So I told you we're

00:25:17.629 --> 00:25:20.649
have to get up toward gasoline. We're talking
about

00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:23.720
2019 and 2021 getting closer to gasoline.
But we don't

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.759
even know what the materials are going to
be. So if you

00:25:25.759 --> 00:25:28.190
want me to go out and say I have an answer
for you, it's

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.970
going to be very hard for anyone to, a company
to say,

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.090
"fine we'll build a manufacturing plant at
100 million

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.289
dollars before we even know the materials."
So the real

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:41.200
challenge today in energy at the very fundamental
level

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.080
is understanding the materials we have. Understanding
how to make and how to predict materials that

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.440
we can use
to do the kinds of things I've been talking

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.779
about. To
generate a battery that's got 400 miles behind

00:25:50.779 --> 00:25:53.499
it. And
so, the way we know how to do that. In fact,

00:25:53.499 --> 00:25:56.599
we know.
This is actually I just got this two days

00:25:56.599 --> 00:25:59.559
ago. I don't
know if you guys know Bob Laughlin. He's a

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:02.570
college up at Stanford University. He won
a Nobel Prize

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.240
for something called the fractional quantum
hall effect but he's a condensed matter physicist.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.639
This equation here, H, which is called the
Hamiltonian is

00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:10.919
really the equation of everything. If I could
solve this

00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:13.870
equation, I would know everything I need to
know about a

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.249
material. He just wrote this down on paper
before he

00:26:16.249 --> 00:26:19.990
gave his Nobel lecture. I'm not going to solve
this

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.330
equation for you. I know solving equations
is always

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.919
risky at giving a talk. I'm just showing it
to tell you, that in

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.190
principle, I can I write down an equation
that will tell me everything about the electrons

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.970
and atoms in any solid including in your body.
So the proteins in

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.419
your body, life itself. And you can see the
list he

00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:37.950
made. If we could solve this equation, then
we would

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.299
know everything from how to put together an
economist

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:44.989
which he said as a joke all the way back to
Ebola virus, glass, wood

00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:49.519
and batteries. You could do everything. All
this is the first two terms, the first term

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:52.239
is just the kinetic
energy of electrons, the second is kinetic

00:26:52.239 --> 00:26:54.899
energy of
nuclei. The third term is the interaction

00:26:54.899 --> 00:26:57.220
between the
electrons and the nuclei. And the fourth and

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.200
fifth
terms are the interactions between the electrons

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.559
respectively
and nuclei respectively. If you have that,

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:05.710
you have
everything in a solid: whether it's a protein,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.970
protein
in a leaf that's doing catalysis or whether

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.349
it's an Ebola
virus, you know everything about that material.

00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:16.760
The problem is we just can't solve this equation.
We can't solve it for silicon. So, for silicon,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.649
if you
ask what are its optical properties, this

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:21.149
won't help give
you that answer, because you can't solve this

00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:23.360
equation.
And the reason you can't solve it is because

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.940
it's a very
Complicated, many-bodied problem. But things

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.070
are starting
to change and that's one of the reasons I

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.960
wanted to, I'm excited about it. Computing
is actually

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.889
slowly becoming, computing has always been
important

00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:36.561
for us because we model stuff. You go out
and you

00:27:36.561 --> 00:27:38.440
measure something and you model stuff. So
physicists and

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.399
chemists and scientists you guys take data
and you model

00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:44.400
it. It's always been possible to model. But
what we

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.859
haven't ever been able to model are the properties
of

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:52.210
materials because the complexity of that simple-looking
equation. But we're actually really at a transition

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.289
point in
and out. We're at a petaflop of computing

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:59.190
ability. So
we're just starting to taste the ability to

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.129
do things
that we never were able to do before. We're

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:03.500
not there
yet, but we're close to it. So this is the

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.710
K computer. You guys may have heard they just
pulled last week as the fastest computer in

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.409
the world.
For the last three computers, they haven't

00:28:10.409 --> 00:28:13.350
been here.
They've been overseas unfortunately, two in

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:21.359
China, sorry, one in China and two
in Japan K computer. It's a 10 petaflop machine.

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:23.809
And of course
what we're pushing towards is the exit scale.

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:26.399
At 10
petaflops we can start thinking about taking

00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:29.451
the equation
and actually modeling real materials. Understanding

00:28:29.451 --> 00:28:31.649
the
properties of those real materials ultimately

00:28:31.649 --> 00:28:33.999
to predict the
properties of materials. So I might be able

00:28:33.999 --> 00:28:37.649
to tell a
manufacturer one day "I'll tell you exactly

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.179
what
materials you can build. If you want to build

00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:41.721
a battery
that's got a 400 mile range here are the materials

00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:43.809
you
need." So it's what I call materials by design,

00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:47.210
and I'll come back to that. But
there's some challenges here. First you're

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.929
still solving a
many-bodied problem. And when you talk about

00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:52.750
these parallel computers, there
are problems you can solve today especially

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.200
local
problems like hydrodynamics. So for example,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.899
one of the
things we're using these major computers for

00:28:56.899 --> 00:28:59.929
now Boeing
uses them for example to eliminate wind tunnels.

00:28:59.929 --> 00:29:01.760
You can
do things like hydrodynamics. You can do wind

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.539
dynamics. So you can
actually design an airplane. In fact the 787

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:08.629
is entirely
designed using computers like this at Boeing.

00:29:08.629 --> 00:29:11.259
That's
great. But still those are fairly local problems.

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:13.289
When
you get to problems like climate, which is

00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:17.719
very
multiscale and very complex, or a solid -- take

00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:21.149
just a
hunk of material like lithium oxide. We still

00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:23.779
can't do
it with this computer. So that's one challenge.

00:29:23.779 --> 00:29:25.909
We're
still working on it. We're getting closer.

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:27.320
The other
thing is you know these computers are pretty

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.889
energy
intensive. So there's actually buried underneath

00:29:29.889 --> 00:29:32.989
these fast
computers is actually the energy challenge.

00:29:32.989 --> 00:29:34.679
Physicists
always thought of the challenge with computing

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:37.580
as being
the transistor itself. And as you get to higher

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.669
and
higher densities of chips, you get to fewer

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:41.469
and fewer
electrons per switch. And when you get down

00:29:41.469 --> 00:29:43.909
to one
electron per switch it's quantum mechanical.

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:46.029
So you
switch it and it's either on or off. That's

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:48.059
not good
enough. So that's the problem we thought was

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:50.419
the
problem. The real problem today is heat. Each

00:29:50.419 --> 00:29:52.649
of those
transistors leaks. Each of those transistors

00:29:52.649 --> 00:29:55.549
have leakage
current. Turns out this machine well, a one

00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:59.519
petaflop
machine is about a megawatt of power. A 10

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:01.919
petaflop
machine is about three to four megawatts of

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:03.960
power. And
we want to go to an exit scale 1,000 times

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.419
faster. So
we're talking about a small nuclear power

00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:09.429
plant to power
an exit scale computer. So we think these

00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:12.080
are solveableproblems.
But we have problems to solve within the computers

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.500
Themselves which is pretty cool. So let me
finish by

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.261
saying on this particular topic which is to
say we are

00:30:18.261 --> 00:30:22.249
making inroads on being able to take that
kind of machine

00:30:22.249 --> 00:30:25.369
and compute properties and predict properties,
right?

00:30:25.369 --> 00:30:28.369
Which for the first time really, ever, in
the last few years.

00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:30.950
Because once we get to a petaflop, we can
take that

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.519
equation and solve it on a computer. It's
hard to solve

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:35.970
analytically, but you could solve it on a
computer. And

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.070
that's what we're starting to be able to do.
And this is just

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.600
some work done by Gerd Cedar from MIT; we
work closely with him. And he's doing things

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.720
like taking that Hamiltonian complicated somewhat
complicated equation and

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.929
solving it on a computer. And what we're able
to do now

00:30:49.929 --> 00:30:55.460
is, instead of trying lots and lots of Edisonian
approaches to materials and that's what we

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.059
do with
batteries, for example. We try intelligently.

00:30:58.059 --> 00:31:02.159
We use high power
thinking as well as high power computing.

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:04.659
But this kind
of computing will actually allow you to start

00:31:04.659 --> 00:31:06.509
narrowing
down the kinds of materials. And in fact,

00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:09.139
Gerd just worked on
Lithium ion batteries and predicted two new

00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:11.549
materials
which have been pretty good. So we're starting

00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:15.269
to be able to do it but we're probably a few
years off from being able to

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:18.469
solve the major problems. And one of the reasons
just to

00:31:18.469 --> 00:31:21.179
give you a reason why it's so hard not to
show you a

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:24.950
fancy physics equation. This is just a material
you may

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.149
have heard of high temperature superconductor.
And

00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:30.389
its constituents are Yttrium, Barium and Copper,
which if

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:33.660
you just pick up are normal boring metals.
But, if you

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.229
put them together in a very interesting form
which

00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:39.511
essentially is made up of planes of copper
and oxygens. I have to add oxygen, I don't

00:31:39.511 --> 00:31:43.109
have it up there.
And then separate those planes basically by

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:45.989
Barium and
Yttrium, you end up with things that superconduct.

00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:48.369
And I
mentioned superconductivity before as one

00:31:48.369 --> 00:31:49.369
of those things I
mentioned before as being those things that

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:52.269
could really
transform the grid for example. So we could

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:54.359
never
predicted this material. It was a bunch of

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:56.440
guys in a
laboratory just like the first two in the

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.919
CCD who were
playing around with materials and thought

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:01.450
they had
something cool and when they discovered

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.940
superconductivity, it was just a eureka moment.
They

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.960
never thought they would get it. They got
it. And in

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.489
fact, this problem is still not solved. Physicists
still

00:32:08.489 --> 00:32:11.961
don't understand why the stuff superconducts
at 90. We now

00:32:11.961 --> 00:32:16.150
have one at about 130 degree kelvin, even.
So it's still a challenge, these fundamental

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.739
materials problems. We can't predict certainly
can't predict how to make this

00:32:19.739 --> 00:32:23.130
material. Nobody could have. But even now
we don't understand in hindsight how this

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.549
material was made. But I'll
come back to the energy grid. If we could

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:30.889
solve the
problem and generate 90 degree superconductor

00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:33.649
is great
because it works at liquid nitrogen temperature.

00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:35.169
So you
could still use it. Liquid nitrogen is not

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:38.710
so expensive.
So out in Long Island, this is the Long Island

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.039
Power
Authority, used to be called LILCO for those

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.039
of you that
know New York.

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:45.240
Actually it took three superconducting cables
with a

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.039
carrying capacity of 500 megawatts. That's
huge. That's

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:53.370
about as much power as a major power station
generates. In just these three cables, their

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:57.729
able to generate and transmit that kind of
power. So this is just a test bed.

00:32:57.729 --> 00:33:00.129
The reason you see these fat pipes is that
they have to drive

00:33:00.129 --> 00:33:04.580
liquid nitrogen through them. But one day
you could image having these thing across

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.239
the grid, replacing old copper with things
like

00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:12.669
this that really could transform the grid
with losses.

00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:15.279
So there's one more point I wanted to make.
I

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:17.330
wouldn't call it a sour point but it really
is a struggle

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.519
for this kind of activity material science.
I hope

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:24.019
I'm getting across the point that material
science is really at

00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:28.030
the heart of all these energy technologies.
Whether it's chemistry like photolysis like

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.979
in plants or whether it's new
materials like in batteries or super conductors.

00:33:31.979 --> 00:33:34.859
This is
a chart which only goes to 2007 but it hasn't

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:39.359
changed out to 2010 or 2011. Which kind of
says the

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:43.500
state of the U.S. is. And this is just, it's
done in a

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.810
certain way. It's by measuring publications,
percentage of publications since 1992.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.700
And you see the United States has fallen in
fact, we're

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:58.010
now well behind China on production just of
knowledge.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.649
Just basic knowledge. The knowledge that feeds
this kind

00:34:01.649 --> 00:34:03.979
of important technology. We're just not doing
as much

00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:07.119
anymore. These are just examples. This is
an example

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:09.420
within a particular kind of field material
synthesis.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.810
But the point is we're not doing as much.
I sort of

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:17.960
attribute that to two things. One is you guys.
Because a lot of kids want to do

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.659
co-development, they want to do algorithms.
They want to do apps. They

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:24.270
want to do fun stuff that you guys allow them
to do. And

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.700
that's great, because we're attracting a lot
of bright

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.540
early people. I look out at the audience and
a lot of early career people here and that's

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.130
good. There's a lot of people being turned
away.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.610
There's another reason too and the reason
is that the big labs

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.970
like Bell Labs and IBM no longer do this stuff
at all.

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:41.220
The U.S. used to have these big labs embedded
in

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.410
Companies much like you do, you're a vertically
integrated

00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:47.010
company. You go all the way up to the applications
from

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.380
very basic code development. We don't have
that in the

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.570
United States anymore so we don't have the
vertically

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.050
integrated companies that drive mission. And
it's one of

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.090
the things that the DOE labs are trying to
fill the hole. So

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.090
let me sort of wrap things up a little bit
here. So come

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.610
back to this concept of how does it game change?
And

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.740
maybe some of you have seen this kind of chart
before.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.140
This is actually from the New York Times.
They haven't

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.570
done it recently so it's a little outdated.
But it give

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:17.140
you a sense of what adoption of new energy
or just

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.860
technology in general look like everything
from the

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.730
telephone which took 50, 80 years to adopt
to

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.000
Internet which was adopted very quickly. The
trend is as you get

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.050
closer and closer to modern technologies,
things go

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.660
faster and faster. The question is what will
energy

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.580
technologies look like? It's my contention
that we

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.260
believe we can make it go very fast, but there
are a lot

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.400
of hurdles to go over to get there. There's
a lot of

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.100
material problems to solve. There could be
eureka

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.720
moments, but in the end, we can't rely on
eureka moments.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.730
It really involves critical mass of people
like you guys

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.610
sitting around thinking through the problems
much like

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.290
Boyle and Smith did back in the late 60s.
And my concern

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.350
on this chart ask do we have the people sitting
this part

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.890
of the curve really thinking through the materials
problems, the chemistry problems -- that we

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.880
address.
It used to be we did this kind of stuff at

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.630
a place like Bell Labs. I
spent 15 years here. I don't know if anyone

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.920
of you have
ever been in Bell Labs. It's where C programming

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.310
language was invented. That was invented in
this wing here on the left. The wing on the

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.230
right. So the
left wing just so you know it wasn't entirely

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.900
integrated.
The left wing was where all code developers

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.370
and software and
guys like Richie sat. The right-hand side

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.980
was where all
the physical scientists where I was. Way before

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.800
my time
you could walk down that hall, called the

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.500
infinite corridor and you walk down the hall
and there's a little

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.610
plaque. It's where the transistor was invented.
That kind of place doesn't exist in material

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.661
science
anymore. It doesn't exist in chemistry. It

00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:42.520
doesn't
exist in this fundamental technology developments

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.140
in many ways
anymore aside from places like this in this

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.550
country. And
so, we're trying to recreate that. So once

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:53.410
we develop
these things here we believe that we're starting

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.640
to bring
National Labs into play in a very big way.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.850
This is a
picture of my lab. There are 17 of us in National

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.650
Lab.
There's one in Stanford, Berkeley, we have

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.530
one outside of
Chicago associated with the University of

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:10.410
Chicago. This
is just one of the devices we use to do discovery

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.890
science. This is a synchrotron which is about
a kilometer around. Electrons whiz around

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.110
at the speed of light and they generate x-rays
and we use

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:22.890
those x-rays to study things like new materials
for cathodes like catalytic processes.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:25.260
This is a nano science building here where
I showed you that

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.241
battery of nano tubes that was developed there.
So we

00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:31.920
provide these tools and we're trying to regenerate
that

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.990
ecosystem where we vertically integrate where
we have

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.940
people doing fundamental science but also
in other places

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.510
besides this at the laboratory. See Chicago
in the

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.140
background if you look carefully. The other
places in

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.030
the laboratory, which is about 1500 acres,
we have people who are doing engineering

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.860
working closely with companies like General
Motors. Working closely

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.390
with companies like Ford and Mitsubishi to
try to solve some of those

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:57.190
challenging problems. And of course here at
Google is

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.220
where we're changing the world too. Really
game

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.850
changing. The challenge I had with Google,
of course,

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:05.050
Google X now we've read about in the New York
Times.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:10.520
Maybe you guys can tell me, this is the best
you can do if you Google Google X. I assume

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.090
when you're doing at Google X is also game
changing and

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:17.670
maybe you can tell me what's going on. If
you Google

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:23.970
Google X you get this but that's also where
the game is changing. What

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.920
the Times said if you put people in different
disciplines

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.460
who aren't doing the same things together
and just let

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.710
them have fun, in other words let them really
try new things.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.560
Let them try to solve the problem of the battery.
Just

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.570
let them go do it. Give them as much latitude
as they

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.610
want, or let them go solve the problem of
solar

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:45.120
energy or photovoltaics. And that's really
important. And this is my last slide. Just

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.110
to repeat again. This is
just up the road from you. This is at SLAC

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.790
National
Accelerator Lab which is if you is like Argonne.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.460
We are
run by the University of Chicago. This is

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.690
run by
Stanford University and what you see here

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.940
is the future. You can't
tell it, it's just a time lapse photo at night,

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:07.670
is the next generation of sources for xrays.
I showed you this big ring which was a Synchrotron.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.690
This which you can't see because it's
buried beneath some of these buildings which

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.720
is a Linac about 3
kilometers long and it's the world's first

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.540
X-ray laser.
So you remember back in the early 60s when

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.740
the laser was
invented which was also at Bell Labrotoriess

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.980
and Columbia
University, it changed the world. Lasers changed

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:30.030
the way we communicate, they changed everything.
That was a game changer. This was a new type

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:33.160
of lasers but instead of
visible light like the red light in the pointers

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.310
or green lights in the pointers, this is actually
using very, very high

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:40.270
energy light called X-rays. And its capabilities
are

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.691
unbelievably dramatic. This is just up the
road from you

00:39:42.691 --> 00:39:45.500
guys. This is the kind of thing that will
change the

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.880
game one day but hasn't done it yet. So I
think I'll

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:58.350
stop there and open it up for any questions.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.850
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:08.130
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So one of your points there was
that photovoltaics had

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.150
to get down to five cents to be competitive.
But they're

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.380
being competitive within an industry that's
externalized a

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.640
lot of its costs. So there's another way to
change the

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.640
game.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.500
&gt;&gt;Isaacs: I would agree with you actually.
My public statement is

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.730
that. I fully agree with you. If you look,
this

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.010
country is free market economy. Everything
has to be

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:33.360
driven by free market. But I think you hit
on an important point.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.040
Energy is anything but free market. It's run
by two

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.370
groups utilities, which are regulated like
crazy. So

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.220
for example, your utilities can't raise the
rates by a

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.940
nickel to put in big solar because they are
more

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.120
expensive, but they can't. If they did, they
would create the market.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.210
So that's one way you could do it. And then
of course,

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.800
it's petroleum and that's a cartel. So we
have no control

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.470
over the cartel, mostly in the Middle East.
In fact, I was asked,

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:05.460
I was on a panel about a month ago with the
Electric Chemical Society and I was asked,

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:10.630
it was a great question, in the end what is
really the challenge to getting these

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.270
energy technologies out? Is it policy or is
it

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.010
technology? And three years ago before I became
director

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.210
of the lab, I easily would have said, "I'm
a physicist;

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:22.880
it's technology. We got to invent new technology."
Today I would say a lot of it is policy. We

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.840
don't have a coherent energy policy in this
country.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.470
China does. So they are spending more, even
in China, they're spending more per

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.160
kilowatt than I told you here. But there's
policy to level

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.480
the playing field. And that's I think your
point. It

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.360
isn't a level playing field for a small company
trying to do

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.720
solar versus the utilities. I don't think
the utilities

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.981
are intentionally keeping out solar. It's
just they have

00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:45.120
to deliver power to you at a cost. They can't
lose

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.651
money. So they have to do what they have to
do. So I

00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:51.330
agree with you. That is probably one of the
major issues

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:54.290
around adopting these technologies. It's a
little

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.250
different than the IT revolution in the sense
there

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.580
wasn't anything competing, right? Now of course
there is

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.360
something competing. It's called oil.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:10.390
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So I was wondering if you'd also
talk about the role

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.830
of public perception in energy game changers
too. I'm

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.080
thinking of like the move, the potential of
something

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.490
like thorium but then people when they think
of nuclear

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:26.210
power they think meltdowns, Chernobyl and
Japan. So can education change the game too?

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.530
&gt;&gt; Isaacs: Yeah, actually that's a very good
question. In fact, I just wrote an

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.860
article in the Huffington Post about this
exact problem.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.620
The public perception about energy in general
is not very

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.500
well defined because we haven't done a good
job of

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.190
talking about it. You bring up nuclear and
that's the

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.270
hottest button there is out there. That always
brings out the

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.970
best and worst of people out there. People
are either

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.600
very afraid of it because it's nuclear; don't
understand

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.630
it. They see the risks. Nuclear by the way
is safer

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.100
than coal. More people die of rearing coal
than they ever will

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.832
of nuclear power. So educating people about
those risks, I mean it's only fair that the

00:43:00.832 --> 00:43:05.760
public gets to
decide the risk/cost benefit sort of analysis.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.490
But in
the end we don't have the right information

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.990
out there.
So one of the things we've been pushing for

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:12.390
at the lab
and I think all over the country is a much

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.500
clearer education
about what these different technologies mean,

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.540
what they really cost,
for example what their impact on the environment

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.191
really is. What nuclear's real impact
is is a very good question. It's really easy

00:43:23.191 --> 00:43:25.150
to dig coal
out of the ground. But look at how many people

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.140
die in
coal mines every year. It sounds easy, but

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.940
it's really
not. And we don't hear those stories. But

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:35.200
you'll hear about, Fukushima was a
terrible accident, but we don't know yet the

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.480
full extent
of that accident, but even that you could

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.070
argue worked
right for what it was, it worked okay. And

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.240
not many
people died. So there is a real issue about

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.051
education
which we don't really think about. So I would

00:43:49.051 --> 00:43:51.370
advocate
that we think about it in high schools in

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.942
K through 12 and we
think about incorporating it much more. And

00:43:53.942 --> 00:43:57.420
we see that.
My kids 13-year-old and a 17-year-old. They

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.110
see more of it in
their chemistry classes. But it really needs

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.390
to be a national
effort educate people on at least so they

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.940
can understand the
risks involved with each of these technologies.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:14.140
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Speaking of education. I do a
lot of education work.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.470
And you mention Google is people are attracted
to it

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:23.970
because we attract a lot of programmers, developers,
people who want to develop apps. And the critical

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.930
part
of that is the barrier of entry is very low

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:32.100
when it comes to doing
computer programming. My 8-year-old cousin

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.490
is writing
his first computer program right now. Material

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.310
science
is a little different. Is there any way to

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.030
really bring
material science into a classroom or create

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.050
small hands-on kits that really get people
involved?

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.520
&gt;&gt; Isaacs: You know, when I grew up, everyone
had chemistry kits.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.580
My kids never had a chemistry kit. I probably
could have

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.900
bought them one. [chuckle] But there's risks.
There you go, no.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.320
&gt;&gt; Male #3: You can't buy one anymore.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.930
&gt;&gt;Issacs: You can't buy one anymore, okay.
So I think basically it's

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.920
not just because it's easy, there is a lower
barrier. It's also because we don't

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.250
talk about it. But also frankly industry isn't
here

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.490
anymore. I have graduate students in physics.
You see

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.990
that the culture in physics has changed since
I was a grad

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.160
student at MIT many years ago. Then people
were going

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.070
into it partially to be physicists. But also
they

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.910
realized they could go to Intel they could
go to IBM, they could go to Bell Labs. I

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.140
went to Bell Labs. That was my dream since
I was 15, 17

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:31.500
whatever. Part of it was just me because I
had that but I think a lot of

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.640
people don't hear about these things so much
anymore.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.250
All we hear about are apps. That's not a bad
thing. You

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.770
know, I look at University of Chicago. Has
this great

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:44.370
new entrepreneurial center built by actually
Michael

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.480
Polsky. Michael Polsky is a wind entrepreneur.
He actually

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.001
built wind companies out of Chicago. He's
made a fair

00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:52.260
amount of money doing it. And he contributed
some money

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.960
to the University of Chicago. In their first
five years or four years of

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.980
existence, they raised 130 million dollars.
Around here

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.440
that's nothing, but in Chicago, that's a big
deal. 130

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:06.690
million dollars of startup funds out of the
Chicago and Bay area. Every single one of

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.900
them was for apps. Different kinds of apps.
So the kids

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.170
are really excited by entrepreneurship but
what your trying to say look at the

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:19.550
low barrier. Look at the big companies in
Chicago, Groupon, StubHub, GrubHub, sorry.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.550
These are all companies that came out of the
same kind of

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:24.900
milieu. It's not a bad thing. I'm not speaking
against

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.310
that. The question is how do we excite those
other group

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:33.180
of kids? So, you know, if you look at University
graduate departments today, they're probably

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.150
50% foreign,
Chinese, Indian. And these days everyone's

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.790
going back to
China. Not as much India, but India also.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.230
People are
going home. There are a lot of great opportunities

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:43.390
at home.
There's nothing wrong with that either. But

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.110
we're not
exciting our young kids in different ways.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:51.900
Whether it's
just chemistry sets or better education programs.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.360
I
think we need to do that and we don't do that

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.130
very much.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.920
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I'm going to ask you a complementary
question for the

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.100
last one. I was a JBEI until a couple of months
ago and I saw ten post docs there for every

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.440
job there
was to be had. Once you finish your post doc.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.250
What can
we do with our flood of post docs to turn

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.140
them into productive
researchers?

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:22.630
&gt;&gt;Isaacs: Send them to us. [chuckle] That
gets back to, it is a

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.970
complementary. Again, I'm not going to complain
here.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.600
I'm going to make an observation. And it is
a true

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.570
observation. We don't make the high end stuff
so much

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:31.830
anymore, even the middle end stuff in this
country.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:35.150
It's cheaper to do it elsewhere. We think
it's cheaper

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:39.380
it elsewhere. Not always. What would you tell
your post

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:45.220
doc if they choose to go into manufacturing
working on a

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.130
assembly line or actually working on an Intel
line for

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.260
example in China versus staying here and working
in Google.

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.580
So it's really hard to convince people when
we don't do

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.810
Stuff, when we don't make stuff in this country.
There's one path that says we'll only own

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:02.460
the
high end IP and we'll actually never make

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.920
stuff ever again.
People say we've given up manufacturing, so

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.350
you're never gonna get that same. The nine
post

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:15.590
docs that don't take the job at JBEI won't
end up doing stuff

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.210
here. They'll end up either teaching or they'll
go into

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.990
this business. And that's a problem. But if
we don't make

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:25.350
stuff, if we don't have a large set of jobs
out there

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:29.560
which are associated with the physical sciences,
the stuff I'm talking about, materials, then

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.660
I would
argue also that you wouldn't. There is a move

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.870
afoot to try and recapture manufacturing.
Whether we should be doing

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.310
that or not is a political question. I can
give you my opinion

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.580
which is we have to. But if you talk to half
of

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.420
Congress now doesn't believe that at all.
Maybe 51?of Congress doesn't believe that

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.820
at all that
restarting manufacturing here, advanced manufacturing.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:54.200
I'm not talking about, you know, sweatshops
and clothing.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.760
I'm talking about high end stuff like even
beyond

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.840
batteries, right? Solar photovoltaics. If
you talk to

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.050
AMAT, Applied Materials, just down the road
here, all of their plants are now in China,

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:08.080
in Asia, Singapore, China. So we're
not making stuff and if we're not going to

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.180
make the
high end stuff, if we cede that, then I have

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.360
a hard time saying what are those
nine post docs that don't get jobs at CalTech

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.960
or Berkeley
do.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:26.160
[pause]
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Just back to this slide that you're

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.960
looking at the
superconducting out there a few generations

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.750
away. What
are some of the other properties you're looking

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.760
for in
those solid materials other than super connectivity,

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.260
battery storage capability.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.900
&gt;&gt;Isaacs: That's a good question. So one I
mentioned which I

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.700
didn't articulate very much is, you want to,
more on

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.600
the biology side of materials, you want to
learn how

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:53.610
to, this is something that JBEI does actually,
you

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.160
want to learn how to co-opt. For example take
algae.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.870
Algae is very intelligent at chewing grass
processing in

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:05.320
its gut through digestion enzymes, proteins
basically in the gut and creating things

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.460
like fuels. And so, Jay Keasling and his friends
at JBEI, you can probably talk about

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.240
this as well as I, have been very clever.
The problem

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.100
with that, let me give you an example. If
you take

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:20.280
algae and you can genetically engineer it.
Actually we know how to do that, genetically

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.600
engineer that. It's
still materials, but it's biology, biomaterials.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.050
Genetically engineer the thing so it produces
let's say

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:31.220
ethanol or even a higher more sophisticated
version closer to biofuel like a diesel.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.430
The problem is that typically that algae dies
because

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:38.700
it's like sitting in ethanol that kills life.
So JBEI's

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.540
been able to do, maybe you did this. I don't
know. It

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.020
engineers that algae so it doesn't die. It
can keep

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.970
excreting that stuff and live in that environment
so that it can start thinking about

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.490
producing more of it. So that's one thing
that would be

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:55.900
great to either co-opt the algae but of course
I said in the end it

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.490
still requires sunlight and you need huge
algae ponds to

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:03.410
do it and whether or not we have the area
to do it. The real question, the real challenge

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:08.410
is that can you make chemistries that mimic
life that can do the catalysis in

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:13.330
a beaker not in an algae farm? I don't know
whether you have an opinion. My opinion is

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.630
you need to
do that. One day you need to co-opt it from

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:20.530
a chemical point of
view so you can scale it. So a place like

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:23.140
the large
chemical companies like Dow, DuPont or Archer

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:28.280
Daniels Midland can
take very very dense cellulosic material and

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.900
make it into. So that's one
example. Photovoltaics are another example.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.550
The
efficiency of today's photovoltaics the best

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:43.100
are about 7, 8% and you need 20, 30 even 40%
to make them useful. To do that we're not

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.130
just going to
use just a hunk of silicon. Silicon is actually

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.500
not very good for optics. Then the other semiconductors
like gallium arsenide are too

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.050
expensive. So you need to come up with some
kind of

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:57.930
interesting multidimensional nano material
that can

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.330
absorb the sunlight very, very efficiently
so it's black and

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.440
not green like a leaf. And then convert that
sunlight

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.490
into electron in a hole and basically charge
a battery with it or

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:13.050
send it onto a grid. We don't have that material
yet. A material that can

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:17.420
do that in a big way. I mean, I can go on
and on. These

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.300
are just examples. Everything that I can tell
you even

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.500
take nuclear energy actually. We're at the
end of life.

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.890
We have 104 reactors in this country. The
last one that

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:30.110
was built was somewhat just before Three Mile
Island

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.060
occurred. We haven't built one since then.
Look,

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:37.530
they're all at least 40 years old and some
of them are 60 years old, 55 anyway. So we're

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:40.160
extending their life. The materials in those
containment

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.910
vessels are embrittled. We have to learn a
lot about how to make materials that withstand

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:50.330
defects that are induced
by neutrons for example. So a lot of good

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:54.990
problems to
solve for the right reasons. We're only working

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.380
on some
of them; not on all of them. We're getting

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.340
beat out. I
kind of made that point. We're kind of getting

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.690
beat out
by a lot of countries now. It's not to say

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:04.400
we still don't have the
smartest guys in the world. I mean Stanford

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.720
itself, the physics department there has a
great group of people doing this work and

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.480
they're great. And they have a critical
mass, but it's only one of many places. If

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.940
you go to
China, there's tremendous number of activities

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.970
like that.
Any other questions?

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:24.340
&gt;&gt;Male #1: How close are we to something like
solar shingles

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.960
where you would just replace your regular
shingles by solar shingles and just?

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.700
&gt;&gt; Isaacs: At cost. There's actually a DOE
program out this called

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.890
SunShot. And the SunShot program it has I
think

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:42.250
it's by 20, I want to say 2017 or 18 they're
shooting to do

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:45.850
that basically. They're look at the cost.
I gave you 7 cents per

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:52.020
kilowatt hour unsubsidized. So to your point
before, if you ask me it's

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.940
somewhere between 2017 and 2050. If you'd
asked me what the ideal would be, I'd say

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.140
we
should have left Yucca Mountain open. We should

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.540
have
built out a couple of nuclear reactors to

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:04.320
compensate,
instead of growing coal which is what we're

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.270
doing, we
grow nuclear. And then by 2050, we'll solve

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:12.890
the solar
problem entirely. A slide I dropped out of

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.070
this talk, if you look at just the usable
land,

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:18.910
we have about 10,000 terawatts of sunlight.
And I told

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.991
you we only need about 15,000 terawatts on
the face of the

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:26.520
earth today. So again, there's a lot of headroom,
physicists headroom. So it just

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.040
seems to me that we have to get to that time.
I'm giving you a big range because there could

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.240
be
some eureka moments in the material development.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.880
And if there
are then it will be accelerated. But the adoption

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.750
curve I
would say it's still probably, we'll see.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:45.309
Germany is actually
the best producer of solar now, good, good

00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:50.650
solar panels. They're very expensive.
China makes the most solar panels. They're

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.450
not as good,
but you could argue you could buy them today.

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:55.350
They're
still more expensive than pumping electricity

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.860
into a wire through your grid. by a lot. If
your willing to pay more, you could do it

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:04.260
today. But if you want to do it at cost, it's
probably ten years, five to

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:05.460
ten years.

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.270
&gt;&gt;Male #6: [inaudible]

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:14.480
&gt;&gt; Isaacs: I know, well here, maybe it's easier
here. For a while California had a

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.844
program it was a tax subsidy, right? For installing
solar panels on your roof. I forget the name

00:55:18.844 --> 00:55:22.960
of the
program. It was okay. I think it's no longer.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.450
I think
that's probably because--

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.170
&gt;&gt; Male #6: What I mean is [inaudible].

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:30.920
&gt;&gt;Isaacs: What I'm saying it's easier to make
the bar here in

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.330
California. So if you get below 31 cents,
maybe you'll

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:39.220
got enough people adopt it. So as an individual
house,

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:43.390
you can do it, but as California consumes
a large

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:46.590
fraction of the U.S.' power -- just count
the people.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.300
And so, you still have a grid issue. And the
question is can you provide power in a city,

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.280
for example? And I don't know if San Francisco
is

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.740
not the best place to have solar. Right? So,
LA is probably better.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.850
So you can subsidize the amount of electricity
you use,

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:04.020
but you're never going to be grid free, you're
not going to be off the grid in California.

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:08.270
Some houses can be
obviously, but on average, it's not going

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:13.030
to happen. So.
Any other questions? Well, thanks everybody

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:14.030
for
listening.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.620
[Applause]
