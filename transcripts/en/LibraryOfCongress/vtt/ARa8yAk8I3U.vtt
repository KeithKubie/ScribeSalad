00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.210
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Good morning and welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.830
and to Collections as Data.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.650
Please welcome Kate Zwaard, Chief
of National Digital Initiatives

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.460
at the Library of Congress
[applause].

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.500
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Hey everybody.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.190
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.600
We're so excited you
could be here both

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.050
in person and via the live stream.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.450
I don't have my clicker.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.750
Is there a clicker?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.950
&gt;&gt; Is it - oh, the clicker?

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.300
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Yeah,
I need a clicker.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.800
Oh, it's here.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.530
Sorry. So we're so excited
to have you here in person

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.040
and also via the live stream.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.420
Welcome to Collections as Data.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.510
We had an event last year you may
remember, Collections as Data,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.600
where we discussed the challenges
and opportunities inherent

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.090
in doing computational
analysis on digital collections.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.860
And we were really
overwhelmed by the response.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.840
People afterwards came
up to me and talked to me

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.380
about how inspired they were,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.260 position:56%
how they thought maybe they could do
this work in their home institutions

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.380 position:56%
and - but we found that we still, to
this day, are struggling to explain

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.910
in a tangible way what Collections
as Data means to our colleagues

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.750
who don't have direct experience.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.730
So we thought we'd have this
event, Collections as Data Impact,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.080
to invite luminaries in the
field to share their stories

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.310
about how they are providing
- about how they're using data

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.490
to better the world
and their communities.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.820 position:56%
So with that in mind, I'd like to
share with you a short story that is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.840
from the time when computers
were people doing calculating,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.070
not when they were
things in our pockets.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.200
And it's my hope that this story
will connect the work you'll hear

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.820
about today to a longer history.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.920
So this is a little bit of a
window into my high school bedroom.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.620
You know, these beautiful
people up here [laughter].

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.790
So as you may remember the
Federalist Papers were written

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.790
by John Jay, Alexander
Hamilton, and Madison.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.700
They were published under a
pseudonym in newspapers, Publius.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.770
And then when changing public
opinion converted those documents

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.090
from anonymous trolling to
foundational to the democracy,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.860
we started to get a
sense of the authorship.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.140
And poor John Jay, only five.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.530
So at some point the dust settled.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.540
We knew who wrote most of
them but there were twelve

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.290
that remained in dispute.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.020
Madison said that he didn't
have anything to do with them.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.790
Hamilton said that
they were joint papers.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.890
And everybody kind of figured
that it was probably Madison.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.190
Why was there so much
finger pointing?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.690
Well, these were propaganda pieces.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.610
And sometimes the authors
took positions in the papers

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.660
for argument's sake
that were very different

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.660
from the ones they held publicly.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.480
So our story really starts in
1944 when an American academic,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.990
Douglass Adair, gathered
all the historical evidence

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.780
and determined it was
probably Madison

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.970
that wrote the disputed papers.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.790
But he considered the
historical evidence modest,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.640
so he sought another way
of making an analysis.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.350
He contacted two statisticians,
Frederick Mosteller

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.750
and David Wallace, to see if
there was a computational way

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.290
of making a determination.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.360
And I really love this quote:
"...blunder into historical

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.920
and literary controversy,
merciless slaughter is imminent."

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.910
If this story strikes
a chord with you,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.210
I really encourage
you to read the book.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.060
They're both just kind of
a joy to spend time with.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.960
So they did a - they decided
to do a computational analysis

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.500
on the authorship of
the papers to see

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.250
if they could have an
independent assessment.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.460
So they took a stack of
known Hamilton papers

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.670
and known Madison papers, and they
thought maybe calculating sentence

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.360
average would be a way
to make a determination.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.060
So they laboriously counted in
these known papers how long each

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.420
sentence was.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.930
And then they did some analysis.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.270
For example, they had to
determine - they had to - sorry.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.570
They had to determine whether

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.350
or not quoted sentences
counted toward the average.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.990
Once they finished all this
work, they found an average

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.700
of 34.5 words per sentence
for Hamilton

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.130
and 34.6 words for
Madison [laughter].

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.460
Not going to work.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.210
So then they decided maybe standard
deviation would be the thing.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.680
So they did the same very
laborious counting and calculation.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.700
They thought maybe although average
sentence length was the same,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.330
one of the authors wrote
very average-length sentences

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.280
and the other author wrote very
teeny, tiny sentences and lots

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.750
of really long sentences.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.630
So they did the same kind of
calculation and analysis and came

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.060
out with the same result
for both of them.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.860
And in retrospect this
kind of makes sense.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.000
Both authors were trained
in a similar style

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.630
that was popular during the period.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.000
Lots of long clauses,
very kind of - I mean,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.300
we've all read the
Federalist Papers;

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.350
you know what I'm talking
about [laughter].

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.790
So they shelved the project.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.080
It was a year's worth of work
that didn't have any fruit.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.410
And they kind of just
went on to other things.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.060
A few years later, Douglas
Sidair reached back out to say

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.190 position:56%
that he found something interesting.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.370
He found that while Hamilton
uses the word "while",

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.000
Madison uses the word "whilst."

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.290
And that fact in itself is not
enough to determine authorship.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.250
The word only occurs once
in every thousand words,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.680 position:56%
so it doesn't even appear in all the
papers - all the disputed papers.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.800
Additionally, it could have
been introduced during the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.100
editing process.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.590
So it's not enough
to be a determinate.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.590 position:56%
But it gave them somewhere to start.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.450
So they took that sample
set of known Madison papers

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.150 position:56%
and known Hamilton papers and
counted the occurrence of every word

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.770
in all those sample sets.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.990
They then correlated them
with each other to see

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.460
which words were favored by
one author versus the other.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.500
And they scoped out
words that they called

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.700
"dangerously contextual"
which I really like.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.870
I'm going to use that, I
don't know, later on today.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.830
Dangerously contextual; those
were words that were correlated

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.220
with a certain author's favorite
subjects, not necessarily

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.310
with their writing style.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.470
They came up with a total of
117 words - and this figure is

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.770
from their book - 117 words

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.690
that they could use to
make a determination.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.950
They then used the
Bayesian analysis --

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.510
Tommy Bayes; give it up for
Tommy Bayes, everybody -

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.440
[ Applause ]

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.790
to determine - they determined

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.290
that their data made an
independent assessment

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.960
that the papers were most likely
written by Madison in the sense

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.470
of degree of belief, which I love

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.240
that because it's very
Bayesian terminology.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.560
And what I really love
about this story is

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.970
that none of this is digital.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.060
So this was all ink on paper.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.860
But what does digital do for us?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.620
It democratizes this type of work.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.220
I mean, you could see how much
time and energy went into this.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.910
And part - and that time and energy
was both in inventing this analysis

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.690
but also in the labor needed
to do the calculations.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.910
And digital makes being wrong
much less expensive which is great

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.840
because I'm wrong a lot, and
I need it to be very cheap.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.950
So to bring this talk around to
Harry Potter, which is fun to do

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.640
in any kind of academic situation,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.430
this type of linguistic
analysis is now very common.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.470
So a few years ago, Patrick
Juola, who's a computer scientist,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.500
got a call from a reporter
who had a tip

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.150
that the semi-obscure mystery
writer, Robin Galbraith,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.660
might actually be JK Rowling.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.050
And they wanted to know if
he could do some computation

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.470
to prove that that was true.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.670
So he ran some numbers and
he found out yes, in fact,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.640
he could confirm the
linguistic style of JK Rowling

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.190
and Robin Galbraith
were very similar.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.290
And so they broke the
story together.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.990
And that brings us to today.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.650
What I'm so excited about with
digital is that it makes this sort

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.060
of Collections as Data analysis
much more possible to more people.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:55.690
I think that it brings
Collections as Data more available

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.180
to what I consider a core
constituency of the Library

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.050
of Congress which is the
informed and curious.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.740
We're inviting a lot of
academic luminaries here today,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.260
and we're so excited that they
could share with us their work.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.170
We're also learning a
lot from our colleagues

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.260
in academic libraries including the
IMLS grant-funded project Always

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.410
Already Computational
Library, Collections as Data.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.920 position:56%
But a number of our speakers here
and a number of you out there are --

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.140
you know, are doing work
not connected to a large,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.670
well-funded library;
institutional library.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.450
And I hope that part of this
event will be to invite you

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.430
to consider the Library of
Congress an intellectual home

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.840
for exploration.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.550
My group, National Digital
Initiatives, are really inspired

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.960
by our new boss, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.850
She is leading us strongly
in the direction

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.510
of opening up the collections.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.860
And we consider it part
of our job to help to do

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.700
that for the digital collections.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.920
And with that in mind, I'd
like to share with you a few

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.600
of the things we have going on.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.790
The first is crowdsourcing.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.780
And so what you see here is a
screen shot of an application built

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.480
by Tong Wang who's a developer here

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.700
in the repository development
center at the library.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.770
While he was an innovator
in residence

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.090
at NDI he had a short
- short time with us.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.620
And it's an application built
on the Scribe platform created

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:17.010
by New York Public Library that
invites people to identify photos

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.850
and cartoons in historic newspapers
and to update the captions.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.540
You can see some really
awful OCR here.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.900
That helps us with findability.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.450
But what's so exciting about it

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.150
to me is people engaging
with the collections.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.760
Like, looking through historic
newspapers really getting a sense

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.060
of what's available.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.150
And also that we can
create these data sets.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.720
So we can create maybe a gallery
of World War I-era cartoons

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.740
that I think is really
useful for scholarship

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.040
and interesting to page through.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.160
This is not the only crowdsourcing
project we're working on,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.450
but I'll save those
details for another time.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.880
And it's our hope that this will
blend into a portfolio of projects

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.690 position:56%
that the Library of Congress is
working on that helps us engage with

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.080
and learn from our users including
Flickr, the American Archive

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.660
of Public Broadcasting game,
and efforts in the Law Library

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.220
and the World Digital Library.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.320
Bud Barton, our CIO,
announced recently

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.090
that we'll be doing a
congressional data challenge.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.670 position:56%
He announced this at the Legislative
Data and Transparency Conference.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.650
We'd like to invite people to
play with congressional data

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.320
and find ways to make
our democracy, you know,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.800
even more robust using the
information we're making available.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.250
We're working on the details,
and we hope to have something

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.550
to announce about that soon.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.110 position:56%
I am thrilled to give you guys a
sneak peek into what we're launching

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.760
in a few months, and
that's labs.loc.gov.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.110
I'm really excited about this.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.350
It's going to be a platform
for play and discovery

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.900
with the digital collections.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.350
It's my hope that this will
reduce the friction to innovation,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.710
and we'll be able to use
it also as a home for NDI.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.230
So it'll make our work a
little bit more easy to follow

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.840
and provide us a place to host the
results of innovators and residents

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.230
and challenge grants and
information about our hackathons.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.600
This one's pictured here.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.620
I love this picture because
when you watch movies

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.200
about people writing code
it's all, like, head down,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.500
dak-a-dak-a-dak-a-dak-a-dak-a.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.510 position:56%
But when I write code it's mostly me
staring at a screen trying to figure

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.470
out why it's doing that
[laughter], pictured here.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.800
So while I have you trapped here -

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.560
because we've got some amazing
speakers so I know you're not going

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.150
to leave - I'd like to selfishly
go through a few things.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.540
The first is jobs.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.210
There are some really cool
jobs posted right now,

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.470
and I have a feeling there'll
be more really cool jobs posted

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.770
in the near future.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.080
So please check this out.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.390
We need your good brains
to come here.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.540
So if you find jobs that, like,
your friend might be good for,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.710
please send it and
check back very often.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.830
The second, the Kluge
Fellowship in Digital Studies.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.390
So if you don't want to come here
for a lifetime, which you should;

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.910
but if you don't want to, you
can come here for just a visit.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:56.070
These are paid fellowships to
bring people into the library

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.420
to study the digital revolution on
society using library collections.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.510
And if you come here and do one of
these, I will hang out with you.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.030
I will. But don't not
- don't not apply

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.330
because you're worried
about that [laugher].

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.850
Like, I'll just call you;
and if you don't want

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.510
to do that, you don't have to.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.440
But it's really fun, and we'll have
two Kluge scholars presenting the

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.740
lightening round.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.890
So if you're inspired by their
work, please come and apply.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.590 position:56%
They can award more than one a
year, so share it with your friends.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.890
Don't horde it.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.610
You can send it out to people.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.470
The third is Innovators
in Residence.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.940 position:56%
So we've been working hard on an
Innovators in Residence program here

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.900
to bring people into the
library for short-term,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.940
high-impact technical projects.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:43.950
Sorry. And the idea behind this
is to bring some fresh ideas,

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.930 position:56%
new blood, great brains to create
new access points to the collection.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.990
Innovators in Residence projects
have included the crowdsourcing

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.540 position:56%
project that I referenced earlier, a
MARC parser to help people interact

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.030
with the bibliographic
records the Library

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.370
of Congress recently released,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.850
and we'll have more information
about this year's soon.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.150
So thanks for coming.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.450
I'm so thrilled you're here.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.500
As I mentioned when we launch
blogs.loc.gov it'll be much easier

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.270
to follow what we're working on.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.840
In the meantime, please
check the blog.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.280
You can sign up for e-mail alerts.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.700
We won't have time
for questions today.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.400
It's wall-to-wall information
into your brains.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.490
But we're encouraging
you to please interact

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.590
with the speakers directly
on social media.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.960
You can also comment on the
blog with any questions.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.760
Thank you so much.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.220
[ Applause ]

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.870
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
