00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.780
W. BARKSDALE MAYNARD: Princeton is
of national, and even

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.550
international, importance
as a landscape.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.530
Princeton is not
just a pretty place,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.610
but it is a place of
tremendous history.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.260
A place that really deserved
to be protected and preserved.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.410
I went through 7,000 historic
photos of the Princeton campus,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.700
studying innumerable
pictures of trees.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.760
Trying to identify which
trees in the old photos

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.280
are still standing today,
and it turns out several are.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.410
Several trees that are 100,
150, even 200 years old

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.660
still stand on the
Princeton campus.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.200
MERC MORRIS: Trees are a part
of the fabric of the campus,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
and they carry
forward one era to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.880
the next, much like buildings.


00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.190
But like us, they don't last
as long as the buildings.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.880
So trees impart a
memory to the campus.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.960
When you come back
to campus, you

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.580
remember how you felt when
you were here as a student,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.150
but it looks different.


00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.770
Well, the buildings haven't
grown, the grass hasn't grown,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.300
but the trees have changed.


00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.500
And that's what makes the
difference in the mood

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.030
and the feeling of the campus.


00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.420 position:56%
W. BARKSDALE MAYNARD: Around campus,
as you walk around,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.250
you'll notice many of
the trees have labels.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.270
That's just been done by
the Grounds Department.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.040
And they've done a terrific
job of labeling these trees

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.940
indicating the
names of the trees,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.000
the species of these trees.


00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.390
There's interesting information
about all of the trees.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.480
It's great to know the
difference between a Wych Elm

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.310
from Scotland and the American
Elm, native to our forests.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.500
And they grow side by
side on Front Campus.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.540
So these trees have now been
labeled, and that's a big help.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.410
MERC MORRIS: I like
to look at trees

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.630
as to what they bring
to the campus in terms

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.810
of botanical uniqueness.


00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.690
This particular tree behind
me was planted in 1948.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.860
And it is comparatively
young, compared

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560
to many of the trees on campus.


00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.040
Yet it may be one of the tallest
of its kind in the world, which

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.660
is a botanical curiosity,
and also speaks to the health

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.960
and well-being of
the trees on campus.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.380 position:66%
W. BARKSDALE MAYNARD: Three of my favorite
trees are on Cannon Green,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.180
and they're these tremendous
Ash trees, enormous Ash trees.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.230
And we know from old photographs
that Cannon Green was densely

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.130
filled with trees at the
time of the Civil War.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.880
So these are three survivors.


00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.410
Three trees that were
planted in the 1850s,

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.260
and are still there growing
on Cannon Green now.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.170
When you see the great Sycamores
in front of Maclean House,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.850
we know they were
planted in 1766.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.900
Those are the very same
trees that George Washington

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480
saw when he came here
for commencement.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.100
Those are the same trees
that James Madison saw

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.880
when he was doing graduate
work in Maclean House.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.180
Extraordinary, that those
are the very same trees.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.300
They sprout new green
leaves every spring today,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.210
just as they did for
George Washington.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.050
That's remarkable.
