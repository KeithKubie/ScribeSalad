00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.790
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Thank you.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.090
Thank you.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.390
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.240
Thank you for coming out
on this beautiful morning.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.140
I had about five different
outfits that I was planning to wear

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.560 position:56%
for today, and they all got shelved.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.950
Welcome to the National
Book Festival.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.490
I have the pleasure today
of interviewing Don Winslow.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.390
And as some of you maybe read
me in the Washington Post.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.020
I'm a regular mystery columnist
for the Washington Post as well

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.850
as a book critic for Fresh
Air on National Public Radio,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.500
both of which are supporters
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.190 position:56%
After my conversation with Don, he
will be signing books from 11 to 12,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.230
and I think once you hear
some more about The Force

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.820
if you haven't had the
pleasure of reading it already,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.330
you will want to grab a
book and get it signed.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.850
I was in St. Louis in April.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.640
I was at a fundraiser for
the St. Louis Library.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.160
It was a fundraiser
organized around the theme

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.930
of a mystery night,
a suspense night.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.560
Reed Farrell Coleman, who is a
fantastic hard boiled detective

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.340
fiction writer, sponsors the event

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.430
and he had gotten other great
writers like Peter Blowner,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.990
Hillary Davidson, Blake Crouch
to come to the event and to talk

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.540
about their suspense fiction.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.360
And guess what?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.070
All of those terrific writers
were talking about this novel.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.540
They were saying to me,
"You've got to read it.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.020
This is the suspense
novel of the year."

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.170
They were so in awe of the research

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.040
of the writing, quality
of Don's novel.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.770
I went home and as you can
see, I started to read it.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.940
These are all my Post It Notes.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.840
It's a fantastic police
procedural --

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.540
it's a fantastic novel
about New York,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.980
but like all the greatest crime
fiction, it's also a terrific novel

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.720
about that struggle
between justice and the law,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.300
and the gap between
justice and the law.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.410
Don has a biography, the likes
of which I've never seen before

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.780
at the National Book Festival.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.940
I mean, in addition to being a
guide in China to leading a safari,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.380
a photographic safari, he's
also written -- what is it?

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.680
19 novels?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.820
Yes, 19 novels, many
of which have been made

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.730
into major motion pictures.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.810
He also was awarded the L.A. Times
Book Prize in 2016 and I am just

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.750
so excited to have him here at the
festival and to be able to talk

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.810
with him about The Force.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.610
So please welcome Don Winslow.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:19.120
[ Applause ]

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.430
So Don, I always imagined that
these audiences are composed

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.320
of people who've already had the
good sense to read your book,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.420
but some folks who haven't.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.210
Could you do the two minute sort of
summary of what The Force is about?

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.220
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah,
wow [inaudible].

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.910
If people want to move up, by
the way, it's not Sea World.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.460
You won't get splashed.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.860
You don't need a cover,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.250
and the author is relatively
harmless in this case.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.060
So please move up if you'd like.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.240
The Force refers to a fictional
special unit inside the New York

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.750
Police Department that's
been charged with taking guns

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.330
and drugs off the streets of upper
Manhattan, upper west side, Harlem,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.820
Inwood, Washington Heights.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.640
And they're very good
at what they do.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.750
They get to be too
good at what they do,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.750
and I'm not giving
anything really away.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.110
It's in the first few
pages of the book.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.320
They make one of the
biggest heroin and cash busts

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.690
in New York City history, and they
keep half of it for themselves

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.230
and things go from there.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.350
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: One of
the things that your colleagues

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.910
in the suspense world were raving
about was the amount of research

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.480
that went into this novel,
but of course didn't bog

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.570
down in any way the narrative,
but they were just talking

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.920
about the authenticity of the
details, and the way cops speak

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.190
to each other and the kind of
situations that they encounter

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.260
that you don't get from
your usual cop TV show.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.070
Talk a little bit about the
research, that process of research.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.690
How did you even get --
most of them are guys --

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.460
guys who do that kind of
work to open up to you?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.760
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: You know what?

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.240
I call it the chair factor.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.700
First of all, I've been
around cops my whole life.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.770
My godfather was a cop.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.580
I worked in New York City as a P.I.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.030
in Times Square.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.940
So I dealt with cops a lot
so I've worked with cops.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.220
I've worked cases against
cops in Los Angeles.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.670
So I've been around them
my whole adult life.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.990
But specifically for this book,
it was a matter not so much

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.400
of having interviews
but becoming the chair.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.500
Do you know how when you buy
a new chair or a new sofa?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.050 position:56%
For the first couple of weeks you go
in the room, and that's all you see.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.350
It's a chair.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.650
It's the sofa.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.450
It's new. It's there,
dominates the room.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.800
A couple of weeks later,
it's the chair.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.380
And so I think for
researching any book

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.020
like this is largely a
matter of becoming the chair.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.080
Just to be there.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.880
And it's like any relationship.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.770
It takes time and to sit and to
listen and to hear what they say

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.600
and to ask fewer and
fewer questions really.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.140
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Did you ride along?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.690
Did you -- yeah, yeah.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.990
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Sorry,
I interrupted you.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.290
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: No.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.830
I mean, you're in -- when you
read The Force, you the reader are

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.370
in those tenement hallways doing
what you guys call the vertical.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.670
It's going up the stairs.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.240
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Up and
down the stairs, yeah.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.710
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: You're talking
to the informants in the alleys.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.070
You have a real sense of
where folks who do this kind

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:49.920
of work would meet an informant
and what the terrain is like.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.480
As your characters
point out in The Force,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.130
cops don't like to bare their souls
to anybody who's not in the club.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.430
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.730
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
So was it the P.I.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.030
credentials that --

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.330
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: No, not at all.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.630
Typically cops don't like P.I.'s.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.210 position:56%
So that was not an advantage at all.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.870
No, it was -- I can't tell you how
many times I heard only other cops

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.630
can understand me.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.170
Why don't we talk to other cops?

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.900
And I think that that's a
real factor, and I get it.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.520
I understand why.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.840
Again, it was a matter of patience.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.110
And it was a matter
of, I think, empathy.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.710
I rarely go in and
ask what did you do?

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.010
What happened?

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.930
We kind of already
know those things.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.940
And from being around and going
on ride-alongs, but of the sort

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.880
of conversation I'd start and
some of these conversations went

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.470
on for years by the way, I would
simply say tell me about it.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:54.070
Keep it as open-ended as possible,
and there were veteran cops

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.550
and retired cops and my wife came
along on some of these actually,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.080 position:56%
which was a big help because I think
that they opened up to her maybe

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.670
in ways they wouldn't have opened
up to me, talking about cases

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.230
that had happened 10, 20 years ago

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.080
that I don't think
they ever talked about.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.380
And all of a sudden, you're looking

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.760
at this very tough veteran homicide
cop, tears streaming down his face.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.470
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I can
understand that from some

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.710
of the stories that you had the
characters tell in the book.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.010
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.310
They're all true.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.610
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.910
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Did you
record those conversations?

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.210
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: No, no, no, no.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.510
Never. Don't record.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.810
Don't take notes.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.110
Nobody wants that.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.400
It makes you instantly unwelcome.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.950
And I'm not a journalist.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.600
I don't -- I try to make it as
realistic and as factually driven

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.730
as I can, but I don't have the
responsibility that journalist has

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.430
for absolute truth and accuracy.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.310
I'm still a fiction writer.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.060
But no, for me to have had a
microphone would not have worked

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.510
in the situation at all or even to
be sitting there with the legal pad

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.930
that I would have liked to
have had and taking things

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.370
down would have inhibited
those conversations

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.310
and inhibited those moments.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.570
I wouldn't have been the chair.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.870
Yeah.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.170
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Did any of them ask

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.770
if they could read
what a draft of the --

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.070
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: No.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:20.010
No. I took that off the table.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.400
Listen, some of them have
really liked the book.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.190
Others have not.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:31.390
Some -- a little bit of both,
and that's what I expected,

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.620
but for the most part, the reaction
has been very positive, but no.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.000
I would never let a subject read.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.050
Maybe for factual things,
could you check on this?

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.780
Is that realistic or
that sort of thing,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.050
but to give pages or chapters, no.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.070
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: It's a hard
time to write about the police.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.370
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: It is.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And you
dramatize that in The Force as well.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:02.190
And a few times in this novel you
have characters making a variation

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.560
of kind of the same speech,
but it's an important speech

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.690
where these detectives
say you're not the one

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.990
who goes up those stairs.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.680
You're not the one speaking
usually to a bureaucrat.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.550
You're not the one who
breaks in the door.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.850
You're not the one who
has to do this dirty work.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.410
So don't judge us.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.710
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.410
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And I think as
a novelist you'd have to walk kind

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.740
of a fine line here because you
wanted obviously to write this kind

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:42.870
of morally complex novel, but I
guess the times that we live in now

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.550
where cops have to deal
with accusations of racism

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.040
and sometimes maybe they're
founded and sometimes they're not.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.910
It must have made your
job harder in terms

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.300
of dramatizing these characters

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.600
and giving them a fully
realized life and role.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.900
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.860
It is a difficult time
to write about cops,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.180
a difficult time to be a cop.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.640
It's a difficult time
to be, I think,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.600
particularly a young
African American

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.230 position:56%
in treacherous situations with cops.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.950
I think that we need to look
at that racial situation

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.280
and know that that's very real.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.290
And I write about it in the book.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.120
I'll probably regret saying
this, but I'm not very interested

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.980
in morality when I'm writing.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.420
I'm not interested in
saying that's a good guy.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.720
That's a bad guy.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.020
This is right.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.320
This is wrong.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.430
I think it's my job is to take
the reader into a world that he

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.760
or she otherwise couldn't go into
or if they do know that world,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.590
to maybe show it to them in a
slightly different way and to do

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.570
that I need to get inside the
character's heads whether they're

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.340
clean cops or dirty
cops or drug dealers

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.250
or informants or whatever it is.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.430
If I'm going to do my job well,
then I need to be subjective

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.680
when I'm actually typing
when I'm actually writing.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.840
I can't be interested in
stepping outside the character

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.360
and saying that's right.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.660
That's wrong.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.960
That's good.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.410
That's bad.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.520
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Another thing
that comes up a couple of times

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.940
in the novel is this idea of every
institution believing its own

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.880
mythology, whether it's
the organized crime,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.930
whether it's the mob,
whether it's the police force,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.940
whether it's an academic
institution.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.750
They've both got their
own mythology.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.230
And one of the things
I admired so much

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.530
about The Force is you've got some

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.950
of the mythic elements
of the police procedure.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.130 position:56%
The young cop -- the young detective
who has to learn the ropes,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:56.840
some of those characters who
we read these stories for.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.180
But you sort of -- as a
novelist, you seem to be able

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.350
to surmount the mythology
and break through.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.660 position:56%
I wonder how much as a writer you're
thinking about the formula and how

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.170 position:56%
to tinker with it as you're writing.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.250
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, I was as a
kid very influenced by those sort

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:24.780
of classic 1970's books and
films, The French Connection,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.960
Serpico, Prince of the City.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.280
I knew the prince of the city, a
friend of mine, a friend to Reed's.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.730
And they were part of what inspired
me to want to be a crime writer.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.300
If I could tell stories like that,
that would be a great way to live.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.530
So we're all aware,
I think, of the --

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:48.480
of that and the trophies
that exist within that genre.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:54.090
I think sometimes though what I
try to do is acknowledge them.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.730
They're very real and partly
they're real because they're real

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.050
because those characters
in those situations exist.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.070
But then sort of point the
story true north toward those

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.030
and then kick it a little bit.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.330
You know what I mean?

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.200
Just -- if you nudge it
like five degrees off center

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.120
when you start a chapter
or start a sequence,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.090
then sometimes interesting
things can happen.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.390
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: So you
must know that I'm going

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:26.120
to ask you how you got into
writing from the world of action,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.120
being a P.I., traveling it
seems like around the globe?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.870
What made you decide that
you could try your hand

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.350
at actually writing
one of these things?

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.140
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: I've
always wanted to be a writer

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.650
since I was a little kid,
but the world didn't agree

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.680
for a long time with
that assessment.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.630
So I had to make a living.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.540
As you alluded to, I
majored in African history,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.290
which makes you a hard
core unemployable.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.230
The only person in the world that
has ever managed to make a living

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.310
at it was Dane Kennedy, my
African History professor sitting

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.610
over there.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:02.690
He took all the money the rest of
us could have made and kept it.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.230
So I went out to become a safari
guide and all that kind of thing,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:12.390
but then I think for a while I
wouldn't come here to lie to you,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.630
and I think for a while
I just lost confidence,

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.590
thinking that can I really do this?

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.430
Can I pull this off?

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.710
And I was cobbling together a
living doing various things,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.860
leading photographic safaris,
directing Shakespeare in England,

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.400
being a P.I., various
times of the year,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.800
seasonally doing that kind of work.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.550
And then I heard Joe Wombow
[assumed spelling] on the radio say

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.560
that when he was an L.A. homicide
investigator that he wanted

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.700
to be a writer and that he told
himself he would write ten pages a

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.190
day no matter what.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.790
And I said to myself, well I
can't do ten, but I could do five.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.090
I could just do -- and so I did.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.440
And I was in a tent in Kenya
with amoebic dysentery.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.330
I weighed 99 pounds,
and I thought no,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.680
but I'm going to write five
pages a day no matter what.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.710
And then three years
later, I have my first book.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.120
I thought it was my first book.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.830
The first 14 publishers did not.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.770
My first book, but the 15th
did and I've been very,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.070
very blessed, very lucky.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.140 position:56%
I've been under contract since then.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.390
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Writing in a tent in Kenya,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.600
you're going into Hemingway
territory there.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.110
Who --

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.740
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Literally, no, no.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:41.450
Our cook was a very old man
named Katoya was a young man

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.580
and an assistant on the
Hemingway green hills of Africa.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.880
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Oh, please.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.180
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Safari.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.700
And the only words in English
that he spoke were Johnny Walker.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.830
But he and I would
have conversations

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.040
about Papa Hemingway in Swahili.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.660
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I -- slight
digression, I had the opportunity

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.810
to see Hemingway's
house in Sun Valley.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.110
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Oh, is that right?

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.410
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Two summers ago.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.170
And that's of course where
he committed suicide.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.050
It's an eerie place because you
can't open any of the windows.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.950
They're all Plexiglass.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.250
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Wow.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.600
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And has
a real sealed in feeling.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.900
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.200
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Wow.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.500
Who else did you read?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.800
Womba?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.100
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Everyone
you'd expect.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.400
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Ed McBain?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.700
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Sure.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.360
Ed McBain, and I was very aware
you have to be aware of Ed McBain

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.400
when you're writing an NYPD novel.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.700
You just do.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.090 position:56%
Lawrence Block was a huge influence.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.040
Elmore Leonard, of
course, Mr. Leonard.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.190
Shortly before he passed away, I
got to spend 45 minutes with him

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.460
on the phone, 45 of the
happiest minutes of my life.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.610
I've been in awe of him forever.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:54.510 position:56%
He got on the phone, and he said,
"Don Winslow, you were two years old

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.840
when I wrote [inaudible]."

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.600
And I said, "Yes, Mr. Leonard,
but I tried to read it."

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.900
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Nice.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.680
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: He has the
most charming way of putting me

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.230
in my place, but who would you
expect, Raymond Chandler of course.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.530
I can go on and on.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:17.840
Charles Wilford, John D. McDonald,
Ross McDonald, all of those people,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:24.940
James Elroy, T. Jefferson Parker
who has since become a dear friend.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.130
I'm always afraid of answering
that question, leaving someone out.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.430
So I read everybody.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.540
I read on stakeouts, which is
probably why I was a lousy P.I.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.270
Something just happened.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.270
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Usually in --

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.910
at least in the classic novels
like the [inaudible] novels,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.450
Marlo is reading and then looks

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.270
up just the right moment,
but I guess --

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.570
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.870
She was [inaudible].

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.170
Trumpets played.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.120
That never happened to me.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.630 position:56%
I got the blonde and beautiful part.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.960
No trumpets.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.380
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Well,
this is a serious novel

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.940
but its got its lighter moments,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.740
and one of the episodes I really
enjoyed is when The Force,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.500
group of elite detectives --

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.260
Denny Malone, the head of The Force
decides he needs to reward the guys

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.700
who work with him, and they go

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.960
out on bowling night,
which is actually what?

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.900
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Drunken,
drug filled orgy.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.740
But yeah, I mean, the scene
that I like in that is

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.050
when they all sit around at dinner.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.720
Bowling night starts with
you have to order steaks

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.750
at a very expensive old fashioned
place called Gallagher's,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.140
and you must wear a suit, and
you must wear French cufflinks

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.050
and you really have to do it up.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.780
And they sit, and they order steaks
because mob guys hang out in there,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.090
and if they see cops ordering
anything less expensive it lessens

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.510
their power and prestige,
which is the truth.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.640 position:56%
So they sit around and tell stories.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.550
And those are all true
stories by the way.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.100
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I too liked
the detail about the steak,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.150
and it feeds into a pattern where
these detectives are very aware

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.450
of appearance and when
you're out on the streets,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.890
how they're carrying themselves.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.990 position:56%
So that they're not under estimated.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:21.020
That must be -- I would think that
would be a huge psychic strain year

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.530
after year to sort of always
have that double consciousness

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.520 position:56%
of how you're being perceived and --

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.490
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: I think it's
all a huge psychic strain.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.750
By the way, everyone and
their dog tried to take

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.070
that sequence out of the book.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.370
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Really?

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.170
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, yeah
because it's just four guys sitting

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.720
around for about 40 pages
telling old stories.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.080
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
That's a great sequence.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.930
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: And everyone
tried to cut it and take it out,

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.860
and I got really stubborn about it

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.910
and just kept writing
[inaudible], leave it alone.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.210
It stays in.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.510
It stays in.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.710
But yeah, I think it is
a strain, but these sort

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:55.020
of rock star cops are
very aware of image.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:00.600
And they have a charisma about
them and a magnetism about them

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.430
that is palpable when you step
into the room, not just in New York

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.980
when you meet these guys anywhere.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.150
And women by the way as well.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.180
And they're very, very aware of it.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:17.790 position:56%
And it helps them succeed in their
jobs, but it's also a survival tool.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.090
It really is.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:23.690 position:56%
It's an instant sort of warning that
creates distance and space and time

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:28.500 position:56%
for them to think of the solution of
the problem that's in front of them

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.380
and to persuade people to do
what they want them to do.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.400
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.920
You do mention that the
two female detectives

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.510
who make appearances here, one
of them more than the other,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:45.010
that they're tougher than
anybody you're likely to meet.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.680
And I guess there too
you would have to be.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.980
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: They have to be.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.570
I mean, the women cops, it's still
the truth, have to be twice as good

00:21:52.570 --> 00:22:00.610
to get to that position, and they
are very, very tough, very smart.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.070
You wouldn't mess with them.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.110
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
I wouldn't want to.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.620
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: In addition
to being a really --

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.790
I've run out of adjectives --
outstanding police procedural,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.270
this is a great novel
about New York,

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.560
and I was born in New
York, I told you.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.240
I teach a course at Georgetown
on New York literature.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.540
Maybe you'd like to come.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.030
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: I'd love to.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.250
Let's go now.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.900
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: They're
all sleep [inaudible] hangovers

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.200
this morning.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.500
It's Saturday morning.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.370
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: As opposed
to the book festival

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.900
where no one's doing that.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But one of the
things we talk about in my course is

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.620
that New York literature is about
location, location, location.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.770 position:56%
It's about boundariness, and I think
you really dramatized that here.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:53.250
Would you talk about the locations
and the lines that you don't cross,

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.620
the streets that you don't cross.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.920
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.830
First of all, it's terrifying
writing a New York novel

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.040
because there's no
such thing as a single.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.850 position:56%
There's no such thing as a base hit.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.500
It's a strike out or a home run.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.400
And -- but I finally felt I
was at a point in my career

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.940
where I had the chops, I
had the talent to do it.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:19.570
New York for me, I refer to
as the small gods of place.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.210
I'm an upper west side
and Harlem guy.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.840
And one thing I never get tired
of, I did it just the other day,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.020
is walking up and down Broadway.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.730
Never get tired of it.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.500
It's always evocative and
beautiful even sometimes

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.600
in its shabbiness is beautiful.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.640
As the years go by as they do,
some of those places that were sort

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.740
of sacred to you go away.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.110
The burger joint on 78th and
Broadway where I ate every meal

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:57.120
for two years and this club,
that corner as it changes,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.630
but they still exist in a
sort of ghost-like fashion.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:08.060
But boundaries in New York, when
I first moved up to 104th Street

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.320
as a young guy, your friends
looked at you like they were

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.090
about to give you a wake, like they
would never, ever see you again.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.120
And certainly it was
small arms fire.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.460 position:56%
One of the things that I was walking
past the other night was that was

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.320
where that guy was killed.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.900
This is where this person was shot.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:33.370
I remember dealing with -- making a
small cocaine buy on the job here.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:38.420
And so there were certain
things you didn't cross.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.160
And I think that that's broken
down to a certain extent,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.300
but in those days that
was an ethnic call.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.190
I'd get out of the
subway at 103rd Street.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:54.120 position:56%
On the west side were Haitians and
on the east side were Puerto Ricans,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.510
and they were lobbing
bottles like mortar shots.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.750
So you'd come out of the subway
putting something over your head

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:07.120
or when gunfire would start in my
building, I'd get in the bathtub,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.260
dry bathtub and read because
it's hard for a bullet

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.650
to get through a thick bathtub.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:18.550
Things have obviously
changed a lot in New York,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.060
but in some neighborhoods no,
in some of the neighborhoods.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.910
And I'm not at liberty to say
that some of the neighborhoods

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.790
where I went on ride-alongs is
still very, very much that way

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:35.150
and the hostility toward
police was palpable.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.450
You felt it.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.750
You heard it.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.940
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: One of the
things that has changed in New York

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.310
as so many neighborhoods
have gone up is

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.710
that the middle class is
sort of on the fringes.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:57.050
And you've, of course, your
cops live on Staten Island.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.350
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.500
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: To me,
that's a very vivid picture

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:07.720
of here are these men and women
who patrol the streets who try

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.940
to keep order, but they're
almost kind of exiled

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.150
to this island on the fringes.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.880
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yes,
financially and culturally.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.180
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.480
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.720
For the most part, cops can't
afford to live where they patrol.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.020
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.130
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Which by the way
creates a host of other problems

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.640
that are probably too complicated
for us to get into today.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.420 position:56%
But when you talk about police
policy and things that are going on,

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.400
that's one of the huge factors.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.000
But that's been true
in New York for years.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.880
You come from Sunnyside,
huge cop environment area.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.110
Staten Island where I
was born, same thing.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.240
We used to say on Staten Island
you have three career choices,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:52.270
cop, fireman, criminal.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.780
Crime writer, close.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.410
And there were streets on Staten
Island that were depopulated

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:05.580
of men the day after 9/11 because
there were so many cops and firemen

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.410
who lived there, and you
drive down those streets now,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:14.630
still and you feel
that sorrow, that loss.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.040
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I want to
throw out one more question to you

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.930
and then we'll open
this up to the audience,

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.390
but yet another thing I
admire about The Force,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.130
you keep that plot growing.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:28.520
You do double crosses.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.210
You do triple crosses.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.930
It's not until the end of The
Force that you actually can figure

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.930
out what's going to happen.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.230
How do you do that kind of plot?

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.720
That huge, sweeping plot
where so many digressions.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.040
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, it's my
least favorite part of the job.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.340
I like story.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:53.690
I don't really like plot,
but you have to have one.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.540
They make you.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.750 position:56%
Rewriting -- there's an old
martial arts saying how do you carve

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.170
a tiger?

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.670
And the answer is you
take a big block of wood

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.230
and then you cut away everything
that doesn't look like a tiger.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.900
And that's the case in
writing a book like this.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.410
It's probably half again
as long in manuscript form.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.630
And I write like really fast
like I'm afraid to get caught

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:23.540
on the first few drafts, but
long around draft ten or 11,

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.170
then I'm really thinking a lot
more about structure, about plot,

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.930
about the reader and the
experience that the reader's having

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.760
and you just keep moving it
around until it's a tiger.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.090
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Draft or 10 or 11.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.500
I'm going to tell my
students that on Tuesday.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.450
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: I wish
it were just 10 or 11.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:47.140
It's usually more like
14, 15 or more.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.240
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Well, let's
open things up to the audience.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.200
I'm sure people have loads
of questions for you.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.500
&gt;&gt; I do. Thank you.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.800
Good morning.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.140
Your books are terrific.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.440
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:05.460
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you to sort of
talk about the cartel which deals

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.290
with a large complex
violent organization

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.920
that is breaking the law.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.570
In The Force, there's a large
complex can be violent organization

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.440
charged with enforcing the
law and your perspectives

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.630
on those two organizations
and where they're similar

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.720
and where they're different
and whether it was any sort

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.770
of purpose -- it might not
be the right word in terms

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.280
of doing the cartel and then
following it up with The Force

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.330
in terms of what you're
trying to say?

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.630
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, thank you.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.930
It's a very astute question.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.840
Let me answer the last one
first and then kind of go back.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.700
I had no intent to create
sort of a moral equivalence

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.160
between The Force and the cartel.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.280
Obviously, both are
large organizations.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.580
Both deal with violence.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.010
Both are corrupt to
a certain degree.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.640
The cartels, Mexican drug cartels

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.400
which I've written a
lot about are evil.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.930
They just are.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.270
Not enough bad things can
happen to them to suit me.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.720
I certainly don't feel
that way about the police.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.040
And by the way, The Force is
dedicated to 187 police officers

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.900
who were killed, murdered
during the time

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.850
that I was just typing the
manuscript, writing the book.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.050
Not even researching it.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.130
But they both are large
organizations,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.140 position:56%
and certainly there are similarities

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.170
between any organized
crime organization

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.790
and any large police force.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.100
They're both hierarchical.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.950
They both have resort
to violence and force,

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:54.320
and they are definite subcultures
where information is currency,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.310
and that's what I find
fascinating about them.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:03.180
The other thing, of course, is that
they have a symbiotic relationship.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.940 position:56%
You don't get one without the other.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:13.090
And they're aware of that symbiosis
particularly on the upper levels.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.560
So for a cop like Danny Malone
and an organization like this

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.430
to do his job, he has
to have relationships

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.200 position:56%
with mob guys and with drug dealers.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.100
You can't do it otherwise.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.940
Same with DEA.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.580
You have an adversarial
relationship with most of them,

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:36.410
but you have to have a cooperate
and symbiotic relation with others

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:42.170 position:56%
of them in order to do the job, and
that gets to be tremendously morally

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.670
and ethically and emotionally
complex.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.060
Thank you.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.360
Yes, I can't see.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.660
So hi.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.280
&gt;&gt; Hi. I first became aware
of your work in the 1990's

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.580 position:56%
with the New York [inaudible] books,

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.460
the first of which
is probably the one

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.110
that I was [inaudible]
rejected by the 14 publishers.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.410
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: It was, yeah.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.710
&gt;&gt; I thought they were magnificent.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.010
You wrote five of them,
and I read all of them.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.310
And then you stopped.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.310
So my question is why?

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.800
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: I wrote
five Neal Carey books.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.070
When I first started doing this,
sir, I thought that's what you did

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.860 position:56%
because of who I was reading really.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.330
I thought you created a
character, a detective

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.500
and then you followed it through.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.920
A number of reasons.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.330
One, none of you were buying.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.320
And so I couldn't make
a living at it.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.550
But also I think I was
getting a little bit bored

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.930
and a little bit boring.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.780
I think that some folks do
series tremendously well,

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.330
and we can all name those
authors, Jane Lee Burke,

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:44.190
and the late sadly Robert
Parker, and there's so many.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.640
I don't think I was doing
it particularly well long

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.510
around book four or five.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.080
But I might come back to it.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.970
I might reintroduce Neal
here in a little while.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.570
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you, sir.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:33:02.110
&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for coming
and also I wanted to thank you

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.580
for making all of your --
thank you for making all

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.570
of your books available
in audio as soon

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.240
as you do [crosstalk] read them all
the same day everyone else does.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.540
So thank you.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.840
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Pleasure.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.140
&gt;&gt; I'm curious.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.090
You said that you don't really
think about the morality

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.460
of what you're writing about.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.710
You sort of do it factually,
but it seems like you must --

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.000
I would imagine you
must think about that

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.650
when you're contemplating what
book to write because you write --

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.660
I won't say sympathetic, but at
least you humanize characters

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.520
from the mob, from the drug
cartels, from the police

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.680
when they're not exactly squeaky
clean, and I'm curious how you go

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.050
about figuring out what
the next book and if you'd

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.450
like to tell us what the next
book is, I'd love that too.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.980
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Sure.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.280
Thank you.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.920
Yeah, look, I pick subjects
that I'm passionate about

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.740
and that I think are important.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.740
I never wanted to write books
about the Mexican cartels.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.530
I kind of still don't.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:05.720
But that's what I'm doing next.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.630
I am finishing the
trilogy that began

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.290
with a book called
the Power of the Dog.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.850
And then moved on to the cartel.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.470
After both of those
books, I swore and promised

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:20.970
that I wouldn't write another one
and I meant that when I said it.

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:24.830
I was hoping there'd be
nothing left to write about.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.760
Sadly, there is.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.440
Don't get me started.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.590
I tend to go into rants about this.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:38.240
We're about to build a wall
that will be worst than useless.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:44.750
So I try to pick subjects
that matter to people.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.730
I try to pick subjects
that are important.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.430
I know that I'm a crime writer.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.540 position:56%
At the end of the day, I'm an
entertainer, but if at the same time

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:56.510
that I'm writing a good type
exciting book I can bring people

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.350
some information or some
insight, I'm happy to do that.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.490
Now I have my own ethical and moral
ideas about some of the things

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.170
that these characters do.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.650
What I'm saying is that
when I'm writing it,

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.380
I have to set those aside
because I can't be object

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.380
if I have to be subjective.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.490
But the book I'm working on now
I'm 300 something pages deep

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:24.740
into it is the final
installment of the cartel trilogy.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.040
Thank you, sir.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.640
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Don, I don't know.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.940
You've got another line here too.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.240
So --

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.540
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Okay, yeah.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.840
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.140
Thank you for attending.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.440
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.740
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily in your
current book, The Force,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.540
but it in any previous
writing I often wonder

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.260
about this with writers of crime.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.990
Did you ever get in a situation
where you were a bit fearful

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.640
of adding something to a book?

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.700
That it may have personal
repercussions on you?

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.000
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: No.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.300
I've never been fearful of that.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.770
There are some things that I've
withheld from books, believe it

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.290
or not, either because they
were so horribly violent.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.810
I couldn't deal with
them and/or I thought

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:14.200
that the reader just
wouldn't accept them as true.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.180
One of the problems with writing
about drug cartels is it's

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:23.410
such a surreal world that
some of the things happen

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:27.980
that actually happened are
nevertheless beyond belief.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:32.870
But I've never withheld anything
out of fear of my own safety.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:34.930
Look, I'm not a crusading
journalist.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.200
I'm a fiction crime writer.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.020
No one cares enough to --

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.990
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.970 position:56%
Let me do this, and we'll flip flop.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.270
Hi.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.570
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:50.870
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Good morning.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.130
&gt;&gt; I was wondering how people
continue to do police work

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.230
into their 40's and 50's.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.220
When I was in my 20's and 30's, I
didn't believe I was under any kind

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.570
of risk at all, but I look back
once I got into my 40's and 50's,

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.740
I wouldn't do that kind of work .

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.500
How do they -- how do police
continue to do the work they do?

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.180
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Well, you
bring up a very good point.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.750
I think it's a young person's
job, and there's a reason

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:21.220
that people's assignments
change as they get older and go

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.060
up the ranks or they pull the pin.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.980
When I was out on the street
with plain clothes guys

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.810
and women, those are young people.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.010
The great fun of chasing
someone down a subway tunnel.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.530
It's one of the great
bonuses of this job you get

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.800
to do, weird, fun things.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.830
It was a thrill, but
an adrenalin rush.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.890
But I was tired.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:56.000
So I think that the job with a
capital J sort of works that factor

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.630
into it, and you see men
and women get more desk jobs

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.180 position:56%
and more sort of investigative jobs.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.720
At the same time, I mean, if
you're a homicide investigator,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.200
for instance, [inaudible] robbery,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:14.160
I think that experience,
of course, is key.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.440
You want those older people,
been around the pool a few times.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.600
You want some gray
hair in that room.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.080
You make fewer mistakes.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.590 position:56%
Even on the streets sometimes I
think it's good to have those people

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.950 position:56%
because they have more of a tendency
to talk down a situation and more

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:36.370
of an ability to talk that
situation down as opposed to sort

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.080 position:56%
of the higher testosterone young
guy who just got out of the military

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.950
and is now on the streets.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.250
Thank you, sir.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:45.580
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: We just
got a five minute warning.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.880
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Okay.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.180
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
A couple minutes ago.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.480
So --

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.780
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Cool.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.080
Should we go back here
and then over here?

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.380
Is that fair?

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.680
Yes. Hi, I can't see a thing.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.980
&gt;&gt; Hi. This book was tremendous.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.280
I've never read any
of your books before,

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.580
and I have a long reading
list ahead of me right now.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.880
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Well, thank you.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.610
&gt;&gt; I have a question about the
character, Nasty, the informant.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:07.450
I found him fascinating, and I was
wondering your inspiration behind

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.940
that character, if that was
based on a composite of people.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.240
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.640
All my characters are not
necessarily based on any person,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.580
but they're sort of
inspired by composites.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.850
Look again, I went out with cops.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.250
I work with cops a lot.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.700
You get to know informants.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.880 position:56%
When I was a P.I., I had informants.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.180
I had sources.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.010
I was such a low level P.I.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.160
at one point I would
take my informants

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.420
to Kentucky Fried Chicken.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.150
And if they had really good
information, they got extra crispy.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.100
That's how down and
dirty my work was

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.490
at a certain phase in Time Square.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.670
So I've known those folks.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:53.560
I have empathy for them.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:58.890
One thing that's in the book --
and a lot of them are addicts.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.450
One thing that's in the
book that's again true,

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:08.180
is that a lot of cops carry around
small amounts of heroin with them

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.640
in order to give to informants
if they're really hurting.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.860
&gt;&gt; I don't want to give anything
away, but just how he evolved

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.700 position:56%
from your first impression of him to
the end, that was just fascinating.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.000
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Well,
thank you very much.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.300 position:56%
I don't want to give it away either.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.600
Thank you.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.900
Yes, sir.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.070
&gt;&gt; So first of all, thank
you so much for this book.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:29.950 position:56%
It's easily my favorite of the year.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.250
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.240
&gt;&gt; It's a very New York book
which I think is distinct

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.240
from just a book set in New York,
and you did that really well

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.060
with Irish Mafia Sessions and
The Power of the Dog as well.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.740
Do you see yourself
returning to that later on?

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.040
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.750
I think that -- well, I know
that large parts of my next book

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.110
about drugs will deal
sadly and [inaudible]

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.220
with the so-called heroin epidemic.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.700
And Staten Island which has
become known as Heroin Island.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:03.260
So large sections of that book will
be returning to New York as well

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.210
as Mexico and California and
here in Washington, D.C.,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.930
long chapters of the book
because this book will --

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.380
because of what's happening
will be more political and more

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.330
about policy battles as it will

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.020
about undercover operations
and things like that.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.620
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.460
Yes, and then we'll come back --
even though I'm from San Diego,

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:28.460 position:56%
I am going to acknowledge the person
in the L.A. Dodgers cap grudgingly.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.760
Yes, ma'am.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.390
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm curious
about your background.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.690
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, me too.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.990
&gt;&gt; Sounds like [inaudible] --

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.910
it sounds like as a writer you
had some fantastic experiences

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.590
to feed into your fiction.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.390
So I'm curious how one
goes from getting a degree

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.510
in African Studies to being a P.I.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.010
in Time Square no less?

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: The long way, ma'am.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.080
Look, I don't want to
be ironic about it.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.890
I just needed to make money.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:59.170
I had to pay rent and --
and so I tried to do things

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.640
that were interesting
and a little different,

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.660
and when those opportunities
came up, I did that.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.950
The way I got to be a P.I.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.750
was I managed movie theaters in
New York City so you learn all

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.060
about theft because all they
are are glittering walls

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.090 position:56%
to disguise various levels of theft.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:20.890
And so later I was hired to uproot
that theft in other theaters

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.280
and then I stayed with the agency.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.230
African History, again, your
career options are tiny,

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:32.420
and I might have gone
in the state department,

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.420
but that would have meant benefits
and a career and prestige and all

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.660
that kind of thing and instead I
could go and be absolutely broke

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.850
and be a safari bum and
live from moment to moment.

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.540
So of course I made that choice.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.500
Thank you.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.340
Yes, Dodgers fan.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.640
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.940
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Make it quick.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.240
&gt;&gt; Really enjoying the book.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.540
Great job.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:58.790
How did you come to write this
narrative strictly from the point

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:02.570
of view of Danny Malone
because I've read two

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.230
of your previous books
also tremendous,

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.060
and they had different
points of view.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.490
This is all from Malone.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:09.790
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Yeah, thank you.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.090
That's, again, a very
astute question.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.120
It's the only book
I've done that with.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.430
There's a technical phrase
for it that I'm not aware of.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.890
So I'm going to mention it in the
third person close or something.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.060 position:56%
Anyway, I've never went to writing
school so I don't know these things,

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:27.130
but the decision -- I wrote scenes
from other character's points

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:28.960
of view, and they didn't work.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.880
And then I realize that what I
wanted to do, what I really needed

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.130 position:56%
to do was put the reader -- the book
starts in a locked room with Malone.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.750
You already know he's been busted.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:44.620
And keep the reader just tight
with him through the entire ride.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:49.400
That seemed to create a certain
kind of intensity and emotion

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.630
because when I did write scenes
from other points of view,

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.920
which would have been a lot
easier by the way from Claudette

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.920
and Russeau and some of
these other characters,

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.910
it seemed to let the
tension out of the book.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.620
It just drained it in ways that
I didn't want and slowed it down.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.860
And so I made that
decision albeit reluctantly

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.520
to stay just with Malone.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.180
I've never done it before, and I
don't know if I'll do it again.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.000
Thank you for that question.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.300
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Thank you so much, Don.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.100
&gt;&gt; Don Winslow: Thank you so much.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:25.570
