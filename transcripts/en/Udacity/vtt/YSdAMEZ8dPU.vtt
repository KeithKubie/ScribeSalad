Once you have a handle on the major elements and behaviors you can begin to

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.290
construct an analysis model. We'll use the UML class-model diagram to

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.510
express this analysis. A class-model diagram has rectangles for

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.780
classes which we're going to use the term components to indicate

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.510
the structural elements. We're going to use classes to, denote the components.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.528
Each rectangle is divided vertically into three compartments. One for

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:30.430
the compartment name, at the top. One for its attributes, in the middle.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.520
And one for its operations, at the bottom. And then lines

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.260
between the rectangles are going to denote relationships among the components.
