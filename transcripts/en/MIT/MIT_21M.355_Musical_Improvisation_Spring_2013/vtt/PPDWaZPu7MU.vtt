00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.970
PROFESSOR: Our guest today, this
is Neil Leonard from Berkeley.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.080
As you can see by
your handout, he's

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.570
the director of the
interdisciplinary Arts

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.200
Institute there, and professor
of electronic production

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.030
and design.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.280
He's been a friend of mine.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.870
He was a former student,
briefly, at NEC,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.340
and gone on to great,
wonderful things,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.390
including travels
around the world,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.220
as you can see by
the bio so we're

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.890
very fortunate that
he's here today.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250
He's got an assignment
on the handout which

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250
he'll talk about
as we go through.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.380
And that'll be due
next Monday like we've

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.720
done before with other
of our presenters.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.200
Don't forget, Wednesday we
have a concert with Neil

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.180
and an associate
Robin Eubanks, who's

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.000
one of the great
improvisers on the scene

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.200
today, wonderful trombonist.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.830
So they'll be in Killian Hall,
Wednesday night, 8 o'clock.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.580
So bring everybody
you know for that.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.060
It's free.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.275
And once again, there will be a
concert reflection, as we know.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.330
So turn it over to
Neil, welcome him.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.830
Thank you.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.700
NEIL LEONARD: Hi.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.134
So I'm going to give a
short presentation on a work

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.800
I've created, a little
bit of background

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.450
and why I made the
work, and leave you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.630
with an assignment,
which is to create

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.750
your own work along the
same lines and with the idea

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.640
that when I come
back next Monday

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.460
I'll be able to hear what
you guys have come up with.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.110
And we could even play together.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.270
So this is all kind of going
in the direction of you taking

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.290
some of these ideas and
running with them on your own.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.000
I have a background
as a jazz saxophonist

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.090
with some activity in the area
of fine arts, which kind of

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.820
means that I've always had not
like a singular vision of what

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.430
I want to do, but
I've always kind of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.310
been looking on the
peripheral for other things

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.450
that will be interesting.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.920
When I was a teenager,
really, I played in bands

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.880
in Philadelphia.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.140
And one of the bands
that I was part of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.214
had these two brothers
Robin and Kevin Eubanks.

00:02:37.214 --> 00:02:38.880
And Kevin Eubanks,
you might have known,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.710
was the band director
of the Jay Leno Show

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.820
for I think about
18 years or so.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.730
And he recently retired.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.030
And his older brother, Robin,
is going to, as Mark said,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.470
participate in the
concert on Wednesday

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.470
evening, fantastic
trombone player.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.480
So he's a guy I've
known as a kind

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.670
of young musician
in Philadelphia.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.210
And that was sort
of the background

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.127
I came from, just kind
of people playing jazz,

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:09.210
a little bit of pop musical,
a little bit of funk,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.640
occasionally a Latin gig, as
a teenager in Philadelphia

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.616
before I moved out
of Philadelphia

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:14.615
to go to a conservatory.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.750
In the course of
playing the saxophone,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.780
I came across a few things
which really interest me.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.110
One was a reel-to-reel
tape deck.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.870
So the school I went to had
a small electronic music

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.900
studio with a EMS synthesizer
and a two reel-to-reel tape

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.700
decks.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.090
And we were essentially
just shown this stuff

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.100
and invited to come
to use it somehow.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.500
And at that time, I was really
interested in pop music.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.130
That was kind of
before jazz, I had

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.020
listened to pop music that
had very interesting things

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.250
happening in the production.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.740
So this would be Jimi
Hendrix, Pink Floyd,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.550
you name it bands of say
the '70s, so to speak,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.180
if I can really date myself.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.450
And I began to teach
myself a little bit

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.890
about how to use this tape deck.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.390
And one of the
first performances

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.459
I can remember doing was with
a trumpet player, my brother

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.280
Devin who played
trumpet, a pianist.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.930
I played some objects
which I had just collected,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.550
pieces of hardware,
chains, stuff like that.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.260
I had some recordings
that I played back

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.140
from this reel-to-reel
tape deck.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.190
And for me, this just
seemed like a normal way

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.070
that someone would
want to play music.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.890
So you'd learn to
play your instrument.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.860
You'd take lessons.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.800
You'd be in ensembles.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.870
You'd do all the things that
an instrumentalist would do.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.930
But at least to
me, it just seemed

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.610
interesting to see
what else I could bring

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.290
to the mix of playing
improvised music.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.420
And now a few decades
later, I'm really

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.970
still kind of doing that.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.280
So I'd like to introduce
a work that I did that in.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.470
But I guess first before
I show my own work,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.210
I want to talk a
little bit about things

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.721
that were in the
air when I started,

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.720
a little more about things
that were in the air.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.685
And two of the things that
I think had an impact on me

00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:32.530
as a young musician, and
musicians in general,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.260
was number one, John Cage.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.270
And mark has
mentioned that you've

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.600
spoken a little bit about John
Cage's work in this class.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.510
And did you talk
about Four Minutes

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.920
and 33 Seconds of
Silence by chance?

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.710
Do you know that work?

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.930
OK, so this is a work, seminal
work of 20th century music.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.550
It's a piece in three parts.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.680
And in the premier performance,
as I understand it,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.400
the pianist went to
the concert hall,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.290
opened up the lid
of the piano, sat

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.570
for four minutes and 33 seconds,
and then closed the piano lid.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.160
And the piece was done.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.820
I heard a really
interesting lecture on Cage

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.110
and his impact on today's
music in the last week.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.690
And the person who gave
the talk pointed out

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.770
that Four Minutes and
33 Seconds of Silence

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.850
was not about listening
to the sound in the room.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.500
But it was about
diverting your attention.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.700
So you go to the concert
hall with the expectation

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.120
of seeing the lid
goes up on the piano,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.870
this virtuoso plays
this incredible piece.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.480
We're all in awe.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.320
We applaud.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.450
We go home.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.350
And this piece was
like opening up

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.905
the door to shifting your
attention away from that.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.170
And that has some really
interesting implications

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.820
because I think even for
Cage-- Cage was thinking

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.930
about the impact of
convention, but also

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.720
the impact of big
business on music.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.905
So he wrote a lecture that
was called Lecture on Nothing.

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:13.690
And in this lecture, he talks
about the impact of media

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.310
culture, Time Magazine,
Life Magazine, Pepsi-Cola,

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.640
and how they have a bearing
on what we understand culture

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.630
to be.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.780
I got a text for my son
during the last Superbowl.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.910
And Rihanna was on.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.430
And so I went to go catch
a little bit of this thing

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.212
he was all excited about.

00:07:32.212 --> 00:07:33.920
And it was sponsored
by Pepsi, wasn't it?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.990
Wasn't Rihanna's Superbowl
performance sponsored by Pepsi?

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.066
So, again, it was
like big business

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:46.045
is investing a lot of time,
money, and energy on what they

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:47.420
want us to see,
which is probably

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.470
going to lead us to
buy Pepsi-Cola, which

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.110
is why they're putting
money into this.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.360
But all this is to say
that one of the things that

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.725
was interesting about Cage
was his music was encouraging,

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:02.370
or his work was encouraging
us, to look outside

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.590
of the prevailing
orthodox models of making

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.220
music, and thinking of other
ways to think about music,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.340
to approach music, to
approach working with sound.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.860
So somehow that stuck.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.550
Another thing that was
in the air at the time

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.530
that I was starting to
play music was, I think,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:24.740
one of the first albums--
I remember at one point,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.670
for my birthday
and for Christmas,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.881
all I wanted was recordings.

00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:29.380
My mother's in the
back of the room.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.760
So I remember giving her my
wish list, like, I want records.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.309
And I remember one
of the recordings

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.386
I got for Christmas was
The Beatles White Album.

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:41.010
And The Beatles White
Album had a piece

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.669
called Revolution Number Nine.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.250
Do anybody know that piece?

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.220
Raise your hand if
you know that piece.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.520
And goes up, OK, good.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.640
Two, OK, two people
know that piece.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.910
John Lennon's wife,
Yoko Ono, no was

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.890
part of a group
called Fluxus artists.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.780
And they were kind of
radical, experimental artists

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.200
who did all kinds of
really fascinating things

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.500
with performance, with music,
with film, kind of opening up

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.440
all genres and medium as
tools for them to explore.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:23.020
And through Yoko Ono, John
Lennon knew John Cage.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.982
And one of the things
he did upon becoming

00:09:26.982 --> 00:09:28.940
in contact with John Cage
and these ideas is he

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.606
made this piece.

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:32.020
And I'd like to play just
a little bit of it that's

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.060
called Revolution Number Nine.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:38.310
Now, I have colleagues who
say that this is a song

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.180
because John Lennon
only made songs.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.420
So you could think
of this as a song.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.610
I always sort of thought of as a
tape piece, or a sound collage,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.330
because that's the kind of
terms I understand it in.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.098
So let me see if I
can get this to play.

00:09:57.078 --> 00:10:02.058
Can we turn this up?

00:10:02.058 --> 00:10:03.552
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.710
NEIL LEONARD: I'm
going to stop it here.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.860
The piece is eight
minutes and 22 seconds.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.490
So it's a sizable piece from
this recording The White Album.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.630
So somehow this
stuff was in the air.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.840
And I think it really
had an impact on me.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.990
As I was alluding to
earlier, did something

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.990
to my peripheral vision.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.365
It made me think that there's
something interesting there

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:56.686
on the side to think
about and investigate.

00:10:56.686 --> 00:10:59.060
With The Beatles it wasn't
just I Want To Hold Your Hand,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.700
and these wonderful pop tunes
that I made, all of which

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.510
I really enjoyed.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.060
But there was sort of
another world, other ways,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.310
to think about
working with sound.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.500
So what I would like to do
now is kind of fast forward

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.850
and show you fragments
of a piece I made,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.090
a long piece I made,
in the past few years.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.240
But before I do
that, I just want

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.610
to invite you, if you have
questions or comments, please

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.830
just blurt out your
questions or raise your hand.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.860
And I'm happy to stop
anywhere along the way

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.410
and hear what's on your mind.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.180
OK?

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.085
And actually, I
have a new tactic

00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:39.210
which I'm using with my
students at Berkeley, which

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.370
is I don't let anybody leave the
room until they ask a question.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.150
So that works pretty well.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.570
Yes, you're leaving the room?

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.861
AUDIENCE: How did he make that?

00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:49.270
Did he splice tapes together?

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.970
NEIL LEONARD: Splicing
tape together,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.470
sometimes the
tapes are reversed.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.460
It sounds like
snippets of a band

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.160
playing that were reversed.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.530
They had a brilliant
producer who's

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.710
often referred to as the fifth
Beatle, George Martin, who

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.420
had a background in
orchestral writing.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.760
So he had a very
robust skill set.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.980
And if they came in
with an idea that

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.540
was kind of outside the norm
of making just pop hits,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.490
or the way popular
music had been made,

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.050
he was often their collaborator
in going on a tangent

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.270
and doing things.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.980
One example would be for
the piece Penny Lane.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.480
I don't know if you
know that piece.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.320
It's a fabulous song of theirs.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.850
I think it was Paul McCartney
had seen the London Symphony

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.350
Orchestra.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.610
He heard a Piccolo trumpet
in a Baroque concerto.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.880
He went back and told
George Martin, like,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.905
that was really cool.

00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:46.280
And George Martin
said, oh, let's

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.820
get the Piccolo
player from the LSO.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.290
And we'll use him on a piece.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.890
So George Martin probably wrote
the part of the Piccolo trumpet

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.850
on Penny Lane.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.790
And it doesn't sound like any
other track they ever made.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.503
It's a wonderful,
idiosyncratic, playful track.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.870
So, yeah, you get
to leave the room.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.130
You asked a question.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.090
I should give you a ticket.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.320
So I'm going to fast forward.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:25.654
And I spent a few years actually
working at Mass College of Art.

00:13:25.654 --> 00:13:27.570
I thought it was going
to be a short-term job.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:34.640
And it turned out to be an
eight year residency there and.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.370
And I kind of went in
knowing a little bit

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.114
about computers, and
some teaching experience,

00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:42.030
and a little bit of
administrative experience.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.620
And they said, great,
you'll do all of that.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.660
And I ended up staying
there because they

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.820
had a few really
interesting people who

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.160
came to work with us.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.170
One was this jazz trombonist
named George Lois, who

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.200
is a seminal person working
with jazz and electronics, which

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.280
only fueled all this
curiosity even more.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.000
John Cage was in town for a
year we did the Norton Lectures.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.590
And he came to Mass
Art a few times

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.640
to meet with us, to
see what we were doing.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.947
I got a chance to
show him my work.

00:14:14.947 --> 00:14:17.280
There was a famous video
artist named Tony [? Allison ?]

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.238
who was on the faculty.

00:14:18.238 --> 00:14:20.329
So all this is to say,
I ended up staying.

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:22.120
I really didn't think
I'd be staying there.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.620
But I did.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.680
I stayed there for
eight years, kind of

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.200
got involved once again in
working with visual artists.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.119
Not so much me
making visual art,

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:34.660
but collaborating
with visual artists

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.650
on all kinds of projects,
performances, films, videos,

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.780
dance projects, theater
projects, happenings,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.010
computer graphics with sound.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:52.640
And then, eventually, I married
a woman who is a visual artist.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.290
And we've done a lot of
work around the world.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.060
We're doing a piece
in the upcoming Venice

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.180
Biennial in May.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.890
We did piece in the
Havana Biennial last May.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.780
And so I've kind of
worked quite a bit

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.490
with people who aren't
just playing saxophone,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.120
or just play with saxophonists.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.440
I've been very interested
in finding artists outside

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.430
of music to collaborate with.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.160
So in this kind of journey of
working with artists outside

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:33.880
of music, I was at an Italian
estate on top of a mountain,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:40.550
fantastic villa that
had two incredible view.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.420
One is the marble
quarries of Carrara.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.300
So across the valley, you can
see these mountains of Carrara.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.720
And even though it's
summer and it's warm,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.260
there's just white spilling
out of the mountains, which

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:01.810
is the fragments of marble
that didn't get schlepped away,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.060
but are just kind of like
tumbling down the mountains.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:09.450
So the mountains had these
sort of white residual marble,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:10.870
chunks of marble.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.150
The other side is
the Ligurian Sea.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.630
And so my wife and
I were asked to make

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.650
a permanent installation
at this Italian estate.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.740
And the owners,
every two years they

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.800
would go to the Venice
Biennial and pick an artist

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.130
to commission to make a
permanent, site-specific work

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.660
for their estate.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.140
And we met them,
they'd say, hey,

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.470
would you do something
for our estate?

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.060
And we said, yep, we
got this great idea.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.393
And they said, no, we don't
want to see your great idea.

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:39.990
We want you to come to the
estate, look at the place,

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.160
look at the territory,
and think of an idea that

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.260
would work for the space.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.790
So its site specific, which
is a very important concept

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.350
in visual art.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.710
So we developed a relationship
with this commissioner

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:59.220
of private sculptures for
this private sculpture park.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.230
And one year I was going
back to visit them,

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.060
and they said, you know, we
have this sculpture which you've

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.450
seen that is this huge--
maybe you could draw it--

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:14.390
it's this huge pit that's
maybe eight feet across.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.810
It's like a pit that goes
straight down the Earth.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.430
And there's just a
spiral of church bells,

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.660
with no clappers in them.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.130
Very large church bells, I
mean, they might be like,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.519
from top to bottom, if
the hinge was up here,

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:27.810
the clapper would be down here.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.790
They're very, very big.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.510
But they're turned
upside down and they're

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.940
arranged in a spiral kind
of like facing the sky.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.920
And so the owner said,
would you record these bells

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.810
and make something with this?

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.790
And I thought, well, I have no
idea what I'll make of this,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.620
but why not?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.380
I'll record these bells.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.500
So I recorded the
sounds of these bells.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.751
And I kind of had them around.

00:17:50.751 --> 00:17:52.708
I started to play with
them, didn't really know

00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:53.800
what I'd do with them.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.910
And I met a choreographer,
also Italy, in Naples,

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:06.400
and then she asked me for a
composition for a dance piece.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.630
And I thought, OK, well
I have these sounds

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.620
I made with these bells.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.390
So maybe it would be
interesting to do something

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.170
with these belts.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.440
So I'm going to play just a
fragment of this recording

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.845
that I made.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.290
So you know when you
take a JPEG image

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.110
and you stretch it
horizontally, all of a sudden

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.050
the image is unrecognizable?

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.150
This is sort of what
I've done with sound.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.130
And some of this I did
with some free software

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.960
which I could show you.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960
There's commercial software.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.020
There's free software.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.394
Lots of different software
does time stretching of audio.

00:18:54.394 --> 00:18:56.230
So this could be
two seconds of audio

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.500
that's stretched
out for a minute.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.210
The computer's going
to kind of sputter.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.597
And then this is sounds of just
bells straight because I wanted

00:19:12.597 --> 00:19:14.180
the listeners in the
dance performance

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:20.068
to be able to hear an actual
bell so this wash of sound

00:19:20.068 --> 00:19:22.068
in the background would
make some kind of sense,

00:19:22.068 --> 00:19:24.528
would have some context.

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:25.512
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.255
NEIL LEONARD: Now,
the dance performance

00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:46.435
was 40 minutes long.

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.261
So it's a very
kind of slow, kind

00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:50.817
of glacially moving performance.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.930
So nothing in the music
happens too quickly.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.955
The music goes through a
lot of different phases.

00:19:58.955 --> 00:20:02.102
But each phase is
maybe five minutes.

00:20:02.102 --> 00:20:03.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:40.946
NEIL LEONARD: And this goes on.

00:20:40.946 --> 00:20:42.904
But essentially, these
were recordings of bells

00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:45.860
that I put in a program called
Spear, which we could look at.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:51.410
And I began playing with ways
to time stretch the audio,

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.860
listening to what
sounded interesting,

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.350
throwing away a lot of stuff.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:01.040
I kind of went into a phase
where when I make a piece,

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.770
I want to have a
phase in the beginning

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.910
where I call it sort of like
your work-- a research phase,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.480
research, slash,
play, slash, failure.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.935
Meaning, I take sounds,
I put them in a software.

00:21:14.935 --> 00:21:15.935
I play around with them.

00:21:15.935 --> 00:21:21.160
I research what I can do,
knowing that I probably

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.580
have time to throw
a lot of these away.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.192
So I'm not doing this the
day before the performance.

00:21:26.192 --> 00:21:27.900
This might be a few
weeks or a few months

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.260
before the performance.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.709
And I want to build
in time to experiment,

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.750
knowing that a lot of the
experiments won't work.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.160
So out of many of
those experiments,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.850
I came out with this file.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:39.830
Sent it to the dancer.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.620
The dancer said, that's really
going to work for the idea

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.110
that she was thinking of.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:50.330
And then she proposed a site
to do this performance, which

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.970
was Mount Vesuvius.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:59.010
So Mount Vesuvius, as you
know, is the volcanic mountain

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.660
that erupted and buried Pompeii.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.900
It is still an active volcano.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:10.000
There are people who occupy the
side of the volcano pretty much

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.492
against, or in defiance of,
kind of zoning limitations

00:22:15.492 --> 00:22:17.200
because the authorities
don't want people

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.190
to live in this volcano
because it's dangerous.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:23.680
The people live there all
have gas masks in their house,

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.030
because the biggest
the problem is

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.600
the toxic gas that
comes from the volcano.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.234
So in any case, there
was an art center

00:22:30.234 --> 00:22:31.650
on the side of
this mountain where

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.830
we staged this performance.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:40.250
And it kind of grounded
the whole piece right then,

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.262
because I begin to think of
what is it I'm working on?

00:22:43.262 --> 00:22:44.470
I'm working with these bells.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.136
We're doing something
on Mount Vesuvius.

00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.850
How am I going to
begin to kind of focus

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.420
on an idea for this piece?

00:22:53.566 --> 00:22:56.807
And there's an author
named Murray Schafer who

00:22:56.807 --> 00:22:58.890
wrote a book called The
Tuning of the World, which

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.490
has been republished under
the title Soundscape.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.630
You can find it on Amazon.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.360
It's probably in the library
here, Murray H. Schafer.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.080
And one of the things
he writes about

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.940
is that for any environment
there's a keynote sound.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.560
There is a sound
that we human beings

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.090
associate with
every environment.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.290
So with this
environment right now,

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:27.440
it's probably the sound of the
fan on the video projector,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.410
or maybe the hiss coming
out of the speakers.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.010
This would be
keynote sound here.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.100
Perhaps in the
hallway, it's the sound

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:39.770
of footsteps within this space
that you know is very long.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.260
It's not very wide.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.705
And it's a fairly
reverberant space.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:46.915
So every place you
go, there are sounds

00:23:46.915 --> 00:23:50.371
that let you know
you're in that place.

00:23:50.371 --> 00:23:52.370
When I was standing at
the subway the other day,

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.310
the metro in Brookline,
I was recording the sound

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.870
of the train because I've
taken that train, the D Line,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.890
for ages.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.640
And if I heard that
sound in my sleep,

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.750
I would know, Green Line,
lightrail vehicle, Green Line.

00:24:09.772 --> 00:24:11.480
So I would say that
one of the things I'm

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.180
really interested
in doing is thinking

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.980
of pieces that have
a particular meaning,

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.385
have a meaning that's
tied to a particular site.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.100
That fascinates me.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.342
And that's a way to kind of get
out of doing what I always do.

00:24:27.342 --> 00:24:29.050
So if I'm going to
work at Mount Vesuvius

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.800
I don't want to do just
what I do in Boston.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.299
I want to do something
which is kind

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:34.336
of specific to a
performance which

00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:35.960
is going to premiere
at Mount Vesuvius.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:42.210
If I do something in
a rice paddy in Japan,

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.470
what's something about
a rice paddy in Japan

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.660
that I wouldn't
think of in Boston?

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:52.400
How can I respond to the
site where the work is?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.750
So one of the ways
to respond to a site

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.230
where you're working
as a musician is

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:08.977
to think of the keynote
sounds, and play with those.

00:25:08.977 --> 00:25:11.310
What are the sounds that are
typical to that environment

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.850
that kind of tell you
you're in that environment

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.370
that you can play with?

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.790
I should say, very briefly,
that one of the things which

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.180
is fascinating in Murray
Schafer's book and his ideas,

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:33.090
is that he also kind of points
to this way of reflecting

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:39.920
on your environment is an
integral part of literature

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.770
that we know, that we've
known for centuries.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:50.910
So, for example, for Dickens
to talk about England

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:56.920
in the period of Oliver
Twist, cobblestone streets

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.220
have a particular sound,
horses on cobblestone streets

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.700
have a particular sound.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.810
Those sounds are
sounds that Dickens

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.330
is very aware of being very
important to your understanding

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:06.460
of that place.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.480
Those are parts
of Dickens' world.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.990
Tolstoy, same, the example
I like most is Dante.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.325
In Dante's Inferno, when Virgil
and Dante head off to hell,

00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:19.200
they decide they're
going to go over to hell,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.116
see what's over there.

00:26:20.116 --> 00:26:21.000
They pass Cerberus.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.540
They make it to
the mouth of hell.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.540
There are no stars above hell.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.680
The damned don't
get to have stars.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.080
There's a black sky above hell.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.290
And because the sky is
black and there's no light,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.505
there are two paragraphs
of The Inferno

00:26:33.505 --> 00:26:37.320
that the contact with
hell is an audio contact.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.960
It's an audible contact.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.190
They hear the sounds
of the damned.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.450
And there is a two paragraph
description of the sighs,

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.400
and the gasping,
and the kind of toil

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.090
that these people are
experiencing in hell.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.970
So all this is fascinating
to me because it

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:57.210
means that Dante, Tolstoy,
Dickens, were audio artists.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:02.600
They were interested in oral
analysis, or oral reflection,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.580
of their environment.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.530
So this is part of
something we can do.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.970
Our environment might be
like the vending machines

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.319
downstairs.

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:14.610
They may be the sound of
going up and down the hallway,

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.340
or going up and down
the staircases which

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.990
have wonderful echoes.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.950
It could be the sound
of radiators just

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.940
kind of flapping.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.710
But these are
sounds which can be

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.740
really interesting to work with.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.500
So when I began to work
on this piece, which

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.750
I'm going to play not
the rest of, but more of,

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.570
I just wanted to say that
it occurred to me that there

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.220
was this wonderful opportunity
in that one of the most

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:46.900
incredible sounds ever in Italy
was Mount Vesuvius blowing up.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.230
And period accounts
of that explosion

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.722
say that the explosion could
be heard 100 kilometers away.

00:27:55.722 --> 00:27:57.180
So you could
practically be in Rome

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.300
and hear the sound of
this colossal boom.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:07.550
The colossal mountain now
is kind of like a big mouth

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.570
waiting to erupt again,
like these bells.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.620
The mouths the bells were
all facing the ceiling.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.170
So this became kind
of an idea that I

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:23.080
began to play with and work
with in the piece, this idea

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.600
of a kind of silent tongue.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.200
As the piece evolved--
and I'll play you

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.360
maybe five minutes of a kind of
finished version of the piece,

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.750
of a radio edit of the
peace, a short version.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:52.730
I wanted to also process
not just bells, but voice.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.910
And I asked the host
if they could find me

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.314
a singer who lived
on Mount Vesuvius.

00:28:59.314 --> 00:29:01.480
And they said, oh, yeah,
we've got a singer for you.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.912
So they found a singer.

00:29:02.912 --> 00:29:03.620
And it was great.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.840
She was in this metal band.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.310
And she told me her my favorite
singer was Diamanda Galas.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.976
I don't know if you
know Diamanda Galas,

00:29:11.976 --> 00:29:17.970
but she is a very kind of
eccentric, powerful force

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.920
of a vocalist.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.295
So she came with some
people from her band

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.670
to the place where
I was staying.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.870
I recorded her voice.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:32.423
And I began to also play around
with time stretching her voice.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.490
Kind of moving forward to
the final stage of the work,

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.300
because there were several
versions of this piece.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.532
There was a piece for the
opening with a dancer.

00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:44.740
There were a couple concerts.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.070
I liked it enough that I
use it concerts a few times.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.560
I'll actually play parts
of this on Wednesday night.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.570
But I also had this
experience where

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.470
I was in China for the
first time, in Beijing.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.430
And I gave a concert.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.190
Somebody came up to
me after the concert

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.182
and was really
interested in this piece.

00:30:05.182 --> 00:30:07.140
Or actually was interested
in a piece I played.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.330
So a conversation began.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.110
And it turned out
the person who had

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:21.040
come to talk to me after the
concert was a singer trained

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.020
in kind of Peking
opera style, so

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.470
very traditional Chinese music.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.990
Does anybody know
Chinese music here?

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.410
I really don't.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.520
I've just been to China and
know some Chinese musicians.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.670
So in any case, I
said, OK, would you

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.160
be interested in
singing a piece?

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.040
And she said sure.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.160
I said, here's an MP3.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.390
Come tomorrow night
at five o'clock.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.306
We have a sound check.

00:30:46.306 --> 00:30:47.580
We'll see how this goes.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:53.820
So let me find a
version of this,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.650
so kind of a later generation
of this piece I played you

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.600
earlier with the bells,
I'll just play an excerpt.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.410
You'll hear three things
which are new here.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:21.900
One is there's a sound of a
singer from Napoli singing not

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.757
Italian syllables, just kind
of making up her syllables.

00:31:24.757 --> 00:31:27.090
And then on top of that there's
also a Chinese vocalist.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.110
So this kind of became this
sort of vocal time collage that

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:34.730
kept on getting elaborated on
in the course of a few projects.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.260
And I'm playing
saxophone as well.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.930
And the bells are kind
of fading out here.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.696
Those are the bells.

00:31:49.696 --> 00:31:50.692
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:46.537 --> 00:35:49.322
I'll stop that here.

00:35:49.322 --> 00:35:50.780
I won't play all
of it because I'll

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.196
play the whole
thing on Wednesday.

00:35:52.196 --> 00:35:55.550
So we'll hear the
whole thing then.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.600
But that piece turned into
kind of a trio voices.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.690
There's a saxophone.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.510
There's this very time
stretched processed voice, which

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.060
is mostly based on this
Italian woman singing.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.290
And there's an improvisation by
a person who does Peking opera,

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:15.730
but was interested in
doing electronic music

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.550
for the first time basically.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.710
And so that piece kind
of took its course

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.690
through just interacting
with people that I found,

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.710
a choreographer, a
singer, a collector

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.894
who had interest in a
sculpture that he thought

00:36:28.894 --> 00:36:29.685
might make a sound.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.821
Actually nobody was a jazz
musician except for me.

00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:39.320
So that's just an
example of a piece

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.805
I did in which these interests
I have kind of coalesce.

00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:45.930
There's an interest in
working with artists outside

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.870
of music, choreographer.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.780
There's interest in fine
art, working with a collector

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.990
to get his idea
for materials that

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:58.880
might be interesting
to play with sonically.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.750
And I'm still
playing the saxophone

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.250
in a way which is not
completely unlike how

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.140
I play in a jazz setting.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.710
Any questions,
comments thus far?

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.210
Yeah?

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:13.162
AUDIENCE: So did you get both
the singers first and then

00:37:13.162 --> 00:37:16.126
decide whether [INAUDIBLE] and
how did you do your sax part?

00:37:16.126 --> 00:37:17.620
Is that what came last?

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:22.190
NEIL LEONARD: Well in this
case it did come last.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.000
There was a lot of
sound design work.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.430
I guess for the premiere
that we did in Napoli-- I'm

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.960
not worried about
playing the sax.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.890
I can play the sax for
40 minutes no problem.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.030
I was concerned about having
enough electronic material,

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.800
enough of the sound collage.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.290
So I invested a lot of time in
getting that happening first.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.300
And that probably
took for the premiere,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.120
I had and some
fragments of it made,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.620
but there was a couple
weeks of work nonstop

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.410
on the electronic score.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.346
And then probably two
days before the concert,

00:38:00.346 --> 00:38:02.220
I began to play around
the saxophone and kind

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.010
of find where it fit in,
although I kind of intuitively

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.500
knew here's a place I
left for me to fit in.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.968
Here's a place for me to fit in.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.131
Other questions?

00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:13.630
Yeah

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.055
AUDIENCE: What sort
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:18.335 --> 00:38:19.460
AUDIENCE: Vocal recordings?

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:24.570
I did one which I'll show
you, which is really--

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.280
I'll do a very
quick version of it.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.280
I found out that a piece of
software that worked really

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:38.330
well, is a piece of
software that's free.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:39.540
It's Windows and PC.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.060
It's called Spear.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.262
And I'll show you
one of the things.

00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:44.970
I don't want to spend
too much time on it

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.060
because it's really fun.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.405
It's a lot of fun.

00:38:52.405 --> 00:38:53.280
But there it is.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.790
This is a recording
of the trombonist

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.190
I'm playing with on Wednesday.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.450
It's a solo trombone track.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:04.570
And what the software's
going to do-- just

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.970
going to say yes
to the defaults.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.840
It's going to do an
analysis of the sound.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.980
And the analysis
takes the sound.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:20.520
And it describes the sound.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.380
Try and shrink this, zoom
out as far as possible.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.260
It's freeware.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.810
It's kind of clunky,
but it works.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:34.380
So this file, let me see
if I can just play it.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.754
[TROMBONE]

00:39:44.358 --> 00:39:46.540
NEIL LEONARD: So
just a trombone.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:54.370
Now, just a trombone-- you
really don't see everything

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:57.290
on the projector, but that's OK.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:02.530
These are frequencies from
zero Hertz up 8,500 Hertz.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.860
And this, of course, is
a timeline over here.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:13.780
And it deconstructs the sound
into a plot of sine waves.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.670
So without really
getting too far into it,

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.336
let me just do one
thing to convince you

00:40:17.336 --> 00:40:19.100
that it's really doing that.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.272
So we'll go over here.

00:40:20.272 --> 00:40:22.230
And I'm going to take
some of these sine waves.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:25.480
I'm going to select them just
by control clicking on them.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.250
And I'll just grab some of them.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.910
There they are.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.449
And now I'll go to
New from Select.

00:40:35.449 --> 00:40:36.990
We'll make a new
file from selection.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.710
And there's only the
sine waves I selected.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.230
Let's play those and
see what it sounds like.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.120
[SOUNDS]

00:40:49.189 --> 00:40:51.230
NEIL LEONARD: Those are
sounds that are in there.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:54.550
Now, there happen to be hundreds
of sine waves at a given

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.020
moment.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.540
What we just heard is this.

[TROMBONE]

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.160
NEIL LEONARD: If we grab
some more sine waves--

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.450
actually I'll do it like this.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.010
What's the first
letter of your name?

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:09.745
AUDIENCE: V.

00:41:09.745 --> 00:41:14.403
NEIL LEONARD: OK, we'll
make a V. Not a great V,

00:41:14.403 --> 00:41:16.570
you could do better.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.470
And I can select them that way
just to have fun with this.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.092
And there we go.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.072
And we can play this.

00:41:28.072 --> 00:41:29.036
[SOUNDS]

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.020
NEIL LEONARD: You can probably
see it on my laptop better.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.050
The greys show up
better on this.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.080
But do you get the idea?

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:50.055
That sound, the sound
of the trombone,

00:41:50.055 --> 00:41:54.340
the trombone performance,
is deconstructed

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.880
into a series of sine waves.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.700
If we play them all, we hear
the whole trombone performance.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:03.820
If we take out
certain ones, then it

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.260
sounds like a filtered trombone.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.520
Now, here's one of the
things I did quite a bit,

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.600
in terms of, what did
you do with voice.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.750
And what was the
question you asked me?

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what sort
of things did you play?

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:16.358
NEIL LEONARD: OK, here's one.

00:42:16.358 --> 00:42:17.038
[TROMBONE]

00:42:27.302 --> 00:42:28.560
NEIL LEONARD: Let's take that.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.190
Let's go right there where I
think he kind of changes a note

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.523
and gets a bit more complicated.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.270
I want to time stretch it.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:41.180
So I'm going to say
Transform, Time Stretch.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.200
And I'm going to make it four
times longer, times four.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.150
So.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.859
[TROMBONE]

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.130
NEIL LEONARD: So you can also
hear him move from one note

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:56.630
to another.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.390
All of a sudden it
doesn't sound so clean.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.446
He's a very articulate player.

00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:01.070
But all of a sudden
you get this moment

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.030
of transition, which
is pretty cool.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:08.260
In fact, if I thought that I
really wanted more of that,

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.410
I'll Time Stretch the same
thing again times four.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.568
What do we get now?

00:43:12.568 --> 00:43:13.560
[TROMBONE]

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.560
NEIL LEONARD: It's
like a tri tone.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.850
It's a pretty difficult
to play and you kind of

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.674
get some of that tension
of him playing it.

00:43:29.674 --> 00:43:31.590
There are many different
ways to time stretch.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.669
They all have artifacts.

00:43:32.669 --> 00:43:33.710
None of them are perfect.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.290
But some of the
artifacts I like.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:38.570
So some ways of
stretching it are useful.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.810
And other ways just sound bad.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.540
So there was quite a
bit of time stretching.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.640
But I guess that piece is
not really that extravagant.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.370
I also sort of
collaged at this level.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:58.710
So, for example, we can make a
collage of just these partials.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:01.540
We can take these lines and
treat it like a drawing,

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.520
and rearrange where
the lines are.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.170
So, in fact, I
think I can, again,

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:09.000
without going too far in
this, I can offset this time.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.750
And I'll push all
that stuff over here.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:11.830
Now, it's probably
going to be a mess

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.538
because you can hear
two notes at a time.

00:44:13.538 --> 00:44:17.010
Or we're going to see
what you can here.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:17.978
[TROMBONE]

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.890
NEIL LEONARD: So all this is
to say that, like in Photoshop,

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.470
you have this sort of
incredible facility

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:38.390
for rearranging the
pixels in an image.

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.860
This is like dealing with
sound at the pixel level.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.850
Every component
sine wave of sound

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.410
can be stretched independently,
shrunk independently,

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:46.070
transposed.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.850
In face, we could take some
of these sounds-- actually

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.810
I won't go any further because
I'll just go on and on.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:55.660
And none of this will be what
we really want to listen to.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.860
But you get the idea.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.440
So I used off the shelf
software you pay for.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.500
I used freeware, spent
hours, and hours,

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.090
and hours in that play,
research, failure,

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.510
mode of just trying
more stuff out.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:16.447
Let me just see if I begin to
experiment, what will I get?

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:17.530
How are we doing for time?

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:18.385
We're probably OK.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.860
I guess where George Martin
and The Beatles were, is

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.930
they did this by
tape manipulation,

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.820
as you had pointed
us to earlier.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.850
And now, of course,
nobody's using tape.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:35.930
It's expensive.

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.480
It's not as flexible.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.100
It has a particular
sound that people love.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.400
But nobody's using it.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.380
I work at Berkeley.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.740
There's a Department of
production engineering

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.255
which is like the tape tribe.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.920
They still worship
reel-to-reel reel tape decks.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.790
They grew up with
reel-to-reel tape decks.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:57.040
They learned their craft
with reel-to-reel tape decks.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.350
They edited Bruce
Springsteen's recordings

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.290
on reel-to-reel tape decks.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.060
They think it has
to be understood.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.430
But they can't use it
either because it's

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.780
big, and expensive, and slow.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.780
And production has
to be cheap and fast.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.046
So we're doing it
in the computer now.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.035
But quite a bit of
this is being done.

00:46:23.027 --> 00:46:25.110
Other than the time
stretching, a lot of that work

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.470
was not that extravagant.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.530
And what I wanted to do was
take the phrases of that singer

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.120
and really kind of
distort her lines in time.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.400
So when she sang, some lines
were held for a very long time.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.960
Some syllables went at
the natural sung rate.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.790
So they appeared
normal, so to speak.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.040
But I'll also
point out something

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.390
that Mark and I talked
about on the telephone

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:56.600
when we were
discussing this class

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.310
and your assignment, which
is the next we'll talk about,

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:08.460
is that this semester I hosted
a composer named Hans Tutschku.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.250
Hans Tutschku is the director
of the computer music

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.300
program at Harvard.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.400
And if you ever get
a chance, there's

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:22.430
probably a concert coming up
probably at the end of April.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:26.950
And he does concerts with what
he calls the hydra system.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:31.400
The hydra system is a
collection of 40 speakers.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.100
And you sit inside
the 40 speakers.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.850
And it's a little bit like going
to a cathedral, where there's

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:42.340
like a dome, and the dome
has a painting on it.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.530
If you ever go to the
Vatican, for example, there's

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.130
this beautiful dome,
with this ring,

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:49.290
with this text which
is really important.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.330
And it's just a
great experience.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:52.209
It's an installation.

00:47:52.209 --> 00:47:53.000
It's a work of art.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.460
The dome is a work of art.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.320
This is the sonic dome.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.250
And there are three
rings of speaker.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.210
One's at ear level.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.180
One kind of maybe six
feet above ear level,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.580
and like 12 feet
above ear level.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.180
And the rings the rings
go really wide, smaller,

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.880
and smallest.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.700
So he came to Berkeley.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.222
And the students
were all excited.

00:48:16.222 --> 00:48:17.430
Here's this guy from Harvard.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.650
He's got to be important.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:19.736
And he uses 40 speakers.

00:48:19.736 --> 00:48:21.610
So he's got to be more
sophisticated than us.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.300
He knows things we don't know.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.690
And the fascinating thing was he
showed us these pieces he made,

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.150
which were fantastic
piece of music.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:31.610
He made them like--
I'm recording

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:34.485
this lecture on this little
Sony handheld recorder.

00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:36.700
it's not that expensive.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.300
He made all his recordings
with a little Zoom

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.120
handheld recorder, like $400.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.720
And he was saying one of things
he likes to do is wave it.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.170
So if he's playing
an antique piano,

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.280
which is all out of tune.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.900
And he's recording the sound.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.530
He'll move, he'll sweep,
like a visual artist

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.610
would move a camera.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:02.010
If a visual artist is going
to shoot a video of a rock,

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.400
they're probably not going
to put the video on a tripod

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.250
to shoot the rock.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.750
I mean, there's a
pretty good chance

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.210
they'll want to move to show us
different aspects of this rock.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.620
Well, this is what Hans
loves to do with microphones,

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.630
move them across the surface.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:16.880
Because his argument
is if you have a gone,

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.720
and you hit the gong, and
you move it by your ear,

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.130
the gong sounds one way
if it's 30 feet away,

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.775
one way if it's 10 feet away,
and one way it it's very soft

00:49:24.775 --> 00:49:26.120
and you're right next to it.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.530
Those are three completely
different sounds.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.880
They're all gong.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.390
But the details you get
are radically different.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:38.160
So one thing I want
to point out is

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.850
that the selection
of the materials

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.820
is a major part of the work.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:49.160
And one of the things Hans said,
which I also had been doing,

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.410
but I'd never really thought
about in quite the way he

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:56.540
was discussing it, was he only
uses sounds he records himself.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.910
And he's been doing this
for a long time, decades.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:00.630
And so he has all
kinds of sounds

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.620
he's made all over the world.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.740
But the important thing
about all the sounds

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.770
is that he has a
memory of recording

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:12.140
each one, of choosing
to record each one.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:16.540
So of these thousands
of sounds he might have,

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.290
he has a visceral
experience that's

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.560
associated with every sound.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.580
So those bells I recorded,
are bells I recorded.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.680
And I know the
weight of the bell.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.895
I know the color of the bell.

00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:32.270
I know where it
was in the Earth.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:33.860
I remember what it was like
to put the mic on there.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.450
I remember how hot
it was that day.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.535
I remember how we kind
of hit them with hammers,

00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.922
did all kinds of things to
try to get a sound out of them

00:50:39.922 --> 00:50:41.880
because they weren't free
standing bells really

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.300
made to be struck.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.560
Same with the vocalist, I
remember hearing this vocalist,

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.820
and we had a discussion
about getting something

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.830
that would work in this piece.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.325
So all those memories are
valuable when you go back

00:50:56.325 --> 00:50:57.950
to your material
because otherwise it's

00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:59.900
just a sound file.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.400
Like every other sound file,
maybe I like it, maybe I don't.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:09.740
But because you have been
involved in physically

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.520
recording and
capturing that sound,

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.490
it's as if it was in your hands.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.970
You have a kind of
tactile relation

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.900
to the sound that you
wouldn't have otherwise.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.990
Now here's what I'm going
to ask you guys to do.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.600
So I understand you've
worked not only with Mark,

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.800
but you've work with
my colleague Tom Hall.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.330
And I'm actually playing a
concert with Tom Hall on Sunday

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:42.150
at a place called The
Outpost with a bassist named

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.044
Jamaaladeen Tacuma, who
is known for his work

00:51:45.044 --> 00:51:46.710
with Ornette Coleman,
very good bassist.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.660
Mark has also told
me that you work

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.610
in pairs, or sometimes
groups of three.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:52:00.545
And with your pair,
I'm going to ask

00:52:00.545 --> 00:52:03.830
you to make a
collaborative improvisation

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.710
with audio recordings.

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:09.720
And your goal is to, with
your partner or partners,

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:13.595
create small sound
library to utilize

00:52:13.595 --> 00:52:15.220
in a two to three
minute improvisation.

00:52:18.965 --> 00:52:21.340
And you're going to prepare
a performance that integrates

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.930
the playback of
some of the sounds

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.360
you record in this performance.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.060
So let me ask you one thing.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.680
How do you like to improvise?

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.770
And how do you
improvise in this class?

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.200
Is it more along the lines
of free improvisation?

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.840
Are people improvising with
a chord, or with a tonic,

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.460
or is it all of the above?

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.470
PROFESSOR: We've done
modal improvisation.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:54.080
We've done graphic notation,
like Cage's notations.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.390
We've created our own scripts
for that, and then done that.

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.570
We've done a lot of free.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:05.940
We've done a lot of with
small little parameters.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.370
Indian concepts
of Phil Scarf too.

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.460
NEIL LEONARD: So all
of those are fine.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.840
Any of the approaches
to improvisation

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.720
that you have been
working with this semester

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.080
that you want to use for the
improvisation you do for me

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.964
next week, or I'll do with
you next week, is welcome.

00:53:24.964 --> 00:53:27.130
It's going to be much more
interesting for all of us

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.312
if you're doing something
which you like to do so.

00:53:29.312 --> 00:53:30.770
And I don't know
you that well so I

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:34.900
don't want to tell you what
to do with the improvisation

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:40.010
except I want you to use
whatever technology you have

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:43.560
at your disposal, which might
be your iPhone-- probably

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.760
everybody has a phone
that can record audio.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.770
It could be a phone.

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.230
It could be an iPad.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:52.620
It could be a portable
recording device.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.220
And I want you to make
a collection of sounds.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.170
Say how many, it could be four.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:00.800
It could be 10.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.630
And I want you to use
this original material

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:07.750
as source material for
this improvisation.

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:14.500
So it can be valuable
to go to the internet,

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:19.744
and find an audio archive, and
get audio, and do a piece based

00:54:19.744 --> 00:54:21.160
on what you found
on the Internet.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.980
And I can think of some
really cool examples.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.896
But I'm going to encourage
you not to do that.

00:54:24.896 --> 00:54:31.480
So I actually want you
to think about the sounds

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:37.780
that-- you don't have to leave
where you live, where you work,

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.490
where you study.

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:44.490
Within this part of the
world that you travel in,

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.850
you can get the sounds there.

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.080
So plan a recording in a
location that you frequent

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.362
daily, your walk to school,
your apartment, your job.

00:54:53.362 --> 00:54:55.070
The idea is to listen
to your environment

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.867
and discover new details that
help divert the audience's

00:54:57.867 --> 00:54:59.700
attention from the
typical mode of listening

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:00.640
to everyday sounds.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.720
So when you think of
the role of audio,

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:12.905
of using audio recordings,
in improvisation,

00:55:12.905 --> 00:55:13.780
you get a few things.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.790
One is you get what
Luciano Berio said

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:19.650
is we open the sound
pallet up to everything.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:24.670
Now, you could prepare
your guitar, for example.

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:27.400
If you play acoustic guitar, or
cello, or piano, or whatever,

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.685
you could prepare your guitar.

00:55:28.685 --> 00:55:32.020
Do you know that is to prepare
your guitar in the John Cage

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.120
sense?

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.070
In the John Cage,
preparing a piano

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.660
meant like putting
bolts in the strengths.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.120
I'm not going to encourage you
to do that with this piano.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:46.560
But people put paper clips,
erasers, and screws and stuff

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.150
in the piano.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:48.524
And it changed
the way it sounds.

00:55:48.524 --> 00:55:51.710
There's a beautiful Cage
recording of prepared piano.

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.110
It makes it sound kind
of like a gamelan.

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:56.840
You could prepare
your instrument.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.220
As long as you're
making the recording,

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.540
I'm probably not going to
say, you can't do that.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.470
You could record
sounds of cars whizzing

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:08.040
by you on Memorial Drive.

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.920
But one of the things
which I didn't really

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.030
put in writing here, but
I think is important,

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:20.930
is if you can find either
one keynote sound, or one

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:25.430
idea about sound, that you'd
like to play with, it might

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:36.780
be-- you might get
more out of that then

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.872
recording like 15
completely different sounds.

00:56:38.872 --> 00:56:41.080
If you want to record 15
completely different sounds,

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.955
I'm not going to stop you, but
I'm actually encourage you to--

00:56:43.955 --> 00:56:44.830
Think of it this way.

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.680
If you had a play, if we were
doing theater for next week,

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.440
and we said, let's make a play.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.050
And there are going
to be five actors.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:01.450
The first actor is probably
not going to come on the scene

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.261
and then never come back again.

00:57:03.261 --> 00:57:05.260
They're probably not going
to just say one thing

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:05.884
and then leave.

00:57:05.884 --> 00:57:11.090
Although, now that I say this,
I can think of some examples

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:11.900
where that happens.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.100
In fact, I went to go see
Mahler's Third at the BSO.

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.640
And there's a singer who
sang literally five lines.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.580
And she came out halfway.

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.600
This is 100 minute symphony.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:27.931
She came out halfway through,
sang literally five lines,

00:57:27.931 --> 00:57:29.930
and stood on the stage
for the rest of the time.

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.850
It was really weird.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.100
It was a great piece of music.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.750
But it was weird.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:40.205
But the point is this, if
you're thinking prepared guitar,

00:57:40.205 --> 00:57:46.370
or if you're thinking of the
sound of opening and closing

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.400
windows in your
apartment, or whatever

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.660
it is that you're
interested in, what does it

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.870
sound like in the quad, or
between the buildings here?

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:03.740
You get sort of a theme and
variation potential, or a kind

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:10.440
of multiple perspective feature
in your piece, if you will,

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:16.320
if you have more than one
recording of a certain thing.

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.425
So let me ask you.

00:58:17.425 --> 00:58:19.300
I'm just going to pick
your brains right now.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:23.840
If you were to choose
something to record

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:26.790
to include in an
improvisation-- I

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:28.636
don't want your
final answer now.

00:58:28.636 --> 00:58:30.510
But I'm just going to
pick on all of you guys

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:32.420
just to kind of get
the conversation going.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:32.970
What's your name?

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:33.620
AUDIENCE: James.

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.078
PROFESSOR: James,
so what would you

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:36.652
do if you had to pick right now?

00:58:36.652 --> 00:58:39.564
AUDIENCE: I think
the sounds of riding

00:58:39.564 --> 00:58:43.090
the bus would be interesting,
the doors opening and closing,

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:46.022
or stop requests.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:48.740
I feel like you could play a lot
with all the different sounds

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:49.320
involved.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.130
PROFESSOR: For sure,
and it would also

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:55.700
have the built in connotation
of the piece's emotion.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:56.784
The piece is stopping.

00:58:56.784 --> 00:58:57.700
The piece is starting.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.562
The motion of the
piece is stopping.

00:58:59.562 --> 00:59:00.520
The motion is starting.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.490
I had a teacher who when I went
back to my master's degree,

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:09.290
a really wonderful composer
named Bob Brookmeyer.

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.240
And he said music is motion.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.880
Anything you do to impede the
motion has to be questioned.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.740
It doesn't mean to you
can't impede the motion.

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:21.890
But think twice if you're
going to impede the motion.

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:24.050
Well, this is a
piece about a bus.

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.240
Or a piece that's including
sounds from the bus,

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.140
so that's kind of
like a built in idea.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:32.530
The bus has stops.

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:35.950
Good.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:37.820
Perfect.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.930
Your name again?

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:42.185
AUDIENCE: Vineet.

00:59:42.185 --> 00:59:43.268
The sounds of an elevator.

00:59:43.268 --> 00:59:48.020
NEIL LEONARD:
Elevator, sure, good.

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.660
And there must be
different elevators

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:50.950
in different places on campus.

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.340
Hopefully old, clunky ones.

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:56.400
And ones that are not
so old and clunky.

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.120
When I got this new
recorder, that's

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.120
the first thing I think
I recorded was elevator.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.290
I was in a hotel that made
a really strange sound.

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:07.950
So I figured, OK,
I've got to grab this.

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.990
And I'll see if I make
something out of it?

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.210
What is your name?

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:16.240
AUDIENCE: Sarah, I think
I'd do my roommate cooking.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.800
NEIL LEONARD: Roommate
cooking, great, good.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.940
The piece is cooking.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.880
There's kitchen, lots of stuff.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.520
There is a teacher
at Berkeley who

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.910
has his students do a piece.

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:30.360
I think the piece
is in their kitchen.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.120
It's found sound in the kitchen.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.840
There's so many things
to rattle, and shake,

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.330
and make stuff out of, good.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.720
And, again, what we're
thinking of doing is

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.310
we're not making a grand opus.

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.560
We're making a piece that's
two or three minutes long.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.320
So you definitely have a few
minutes of sound from cooking.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.150
What is your name?

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.780
AUDIENCE: Jacob.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.720
I was thinking various
machines around a dorm,

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.595
so washing machine,
microwave, people typing.

01:00:57.595 --> 01:00:58.540
NEIL LEONARD: Good.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:02.880
That would be fine.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.230
Tons of automation, which is
a really interesting topic.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.280
When I first got
into computers, one

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.130
of the things that they
seem to offer to music,

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:19.220
which was a big question
mark, was automation.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.997
You can automate a musical
process with a computer.

01:01:22.997 --> 01:01:25.330
If you're writing software,
if you're creating software,

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:30.590
you can describe a process
of generating notes or sounds

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:33.220
and have it do that.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.390
So automation sounds, fine.

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:39.630
So all of these four ideas
that we just touched on

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:44.590
are exactly what I was
kind of hoping to get to,

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.969
where you have an idea of
something you can play with.

01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:48.760
These are all fine.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.522
Your name is in
the orange shirt?

01:01:50.522 --> 01:01:51.406
AUDIENCE: Ben.

01:01:51.406 --> 01:01:52.290
NEIL LEONARD: Ben?

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:54.090
What do you think
would you record?

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:57.240
AUDIENCE: I was thinking maybe
the sounds of the locker room,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.080
which the loudest of
which are probably

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.380
people slamming their lockers.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.730
NEIL LEONARD: Yeah, good.

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:04.582
Percussion piece.

01:02:07.984 --> 01:02:11.020
PROFESSOR: I want to clarify
something for myself and maybe

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.890
for others.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.540
So when we've had these
other assignments,

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.650
I've called them
design assignments.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.190
And that's what we talked about.

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:22.882
So should we be thinking about
how we design the framework?

01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:24.340
In other words,
you had a framework

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.880
with your certain
phases, certain segments.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.410
Should we be thinking that way?

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:30.960
NEIL LEONARD:
Absolutely, and we want

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.430
to think about how
to use these sounds.

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.850
So before we get to
framework, let just say,

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.890
in terms of the playback
of these sounds,

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:46.190
it's kind of flexible.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:50.620
I mean, a simple thing
that you could do

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.990
is you could make a playlist in
iTunes of sounds you've created

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.970
and play with this playlist.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:02.260
You also probably want to
make some sound of silence.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:09.280
The sound might be more
effective if you're not

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.030
hearing your recorded
sounds all the time,

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.870
but you're hearing the
sounds some of the time.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.150
So you don't have to inundate
us with recorded sound.

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:20.410
It could be very, very poetic.

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:27.990
It might just be that a few
moments of recorded sound

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:31.280
add another dimension
to improvisation.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:36.250
So that would be the simplest
way to use the sounds.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:38.070
Is everybody OK with that?

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:41.000
I mean, everybody has iTunes.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.490
So you could do it that way.

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:46.540
Everybody can record a sound
which is basically really,

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:49.360
really quiet or
silent, so to speak.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.350
So you can also put in blocks.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.950
You can space out silence.

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:55.900
That kind of would
be a composition.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.090
The other way to think of
this would be-- and then

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:00.340
let's make sure we have time
to talk a little bit more

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:05.430
about context-- is when
you're working in pairs,

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:09.620
one person could use the iPhone,
or the computer, or the iPad.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.580
And the other person could play.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.750
So the two of you don't have
to improvise simultaneously.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:21.700
One person could be more
working the computer.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.950
And one person could
do the playing.

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:28.410
So, for example, if--
what's your name?

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:29.336
AUDIENCE: Forest.

01:04:29.336 --> 01:04:31.500
NEIL LEONARD: And what
instrument is that?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.258
Is that yours?

01:04:32.258 --> 01:04:34.090
AUDIENCE: No, I play the piano.

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.260
NEIL LEONARD: So
Forest, for example,

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.934
who would your partner be?

01:04:37.934 --> 01:04:39.855
AUDIENCE: Austin.

01:04:39.855 --> 01:04:42.513
NEIL LEONARD: Austin, OK,
good, so if Forest and Austin

01:04:42.513 --> 01:04:46.310
did a piece, and Forest is
playing piano and improvising,

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:48.210
and Austin is
working the computer,

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.900
one thing you could
do, Austin, is

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:57.830
you could trigger the
sounds at your discretion

01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:58.900
in a spontaneous way.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.180
You could improvise.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.870
It won't be like
playing the piano

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:05.480
where there's a whole
lot of finger motion.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.910
But you could choose in
relation to Forest's performance

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.191
when to trigger the sounds.

01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:12.940
So you're not triggering
them all at once.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.810
You're not triggering them in a
sequence that's predetermined.

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:17.210
You could trigger
them as you go.

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:18.251
So does that makes sense?

01:05:18.251 --> 01:05:22.730
So I think in order for this
to be successful-- in order

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:25.410
for the use of the
recorded playback of sound

01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:28.540
to be more robust and to
give you more flexibility,

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.560
it probably make sense,
unless you think otherwise

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.560
and have a difference scheme,
but my first suggestion

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.890
would be to have one
person improvising

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.630
with these sound files
and another person

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:47.910
improvising on the
traditional instrument.

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.156
Yeah?

01:05:49.156 --> 01:05:52.114
AUDIENCE: In your
performances, is it

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:54.086
usually balanced like that?

01:05:54.086 --> 01:05:56.544
Where one person is operating
some part of the electronics?

01:05:56.544 --> 01:05:59.016
The electronics are
also improvised?

01:05:59.016 --> 01:06:04.190
Or it more just
straight recording.

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.380
NEIL LEONARD: It's a
very good question.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.630
Because I only have two hands,
and the saxophone, really,

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:12.580
you can't do it with one hand.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.870
Piano, you could probably
pull it off a little better.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:17.819
But I'm usually doing three
things, playing the saxophone,

01:06:17.819 --> 01:06:20.360
doing live audio processing of
the saxophone, which we didn't

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.651
touch on, which I don't think
we'll have time to today,

01:06:22.651 --> 01:06:24.500
but we could touch
on it next time.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.240
And then playing
back sound files.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.180
So at certain times, I tried to
improvise everything, and write

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.620
software to
improvise everything.

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.260
And I've sort of moved
away from that approach

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.250
in favor of building these sound
collages which I know very well

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:40.280
and perform with.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.500
But I do live sax processing
which is improvised.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.460
And that's what I'll
do on Wednesday.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.910
But I wan to go
back to the issue

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:51.735
that Mark raises about
a formal structure.

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:58.210
And I'm going to ask you to
help with this as well because I

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:09.851
didn't come today with a
very exact formal structure.

01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:11.850
Or really I didn't come
with a formal structure.

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:15.530
So one of the things
that comes to mind

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.440
is-- and actually
maybe Mark you should

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.940
help with the
brainstorming of this.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.490
But one of the things
that does come to mind

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:27.540
is do the sounds you record
suggest any kind of structure?

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.230
So, for example, if you're
thinking locker room,

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:35.614
if I go to the gym, I
have a combination lock.

01:07:35.614 --> 01:07:37.030
I don't how much
noise that makes.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.155
It's probably pretty quiet.

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:40.182
But the bang of the lockers.

01:07:40.182 --> 01:07:42.140
What do you do with the
banging of the lockers?

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:48.740
They can be kind of cacophonous,
as they sort of are.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.830
They don't really
kind of open and close

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:51.890
with any kind of logic.

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:56.870
If I go to the gym at 6 o'clock,
and a lot of people are there,

01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:59.310
there's a lot of opening
and closing of doors.

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:02.630
But because you're
recording, potentially you

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.310
could trigger things live, who
would your partner be in this?

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.760
Who was your last partner
in an improv project?

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.385
AUDIENCE: James

01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:13.345
NEIL LEONARD: And James is you?

01:08:13.345 --> 01:08:16.510
So if you did this
with James, James

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:21.060
could do something which is
not typical of a locker room,

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.140
where things are opening
and closing periodically.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.560
So you're making a rhythm
out of these lockers.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.850
I do want to mention
something about that.

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:37.479
But I want to talk
about a slamming door

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:42.821
piece, or a banging piece that
maybe I can bring next time

01:08:42.821 --> 01:08:43.529
and play for you.

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:49.620
But maybe it's a binary form.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.240
One part is more free.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.010
And the banging feels
like less-- just

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.979
seems a little random.

01:08:56.979 --> 01:09:00.479
And another other part
seems decisively not random.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.010
Mark, what do you think?

01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:06.755
What have they done with form
that would be applicable here?

01:09:06.755 --> 01:09:09.470
PROFESSOR: I think we've
done a lot of these things.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:15.155
So I would say leave it
up to people's ideas.

01:09:15.155 --> 01:09:18.470
NEIL LEONARD: OK, that's fine.

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:20.120
I have the impression
anything you've

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:26.640
thought about with form
already probably is still--

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.969
could be applicable here.

01:09:27.969 --> 01:09:29.510
PROFESSOR: And we
could apply things.

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:32.870
I think what I would say is
if you could think of a way

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:36.910
to have a beginning
and an ending,

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:40.710
and maybe a middle
marker of some sort.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:41.833
If that makes sense.

01:09:41.833 --> 01:09:44.720
NEIL LEONARD: Good, good.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.770
I do want to say one thing
about noise and banging doors.

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:54.920
I just want to say
a couple that does

01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:03.870
sound art, Janet Cardiff and
George Miller is her partner.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:16.490
And Janet Cardiff just did
a piece in a New York armory

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:17.850
in the last 12 months.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.820
But she's famous for
making these pieces where

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.600
they were like audio walks,
where you would headphones on.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.920
And it would be like she
was on the walk with you.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.378
And she would tell
you where to go.

01:10:31.378 --> 01:10:32.940
There was a Central Park one.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.200
And as you're walking with
this person who's not there,

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:42.620
it's like a disembodied voice,
she begins to tell you a story.

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.040
And you're getting kind of
wrapped up in the story.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.560
And the next thing, a
helicopter flies right by you.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.226
And you turn around,
and it's not there.

01:10:49.226 --> 01:11:01.390
So it's a kind of a
talk kind of reshapes

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.990
your audio experience
on a specific

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.720
walk that she's designed it for.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.840
So, again, a site-specific
piece of art.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.590
But she and George
Miller were invited

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:19.710
to do a piece at the
Eastern State Penitentiary

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.740
in Pennsylvania, which
is in Philadelphia.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.120
It's a penitentiary
which is infamous

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.340
for, among other
things, it was maybe

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.274
the first penitentiary
in the United States

01:11:30.274 --> 01:11:31.690
where they had
this big experiment

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:33.140
in solitary confinement.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:37.810
So one of the wings, or
maybe in all of the wings,

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:41.280
prisoners were isolated
in cells by themselves

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.970
with only a Bible with the idea
that if they were by themselves

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:46.300
with a Bible they
would have nothing

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.950
to do but reform themselves.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:51.580
And I think that it did not
become the model for reform.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.880
But they now commission
artworks in the Eastern State

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.770
Penitentiary.

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:08.950
And so what they did is they
made these kind of robots--

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:12.670
I won't call them robots--
but these beaters that

01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:14.600
were motorized.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.120
And they were maybe
in this one corridor

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.470
there were like 162
cell blocks, both sides

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:25.010
of the corridor, first
and second floor.

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:28.844
And they had at least
one of these beaters

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.260
in every one of
these cell blocks.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.850
Now, this corridor had
not been renovated.

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.240
It was still like totally
dilapidated, paint

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.300
chipping all over the
place, water damage.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.560
But they never cleaned it out.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.976
So there was still
some furniture,

01:12:39.976 --> 01:12:42.420
which means like beds,
bed pans, whatever it as.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.609
So they put beaters
in every cell block.

01:12:44.609 --> 01:12:45.650
And they controlled them.

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.680
They were controlled
by computer.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.370
And they did exactly
what I was saying,

01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:53.260
which is where I
got the idea, is

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.430
they made this 16 minute score.

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:57.110
And they did it with a computer.

01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:58.480
And they did it in a sequence.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.000
They did it actually
in the same one

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.450
I'm using now, Logic, and
the piano roll notation.

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.820
And everyone little
note in the piano roll

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:08.440
was a different hammer
in a different cell.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.190
So in some parts
of the recording.

01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:13.840
It's very pointalistic.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.374
You would hear a sound
from one cell, then

01:13:17.374 --> 01:13:19.290
something from the other
side of the corridor.

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:21.370
There's kind of a
race section where

01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.680
they're all pounding
out a rhythm.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.614
But they're kind
of different sounds

01:13:27.614 --> 01:13:30.030
that-- I mean, you can only
imagine what the inmates would

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:35.120
have thought if
whatever it would be,

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.255
really 150 years later.

01:13:37.255 --> 01:13:43.910
This is long-- this is
like totally over, pretty

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:44.580
horrible place.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:49.790
But it was a banging piece.

01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:50.650
Lockers bang.

01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:53.530
So it was a piece that
was all about banging,

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:57.480
banging in a corridor, kind
of almost like a prison riot

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.570
kind of vibe from the
recording I've heard of it.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.700
I didn't actually see the piece.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.090
But they had a structure too.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:06.930
And part of the structure
was have a rave.

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.061
So there was kind
of a beat, or I

01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:11.590
don't know if you could call
it a recognizable groove.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:15.952
But there was sort of
like a periodic thumping

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.410
happening at one
part of the piece.

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:19.284
Other parts were more
noisy and pointalistic.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:25.010
So given that I don't know
what you're going to record,

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:27.010
and I also don't want to
make the piece for you,

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:28.190
I'm kind of open to form.

01:14:28.190 --> 01:14:31.330
But I would say this, open
to your ideas about form.

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:37.480
But be prepared to tell us why
you recorded these sounds, what

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.272
was attractive about recording
the sounds, what it was

01:14:40.272 --> 01:14:42.730
like after you recorded them
because everything's different

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:44.680
after you record it.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.940
The classic example
are gunshots.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.956
You think a gunshot
would be powerful.

01:14:48.956 --> 01:14:50.580
But when they made
the film Terminator,

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.420
they took Howitzer's, and
cannons, and bazookas,

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.320
and they put them all together
to make these guns that Arnold

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.660
Schwarzenegger would shoot to
make them sound like comic book

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.240
big, larger than life.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.800
But guns don't sound
larger than life.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.260
They sound smaller than
life, just like a little pop.

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:13.420
In Hollywood, there
is a job in Hollywood,

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:17.630
should you be interested,
in making guns sound big.

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:19.850
Many of my students
go and do that stuff.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.640
So why did you want
to record these?

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.098
What was your initial thought
about recording these sounds?

01:15:29.098 --> 01:15:32.170
Like, the kitchen, my
roommate makes all this,

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:34.690
boiling, there's sauteing,
there's stuff coming out

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:38.140
of the toaster, there's
water boiling, all that.

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.280
And that seemed like
it's a pallet which

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.586
could be interesting.

01:15:41.586 --> 01:15:42.960
Whatever your
reason is, whatever

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.230
your experience is after.

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:50.060
And then also going back to
what mark suggested, how did you

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.890
think about
organizing the sound?

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:55.160
Because I'm not so much
interested in right or wrong,

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.667
but what were your
thoughts about putting

01:15:57.667 --> 01:15:58.500
this stuff together?

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.490
Did you have a thought
before you improvised

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:05.170
about how to arrange
this improvisation

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:06.245
with your partner?

01:16:06.245 --> 01:16:08.370
Did you guys just
plunge into it?

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:11.940
If you had a thought about
how to use it, with the bus,

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.580
does it begin with
starting the bus?

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.094
Does it end with
the bus stopping?

01:16:15.094 --> 01:16:15.885
It doesn't have to.

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:22.940
But that would be
another valuable part

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:28.325
of your experience to
bring to the discourse.

01:16:28.325 --> 01:16:31.900
Once you had those
sounds, how did you

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.510
go from there to
finishing a piece?

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:36.110
So as you see with me,
it's like, I come up

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:37.080
with some cool sounds.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.820
I record some
elevators, some bells.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.270
And sometimes I just start
messing with the stuff.

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:44.245
But at some point, it's
actually got to finish a piece.

01:16:44.245 --> 01:16:47.230
So once I start to set
out to make a piece,

01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:51.004
then typically I'm beginning
to think of what kind of shape

01:16:51.004 --> 01:16:51.920
should the piece have?

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.500
I have a degree in
music composition

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.170
so I kind of neurotically
have to deal with it that way.

01:16:57.170 --> 01:16:57.920
You don't have to.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:02.940
And I think any way you
deal with it can potentially

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.640
be successful.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.590
But one of the things I learned
from a teacher I had was

01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:13.940
that the first thing you do
when you write a piece of music

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.810
is you decide the duration.

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:20.610
The second you can do is can
could think about the form.

01:17:20.610 --> 01:17:23.560
And when you're thinking about
the form, the order in which

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.410
stuff's going to happen,
you're actually preparing,

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:29.350
if you call this
composition, you're

01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:32.180
actually composing music
without hearing a sound.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.860
I could think start
soft, end loud.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.830
I could think, start
fast, end slow.

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:42.300
And those are really
compositional decisions

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.820
which I can make
without making a sound.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:49.280
I can think of only
lockers opening

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.960
at the beginning, only
lockers closing at the end.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.110
That's a compositional decision.

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:57.030
That came from George Russell.

01:17:57.030 --> 01:18:00.750
You can compose.

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:03.140
Or, because this is a
class in improvisation,

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.370
you can create sonic ideas
without making a sound.

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:14.185
And my neurosis as a composer
and as a lifelong student

01:18:14.185 --> 01:18:20.470
of composition, is I want to
use that approach, at least

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:21.090
to some level.

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.650
Not in everything
I do, but I'm often

01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:28.880
trying to think about what are
some ideas about these pieces

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.995
before I roll up my sleeves
and start making stuff?

01:18:32.995 --> 01:18:33.870
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:34.835
We're going to have to call
time because we have to leave.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.918
NEIL LEONARD: I think
that's a good place to stop.

01:18:36.918 --> 01:18:40.250
PROFESSOR: Thank you very much.

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:42.230
I just have one
practical question.

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:46.870
We should think about how
we're going to present these

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:48.840
because we're going
to wind up with 16.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.256
Does that mean
we're going to have

01:18:50.256 --> 01:18:52.880
six computers with individual
sound files or what?

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.590
NEIL LEONARD: I think
so, because it's probably

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:57.280
easiest for you
just to set it up

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.420
on your phone, or your
iPad, or your computer,

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.745
and plug them in here.

01:19:02.745 --> 01:19:04.120
The only thing
about that is this

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.480
seemed to behave better when
video is plugged in as well.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.750
But maybe we can just
plug video into my machine

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:13.780
and swap in and out of
this cable if need be.

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:17.170
PROFESSOR: OK, so in
each team, one person

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:19.435
should bring some device.

01:19:19.435 --> 01:19:20.410
Is that OK?

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:24.820
Great.

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:28.020
Assignment for Wednesday,
I got inspired.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.620
I'm improvising.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.470
We're going to bring
our instruments.

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:36.460
I want you to think between now
and then of at least one sound

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:40.426
that is not a conventional
sound on your instrument.

01:19:40.426 --> 01:19:41.800
If you can think
of two or three,

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.840
that's great, but at
least one sound that

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.690
not conventional
to your instrument.

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:49.240
OK?
