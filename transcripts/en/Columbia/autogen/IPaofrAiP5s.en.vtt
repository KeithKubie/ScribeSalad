we've learned since it came out is how
 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.130

kind of history the kind of history that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310
kind of history the kind of history that
 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.910
kind of history the kind of history that
was true to life and that would provide

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920
was true to life and that would provide
 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.190
was true to life and that would provide
a compelling account of these events in

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200
a compelling account of these events in
 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.280
a compelling account of these events in
a way that would imprint itself on the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
a way that would imprint itself on the
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.540
a way that would imprint itself on the
public imagination and the way people

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550
public imagination and the way people

had just begun to come to terms with

had just begun to come to terms with
 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.620
had just begun to come to terms with
these tragic events and I think that

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630
these tragic events and I think that
 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.900
these tragic events and I think that
that historians took some pride you know

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910
that historians took some pride you know
 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.399
that historians took some pride you know
and the fact that this was the work of

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409
and the fact that this was the work of
 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.770
and the fact that this was the work of
an historian and also of a number of

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
an historian and also of a number of
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.950
an historian and also of a number of
historians in assisting him in this work

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
historians in assisting him in this work
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.260
historians in assisting him in this work
because in fact it was a demonstration

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270
because in fact it was a demonstration
 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.380
because in fact it was a demonstration
of the power of history and the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
of the power of history and the
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.230
of the power of history and the
importance of history because then as

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
importance of history because then as
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.910
importance of history because then as
now and perhaps forever there will be

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920
now and perhaps forever there will be
 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.380
now and perhaps forever there will be
many who would look back at these events

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390
many who would look back at these events
 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.690
many who would look back at these events
very differently who would find it too

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
very differently who would find it too
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.770
very differently who would find it too
hard to believe that these tragic events

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
hard to believe that these tragic events
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.290
hard to believe that these tragic events
could be the work of a relatively small

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300
could be the work of a relatively small
 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.160
could be the work of a relatively small
number of people on both sides people

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170
number of people on both sides people
 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.369
number of people on both sides people
making terrible mistakes with terrible

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379
making terrible mistakes with terrible
 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.289
making terrible mistakes with terrible
consequences who prefer to believe that

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299
consequences who prefer to believe that
 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.000
consequences who prefer to believe that
it was an even smaller number of people

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010
it was an even smaller number of people
 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.600
it was an even smaller number of people
perhaps who were orchestrating all of it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
perhaps who were orchestrating all of it
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.090
perhaps who were orchestrating all of it
and you know if you think of the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100
and you know if you think of the
 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.260
and you know if you think of the
importance of history and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270
importance of history and
 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.700
importance of history and

theoretical idea but it's just not
 

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.620
theoretical idea but it's just not
practical so then a good question to

practical so then a good question to
 

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.200
practical so then a good question to
turn to is when exactly was the decision

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.520
actually kind of it's not hard to find
really good evidence on this point they

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:01.530
really good evidence on this point they
 

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.200
really good evidence on this point they
didn't write much stuff down about it I

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.210
didn't write much stuff down about it I
 

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.420
didn't write much stuff down about it I
mean we know we have good evidence that

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:05.430
mean we know we have good evidence that
 

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.700
mean we know we have good evidence that
up to about a certain point they're

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:07.710
up to about a certain point they're
 

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.650
up to about a certain point they're
asking again and again for materials

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660
asking again and again for materials
 

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.150
asking again and again for materials
that they need and are basically being

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160
that they need and are basically being
 

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.980

reaction the Fermi pile in Chicago
 

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.150
reaction the Fermi pile in Chicago
produced the first chain reaction that

and the Air Corps to win the war I mean
 

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.800
and the Air Corps to win the war I mean
basically here's how big it's going to

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:48.810
basically here's how big it's going to
 

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.140
basically here's how big it's going to
be and therefore here's here's how many

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.150
be and therefore here's here's how many
 

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.940
be and therefore here's here's how many
people were going to need and here's how

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:52.950
people were going to need and here's how
 

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.370
people were going to need and here's how
much stuff we need to buy here's how

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:55.380
much stuff we need to buy here's how
 

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.380
much stuff we need to buy here's how
many training camps we need to build you

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:57.390
many training camps we need to build you

that would flow from these decisions and
their basic plan is we're going to build

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:04.890
their basic plan is we're going to build
 

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.850
their basic plan is we're going to build
a gigantic army it's going to be an army

a gigantic army it's going to be an army
 

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.820
a gigantic army it's going to be an army
that's going to have about 200 divisions

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:09.830
that's going to have about 200 divisions
 

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.290
that's going to have about 200 divisions
we're going to build a gigantic Air

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300
we're going to build a gigantic Air
 

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.090
we're going to build a gigantic Air
Corps and we're going to build a

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100
Corps and we're going to build a
 

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.900
Corps and we're going to build a
gigantic Navy and then by about the

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:17.910
gigantic Navy and then by about the
 

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.880
gigantic Navy and then by about the
summer of nineteen forty-two they

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:19.890
summer of nineteen forty-two they
 

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.150
summer of nineteen forty-two they
realize that they cannot do it all they

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160
realize that they cannot do it all they
 

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.830
realize that they cannot do it all they
just can't have it all there just aren't

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:24.840
just can't have it all there just aren't
 

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.570
just can't have it all there just aren't
enough people there aren't enough

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:26.580
enough people there aren't enough
 

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.370
enough people there aren't enough
resources to do it all and actually

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380
resources to do it all and actually
 

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.780
resources to do it all and actually
they're going to have to make really big

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:29.790
they're going to have to make really big
 

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.180
they're going to have to make really big
cuts not like five or ten percent at the

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:32.190
cuts not like five or ten percent at the
 

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.550
cuts not like five or ten percent at the
margin cuts across the board something

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560
margin cuts across the board something
 

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.140
margin cuts across the board something
there have to make some really big

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:36.150
there have to make some really big
 

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.750
there have to make some really big
strategic choices to change the plan how

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760
strategic choices to change the plan how
 

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.220
strategic choices to change the plan how
they're going to win the war by the way

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.230
they're going to win the war by the way
 

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.160
they're going to win the war by the way
the big army plan was totally natural to

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.170
the big army plan was totally natural to
 

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.410
the big army plan was totally natural to
them America had mobilized for all-out

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420
them America had mobilized for all-out
 

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.300
them America had mobilized for all-out
war this is the third time it had

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.310
war this is the third time it had
 

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.460
war this is the third time it had
happened in the history of the country

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:48.470
happened in the history of the country
 

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.470
happened in the history of the country
the fur and the American Way of war is

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480
the fur and the American Way of war is
 

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.000
the fur and the American Way of war is
established by the first time which was

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.010
established by the first time which was
 

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.060

is get the biggest army you can and just

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260
is get the biggest army you can and just
 

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.080
is get the biggest army you can and just
bludgeon the other guy until they are

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.090
bludgeon the other guy until they are
 

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.780
bludgeon the other guy until they are
bloody and lying on the ground and you

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:02.790
bloody and lying on the ground and you
 

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.550
bloody and lying on the ground and you
just win a war of attrition and you win

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560
just win a war of attrition and you win
 

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.120
just win a war of attrition and you win
that and so the next time they mobilize

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.130
that and so the next time they mobilize
 

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.650
that and so the next time they mobilize
for all-out war which is in the First

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660
for all-out war which is in the First
 

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.960
for all-out war which is in the First
World War we built the largest army we

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:11.970
World War we built the largest army we
 

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.400

00:22:44.289 --> 00:22:44.299
Germans are working on this is a
 

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:46.600
Germans are working on this is a
misjudgment they were actually wrong

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:46.610
misjudgment they were actually wrong
 

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.119
misjudgment they were actually wrong
about that unbeknownst to them the

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:49.129
about that unbeknownst to them the
 

00:22:49.129 --> 00:22:51.039
about that unbeknownst to them the
Germans have more or less decided not to

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:51.049
Germans have more or less decided not to
 

00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:52.629
Germans have more or less decided not to
go all out on this in the summer of

00:22:52.629 --> 00:22:52.639
go all out on this in the summer of
 

00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:55.239
go all out on this in the summer of
nineteen forty-two but in September in

00:22:55.239 --> 00:22:55.249
nineteen forty-two but in September in
 

00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:57.489
nineteen forty-two but in September in
1942 the u.s. government maybe

00:22:57.489 --> 00:22:57.499
1942 the u.s. government maybe
 

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:59.169
1942 the u.s. government maybe
fortunately maybe unfortunately

00:22:59.169 --> 00:22:59.179
fortunately maybe unfortunately

according to your lights doesn't know
 

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.519
according to your lights doesn't know
that and so that's a factor but my view

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:03.529
that and so that's a factor but my view
 

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:05.019
that and so that's a factor but my view
not still not the only factor about a

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:05.029
not still not the only factor about a
 

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:07.389
not still not the only factor about a
factor because I think still the key

00:23:07.389 --> 00:23:07.399
factor because I think still the key
 

00:23:07.399 --> 00:23:10.149
factor because I think still the key
factor is what's your theory of how

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159
factor is what's your theory of how
 

00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:12.489
factor is what's your theory of how
you're going to win the war this is no

00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:12.499
you're going to win the war this is no
 

00:23:12.499 --> 00:23:14.470
you're going to win the war this is no
longer a theory that relies on the brute

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480
longer a theory that relies on the brute
 

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.409

force of the US Army to carry today this
 

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:20.049
force of the US Army to carry today this
is clearly a theory that relies on naval

00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:20.059
is clearly a theory that relies on naval
 

00:23:20.059 --> 00:23:22.419
is clearly a theory that relies on naval

and then airpower you're still going to

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:25.850
and then airpower you're still going to
 

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.609
and then airpower you're still going to
bet heavily on air power there's been

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:27.619
bet heavily on air power there's been
 

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:30.549
bet heavily on air power there's been
some very good work that's done on where

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559
some very good work that's done on where
 

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.529
some very good work that's done on where
did we get this cultural belief that air

did we get this cultural belief that air

word one of the points to is that this

word one of the points to is that this
is very much a cultural belief that is

is very much a cultural belief that is

strategic bombing arguments have been
 

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.560
strategic bombing arguments have been
doing very badly in 1942 they've been

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.739
British they're doing badly in 1942 and
19-43 they will do even worse

00:24:04.739 --> 00:24:04.749
19-43 they will do even worse

basically fail pretty spectacularly by

are we really going to keep relying

heavily on the air campaign and instead
 

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:24.940
heavily on the air campaign and instead
of basically pulling back from it they

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:24.950
of basically pulling back from it they
 

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.119

double the bet and then have a terrible

double the bet and then have a terrible

1944 actually that's when actually that

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:37.920
1944 actually that's when actually that
 

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.950
1944 actually that's when actually that
bet begins to prove out because they

from Cleveland's they developed

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:41.660
from Cleveland's they developed
 

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.940
from Cleveland's they developed
long-range fighter escorts above all the

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:43.950
long-range fighter escorts above all the
 

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.000
long-range fighter escorts above all the
p-51 Mustang and then deployed it in and

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.010
p-51 Mustang and then deployed it in and
 

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.400
p-51 Mustang and then deployed it in and
then deployed it in numbers in early

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.410
then deployed it in numbers in early
 

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.260
then deployed it in numbers in early
nineteen forty four and then that

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:51.270
nineteen forty four and then that
 

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.030
nineteen forty four and then that
dramatically changed the whole air power

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:53.040
dramatically changed the whole air power
 

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.280
dramatically changed the whole air power
equation of Europe but that's kind of a

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:55.290
equation of Europe but that's kind of a
 

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.290
equation of Europe but that's kind of a
digression and different story the point

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:57.300
digression and different story the point
 

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.200
digression and different story the point
is is they have a theory of how to win

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:00.210
is is they have a theory of how to win
 

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.540
is is they have a theory of how to win
the war that's also substantially

the war that's also substantially
 

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.340
the war that's also substantially
conjectural and actually most of the

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:04.350
conjectural and actually most of the
 

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.020
conjectural and actually most of the
empirical evidence available to them

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.030
empirical evidence available to them
 

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:10.540
empirical evidence available to them
then and for some time is against it

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:10.550
 

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.570
that's embedded in that theory to is and

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580
that's embedded in that theory to is and
 

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.190
that's embedded in that theory to is and
what's going to happen to the bear mouth

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200
what's going to happen to the bear mouth
 

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.040
what's going to happen to the bear mouth
and part of that theory is the Red

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.050
and part of that theory is the Red
 

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.950
and part of that theory is the Red
Army's going to bleed the bear model and

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960
Army's going to bleed the bear model and
 

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.780
Army's going to bleed the bear model and
so embedded in that is also an

so embedded in that is also an

so embedded in that is also an

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:25.890
assessment of how do we think the Red
 

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.130

Army is going to do and is Russia likely
 

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.110
Army is going to do and is Russia likely
to survive without us and they are

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120
to survive without us and they are
 

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.790
to survive without us and they are
coming to a judgment by the fall of

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:31.800
coming to a judgment by the fall of
 

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.800
coming to a judgment by the fall of
nineteen forty-two that they think

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:33.810
nineteen forty-two that they think
 

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.650
nineteen forty-two that they think
Russia is not going to collapse they

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:36.660
Russia is not going to collapse they
 

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.600
Russia is not going to collapse they
don't necessarily foresee Stalingrad

don't necessarily foresee Stalingrad
 

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.940
don't necessarily foresee Stalingrad
coming neither did the Germans because

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:40.950
coming neither did the Germans because
 

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.370
coming neither did the Germans because
the Germans in us we didn't actually see

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380
the Germans in us we didn't actually see
 

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.390
the Germans in us we didn't actually see
where the Russians were going to get

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400
where the Russians were going to get
 

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.540
where the Russians were going to get
another group of armies from and

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:46.550
another group of armies from and
 

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.350
another group of armies from and
actually that which is another

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360
actually that which is another
 

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.750
actually that which is another
interesting story because it's amazing

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760
interesting story because it's amazing
 

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.400
interesting story because it's amazing
that they actually could find and scrape

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:52.410
that they actually could find and scrape
 

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.080
that they actually could find and scrape
another group of our meals together but

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.090
another group of our meals together but
 

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.200
another group of our meals together but
they did and that made a big difference

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.210
they did and that made a big difference
 

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.470
they did and that made a big difference
but it's so point is when you unpack

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480
but it's so point is when you unpack
 

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.630

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:13.680
which is all about brute force we're
 

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.110
which is all about brute force we're
going to rely on brute force but in a

totally different way we're going to
 

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.400
totally different way we're going to
rely a lot on death from above we're

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:19.410
rely a lot on death from above we're
 

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.990

story that I've just been describing and
 

00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:33.499

I think that's an interesting story in

I think that's an interesting story in
 

00:27:33.509 --> 00:27:35.690
I think that's an interesting story in
its own right so this is I think there's

its own right so this is I think there's
 

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.339
its own right so this is I think there's
an interesting story and why America

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:37.349
an interesting story and why America
 

00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:38.960

the atomic bomb and I've tried to
 

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:44.239
the atomic bomb and I've tried to
suggest to you that I think that if you

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:44.249
suggest to you that I think that if you
 

00:27:44.249 --> 00:27:45.499
suggest to you that I think that if you
had been making an intelligence

00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:45.509

would do this in say spring 1942 and
 

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:56.869
would do this in say spring 1942 and
certainly in 1941 you could you would

00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:56.879
certainly in 1941 you could you would
 

00:27:56.879 --> 00:27:58.219
certainly in 1941 you could you would
have been pretty hard pressed to make a

have been pretty hard pressed to make a
 

00:27:58.229 --> 00:27:59.960
have been pretty hard pressed to make a
really good argument as to why for sure

00:27:59.960 --> 00:27:59.970
really good argument as to why for sure
 

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.909
really good argument as to why for sure
we were going to do this ok I think

00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919
we were going to do this ok I think
 

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:04.430
we were going to do this ok I think
that's fair to say indeed even in

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440
that's fair to say indeed even in
 

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.169
that's fair to say indeed even in
September 42 it might not have seemed

September 42 it might not have seemed
 

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:09.529
September 42 it might not have seemed
like an obvious call and it's a product

00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539
like an obvious call and it's a product
 

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:11.450
like an obvious call and it's a product
of a particular configuration of

I've tried to unpack a little bit i must
tell you I I can't point today to

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340
tell you I I can't point today to

actually a single scholarly work that to

00:28:19.159 --> 00:28:19.169
actually a single scholarly work that to
 

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:20.719
actually a single scholarly work that to
my view adequately recounts the story

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:20.729
my view adequately recounts the story
 

00:28:20.729 --> 00:28:24.229
my view adequately recounts the story
and this is the one we know best all

00:28:24.229 --> 00:28:24.239
and this is the one we know best all
 

00:28:24.239 --> 00:28:26.060
and this is the one we know best all
right so I wanted to introduce that

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.070
right so I wanted to introduce that
 

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.889
right so I wanted to introduce that
story for you and spend a few minutes on

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:27.899
story for you and spend a few minutes on

point I want to make in the talk is how
 

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.680
point I want to make in the talk is how
do we reason from history let's mainly

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:39.690
do we reason from history let's mainly
 

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.419
do we reason from history let's mainly
the way we reason from history about a

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:41.429
the way we reason from history about a
 

00:28:41.429 --> 00:28:43.279
the way we reason from history about a
problem like nuclear proliferation is

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:43.289
problem like nuclear proliferation is
 

00:28:43.289 --> 00:28:46.159
problem like nuclear proliferation is
there to there are basically two styles

00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:46.169
there to there are basically two styles
 

00:28:46.169 --> 00:28:47.930
there to there are basically two styles
of reasoning one of them is an illogical

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940
of reasoning one of them is an illogical
 

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.690
of reasoning one of them is an illogical
and the other is direct the analogical

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700
and the other is direct the analogical
 

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.879
and the other is direct the analogical
style of reasoning would go something

00:28:52.879 --> 00:28:52.889
style of reasoning would go something
 

00:28:52.889 --> 00:28:56.839
style of reasoning would go something
like this let's take the case of Oh Iran

00:28:56.839 --> 00:28:56.849
like this let's take the case of Oh Iran
 

00:28:56.849 --> 00:29:00.690
like this let's take the case of Oh Iran
Iran that's a familiar case

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:00.700
Iran that's a familiar case
 

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.500
Iran that's a familiar case
so the analogical version would be we

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:05.510
so the analogical version would be we
 

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.049
so the analogical version would be we
can deter Iran because deterrence of

00:29:08.049 --> 00:29:08.059
can deter Iran because deterrence of
 

00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:11.710
can deter Iran because deterrence of
Iran is like dot dot dot fill in the

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720
Iran is like dot dot dot fill in the
 

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.530
Iran is like dot dot dot fill in the
blank de turns in the Cold War the turns

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:14.540
blank de turns in the Cold War the turns
 

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.530
blank de turns in the Cold War the turns
of China deterrence of we have various

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:17.540
of China deterrence of we have various
 

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.740
of China deterrence of we have various
analogies of deterrence and we think

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:20.750
analogies of deterrence and we think
 

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.690
analogies of deterrence and we think
those analogies worked or did not work

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:22.700
those analogies worked or did not work
 

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.880
those analogies worked or did not work
and therefore if those analogies worked

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:24.890
and therefore if those analogies worked
 

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.740
and therefore if those analogies worked
or did not work we form a generalization

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:26.750
or did not work we form a generalization
 

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.560
or did not work we form a generalization
about whether deterrence works we then

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:29.570
about whether deterrence works we then
 

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.810
about whether deterrence works we then
apply that generalization to Iran that's

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:31.820
apply that generalization to Iran that's
 

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.780
apply that generalization to Iran that's
called an illogical reason and I view

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:34.790
called an illogical reason and I view
 

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.230
called an illogical reason and I view
this is this form of reasoning is deeply

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240
this is this form of reasoning is deeply
 

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.450
this is this form of reasoning is deeply
to the efficient and highly suspect and

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:40.460
to the efficient and highly suspect and

to the efficient and highly suspect and
extremely common and terribly seductive

extremely common and terribly seductive
 

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.010
extremely common and terribly seductive
because it's the most common form of

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:45.020
because it's the most common form of
 

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.350
because it's the most common form of
reasoning in public affairs usually

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360

unacknowledged usually implicit and

let's say Iran is like Red China we were

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.030
let's say Iran is like Red China we were
 

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.210
let's say Iran is like Red China we were
very worried about Red China and that

seemed really wild and irrational in the

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:24.710
seemed really wild and irrational in the
 

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.970
seemed really wild and irrational in the
1950s or early 1960s well maybe Iran is

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:27.980
1950s or early 1960s well maybe Iran is
 

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.950
1950s or early 1960s well maybe Iran is
like that and maybe they're not even as

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960
like that and maybe they're not even as
 

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.840
like that and maybe they're not even as
wildly irrational as the Chinese seemed

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:31.850
wildly irrational as the Chinese seemed
 

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.160
wildly irrational as the Chinese seemed
to us and then them in principle the

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:35.170
to us and then them in principle the
 

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.230
to us and then them in principle the
supposition is maybe we can be a little

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240
supposition is maybe we can be a little
 

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.770
supposition is maybe we can be a little
more relaxed about Iran because we could

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:41.780
more relaxed about Iran because we could
 

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.790
more relaxed about Iran because we could
have been a little more relaxed about

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:42.800
have been a little more relaxed about
 

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.580
have been a little more relaxed about
China it turns out or you could then say

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:45.590
China it turns out or you could then say
 

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.000
China it turns out or you could then say
no Iran is like Hitler's Germany and you

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.010

very comfortable if Hitler had acquired

an atomic bomb maybe you'd be uneasy

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:54.470
an atomic bomb maybe you'd be uneasy
 

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.680
an atomic bomb maybe you'd be uneasy
about that and so I'll use that now

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:56.690
about that and so I'll use that now
 

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.169
about that and so I'll use that now
majan if Hitler had had an atomic bomb

that's like aqua d nejad then there's

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:00.920
that's like aqua d nejad then there's
 

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.400
that's like aqua d nejad then there's

of history in that way then there are

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:09.530
of history in that way then there are

a direct historical reasoning is usually

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:14.950
a direct historical reasoning is usually
 

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.600
a direct historical reasoning is usually
found when someone has called upon a

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:45.660
what weapons will it likely rely on what
 

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.870
what weapons will it likely rely on what
strategies will it likely adopt if I was

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880
strategies will it likely adopt if I was
 

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.370
strategies will it likely adopt if I was
working in German military intelligence

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380
working in German military intelligence
 

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.560
working in German military intelligence
in summer of nineteen forty-two and

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:51.570
in summer of nineteen forty-two and
 

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.410
in summer of nineteen forty-two and
trying to project the likely shape white

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:54.420
trying to project the likely shape white
 

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.120
trying to project the likely shape white
and direction of American military power

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.130
and direction of American military power
 

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:01.730
and direction of American military power
that would be wielded against and I

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740
that would be wielded against and I
 

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.110
that would be wielded against and I
think you could get somewhere with that

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120
think you could get somewhere with that
 

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.920
think you could get somewhere with that
I think that would be of some value but

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:05.930
I think that would be of some value but
 

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.660
I think that would be of some value but
as far as shedding a lot of light on the

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:08.670
as far as shedding a lot of light on the
 

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.850
as far as shedding a lot of light on the
particular story I just hold I think

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:10.860
particular story I just hold I think
 

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.970
particular story I just hold I think
it's very hard so let's if you were to

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980
it's very hard so let's if you were to
 

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.890
it's very hard so let's if you were to
look at the Iran case today and someone

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:15.900
look at the Iran case today and someone
 

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.320
look at the Iran case today and someone
was asking me earlier today if you

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:18.330
was asking me earlier today if you
 

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.600
was asking me earlier today if you
wanted to do a study of Iran today what

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:20.610
wanted to do a study of Iran today what
 

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.310
wanted to do a study of Iran today what
would be an example of how you would

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320
would be an example of how you would
 

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.870
would be an example of how you would
work on Iran well let's take a

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:23.880
work on Iran well let's take a
 

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.970
work on Iran well let's take a
historical case on a mom let's just

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980
historical case on a mom let's just
 

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.860
historical case on a mom let's just
discard the analogical reasoning all

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:27.870
discard the analogical reasoning all
 

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.860
discard the analogical reasoning all
together and let's just say that we

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:30.870
together and let's just say that we
 

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.170
together and let's just say that we
wanted to do some direct historical work

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.180
wanted to do some direct historical work
 

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.690
wanted to do some direct historical work
on Iran we actually know of a particular

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700
on Iran we actually know of a particular
 

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.640
on Iran we actually know of a particular
decision Iran has made about nuclear

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:37.650
decision Iran has made about nuclear
 

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.980
decision Iran has made about nuclear
matters that was very significant Iran

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:39.990
matters that was very significant Iran
 

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.480
matters that was very significant Iran
made the decision to quit the moratorium

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:41.490
made the decision to quit the moratorium
 

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.720
made the decision to quit the moratorium
and resume uranium enrichment it appears

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:44.730
and resume uranium enrichment it appears
 

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:46.790
and resume uranium enrichment it appears
to have made that decision no later than

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800
to have made that decision no later than
 

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.300
to have made that decision no later than
some time in 2004 that's a decision we

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:50.310
some time in 2004 that's a decision we
 

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.640
some time in 2004 that's a decision we
know they made at the decision we know

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:52.650
know they made at the decision we know
 

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.540
know they made at the decision we know
they thought was significant so then you

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:56.550
they thought was significant so then you
 

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.190
they thought was significant so then you
would think if you will use my example

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200
would think if you will use my example
 

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.720
would think if you will use my example
of the American case and you think about

00:34:59.720 --> 00:34:59.730
of the American case and you think about
 

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.940
of the American case and you think about
the level of detail I needed to get into

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:01.950
the level of detail I needed to get into
 

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.120
the level of detail I needed to get into
to try to explain that case to you and

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.130
to try to explain that case to you and
 

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.650
to try to explain that case to you and
said okay then what level of detail

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660
said okay then what level of detail
 

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.570
said okay then what level of detail
would I need to get into to be

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580
would I need to get into to be
 

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.970
would I need to get into to be
comparable II have a stab at being

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980
comparable II have a stab at being
 

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.670
comparable II have a stab at being
comparably insightful about Iran that's

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680
comparably insightful about Iran that's
 

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.400
comparably insightful about Iran that's
like I when who why when did iran make

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:19.410
like I when who why when did iran make
 

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.790
like I when who why when did iran make
that decision in about resuming uranium

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800
that decision in about resuming uranium
 

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.470
that decision in about resuming uranium
enrichment and then to the best of my

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480
enrichment and then to the best of my
 

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.390
enrichment and then to the best of my
knowledge can I bound that time frame

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400
knowledge can I bound that time frame
 

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.780
knowledge can I bound that time frame
you know to one degree or another who

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:29.790
you know to one degree or another who
 

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.470
you know to one degree or another who
exactly made it I mean to actually make

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480
exactly made it I mean to actually make
 

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.050
exactly made it I mean to actually make
a list of the names

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:35.060
a list of the names
 

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.290
a list of the names
and the positions they held and the

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.300
and the positions they held and the
 

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.190
and the positions they held and the
institutional environment in which they

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200
institutional environment in which they
 

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.620
institutional environment in which they
operate so you like Vannevar Bush as an

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:41.630
operate so you like Vannevar Bush as an
 

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.810
operate so you like Vannevar Bush as an
atomized name if they understand who is

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:43.820
atomized name if they understand who is
 

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.000
atomized name if they understand who is
van eager bush what are his concerns

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.010
van eager bush what are his concerns
 

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.830
van eager bush what are his concerns
what's his world what is the office of

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:47.840
what's his world what is the office of
 

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.840
what's his world what is the office of
scientific research and development but

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:49.850
scientific research and development but
 

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.550
scientific research and development but
part of it is the personal relationships

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560
part of it is the personal relationships

Heisenberg so you would then you want to

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:58.850
Heisenberg so you would then you want to
 

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.490
Heisenberg so you would then you want to
look at the names and then who are these

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:00.500
look at the names and then who are these
 

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.800
look at the names and then who are these
and what is the institutional

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:02.810
and what is the institutional
 

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.420
and what is the institutional
environment in which they specifically

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:04.430
environment in which they specifically
 

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.720
environment in which they specifically
operated at that time and what are the

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:07.730
operated at that time and what are the
 

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.290
operated at that time and what are the
different relationships and so on and

different relationships and so on and
 

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.000
different relationships and so on and
then why did they make that decision and

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.010
then why did they make that decision and
 

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.230
then why did they make that decision and
then of course you wouldn't want to just

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240
then of course you wouldn't want to just
 

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.000
then of course you wouldn't want to just
look at the wise having to do with

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.010
look at the wise having to do with
 

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.940
look at the wise having to do with
atomic issues what were all the concerns

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:18.950
atomic issues what were all the concerns
 

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.040
atomic issues what were all the concerns
in those people's heads at that point in

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.050
in those people's heads at that point in
 

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.930
in those people's heads at that point in
time what were all the assessments they

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:22.940
time what were all the assessments they
 

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.100
time what were all the assessments they
would have made notice in the American

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:24.110
would have made notice in the American
 

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.020
would have made notice in the American
case there are a whole lot of other

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.030
case there are a whole lot of other
 

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.880
case there are a whole lot of other
issues going on there that they were

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:27.890
issues going on there that they were
 

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.650
issues going on there that they were
weighing and calculating most of them

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:29.660
weighing and calculating most of them

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:31.460
not having to do with atomic matters
 

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.950
not having to do with atomic matters
because the people who actually made

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960
because the people who actually made
 

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.600
because the people who actually made
that decision none of them were doing

that decision none of them were doing

that decision none of them were doing
atomic research they had some

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520
atomic research they had some
 

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.890
atomic research they had some
representations about the state of

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:38.900
representations about the state of
 

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.720
representations about the state of
atomic research being made to them by

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:40.730
atomic research being made to them by
 

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.500
atomic research being made to them by
others that they chose to believe so you

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:44.510
others that they chose to believe so you
 

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.030
others that they chose to believe so you
begin to think about that kind of level

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040
begin to think about that kind of level
 

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.950
begin to think about that kind of level
of analysis that you then apply to that

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960
of analysis that you then apply to that
 

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.720
of analysis that you then apply to that
case and I would think you begin to

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:49.730
case and I would think you begin to
 

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.910
case and I would think you begin to
surface then the character of the

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920
surface then the character of the
 

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.040
surface then the character of the
problem in analyzing a case like say the

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.050
problem in analyzing a case like say the
 

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.850
problem in analyzing a case like say the
Iranian case I mean I've had to work on

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:57.860
Iranian case I mean I've had to work on
 

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.530
Iranian case I mean I've had to work on
a little bit of this problem myself in

00:36:59.530 --> 00:36:59.540
a little bit of this problem myself in
 

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.300
a little bit of this problem myself in
the real world because when i was in

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:01.310
the real world because when i was in
 

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.190

of the department of state in 2005 and
 

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.420
of the department of state in 2005 and
2006 i was very much concerned with iraq

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:07.430
2006 i was very much concerned with iraq
 

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:11.320
2006 i was very much concerned with iraq
and i was very much concerned with why

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.330
and i was very much concerned with why
 

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.590
and i was very much concerned with why
is Iran doing so much to intervene in

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:14.600
is Iran doing so much to intervene in
 

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.660
is Iran doing so much to intervene in
the Iraqi in Iran and the Iraqi conflict

intervening in this war and Iranians are

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:27.740
intervening in this war and Iranians are
 

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.050

we usually do something to the people
who are doing that and I actually

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480
who are doing that and I actually
 

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.330
who are doing that and I actually
visited and I saw for myself what they

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:40.340
visited and I saw for myself what they
 

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.700
visited and I saw for myself what they
were doing to our soldiers and you're

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:42.710
were doing to our soldiers and you're
 

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.080
were doing to our soldiers and you're
going to if you do that you're going to

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.090
going to if you do that you're going to

something that people

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.210
something that people
 

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:47.790
something that people
were making it happen so I spent a lot

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800
were making it happen so I spent a lot
 

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.370
were making it happen so I spent a lot
of time trying to figure out who makes

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.380
of time trying to figure out who makes
 

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.500

these decisions are significant
decisions in which substantial resources

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:55.930
decisions in which substantial resources
 

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.140
decisions in which substantial resources
were invested there was some flurry of

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.150
were invested there was some flurry of
 

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.180
were invested there was some flurry of
controversy about this back when it

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:00.190
controversy about this back when it
 

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.010
controversy about this back when it
finally surfaced publicly no no they

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:02.020
finally surfaced publicly no no they
 

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.020
finally surfaced publicly no no they
couldn't be doing it that controversy I

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.030
couldn't be doing it that controversy I
 

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.690
couldn't be doing it that controversy I
think now has subsided I mean the

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:06.700
think now has subsided I mean the
 

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.339
think now has subsided I mean the
evidence on this overwhelming was not

00:38:08.339 --> 00:38:08.349
evidence on this overwhelming was not
 

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:10.079
evidence on this overwhelming was not
cooked up by politico's in the White

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:10.089
cooked up by politico's in the White
 

00:38:10.089 --> 00:38:12.750
cooked up by politico's in the White
House it was very much a ground-up stuff

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760

weapons in the field and then working
them back and of course we now we've

00:38:21.329 --> 00:38:21.339
them back and of course we now we've
 

00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:23.310

a very particular beauty of the world
and it varies to some extent among them

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920
and it varies to some extent among them
 

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.650
and it varies to some extent among them
and actually they talk a lot about their

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:58.660
and actually they talk a lot about their
 

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.400
and actually they talk a lot about their
view of the world

00:39:59.400 --> 00:39:59.410
view of the world
 

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.809
view of the world
in different ways because they have to

00:40:00.809 --> 00:40:00.819
in different ways because they have to
 

00:40:00.819 --> 00:40:02.430
in different ways because they have to
talk to each other and there's a

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440
talk to each other and there's a
 

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.980
talk to each other and there's a
spectrum of views about that but the

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:04.990
spectrum of views about that but the
 

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.299
spectrum of views about that but the
more I got into that and of course these

00:40:06.299 --> 00:40:06.309
more I got into that and of course these
 

00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:08.130
more I got into that and of course these
are mostly people who aren't very

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:08.140
are mostly people who aren't very
 

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.680
are mostly people who aren't very
well-traveled who don't know a whole lot

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:10.690
well-traveled who don't know a whole lot
 

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.420
well-traveled who don't know a whole lot
about the outside world and what they do

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:12.430
about the outside world and what they do
 

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.319
about the outside world and what they do
know comes to them through very unusual

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:16.329
know comes to them through very unusual
 

00:40:16.329 --> 00:40:19.140
know comes to them through very unusual
prisms refracted in very interesting

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.150
prisms refracted in very interesting
 

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.890
prisms refracted in very interesting
ways and so we kind of constructing what

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:22.900
ways and so we kind of constructing what
 

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.380
ways and so we kind of constructing what
do they believe is going on in the world

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:24.390
do they believe is going on in the world
 

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.640
do they believe is going on in the world
what are they what kind of action

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:26.650
what are they what kind of action
 

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.859
what are they what kind of action
judgments are they making I just found

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:28.869
judgments are they making I just found
 

00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:30.870
judgments are they making I just found
this is it's just extremely hard to

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880
this is it's just extremely hard to
 

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.059
this is it's just extremely hard to
understand and so I'm humbled by it and

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:33.069
understand and so I'm humbled by it and

you deal with situations of modesty and
uncertainty and risk and that's an

uncertainty and risk and that's an
 

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:46.200

possibly speculate reason from history
about others but there's another aspect

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:20.299
about others but there's another aspect
 

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:21.910
about others but there's another aspect
of the proliferation debate i'm

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920
of the proliferation debate i'm
 

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.039

wondering about your how history should

00:44:24.039 --> 00:44:24.049
wondering about your how history should
 

00:44:24.049 --> 00:44:24.620
wondering about your how history should
be

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:24.630
be
 

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.600
be
used here and that is the effect these

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:26.610
used here and that is the effect these
 

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.030
used here and that is the effect these
weapons have on the international

weapons have on the international
 

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.890
weapons have on the international
environment and how one should react

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900
environment and how one should react
 

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.450
environment and how one should react
when a state actually has them now of

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460
when a state actually has them now of
 

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.910
when a state actually has them now of
course there's a feedback loop here but

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920
course there's a feedback loop here but
 

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.730
course there's a feedback loop here but
while we may not want to generalize

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740
while we may not want to generalize
 

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.330
while we may not want to generalize
about why Iran is making the decisions

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:41.340
about why Iran is making the decisions
 

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.680
about why Iran is making the decisions
they're making or why North Korea is

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:42.690
they're making or why North Korea is
 

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.330
they're making or why North Korea is
making these decisions and making it

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:44.340
making these decisions and making it
 

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.150
making these decisions and making it
does strike me that it still we still

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160
does strike me that it still we still
 

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.070
does strike me that it still we still
would want to think about what our

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:49.080
would want to think about what our
 

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.340
would want to think about what our
reactions could do and to do that we

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:52.350
reactions could do and to do that we
 

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.080
reactions could do and to do that we
would want to have some understanding on

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:54.090
would want to have some understanding on
 

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.110
would want to have some understanding on
how we think about nuclear weapons shape

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:57.120
how we think about nuclear weapons shape
 

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.530
how we think about nuclear weapons shape
incentives affect whether it makes a

incentives affect whether it makes a
 

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.090
incentives affect whether it makes a
play for the world more dangerous or

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:02.100
play for the world more dangerous or
 

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:07.040
play for the world more dangerous or
less dangerous place and I wondered what

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:07.050
less dangerous place and I wondered what
 

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.740
less dangerous place and I wondered what
role would history have in trying to

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:09.750
role would history have in trying to
 

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.540
role would history have in trying to
answer that how would that second

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:11.550
answer that how would that second
 

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.310
answer that how would that second
question then relate to the first

question then relate to the first
 

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.020
question then relate to the first
because of the second question is really

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:15.030
because of the second question is really
 

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.460
because of the second question is really
the one that actually matters in policy

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:16.470
the one that actually matters in policy
 

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.500
the one that actually matters in policy
the first question if you're if you're

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:18.510
the first question if you're if you're
 

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.940
the first question if you're if you're
saying what about nuclear weapons you

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:19.950
saying what about nuclear weapons you
 

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.590
saying what about nuclear weapons you
really care about the decision season

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:21.600
really care about the decision season
 

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.450
really care about the decision season
what you really care about is how they

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460
what you really care about is how they
 

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.760
what you really care about is how they
shape state behavior and I was wondering

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:25.770
shape state behavior and I was wondering
 

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:35.800
shape state behavior and I was wondering
what role history can play an act sure I

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:35.810
 

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.940
think there's a lot of insight to be

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:37.950
think there's a lot of insight to be
 

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:40.550
think there's a lot of insight to be
gained by analyzing that the the actual

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.870
history of this dynamic like the work
that some of the work you published or

and in fact one reason that your work

and in fact one reason that your work
 

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.870
and in fact one reason that your work
and Mark's work is so interesting is

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880
and Mark's work is so interesting is
 

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.940
and Mark's work is so interesting is
because you tend to use words in it like

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:04.950
because you tend to use words in it like
 

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.759
because you tend to use words in it like
the myth about all these things that are

the myth about all these things that are

look actually it can have a lot of

look actually it can have a lot of
 

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.099
look actually it can have a lot of
possibilities for instance if you study

possibilities for instance if you study
 

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:33.440

the Cold War you'll find examples where

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:33.450
the Cold War you'll find examples where
 

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.509
the Cold War you'll find examples where
I believe Newton or even the post-cold

00:47:35.509 --> 00:47:35.519
I believe Newton or even the post-cold
 

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.670

war era where the acquisition of nuclear

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680
war era where the acquisition of nuclear
 

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.430
war era where the acquisition of nuclear
weapons has increased risks I think

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440
weapons has increased risks I think
 

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.650
weapons has increased risks I think
you'll find examples where the

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660
you'll find examples where the
 

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.999
you'll find examples where the
acquisition of nuclear weapons may have

00:47:43.999 --> 00:47:44.009
acquisition of nuclear weapons may have
 

00:47:44.009 --> 00:47:47.779
acquisition of nuclear weapons may have
decreased risks which tells me is that

00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:47.789
decreased risks which tells me is that
 

00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:49.460
decreased risks which tells me is that
there is no certain answers to what it

there is no certain answers to what it
will be in case X there are a lot of

will be in case X there are a lot of
 

00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:54.620
will be in case X there are a lot of
different possibilities and then you

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:54.630
different possibilities and then you
 

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.120
different possibilities and then you
really just need to do the historical

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.130
really just need to do the historical
 

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.190
really just need to do the historical

they're taking it as a situation where

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:37.290
they're taking it as a situation where
 

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:38.420
they're taking it as a situation where
they do want to build up a nuclear

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:38.430
they do want to build up a nuclear
 

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.460
they do want to build up a nuclear
capability to deter conventional

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:40.470
capability to deter conventional
 

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.140
capability to deter conventional
invasion like this or what happened with

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:42.150
invasion like this or what happened with
 

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.230
invasion like this or what happened with
when we knocked off their enemy in 91 in

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240
when we knocked off their enemy in 91 in
 

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:49.010
when we knocked off their enemy in 91 in
a massive conventional victory again we

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:49.020
a massive conventional victory again we
 

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.720
a massive conventional victory again we
don't know and you're sort of argument

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:50.730
don't know and you're sort of argument
 

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.310
don't know and you're sort of argument
about it was sort of focusing it on the

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:52.320
about it was sort of focusing it on the
 

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.560
about it was sort of focusing it on the
positron on the iarc and what they were

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:54.570
positron on the iarc and what they were
 

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.510
positron on the iarc and what they were
doing and again you know it's a very

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520
doing and again you know it's a very
 

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.680
doing and again you know it's a very
interesting thing I'm not privy to

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:57.690
interesting thing I'm not privy to
 

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:59.390
interesting thing I'm not privy to
classified information I certainly have

00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400
classified information I certainly have
 

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.740
classified information I certainly have
read a lot about what they say publicly

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:00.750
read a lot about what they say publicly
 

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.570
read a lot about what they say publicly
so it raises sort of interesting

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:02.580
so it raises sort of interesting
 

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.160
so it raises sort of interesting
questions about how you view history

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:04.170
questions about how you view history
 

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:07.310
questions about how you view history
coming into these situations and so I

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:07.320
coming into these situations and so I
 

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.230
coming into these situations and so I
just was curious about your response to

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240
just was curious about your response to
 

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.910
just was curious about your response to
that and then you as someone who

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920
that and then you as someone who
 

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.790
that and then you as someone who

when we're viewing these issues oh
 

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:24.290
when we're viewing these issues oh
that's a terrific question and because

that's a terrific question and because
it's actually a source of a real insight

to break into the most classified

this is one of the reasons why I find

history and cultural history to be so
 

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.480
history and cultural history to be so
artificial because actually if you do

artificial because actually if you do
 

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.609
artificial because actually if you do
political history correctly you actually

00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619
political history correctly you actually
 

00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:28.340
political history correctly you actually
have to unpack a cultural world that is

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:28.350
have to unpack a cultural world that is
 

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:29.840
have to unpack a cultural world that is
full of all kinds of idiosyncratic

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:29.850
full of all kinds of idiosyncratic

about what their history has been that

00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619
about what their history has been that
 

00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:39.140
about what their history has been that
is the only way to really make sense

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:39.150
is the only way to really make sense
 

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.550
is the only way to really make sense
actually have a lot of their politics

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:40.560
actually have a lot of their politics
 

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.330
actually have a lot of their politics
including by the way ours what words

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:44.340
including by the way ours what words
 

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.070
including by the way ours what words
like Republic have meant at different

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:46.080
like Republic have meant at different
 

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.020
like Republic have meant at different
times even in our history so that's

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:48.030
times even in our history so that's
 

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.120
times even in our history so that's
actually a suggestion of really

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:50.130
actually a suggestion of really
 

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:52.130
actually a suggestion of really

reconstruct it from the available
 

01:03:51.709 --> 01:03:54.719
reconstruct it from the available
evidence and that's a terrific paper and

01:03:54.719 --> 01:03:54.729
evidence and that's a terrific paper and
 

01:03:54.729 --> 01:03:57.489
evidence and that's a terrific paper and
it's not published in a book but you can

01:03:57.489 --> 01:03:57.499
it's not published in a book but you can
 

01:03:57.499 --> 01:04:01.689
it's not published in a book but you can
find it that I think this is part of the

find it that I think this is part of the
 

01:04:01.699 --> 01:04:04.989
find it that I think this is part of the
dulfer report and I that I mean so there

01:04:04.989 --> 01:04:04.999
dulfer report and I that I mean so there
 

01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:06.999
dulfer report and I that I mean so there
it's another there are people who have

it's another there are people who have
 

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.759
it's another there are people who have
the talent to do this sort of work there

01:04:09.759 --> 01:04:09.769
the talent to do this sort of work there
 

01:04:09.769 --> 01:04:11.529
the talent to do this sort of work there
are plenty of them they're just not

01:04:11.529 --> 01:04:11.539
are plenty of them they're just not

this way similar to what you mentioned

01:04:18.189 --> 01:04:18.199
this way similar to what you mentioned
 

01:04:18.199 --> 01:04:21.219
this way similar to what you mentioned
about the ship from focusing on the army

01:04:21.219 --> 01:04:21.229
about the ship from focusing on the army
 

01:04:21.229 --> 01:04:25.180
about the ship from focusing on the army
to the technical side how much do you

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:25.190
to the technical side how much do you
 

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:26.650
to the technical side how much do you
think that sort of mentality still

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:26.660
think that sort of mentality still
 

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.039
think that sort of mentality still
drives the current military operation in

01:04:30.039 --> 01:04:30.049
drives the current military operation in
 

01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:32.289
drives the current military operation in
particular with the drone bombing in

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.299
particular with the drone bombing in
 

01:04:32.299 --> 01:04:34.390

Pakistan because we always hear about

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400
Pakistan because we always hear about
 

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.519
Pakistan because we always hear about
the collateral damage and how much that

01:04:36.519 --> 01:04:36.529
the collateral damage and how much that
 

01:04:36.529 --> 01:04:40.870
the collateral damage and how much that
sort of makes more enemies but it's

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880
sort of makes more enemies but it's
 

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.259
sort of makes more enemies but it's
still happening and I don't I mean it

01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:44.269
still happening and I don't I mean it
 

01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:46.739
still happening and I don't I mean it
seems like it's a self-defeating

01:04:46.739 --> 01:04:46.749
seems like it's a self-defeating
 

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:50.109
seems like it's a self-defeating
operation so why is that still going on

01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119
operation so why is that still going on
 

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:53.499
operation so why is that still going on
in your mind well actually at the micro

01:04:53.499 --> 01:04:53.509
in your mind well actually at the micro
 

01:04:53.509 --> 01:04:55.930
in your mind well actually at the micro
level and one of the things that I've

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:55.940
level and one of the things that I've
 

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.830
level and one of the things that I've
encountered in my experience is that

01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:57.840
encountered in my experience is that
 

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.570
encountered in my experience is that
this is the problem that we've just been

01:04:59.570 --> 01:04:59.580
this is the problem that we've just been
 

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.250
this is the problem that we've just been
talking about about the reconstruction

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260
talking about about the reconstruction
 

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.110
talking about about the reconstruction
of other people's world gets much better

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:03.120
of other people's world gets much better
 

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.510
of other people's world gets much better
the closer you get to the field and the

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520
the closer you get to the field and the
 

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.860
the closer you get to the field and the
more you get to people who are working

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:06.870
more you get to people who are working
 

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.290
more you get to people who are working
on particular individuals so for

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:09.300
on particular individuals so for
 

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.850
on particular individuals so for
instance if you were to go to an embassy

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:10.860
instance if you were to go to an embassy
 

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.890
instance if you were to go to an embassy
and then you're go to the people in the

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900
and then you're go to the people in the
 

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.290
and then you're go to the people in the
embassy who you know interact every day

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:15.300
embassy who you know interact every day
 

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.330
embassy who you know interact every day
with a particular office or minister and

with a particular office or minister and
 

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.070
with a particular office or minister and
you just like tell me about this guy

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:19.080

lot and they r it and they get a lot now
let's take the illustration that you

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:27.570
let's take the illustration that you
 

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:30.590
let's take the illustration that you
just offer people who are working on and

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:30.600
just offer people who are working on and
 

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.750
just offer people who are working on and
at particular al-qaeda problems let's

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760
at particular al-qaeda problems let's
 

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.810
at particular al-qaeda problems let's
say al qaeda in iraq or al-qaeda bases

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:35.820
say al qaeda in iraq or al-qaeda bases
 

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.450
say al qaeda in iraq or al-qaeda bases
in pakistan they have now zeroed in on a

01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.460
in pakistan they have now zeroed in on a
 

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.850
in pakistan they have now zeroed in on a
number of individuals and interactions

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:40.860
number of individuals and interactions
 

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.850
number of individuals and interactions
between individuals for a long time with

every asset of the US government that
 

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:48.200
every asset of the US government that
they can muster and they actually have

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:48.210
they can muster and they actually have
 

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.300
they can muster and they actually have
they have tried to do a lot to

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:50.310
they have tried to do a lot to
 

01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:52.820
they have tried to do a lot to
reconstruct their the world of a handful

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:52.830
reconstruct their the world of a handful
 

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:55.790
reconstruct their the world of a handful
of people so they may have drones for

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:55.800
of people so they may have drones for
 

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.380
of people so they may have drones for
instance surveillance drones that just

01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:57.390
instance surveillance drones that just
 

01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:59.480
instance surveillance drones that just
kind of hover over places for a long

01:05:59.480 --> 01:05:59.490
kind of hover over places for a long
 

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.960
kind of hover over places for a long
time and try to just get a sense of who

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:02.970
time and try to just get a sense of who
 

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:05.240
time and try to just get a sense of who
travels with whom where do people go

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:05.250
travels with whom where do people go
 

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.220
travels with whom where do people go
what are the ways in which they move

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:07.230
what are the ways in which they move
 

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.700
what are the ways in which they move
what are the ways in which they meet

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:09.710
what are the ways in which they meet
 

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:12.350
what are the ways in which they meet
when they meet what do they do how our

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:12.360
when they meet what do they do how our
 

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.570
when they meet what do they do how our
operations planned you get a lot of

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:14.580
operations planned you get a lot of
 

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.670
operations planned you get a lot of
information after an operation sometimes

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680
information after an operation sometimes
 

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.770
information after an operation sometimes
and you can reconstruct okay that's how

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780
and you can reconstruct okay that's how
 

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.960
and you can reconstruct okay that's how
this worked and so when you what you'll

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:20.970
this worked and so when you what you'll
 

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:23.300
this worked and so when you what you'll
find is close to the field are people

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:23.310
find is close to the field are people
 

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.060
find is close to the field are people
who have really quite masterful detailed

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.070
who have really quite masterful detailed
 

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:28.640
who have really quite masterful detailed
knowledge about petit these particular

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:28.650
knowledge about petit these particular
 

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:30.980
knowledge about petit these particular
groups that they have been focused on

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:30.990
groups that they have been focused on
 

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.560
groups that they have been focused on
very hard not always the case but it is

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:33.570
very hard not always the case but it is
 

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:37.400
very hard not always the case but it is
sometimes the case and therefore when

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:37.410
sometimes the case and therefore when
 

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:40.730
sometimes the case and therefore when
they decide to shoot sometimes they

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740
they decide to shoot sometimes they
 

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.210
they decide to shoot sometimes they
shoot very accurately because they

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220
shoot very accurately because they
 

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.070
shoot very accurately because they
probably they may have had four other

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:46.080
probably they may have had four other
 

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.540
probably they may have had four other
occasions where they could have taken a

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:47.550
occasions where they could have taken a
 

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:49.670
occasions where they could have taken a
shot and decided not to and that one

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680
shot and decided not to and that one
 

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.650
shot and decided not to and that one
they did and that's one reason why

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660
they did and that's one reason why
 

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.620
they did and that's one reason why
frankly we broke and rolled up most of

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:54.630
frankly we broke and rolled up most of
 

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:56.900
frankly we broke and rolled up most of
al Qaeda in Iraq as we gain that kind of

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:56.910
al Qaeda in Iraq as we gain that kind of
 

01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:59.060
al Qaeda in Iraq as we gain that kind of
mastery of knowledge about the way al

01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.070
mastery of knowledge about the way al
 

01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.280
mastery of knowledge about the way al
Qaeda in Iraq worked to the point and

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:01.290
Qaeda in Iraq worked to the point and
 

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:03.110
Qaeda in Iraq worked to the point and
actually interestingly a lot of the

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:03.120
actually interestingly a lot of the
 

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.490
actually interestingly a lot of the
breakthroughs in the interrogations

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500
breakthroughs in the interrogations
 

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.800
breakthroughs in the interrogations
process came after we quit using the

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:06.810
process came after we quit using the
 

01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:08.840
process came after we quit using the
bully-boy tactics and just began

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:08.850
bully-boy tactics and just began
 

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:11.210
bully-boy tactics and just began
interrogating under field man

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220
interrogating under field man
 

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.920
interrogating under field man
rules beginning in 04 05 and

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:14.930
rules beginning in 04 05 and
 

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.870
rules beginning in 04 05 and
incidentally we found that we did it we

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880
incidentally we found that we did it we
 

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.550
incidentally we found that we did it we
conducted a natural experiment on

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:19.560
conducted a natural experiment on
 

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.950
conducted a natural experiment on
methods of interrogation incidents as a

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960
methods of interrogation incidents as a
 

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.020
methods of interrogation incidents as a
footnote or we've tried different

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:24.030
footnote or we've tried different
 

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:25.490
footnote or we've tried different
methods of interrogation against

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500
methods of interrogation against
 

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.589
methods of interrogation against
al-qaeda simultaneously in a

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599
al-qaeda simultaneously in a
 

01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:29.240
al-qaeda simultaneously in a
double-blind experiment without meaning

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:29.250
double-blind experiment without meaning
 

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.220
double-blind experiment without meaning
to do it is what scientists call a

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:31.230
to do it is what scientists call a
 

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:35.240
to do it is what scientists call a
natural experiment and actually the we

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:35.250
natural experiment and actually the we
 

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.980
natural experiment and actually the we
did very well against al-qaeda in Iraq

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:36.990
did very well against al-qaeda in Iraq
 

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:39.320
did very well against al-qaeda in Iraq
and we would in real time could get

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:39.330
and we would in real time could get
 

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:41.870
and we would in real time could get
people could okay they could tell us

01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880
people could okay they could tell us
 

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.900
people could okay they could tell us
some stuff that fit three pieces into

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:44.910
some stuff that fit three pieces into
 

01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:47.180
some stuff that fit three pieces into
the mosaic completed the mosaic and an

the mosaic completed the mosaic and an
 

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:48.620
the mosaic completed the mosaic and an
hour half later you rolled out another

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:48.630
hour half later you rolled out another
 

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.050
hour half later you rolled out another
raid in the same night and then rolled

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:51.060
raid in the same night and then rolled
 

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.520
raid in the same night and then rolled
out the next node in the network and

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:52.530
out the next node in the network and
 

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:54.880
out the next node in the network and
even maybe the next note after that and

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:54.890
even maybe the next note after that and
 

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:57.980
even maybe the next note after that and
really broke that organization it's

01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:57.990
really broke that organization it's
 

01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:00.020
really broke that organization it's
beginning to reconstitute some now as

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:00.030
beginning to reconstitute some now as
 

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.660
beginning to reconstitute some now as
our presence draws down and so on but

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:02.670
our presence draws down and so on but
 

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:05.750
our presence draws down and so on but
the point is that we have there are

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760
the point is that we have there are
 

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.150
the point is that we have there are
people out there who intuitively get

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160
people out there who intuitively get
 

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.520
people out there who intuitively get
these skills and apply these skills in

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:10.530
these skills and apply these skills in
 

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:15.080
these skills and apply these skills in
working micro problems and and and the

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:15.090
working micro problems and and and the
 

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.729
working micro problems and and and the
way these are very valuable skills if

01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739
way these are very valuable skills if
 

01:08:16.739 --> 01:08:18.320
way these are very valuable skills if

objects I capture I wanted to ask you
 

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.660
objects I capture I wanted to ask you
about historical narrative about the

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:44.670
about historical narrative about the
 

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:47.740
about historical narrative about the
german reunification from your book and

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:47.750
german reunification from your book and
 

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.120
german reunification from your book and
one thing i noticed reading your book

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:50.130
one thing i noticed reading your book
 

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:51.709
one thing i noticed reading your book
but also reading some of the other

01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719
but also reading some of the other
 

01:08:51.719 --> 01:08:53.599
but also reading some of the other
memoirs from this time is that for

invited to the polished journals to come

01:09:10.519 --> 01:09:10.529
invited to the polished journals to come
 

01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:12.590
invited to the polished journals to come
to a NATO meeting in canada at the

01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600
to a NATO meeting in canada at the

beginning of august of 1918
 

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.690
beginning of august of 1918
and then they came to Washington and

01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:16.700
and then they came to Washington and
 

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.220
and then they came to Washington and
that was sort of the first breakthrough

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:19.230
that was sort of the first breakthrough
 

01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:21.770
that was sort of the first breakthrough
in the Cold War that this was actually

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:21.780
in the Cold War that this was actually
 

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.540
in the Cold War that this was actually
the first time since before World War

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:23.550
the first time since before World War
 

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:26.720
the first time since before World War
two where they invited these people here

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:26.730
two where they invited these people here
 

01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:31.640
two where they invited these people here
and it was you know followed by some of

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:31.650
and it was you know followed by some of
 

01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:35.740
and it was you know followed by some of
the more conventional arms control

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:35.750
the more conventional arms control
 

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:37.910

understandings that later developed into
something else but I didn't see that in

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:40.650
something else but I didn't see that in
 

01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:42.380
something else but I didn't see that in
your book and I didn't see it in print

your book and I didn't see it in print
scroll crop spoke and I think that maybe

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000
scroll crop spoke and I think that maybe
 

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.300
scroll crop spoke and I think that maybe
it affects the historical narrative out

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:47.310
it affects the historical narrative out
 

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:49.820
it affects the historical narrative out
than the german reunification because it

than the german reunification because it
 

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:52.490
than the german reunification because it
was sort of the first breakthrough and i

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500
was sort of the first breakthrough and i
 

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.190
was sort of the first breakthrough and i
wonder if you could tell me you know was

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:55.200
wonder if you could tell me you know was
 

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.140
wonder if you could tell me you know was
that a sort of a conscious decision not

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:57.150
that a sort of a conscious decision not
 

01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:00.590
that a sort of a conscious decision not
to include dead or it was secret I don't

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600
to include dead or it was secret I don't
 

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.410
to include dead or it was secret I don't
know I mean I I know it was there and I

01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420
know I mean I I know it was there and I
 

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:07.070
know I mean I I know it was there and I
was there by the way but you know I just

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080
was there by the way but you know I just
 

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.250

the training camps and so on then you if
 

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:59.379
the training camps and so on then you if
you kind of do the work on them how many

01:25:59.379 --> 01:25:59.389
you kind of do the work on them how many
 

01:25:59.389 --> 01:26:02.970
you kind of do the work on them how many
people you have to field then how many

I'm yeah these are these are combat

01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960
I'm yeah these are these are combat
 

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.859
I'm yeah these are these are combat
units these are not support units and so

01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:08.869
units these are not support units and so
 

01:26:08.869 --> 01:26:10.990
units these are not support units and so
what's happening actually an early 45 is

01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.000
what's happening actually an early 45 is
 

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.030
what's happening actually an early 45 is
there repeatedly coming through the

there repeatedly coming through the
 

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.160
there repeatedly coming through the

more people to throw into the line
 

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.160
more people to throw into the line
because they basically run out of combat

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:24.170
because they basically run out of combat
 

01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:26.560

have been respected in some cases but
 

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:29.820
have been respected in some cases but
for instance right now with a lot of

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:29.830
for instance right now with a lot of
 

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:31.890

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560
concentrated to rain down in Israeli
 

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.420
concentrated to rain down in Israeli
cities based in the state of 11 so if

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:39.430
cities based in the state of 11 so if
 

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:41.340
cities based in the state of 11 so if
that happens what will Israel do about

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:41.350
that happens what will Israel do about
 

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:45.630
that happens what will Israel do about
that is that cross some kind of Israeli

01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:45.640
that is that cross some kind of Israeli

answer to your question is red lines

01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800
answer to your question is red lines
 

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.970
answer to your question is red lines
often don't work and you then really

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:53.980
often don't work and you then really
 

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.400
often don't work and you then really
just have to do if I do a red line on

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:56.410
just have to do if I do a red line on
 

01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:58.200
just have to do if I do a red line on
this particular place in this particular

01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:58.210
this particular place in this particular
 

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:01.970

do I think I will reduce

01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:04.420
do I think I will reduce
 

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.780
do I think I will reduce
the risk that the red line will be

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:06.790
the risk that the red line will be
 

01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:09.030
the risk that the red line will be
crossed because see mostly what you're

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040
crossed because see mostly what you're
 

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.410
crossed because see mostly what you're
doing is you're nobody's offering you a

01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:10.420
doing is you're nobody's offering you a
 

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:12.450
doing is you're nobody's offering you a
guarantee you're mostly just in the

01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:12.460
guarantee you're mostly just in the
 

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.490
guarantee you're mostly just in the
world of IP need to raise risks so I can

01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:14.500
world of IP need to raise risks so I can
 

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.770
world of IP need to raise risks so I can
even lower risks and oftentimes what I

01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:16.780
even lower risks and oftentimes what I
 

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.020
even lower risks and oftentimes what I
do to lower risks creates other kinds of

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.030
do to lower risks creates other kinds of
 

01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:21.720
do to lower risks creates other kinds of
risks and so usually the art of judgment

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:21.730
risks and so usually the art of judgment
 

01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:24.060
risks and so usually the art of judgment
and public affairs is how i balance the

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:24.070
and public affairs is how i balance the
 

01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:26.370
and public affairs is how i balance the
trade-offs among my wrists and my

trade-offs among my wrists and my
 

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.850

management of risk alright well thank

01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:29.860
management of risk alright well thank
 

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:32.460
