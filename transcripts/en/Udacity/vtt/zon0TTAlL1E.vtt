[Evans] So if you recall the separate channels, we divided the cipher

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
into the message part, the key part, and the part from the S wheels,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and now we've concluded that if we can--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we're going to try 1271 possible settings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So for 1 of those possible settings we're going to know all the key bits,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and that means if we guess the right setting the key will go to 0.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So now all that's left is the other 2 parts.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is what we had before.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We knew that the probability of delta M being zero was greater than a half,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and it was actually about 0.61 for German

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because of the likelihood of message letters being repeated.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And we knew that the probability of delta S being 0 was about 0.73,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and that's because of the structure of the machine--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that the S wheels don't advance every step.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Only when the M wheels are on a 1 do the S wheels advance.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And so now we've said if we guess right, that means the probability that the key bits are 0

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
goes to 1.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And it'll be 1 when we guess right.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When we don't guess right it'll be ½.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So in order to tell if we guess right,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we need to know that the probability of the cipher text bits when we guess right,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the probability of the delta Zs being 0 will be different from ½.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So the question is, what is the probability delta Z is 0 when we guess right?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And remember that what delta Z is is the XOR of delta M, delta K, and delta S.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So to solve this you need to think about all the different things

00:01:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that would make delta Z equal to 0 and compute their probability.
