00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.496
&gt;&gt;Young: Take a look at your graph--

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:07.053
&gt;&gt;In most classes variability
is the norm, not the exception.

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.548
&gt;&gt;We're going to be doing
an "I notice, I wonder".

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.498
&gt;&gt;Cantor: This teacher is aware that
these children learn at different paces

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:24.235
and so she is creating a mechanism to
see the developmental starting points

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:28.715
of a diverse group of kids
so that children can move

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:32.157
at different rates to
master the content.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.163
&gt;&gt;Young: This classroom is
heterogeneously grouped.

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:39.072
This is a non-tracked class. Some kids
will be bypassing Algebra One next year

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.988
and going into an advanced class

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:42.864
and some kids will be
taking a pre-algebra class.

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:44.250
So, there's a wide range.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.389
Today's graph had a lot of
information in it and, so,

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:51.474
it was perfect for an
"I notice, I wonder."

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:54.907
&gt;&gt;What is this graph telling us?
What do you notice in the graph?

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.506
Don't do the "wonders" yet, just your
"notices". Take about two minutes.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:05.822
&gt;&gt;The "I notice, I wonder" helps
kids slow down and really focus

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:07.000
on what's in front of them.

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:11.909
They wrote about what they noticed and
then turned and talked to a neighbor

00:01:12.108 --> 00:01:16.558
to enhance and to draw attention to
things that they maybe had missed.

00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:20.190
&gt;&gt;Student: Renewable energy
aren't being used as much.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.964
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah. Seems to
be going down actually.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.313
&gt;&gt;Cantor: The information
she is getting is

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:36.484
about the individual
variability in that classroom.

00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:41.243
What the kids are getting is the
benefit of learning from each other.

00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:45.434
&gt;&gt;Young: All right, let's get
a list of "I notice, I wonder".

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:48.817
&gt;&gt;Student: I noticed that petroleum
had a big jump in the 1900s.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:50.413
&gt;&gt;Young: What's another "notice"?

00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:53.297
&gt;&gt;Student: I notice this
is a monthly energy review.

00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:57.058
&gt;&gt;Young: Oh, so, you're looking below
the graph as well as above the graph.

00:01:57.208 --> 00:02:01.688
Awesome. All right, let's switch over to
the backside and I want your "wonders".

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.043
What do I wonder about this graph?

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.183
&gt;&gt;The "I wonder" is a great way for
me to see what they need to know.

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:12.294
&gt;&gt;So, what do you wonder? Oh, my
gosh, so much to wonder about.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.899
&gt;&gt;Student: I wonder what
the other renewables are.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:18.670
&gt;&gt;Young: It's also a time when
you can build confidence in kids.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.287
&gt;&gt;Great question.
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:21.763
&gt;&gt;Young: Yeah, I agree with you. Aidan?

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.400
&gt;&gt;Aidan: What is BTU?

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.243
&gt;&gt;Young: What is a BTU? Great question.

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:30.933
&gt;&gt;"I notice, I wonder" just
brings the conversation to a place

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.110
where all people can contribute.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.806
It gives everyone a voice.

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:38.157
It allows kids to listen

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:41.619
to other people's ideas
before they do the analysis.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:46.827
So, it's like a way to collect
information collaboratively,

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:50.813
but allowing time to think first.
