00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.800
several years ago I got to be very

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
several years ago I got to be very
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.940
several years ago I got to be very
interested in honeybees and the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
interested in honeybees and the
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.830
interested in honeybees and the
extraordinary talent that they have for

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
extraordinary talent that they have for
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930
extraordinary talent that they have for
dancing they're better dancers than us

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
dancing they're better dancers than us
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.370
dancing they're better dancers than us
they've been doing it a lot longer and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
they've been doing it a lot longer and
 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.060
they've been doing it a lot longer and
they certainly seem to have danced as

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
they certainly seem to have danced as
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.450
they certainly seem to have danced as
their culture to a greater extent than

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460
their culture to a greater extent than
 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.269
their culture to a greater extent than
probably any other species so I got to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
probably any other species so I got to
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.160
probably any other species so I got to
thinking about whether there was a way

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
thinking about whether there was a way
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.240
thinking about whether there was a way
to work with honeybees collaboratively

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250
to work with honeybees collaboratively
 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.130
to work with honeybees collaboratively
making use of their dance in a way that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
making use of their dance in a way that
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.299
making use of their dance in a way that
would choreograph it as we do amongst

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
would choreograph it as we do amongst
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.630
would choreograph it as we do amongst
ourselves for human audiences so what I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
ourselves for human audiences so what I
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.709
ourselves for human audiences so what I
did was I studied extensively the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
did was I studied extensively the
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959
did was I studied extensively the
language of bees the language by which

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
language of bees the language by which
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.540

they indicate to others where flowers

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
they indicate to others where flowers
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.790
they indicate to others where flowers
are to be found so that others can then

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
are to be found so that others can then
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100
are to be found so that others can then
to go and find those flowers and in the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
to go and find those flowers and in the
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319
to go and find those flowers and in the
process of pollinating them bring back

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
process of pollinating them bring back
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.680

more nectar or more pollen for the hive
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.160
more nectar or more pollen for the hive
I worked out where hives were in the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
I worked out where hives were in the
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.000
I worked out where hives were in the
city of San Francisco relative to places

that I might plant flowers and then
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.000
that I might plant flowers and then
mapped out specifically where the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
mapped out specifically where the
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.810
mapped out specifically where the
flowers should be planted as a way of

then working with some collaborators
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100
then working with some collaborators
went and planted the flowers and I made

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
went and planted the flowers and I made
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.499
went and planted the flowers and I made

honeybee ballet I had the question of
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.120

whether I could choreograph a ballet for
