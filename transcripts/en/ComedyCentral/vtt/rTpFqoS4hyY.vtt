So it was at the very
beginning of my career.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.299
I was flat broke.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.735
I was performing all around
town at, you know,

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:44.937
stand-up clubs, improv shows.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.242
Like, I mean, I would have
performed here.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.011
But I was just desperate
to get anything going.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:54.447
I was doing a little improv
show at the Groundlings...

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.615

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:00.286
I was doing an improv
show at the Groundlings.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.455
It went very well,
and when I stepped offstage,

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:06.192
the stage manager was
literally, like, vibrating,

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.627
she was so excited.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.928
She was like,
"Oh, my God, oh, my God,

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.630
Michael, come here, come here."

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.031
I was like, "What is it?"
and she goes,

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:15.334
"Faye Dunaway

And her hands
were just shaking,

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.846
and I took a movie script
from her hands.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.018
And on it, it said,
"MICHAEL, YOU ARE BRILLIANT."

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.286

I couldn't wait to call her.

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:48.501
And I flew to the Valley to my
phone,

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.869
'cause we didn't have cell
phones,

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.004

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:55.641
And the way she answered
the phone was very formal.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:58.477

"Hello, this is Faye Dunaway."

You know, like, everything was

but excited, and I said,

"Ms. Dunaway,
I'm Michael McDonald.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.392

"I mean, thank you very much,
but it's--

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.012

looks."

do for you, Faye?"

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:47.360
She goes, "I have an audition

very funny."

She goes,
"That's the problem, Michael,

"the comedy is scaring
the hell out of me!

my whole career!"

I was like, "Well, what can I
do?"

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:22.495
She goes, "I need you
to be my comedy coach."

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.997
I said, "Um, done.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.501
I charge $25 an hour.
I can meet you tomorrow."

so could we make it 8:00?"

And she just hangs up
the phone.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:52.291
And now I'm thinking, like,
I mean,

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:55.161
I'm so excited, but also, like,
"What happened?

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.330
What do I--what did I just
agree to?"

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.632
There's--there's an 8:00 time,
but I don't know--

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:00.633
is it a phone call?

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:01.967
Do I meet her?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.302
What--I don't have time.

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:04.537
I've got to just read the
script.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.638
So I--excited.

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:06.672
I do all my homework.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.140
I do my diligence.

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:10.476
And at 8:00, I now think, like,

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.944
"If she calls me, do I--

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:13.879
"do I just hop in the car like
Batman?

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:15.281
Like, what happens?"

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.783
So I put my car keys by my
landline,

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.352
and I've got the script with
all my notes,

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.954
and I'm dressed up just to look
professional,

00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:25.057
and the phone rings at 8:00
on the dot.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.493
So I just, you know,
do a little bit, and I go,

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.028
"Hello, Faye, how are you?"

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.830
And she goes,
"How did you know it was me?"

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.465
[laughter]

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.334
And I go, "Oh, I didn't tell
you? I'm psychic."

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:37.837
And she goes..."Really?"

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.505
[laughter]

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:41.474
And I go, "No, I'm sorry,
I was just joking."

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.876
And she goes,
"Oh, Michael, you're brilliant!

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.011
"You're brilliant!

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:50.182
What a high-wire act you have!"

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:51.650
So...

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:53.719
[laughter]

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:55.721
So I say, "Well, you know,
Faye, what--

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:56.922
"you know, what should we do?

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:59.191
"I can come to you.

"You can--we can do a thing at

"whatever you would like.

How would you like to do this?"

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:05.264
She goes, "I'm ensconced right
now, Michael,

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:06.832
"just ensconced.

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:10.169
Can we just do one scene over
the phone?"

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:11.670
And then I realize, like, oh,
of course.

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:13.205
I know what she's doing.

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:15.107
You know, she doesn't know if
I'm any good.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.410
She doesn't know what my take
would be, and I--like,

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.745
her credits: she's from
"Chinatown"

00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:22.448
and "Bonnie and Clyde" and
"Network."

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:24.216
She has an Oscar.

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.520
And at that point, my biggest
credit was "Leprechaun 2."

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.954
[laughter]

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:30.723
So she wants a little bit of a
taste,

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.024
so I'm, like, I get it.

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:33.959
So she says, "I tell
you what.

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:37.396
You read my part,
and I'll read all the others."

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:41.066
And I'm like, "What?"
Like, she...

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.403
you--you want me to play your
part at you?

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:46.739
Like, give you line readings
and...what--

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.107
what the fuck is happening?

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.542
But it's, you know,
Faye Dunaway,

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:50.943
and, you know, sure,

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.479
so, like, I start
doing her part to her,

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:55.881
and she doesn't even let me
get a couple lines out

00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:59.819
before, "Oh, Michael,
ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.755
"Oh, Michael, you're brilliant!

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:04.256
"Just let me write that down.

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:05.624
'Deadpan.'"

00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:07.927
[laughter]

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.595
"Let's do another scene."

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:12.932
And, like, I'm so happy
to be pleasing Oscar winner,

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.401
legend, Faye Dunaway,
that, like, we just go

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.102
through each scene.

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:18.804
We do another one, and she's
laughing the whole time

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.272
at everything.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:21.907
"You go up at the end of that
sentence.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.309
Let me jot that down."

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.411
Like, it's just this maniacal
thing,

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:29.582
but because she's--I'm, like,
drunk on her compliments.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.016
So at a certain point,

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:33.152
I look at the clock,
and it says 10:00.

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:34.954
We've been on the phone for two
hours.

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:37.756
She has an audition
at Universal at noon,

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:39.124
so I'm like,
"Faye, hold on a second,

00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:41.360
"like, I need to
get over to you

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:44.263
"so that we can really work
this out

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:45.965
and so you can get to
Universal."

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.867
And she's like,
"Michael, I don't know.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.535
Let me check my schedule."

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:50.970
[imitates dial tone]

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:52.605
She just hangs up.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.173
So I'm like, "What the f..."

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:55.541
Now I realize, like,
the conversation's over

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.543
when you hear the dial tone.

00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:00.145
So I, like, I'm kind of staring
by the phone,

00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:01.881
like, is it over?
What happened?

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.183
And about a half an hour later,
I get another phone call.

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:05.651
"Hello, this is Faye Dunaway."

00:08:05.684 --> 00:08:07.853
I'm like, "Yes, I know, Faye."

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:10.890
"I was thinking about
wardrobe."

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.191
I'm like, "What?"

00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:13.993
And she's like, "I was
thinking,

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.128
"I have a black Armani skirt.

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.897
"It's 9 inches above the knee,

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.965
"which is not appropriate
for the character.

00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:22.668
"So I'm going to go to Armani
I Beverly Hills,

00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:24.870
"and I'm going to have them
alter it for me.

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:27.206
They know me.
They'll do it."

00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:28.841
And I'm like, "Faye, you're"--

00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:30.509
like, I'm realizing a couple
things.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:33.879
One, Faye's got a touch of the
bat shits.

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:39.018
[laughter]

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.986
And two, like, I don't care.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.521
I'm undeterred.
I want to help.

00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:43.656
I'm still a fan.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.057
I love crazy.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.659
I want her to get this part.

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.395
So I realize she needs a little
tough love.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:52.231
So I go, "Faye, you don't have
time to drive to fucking

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:55.200
"Beverly Hills for a fitting
with Armani

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:58.537
"and then drive all the way to
Universal in the Valley.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.673
You're never gonna make it.
You can't do it."

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.508
"What are your suggestions?"

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:04.510
"Well, Faye, why don't you just
wear that black mini skirt,

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.378
"and if it's too tight and too
short for you,

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:09.548
throw on some black leotards,
and you'll be fine."

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:10.716
She goes, "Perfect."

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:11.717
Click. [imitates dial tone]

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.385
And I'm like...

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:15.220
so I just--now I know just to
wait by the phone,

00:09:15.253 --> 00:09:17.957
and a couple minutes later,
phone rings.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.224
I just go, "Yes, Faye, what is
it?"

00:09:19.257 --> 00:09:20.893
"Maybe you are psychic."

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:23.529
[laughter]

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:25.698
And I go, "I knew you were
gonna say that."

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.966
And she goes, "Really?"

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.300
And I go, "No, I'm joking."

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.803
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
You're brilliant."

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:33.238
[laughter]

00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.307
"I was thinking about my hair.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.709
"I just want to put it up in a
bun,

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.143
because time is ticking."

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.578
And I said, "Well, Faye, that's
fine.

00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:40.746
"Go ahead. Put your hair in a
bun.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:42.247
Feel comfortable."

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.049
"But since you're playing an
alcoholic,

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:45.951
"why don't you pull a couple of
strands of hair just loose

00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:47.987
"so that it gives you--
it reminds you

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.755
"of the mayhem that's going on

00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:52.257
inside your character's heart
and soul?"

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.460
"Perfect."
[imitates dial tone]

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.261
Hangs up.

00:09:56.294 --> 00:09:58.764
So now at this point,
it's, like, 11:30.

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.300
And I'd been working on this
thing since midnight,

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:03.268
and I'm realizing I'm never
gonna--

00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:05.938
I'm not gonna meet with her.
and I'm not gonna get paid,

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.973
like, I'm basically
working for free,

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:11.110
and I needed the money so bad
that again, remember,

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.578
this was calling me.

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.179
[laughter]

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:15.748
And I start to get mad at her,

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.449
but then I think, you know,
I don't know,

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:20.452
maybe the payment is not
in the form of money.

00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:22.588
Maybe it's in the form
of this story.

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.124
And maybe someday,
20 years from now,

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:28.627
I can tell this story
in a strip club....

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.597
[laughter]

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.667
[applause]

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:43.042
For slightly less than the $25
an hour

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.810
I would have got than...

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:46.979
[laughter]

00:10:47.012 --> 00:10:49.548
Anyway, the phone rings again.
It's right before noon.

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:52.151
And I can tell by the--
"This is Faye Dunaway."

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.353
I'm like, "Faye, no need.
I got it."

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:56.822
And I can tell by the sound,
she is in her car.

00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:58.157
She's on speakerphone.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.858
All of her windows are down.

00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:01.660
And I can hear traffic.

00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:04.797
And she's like, "I am right
outside of Universal Studios.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.366
"I want you to go over the
lines with me one more time.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.401
Do the lines, Michael."

00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:11.637
So I'm like, "All right," and
what you have to remember now,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.307
it's noon on a Friday lunch
hour rush.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.243
And Faye Dunaway is driving a
car,

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:21.080
talking on speakerphone,
and holding a script,

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:24.016
and reading four different
parts

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:25.684
with me on speaker.

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:28.554
So, "Do the lines!"
And I do a couple of lines.

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:30.656
"Oh, my, ha-ha-ha, that's..."

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:34.893
Suddenly I hear a tire screech,
a horn go off...

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:36.762
[imitates horn honking]

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.731
And then you hear her go, "I am
on the right side of the road.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:43.235
"You're on the wrong side of
the road, sir.

00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:44.770
Michael, do the lines."

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:46.872
And I'm, like--like, the
tension's starting to

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:49.675
really pick up, and so I'm
doing the lines.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.710
And it's time for her to now do
her line,

00:11:51.743 --> 00:11:56.348
and she goes,
"I'm Faye Dunaway."

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.684
And I was like, "Is this it?
Did she have her break?"

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.753
Like,
is it a psychotic break

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:05.557
where she's just starting at
the beginning of her existence?

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.460
Like, so I wanted to help her,
and I was like,

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:12.731
"Yes, yes, Faye,
you are Faye Dunaway, yes."

00:12:12.764 --> 00:12:14.900
And then I realize
she's not talking to me.

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:16.802
She's talking to the guy at the
guard gate.

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:19.571
He's like, "Yes, Ms. Dunaway,
we were expecting you.

00:12:19.604 --> 00:12:21.640
"All you have to do is make a
left-hand turn,

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.809
"follow the blue line
along the river,

00:12:23.842 --> 00:12:26.912
and it will take you to a Cape
Cod-style bungalow."

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:28.614
She says, "Thank you."

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:32.217
We start to turn, she goes,
"Michael, do the lines!"

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.787
I start doing the lines,
she's, "Oh, my goodness.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.423
"Michael, you should get this
part instead of me.

00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:40.626
"You're absolutely wonderful.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.294
God damn it!"

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:44.596
And I go, "What--what's wrong?"

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:49.768
And she goes, "I am behind a
Universal Studios tour tram."

00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:52.337
[laughter]

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.007
And she's honking on her horn,
and she's,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.441
"I'm going around.

00:12:56.474 --> 00:12:59.511
"I'm going--I'm going to go
around.

00:12:59.544 --> 00:13:01.847
Michael, do the lines."

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.649
[laughter]

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:07.019
And I can just imagine, like,
the luckiest tour group

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.121
in the world with their
cameras,

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:10.823
and they see Faye Dunaway,
like,

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:14.259
blasting past them with the--
flipping the bird

00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:17.162
"doing the lines."

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:20.432
[laughter]

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:23.535
We get--we get through that,
and I'm finishing up,

00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:26.205
and I forgot to mention that
she gave me originally

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:27.673
one script that was different.

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.541
There were different versions.

00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:31.977
Hers and mine were different,
and mine had a scene

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.812
that ended earlier than hers.

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:37.649
So I finish my last line,
and she goes,

00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:39.351
"And?"

00:13:39.384 --> 00:13:42.321
I go, "Well, that's the end
of the scene."

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.223
"There's more."

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.557
I go, "No, Faye, remember,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.560
"you have a longer scene
than I do,

00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:51.964
"but mine was shorter,
and it's the later draft,

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.532
so you don't need to know
any of that."

00:13:53.565 --> 00:13:55.300
"Well, that was for subtext!

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:56.735
"It helps for subtext!

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:58.570
"I cannot believe
you did not write down

00:13:58.603 --> 00:14:00.305
"all of these things
and make notes!

00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:01.974
"I thought you were
a professional, Michael!

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:06.545
I cannot believe I trusted you
and you've let me down!"

00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:10.349
She just starts making
noises of rage.

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:12.351
It's tears. It's rage.

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.386
It's--there's animal sounds.

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:16.889
Like, I'm--I'm terrified.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.523
Like, I--I'm totally safe.

00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:20.025
I'm in my apartment in the
Valley.

00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:22.561
I could just hang up, but I
was, like--

00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:24.596
it was like a horror movie;
I was just frozen, like,

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.432
"What do I...what do I...
what do I do?

00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:30.202
I'm so...I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry."

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:31.837
I barely could get
anything out.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.438
And then she goes,
"Quiet.

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.674
I found the bungalow."

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:37.910
And I'm like--was expecting the
little...

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:39.211
[imitates dial tone]

00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:40.545
But I didn't.
She's keeping me.

00:14:40.578 --> 00:14:42.447
And I'm not sure why.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.717
And so--especially after I
disappointed her so.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.387
So she opens the car door,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.555
and you hear the pling-pling,
pling-pling,

00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:53.058
like your "car door open" and
your keys are still there

00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:54.226
kind of thing.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.394
And I hear a man's voice...

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:57.229
[mumbling indistinctly]

00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:59.898
And then I hear her go, "I know
it's not my parking space,

00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:02.067
but I won't be long."

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.403
And the guy just goes, "Oh,
okay," like...

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:06.038
[laughter]

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.572
And so then I can hear Faye.

00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:09.207
She's just breathing.
I'm still there.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.409
I don't know what to do.

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:12.577
She sits back down in her car.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.747
And she's just breathing,
and she goes,

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.583
"Michael,
are you there?"

00:15:18.616 --> 00:15:20.152
I said, "Yes, I'm here, Faye.

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.586
What--what can I do for you?"

00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:23.989
And she goes,
"I'm just so frustrated.

00:15:24.022 --> 00:15:26.391
"I've been let down
so many times,

00:15:26.424 --> 00:15:30.128
"and I'm so frustrated,
and now I cannot do the comedy.

00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:33.999
I cannot do the comedy,
and I don't know what to do."

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:37.235
And I, it was at that point,
I, like, I got her.

00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:39.938
Like, auditions are horrifying.

00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:41.340
They're embarrassing.

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:42.774
They're nerve-racking.

00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:44.743
You're putting yourself on the
line.

00:15:44.776 --> 00:15:46.511
And, I mean, that's--for me,
is, like,

00:15:46.544 --> 00:15:47.946
as a shitty little actor in an
improv troupe.

00:15:47.979 --> 00:15:50.682
This is Faye Dunaway,
Oscar winner,

00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:53.118
having to audition for a part.

00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:54.853
Of course she's frustrated.

00:15:54.886 --> 00:15:57.622
So I just--I decided I'd get
into her head

00:15:57.655 --> 00:15:58.957
and help her out, and I said,

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.659
"Faye, I know you're
frustrated.

00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:02.594
"You have every right to be
frustrated.

00:16:02.627 --> 00:16:06.698
"And what is an alcoholic

00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:08.800
"but a frustrated person?

00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:12.137
"I want you to use all of your
frustration,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.672
"and I want you to go in there

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:17.342
and turn that into your
character."

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:20.045
And she goes, "Brilliant."

00:16:20.078 --> 00:16:22.214
And I thought I was gonna...
[imitates dial tone]

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:24.182
But I still didn't get it.
She was still there.

00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:26.651
And I could hear her undoing
makeup and, you know, like,

00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:28.854
clicking and unclicking
lipstick

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:31.656
and all kinds of things, and I
just imagined her

00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:33.892
looking at herself in that
little rearview mirror,

00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:35.727
and she goes,
"Michael, before I go in,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.830
do you have any last words
of advice?"

00:16:38.863 --> 00:16:41.066
And I go, "Yeah, I do,
actually.

00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:44.803
"I want you to remember,
when you walk into that room,

00:16:44.836 --> 00:16:49.574
that you are fucking
Faye Dunaway."

00:16:49.607 --> 00:16:51.476
- Yeah.
- And...

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:54.713
[cheers and applause]

00:16:58.383 --> 00:17:01.486
And her response was,
"Thank you."

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:04.189
[imitates dial tone]

00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:06.691
Thank you all very much.
