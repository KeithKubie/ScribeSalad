00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.800
I had a couple requests on reviewing
certain things, so I'm gonna do a few.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.427
I just picked a few examples that I'll
talk about, but if in the meantime you

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:14.641
think of anything else you want to ask,
then ask at any point, okay?

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:22.495
So first, here's kind of a famous example
that I wanted to go through anyway,

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:29.290
which is good review of geometric
distribution and expectations.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.125
Then we will talk more about
the universality of the uniform,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:38.590
since that's the number one request, okay.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.765
But first, let's do a problem
called the coupon collector.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.470
I think a couple of the sections
did this problem or

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.280
something similar, but
not all of them definitely.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790
This is a really good example.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.720
It happens to be very
useful in a lot of cases.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.264
I think of it as the toy collector
problem cuz I don't collect coupons.

00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:10.950
Well, I don't really collect toys either.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.110
But I'd rather collect toys than coupons.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
The problem is that you have a certain
number of different types of toys and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.982
you want to collect a full set.

00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:22.520
And it's one of these
Happy Meal type of things,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.440
where you buy a Happy Meal at McDonald's
or whatever, and you get a random toy, and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.130
you want the full set, right?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.740
That's the problem.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.960
The problem is, on average, how long will
it take you to collect the full set, okay?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.017
So we have a certain number of toys,
let's say, n toy types.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.123
I say type just because, to distinguish
between the individual toys,

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:51.747
you might get seven of the same toy,
right, but I mean,

00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:55.700
seven of the same type, but
seven physical objects.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.900
So there are n types and
we'll assume that they're equally likely.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.755
Now, in practice they probably will make
one really hard to find so that then

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:09.032
people go berserk, going on eBay and stuff
trying to track down the one hard one, but

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:11.990
we'll assume right now
they're equally likely.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.310
Problem gets very,
very messy if they're not equally likely.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.468
Like, really, really tedious,
long calculations, you'd go on for pages.

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:24.053
So it's certainly not something
you would need to worry about for

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:28.801
an exam in this course because
the problems that you'll have to deal

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:32.159
with should have very short,
nice solutions.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.220
And it gets really nasty if
the probabilities are unequal.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.650
But in this case it
works out really nicely.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.190
So the question is find the expected
time to collect a full set, where

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.580
time is just measured discretely in terms
of how many toys you need to buy, right?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.800
Expected time, i.e., number of toys,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.610
Until you have a complete set.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.473
And if you think of breaking up
this random variable into smaller

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:15.118
random variables, then it's easy
to think about how to do this.

00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:20.010
So if we call this T, for time and
T for toys, we want to know the,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.420
T is the number of toys that we
need to collect to get a full set.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.796
Let's think of just breaking
down T into components.

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:33.765
So it's T1+T2+ blah blah

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:37.745
blah, +Tn where T1,

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.800
Equals time until first new toy.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.773
By new,
I mean a toy that we didn't already have.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.540
Well, that's actually equal to 1,
cuz the first one you get,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.060
that's your first toy, and you didn't
already have it, obviously, okay?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.230
So T1 is actually just a constant,
always equal to 1.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.395
Now T2,
after you've collected your first toy,

00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:08.360
if you're unlucky the second toy
is the same as the first toy.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.740
But most of the time you get something
new on the second try, okay?

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.540
So T2 is the additional time
until your second new toy.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.710
So, new just means one you didn't already
collect earlier in the process, so

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.175
additional time until second new toy.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.150
And then T3 is same thing
until the third and so on.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.010
So additional time after the second.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.020
That is, collect, collect, collect till
you get your second toy, collect, collect,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.270
collect till you get the third, and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.800
keep going like that until
you have all of them.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.900
So all the way up to Tn, okay?

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.529
Then notice that T1 is just equal to 1,

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.860
but T2, let's think about T2.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.010
So there are n different toy types and
we have 1 out of the n, so there's an n

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.990
minus 1 over n chance that the next
one is gonna be something new, right?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.690
That, so we'd consider that a success.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.140
So the success probability
is n minus 1 over n.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.480
On the other hand, with probability 1
over n, we get a failure in the sense of

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.270
collecting a toy we already had and
then it's the same problem again.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.164
So therefore T2- 1 is geometric with

00:05:35.164 --> 00:05:39.920
probability of success n -1 over n.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.310
The minus 1 is just because of
the convention about the geometric,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.020
that we're taking the convention
that the geometric starts at 0.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.310
But of course, you need at least one more
new toy, so I'm subtracting off that 1.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.344
And in general, Tj-1

00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:03.384
is gonna be geometric.

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:08.680
So Tj, we're trying to get the jth toy,
right?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.669
That means that we already have
collected j minus 1 toys, so

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.162
it's going to be n minus the number we've
already collected, which is j minus 1.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.720
So they're all geometrics.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.850
Then we can immediately
write down the answer.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.540
In this case,
these Ts are independent, but

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.580
linearity would hold even
if these were dependent.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.960
Here they're independent because, right,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.870
it's just like how long does it
take to get your second new toy,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.240
but has nothing to do with telling
you the additional time, right.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.877
But even if they were not independent,
it would still be true

00:06:48.877 --> 00:06:54.332
that E(T) equals the sum
E(T1) + E (T2) + E of Tn.

00:06:54.332 --> 00:06:59.191
And just to simplify that,
write out what that is.

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:04.079
So that's E(T) equals,

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:08.546
so E(T1) is just one.

00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:12.777
E(T2), well we talked about
the fact that if you have

00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:16.739
a geometric starting at 1
then the mean is 1 over P,

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:21.620
cuz that's Q over P plus 1,
because we're adding back the 1.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.470
So the next one is just gonna be
the reciprocal of this which is

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.590
n over n minus 1.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.330
And then the next one is
gonna be n over n minus 2,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.710
and so on.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.820
And then for the last term, that means
that we have n- 1 out of the n types.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:47.700
Then our probability of success
is only 1 over n, right?

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.360
So for the last one, it's n.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.100
Let's just write this as n over 1.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.130
Then we can factor out n.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.675
So this is really just n times, and

00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:02.205
I'll reverse the order of terms just to
make it look nicer, it's n times one-half.

00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:07.060
1 plus one-half plus one-third,
plus blah, blah, blah, plus 1 over n.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.580
So that's called the n harmonic sum.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.100
That looks like the harmonic series.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:18.360
This is approximately n log n for large n.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.410
That's just a useful fact about the
harmonic series that we can approximate

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.840
it as logarithmic.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.760
But, in general for
a midterm and homework and

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.520
stuff, you should give exact answers
unless you're asked for an approximation.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.470
So this would be the exact answer, but

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.760
this would be a handy approximation for
large N.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.430
So we just used linearity and
geometrics here.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.780
Sounds like it could have been a hard
problem, but you break it up into

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.710
pieces like that, use linearity, and
then it becomes an easy problem.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.560
Okay, so let's talk a little more about

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.890
the universality stuff, and
there's always questions about.

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:09.430
So I just wanna draw a little picture and

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.170
do a quick example to show more
about what's going on with that.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.150
So first here's a picture.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.450
So we're talking in the continuous case.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.400
So we have an x and F of x.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.980
Just imagine drawing a CDF and
remember CDFs,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.360
you know, they have to be increasing and
right continuous but for universality,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.000
we're assuming that it's strictly
increasing and it's continuous.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.900
So let's draw some kind of CDF,
maybe it looks like that.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.410
And either it hits one and

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.260
then it would stay one forever, or
it just asymptotically approaches one.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.090
Either way is fine.

00:09:55.908 --> 00:10:01.710
But just to have like a picture in mind
of what's universality really saying.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:07.230
What it says is, for
example, what if we chose

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.590
a random, this is lower case x,
this is just the x-axis.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:20.310
But what if we chose a point
on the x-axis randomly.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.990
So the question is basically,
let X be distributed according to F.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.830
So X is the random variable.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.930
F is this curve, this CDF.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.260
And the claim is that when you plug X,
this is one-half of the universality.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.640
Remember, we talked about two
parts which are equivalent.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.900
So just talked about
one of them right now.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.640
We said that if we plug X into
its own CDF, we'll get a uniform.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.200
So I just wanna explain using
this picture, why is that true?

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.490
I think the easiest way to think of it is
just to make it a little bit more concrete

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.920
and pick a certain number here.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.240
Let's say let's pick a number
on the vertical, so here's 1.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.700
And maybe it hits 1, and
then it would stay at 1 forever.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.890
Now let's pick some other
number on the vertical axis.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:16.180
Let's say, here is one-third,
I just picked a y value of one-third.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:23.340
And suppose that I ask the question,
let's call this point here x sub zero.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.040
So, x0 is the point such that
F of x0 equals one-third.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.350
That's the, you know,
just inverse of a function.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.980
So, in other words, I'm just saying,
I'm just making up, for

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.220
some reason it looks really abstract
at first, but I found that if I

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.390
make up a number like one-third
it's easier to see what's going on.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.700
So you could have chosen any number
between 0 and 1, but I picked one-third.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.003
So I assume that F of x0 equals 1/3.

00:11:49.003 --> 00:11:53.790
Now I want to know what's the probability

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.450
that F of X, that's a random variable.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.530
Cuz we're plugging this random
variable into its own CDF.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.540
We wanna know what's the probability that
this is less than or equal to 1/3, where.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.420
So the interpretation of this F of X is,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.670
we first pick a random value on the x-axis
according to this distribution.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.350
This distribution is telling us how
do we select the random x value, and

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.130
then we compute the corresponding
y value which is F of x.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.800
So that's how we compute F of X.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.750
But notice that that's true exactly, so

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.890
I'm picking a random point here,
somewhere on this x axis I'm saying,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.840
when is it true that the y value is
less than or equal to one-third?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.800
Well, that's the same thing as
saying that the x value has to be

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.600
between here and here.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.220
Because if x were to the right and
I go up, here it's bigger than a third.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.585
And I said less than or
equal to one-third.

00:12:51.585 --> 00:12:57.540
That's the exact same thing as saying
X is less than or equal to this x0,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.265
but by definition of the CDF,
that's F of x0 equals 1/3.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.836
And there was nothing special about
one-third here, you could do this for

00:13:07.836 --> 00:13:10.500
whatever number you want between 0 and 1.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.390
That's the uniform distribution.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.850
The uniform distribution is saying that
probability is proportional to length.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:24.610
And for the uniform 0,1 probability is
length within that interval 0 to 1.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.110
So that's what we just verified.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.020
That one-third became one-third.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.275
So all this is saying is that the claim is

00:13:35.275 --> 00:13:40.545
that F of X is uniform between 0 and 1.

00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:44.434
And if you do the same calculation
with any number here instead of

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:48.080
1/3 any number between 0 and
1, same thing holds.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.170
So that's what it's saying geometrically.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.020
We are just relating random
points on the x axis to figuring

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.960
a random value vertically between 0 and 1.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.960
And as a quick example of
how you might use that.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:09.250
Suppose you wanted to simulate
from a logistics distribution.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.610
We haven't defined
logistics distribution yet.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.300
But I'll just tell you
what it is right now.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.840
The logistic distribution,

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.800
which is another important
distribution in statistics.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.090
That it's used in what's called logistic
regression for example which is very,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:33.430
very widely used method in economics and
statistics and elsewhere.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.032
It's based on the logistic distribution
which has the following CDF,

00:14:36.032 --> 00:14:37.604
F of x equals e to the x
over 1 plus e to the x.

00:14:37.604 --> 00:14:42.980
This is for all real x.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.800
For practice with CDFs you can
verify that this is a valid CDF.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.370
There's three properties it's continuous,
increasing, and so on.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.040
You should check for

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.260
yourself that this function I wrote
down does have the properties of a CDF.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.630
So that's a valid CDF but
that doesn't tell us how we could ever

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.620
simulate random variables
that have that CDF.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.050
And if we want to do that,
an easy way to do it would be,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.923
let U be uniform zero one,
which is easy to simulate, and

00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:23.450
then consider just doing f inverse of u.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.860
So if you set this thing equal to u and

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.700
then this is u in terms of x but
solve for x in terms of u just

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.820
by doing the inverse just a little
bit of algebra to get the inverse.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:42.690
What you'll get is this function
log of u over 1 minus u.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.590
So that's just the inverse evaluated at u.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:51.590
Just do the algebra, compute the inverse
of this and that's what you'll get.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.190
So that will be interpreted as the log of
the odds basically, if you think of this.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:01.240
If u were just a probability between 0 and
1 that would be the log of the odds.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.670
But in this case,
u is a random variable, so

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.120
we plugged it into its inverse CDF,
and then that would be logistic.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.190
So if you just computed this thing,

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.650
then you would have a random draw
from the logistic distribution.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.141
Now if you wanted, you can check that
that's true just by taking this thing, and

00:16:19.141 --> 00:16:21.129
just compute directly its CDF.

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:24.268
Use the definition of CDF and
you'll get this, but

00:16:24.268 --> 00:16:28.360
it's easier to recognize that
that's really why it's working.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:36.589
Okay, so are there more questions
that you've thought of since before?

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:45.070
I have a few more examples that I
thought of, and things to talk about.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.739
But anyway, let me know if you
think of any other questions.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.420
I wanna do something more
with symmetry and linearity,

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.420
so here's just a fun little
symmetry problem I made up.

00:17:02.986 --> 00:17:07.325
So let X, Y, Z, this is just
good practice with linearity and

00:17:07.325 --> 00:17:12.320
symmetry, and what does IID actually mean,
things like that.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.030
So let's Let X, Y and

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.380
Z be IID, positive random variables.

00:17:22.368 --> 00:17:30.235
And the problem is,
find the expected value of (X/X+Y+Z).

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.410
Okay, now, you can't do linearity
on a quotient, you can't just say

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.260
that this is E of the top over E of
the bottom, or anything like that.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.950
That's not linearity, you can't do
things like that, linearity is for sums.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.150
Okay, so at first it looks like kind
of a mysterious problem, maybe.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:57.748
We haven't really dealt much with
quotients of random variables.

00:17:57.748 --> 00:18:04.049
And I didn't give you any
explicit formula for the CDF or

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:10.900
the PDF, I didn't say if they
were discrete or continuous.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.252
I just said they are IID positive random
variables, I only said they're positive

00:18:15.252 --> 00:18:19.380
just so that we don't have to
worry about dividing by 0.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.990
No other assumptions, so
this is very general, okay.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:29.820
To solve this, we just need to
see the symmetry of the problem.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.300
The symmetry is that we have
three IID random variables, okay.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.270
And we took one of them divided
by the sum of all three of them.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:45.961
But by symmetry, that has to be the same
as E of (Y over (X + Y + Z)), right?

00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:50.070
Because I could have listed
these in a different order,

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.560
and it would have been the same problem,
right?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.572
It's completely symmetrical
because they're IID,

00:18:56.572 --> 00:19:00.160
so maybe I should have written Y+X+Z,
but that's the same thing.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.290
Right, it doesn't matter what
order you add them in, so

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.600
that's the exact same thing by symmetry.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.730
Similarly, that's the exact same
thing as E(Z over (X + Y + Z)).

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:15.610
So whatever this quantity is,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.730
it doesn't matter which way we write it,
because they're IID.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.940
I'm not saying X = Y, I'm just saying this
problem, if I'd asked you this problem.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.800
That is the same structure
as this problem,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.180
it has the same structure of this problem.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.363
It must be the same thing by symmetry,

00:19:32.363 --> 00:19:36.299
so these two steps are by symmetry.

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:41.948
Okay, well now,
I have these three different expectations,

00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:45.572
and that makes me think of adding them and

00:19:45.572 --> 00:19:51.160
using linearity, so
what if we added these three things?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.056
So if we added them, they would be E(X

00:19:56.056 --> 00:20:01.105
over (X + Y + Z)) + E(Y over (X + Y

00:20:01.105 --> 00:20:06.008
+ Z)) + E(Z over (X + Y + Z)).

00:20:06.008 --> 00:20:13.080
Oops, X over, sorry, this is Z over
X + Y + Z, and then use linearity.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:23.326
By linearity, that's just E(((X
+ Y + Z) over (X + Y + Z)),

00:20:23.326 --> 00:20:30.001
okay, now that's a very easy problem,
expected value of 1 is 1.

00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:34.520
But on the other hand,
this is the same thing added three times.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:43.050
So 3 times this thing is 1, so that tells
us that the thing we want is one-third.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:48.460
It's basically immediate by symmetry and
linearity.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:55.343
And I think intuitively, this seems
like a very kind of general thing,

00:20:55.343 --> 00:20:57.682
like how did that always work?

00:20:57.682 --> 00:21:00.660
But if you think about this,
that's a pretty intuitive answer,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.680
that would have been a good guess.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.470
If you had done this and
gotten like 4 as your answer,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.334
you should immediately know
that that would be wrong.

00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:12.220
Because the denominator is
a number between 0 and 1.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.050
The denominator is bigger than
the numerator, I said they're positive, so

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.361
it has to be something between 0 and 1.

00:21:17.361 --> 00:21:21.726
One/third makes sense because if I asked
you just intuitively, we have three

00:21:21.726 --> 00:21:26.105
things, and how much would you guess
that one thing contributes to the total?

00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:29.019
One out of three things,
you would guess one-third, so

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:31.030
it's just a pretty intuitive answer.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.576
But that's not a proof,
and this is a proof, so

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:39.381
that's just an example of symmetry,
linearity, that stuff.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.242
Another thing we should talk
a little more about is LOTUS,

00:21:46.242 --> 00:21:49.860
cuz LOTUS is something that looks very,
very simple.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.569
But students may make
mistakes a lot with it, so

00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:59.180
here's a simple LOTUS
example that I made up.

00:22:06.948 --> 00:22:10.640
So here's the problem,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:21.427
The problem is, let U be uniform 0,1,

00:22:21.427 --> 00:22:26.167
and let X equal U squared, and

00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:29.590
let Y equal e to the X.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:35.514
Is that what I want, yep, e to the X,
and the problem is to find the expected

00:22:35.514 --> 00:22:42.990
value of Y, As an integral.

00:22:46.585 --> 00:22:51.289
In general, on the midterm,
I'll be very clear about,

00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:56.500
you might have a hard integral
that you wouldn't have to do.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.746
I would say leave it as
an integral in that case.

00:22:58.746 --> 00:23:03.555
Or if it's stated that you should
actually compute the thing.

00:23:03.555 --> 00:23:06.311
So basically I'll say whether it should
be left as a sum or an integral, or

00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:08.007
if it doesn't say,
leave it as an integral.

00:23:08.007 --> 00:23:12.405
Then you should get an actual number,
and fully simplify everything.

00:23:12.405 --> 00:23:17.015
Okay so in this case, suppose I said
find this as an integral, well,

00:23:17.015 --> 00:23:23.120
it's clearly a LOTUS problem, and
there's two approaches you could take.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.330
But a lot of students in previous
years have kind of mixed up

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.380
the different approaches.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.990
And it's kinda for an interesting
reason that I wanted to tell you about.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:39.270
So one approach would be to say E(Y),
so we want expected value of Y.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.143
Well, that just looks like
an easy LOTUS problem,

00:23:43.143 --> 00:23:47.210
right, so E(Y) equals,
LOTUS says we integrate.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:53.660
We'll just change capital
X to lowercase x, so

00:23:53.660 --> 00:24:00.600
we go e to the x,
times the PDF of x, f(x) dx.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.270
And we need the limits of integrations for
x, so u is between 0 and

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.580
1 so x is also 0 to 1, cuz you're
squaring a number between 0 and 1.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.749
And so you get that, so
I mean this is correct,

00:24:14.749 --> 00:24:17.673
where this is the PDF of x.

00:24:17.673 --> 00:24:20.467
I mean this is true but
this would not, you know,

00:24:20.467 --> 00:24:24.367
this is not the full answer because
you haven't said what's f of x.

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:25.470
I haven't said what's f of x.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.070
I mean, I said it's the PDF of x,
but what's the PDF of x?

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.530
So if I say write it as an integral,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.670
it should be like an actual integral where
you're saying what you're integrating.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.250
Here we just said that's the PDF,
what's the PDF?

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:42.130
Okay, so at this point you could find

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.400
the CDF of x and
then take the derivative and get the PDF.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.050
That's similar to the problem that
you just had on the homework.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.240
Slightly easier here.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.410
You had the homework problem about
uniform between minus one and one, okay?

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.929
This is a little bit easier, cuz you
don't have to deal with negative numbers.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.630
So you could find the CDF and
then find the PDF and plug that in.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.249
And that would be perfectly valid but

00:25:05.249 --> 00:25:10.508
that'll be more work versus
doing it the better way.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.630
The better way is to think of it.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.830
Y equals e to the x is a function of x,

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.920
but x in turn is a function of u.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:36.980
So I could also write this as e to the u
squared and do the LOTUS this way.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.270
So if I did it this way,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:45.160
then I would just say it's the integral
zero to one e to the u squared du.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.990
Because we know that the PDF of
u is just one on this integral.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.520
So if I did it this way, I can write down
the answer in like one minute, right.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.534
This way, then you have to
do a separate calculation.

00:25:59.534 --> 00:26:06.780
Now, I mean, I'm saying better just for
writing down the integral immediately.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.950
Not necessarily better for
solving the integral.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.215
If we wanted to get a number then
that kind of looks like the Gaussian

00:26:13.215 --> 00:26:16.525
integral again,
except without a minus there, okay.

00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:19.495
But the problem just says
leave it as an integral,

00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:22.055
then this I could just
write down instantly.

00:26:22.055 --> 00:26:24.240
And here we have to first find the PDF.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.520
Both of these are correct though, so

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.700
you get full credit either way as
long as if you did either of these as

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.580
long as you actually worked out explicitly
what the PDF is, that's perfectly fine.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.300
Where you'd run into trouble though,
a lot of students had trouble and

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.386
this kind of thing.

00:26:38.386 --> 00:26:43.155
But somehow like mixing and matching
with these two things, somehow I think

00:26:43.155 --> 00:26:47.924
there's a mindset that just because we
define LOTUS and we called our random

00:26:47.924 --> 00:26:52.345
variable x and we looked at functions
of x that some how it depends on x.

00:26:52.345 --> 00:26:56.260
And then if we add another LOTUS problem
where I don't even mention X and

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.620
then there's gonna be a lot
of answers where x's appear.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.390
Well, what's x, right?

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.519
So the important thing is the pattern
not what you call the variables.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.399
So, okay, well anyway,
that's just some comments about lotus.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.594
Other questions on anything?

00:27:24.077 --> 00:27:24.924
Yeah.

00:27:24.924 --> 00:27:25.424
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:25.424 --> 00:27:28.774
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:28.774 --> 00:27:30.260
&gt;&gt; How do you find the PDF?

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.570
Yeah, so let's do that as quick practice,
not only with PDFs but with CDFs.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.910
Okay, so, first find the CDF.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:44.720
So, the CDF is the problem that u squared
is less than or equal to some number x.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.730
That's x, but
I'm trying to reduce it back to you.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.410
So the CDF would be this.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.730
And as I said, it's kinda similar
to your homework, but easier,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.830
because here we don't have to
worry about negative numbers.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.540
So just take the square
root of both sides.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:04.798
That's just the square root
of x if x is between 0 and 1.

00:28:04.798 --> 00:28:09.783
That's the CDF,
the derivative is the PDF is just gonna be

00:28:09.783 --> 00:28:15.404
one-half x to the minus one-half,
again x is between 0 and 1.

00:28:15.404 --> 00:28:18.110
So we get the CDF take the derivative and
get the PDF.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.930
To get the CDF, all we have to really
do is understand what a CDF is and

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.768
then reduce it back to the uniform
which is something we understand.

00:28:26.768 --> 00:28:30.988
Okay, other questions?

00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:41.941
Okay, so I wanted to do a quick
example of a story type of proof,

00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:45.865
just to review that a little bit.

00:28:45.865 --> 00:28:50.560
[SOUND] This is a very simple one but,
But I think it's

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:56.580
interesting, Just as quick practice,
right?

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:04.441
So quick story practice,
if we let x be binomial (n,p) and

00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:12.452
the problem is find
the distribution Of n- x.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:24.579
Well, one way to do it this is
quick practice with PMFs would be,

00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:28.500
n- x is discrete let's find its PMF.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.410
Well, it's PMF is the probability
that n- x is some number k,

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.080
but let's just rewrite that as
the probability that x is n minus k.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:43.290
Those are the same events now
we've reduced it back to x.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:47.864
Probability that x = n- k,
that's just from the binomial PMF and

00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:49.190
choose n minus k.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.800
P to the n- k.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:58.140
q, q = 1- p, again,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.220
q to the k, right?

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.590
So that was easy, but
a nicer way to write that

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:13.610
would be n choose k,
q to the k, p to the n- k.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.997
So that would be the PMF method.

00:30:21.397 --> 00:30:26.617
Remember that n choose n- k, is n choose
k which you can prove easily by using

00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:31.940
factorials or just by the story, picking
k is the same a picking n- k, okay.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.804
But a simpler way,
not that this is difficult but

00:30:37.804 --> 00:30:43.667
an even easier way to see
this is using the story,

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:50.405
we can immediately say that
n- x is binomial ( n,q).

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.010
Just by interchanging successes and
failures.

00:30:57.202 --> 00:31:04.620
Okay, so the story is that x is the number
of successes in n, IID Bernoulli P trials.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.550
So x is the number of successes then
obviously n- x is the number of failures.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.480
Okay, but we said repeatedly that you're
gonna find success and failure however

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.040
you want as long as each trial is either
success or failure, but not both.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.520
So if we redefine success
to be failure and

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.710
redefine failure to be success,
then that's immediate.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.640
So, I'll just call that
swapping success and failure.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.030
Because you define it however you want,
right?

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.680
So we could redefine it the other way
around and then that's immediate.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.080
So, no calculation whatsoever,
just one line.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.100
Just swap success and
failure and that's it.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.340
So swap success and failure and

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.230
I hope that none of you have
to do that on the exam.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.610
But I think it's good practice.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.960
Now, [COUGH] okay.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.440
So we haven't done any Poissons yet
today, so

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.215
there's a Poisson example that I think
that is also a good practice question.

00:31:59.215 --> 00:32:05.841
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:09.396
the question is whether on the midterm
there may be questions where you

00:32:09.396 --> 00:32:12.005
can just write things down in one line,
and yeah.

00:32:12.005 --> 00:32:15.625
There's a good chance that you'd
have to write something, right.

00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:19.925
But there may be several things
where you just write one line or

00:32:19.925 --> 00:32:23.055
one sentence of explanation
because you see the story or

00:32:23.055 --> 00:32:27.455
the pattern or the structure like
one sentence of what's going on.

00:32:27.455 --> 00:32:28.775
You know, like this.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.660
I mean this would be,

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.260
I mean just writing this immediately
then it doesn't say how he got there.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.485
By saying we're interswapping success and
failure, that's a sentence and

00:32:38.485 --> 00:32:41.090
there's a good chance
of something like that.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:46.115
Which would save you some time,
that that's part of the point.

00:32:46.115 --> 00:32:51.680
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Do you get extra credit for

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.690
writing, it's immediately obvious?

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.790
Don't waste time writing it
as is immediately obvious.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.640
You've ought to conserve time,
time is precious.

00:33:02.749 --> 00:33:06.270
Yeah, so let's do a Poisson problem.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.730
So here's the problem.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.040
Suppose that the number of,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.080
this is just an example that I like,
suppose that the number of

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:25.060
emails that I get, in a time interval

00:33:28.246 --> 00:33:31.408
Of length t, let's just say time t,

00:33:31.408 --> 00:33:37.310
is distributed as Poisson of lambda t or
a lambda of some constant.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:42.097
So we're thinking of lambda as a rate,
rate times time,

00:33:42.097 --> 00:33:46.983
right, so if I get say 20 emails
per hour times the number

00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:51.900
of hours then that would be
the expected number of emails.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.199
Remember that this is lambda
t is both the mean and

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:58.180
the variance of this distribution, okay.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.067
So it's a random variable because
in different intervals of length t,

00:34:02.067 --> 00:34:06.080
I mean I may, I'm not always gonna get
exactly the same number of emails so

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.446
there's some distribution to it, okay.

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:13.249
Now the problem is find
the PDF of T which we

00:34:13.249 --> 00:34:18.189
define as the time of
the first email like,

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:22.306
let's say right now it's time 0,

00:34:22.306 --> 00:34:27.953
starting now what time
will my first email come?

00:34:30.503 --> 00:34:33.100
So that's in continuous, right?

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.370
That's a continuous time problem, right?

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.600
Because the emails could arrive
at any time in continuous time

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.090
where as this is discrete because I'm
counting the number of emails, okay.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:48.189
So this is kind of neat because
it just connecting discrete and

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:52.021
continuous and well,
let's see how to do it.

00:34:52.021 --> 00:34:56.774
So find the PDF or the CDF, once we have
the CDF just take the derivative, so

00:34:56.774 --> 00:34:59.641
I would normally say
find the distribution or

00:34:59.641 --> 00:35:03.800
find the PDF or the CDF,
any of those would be fine.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.401
So the CDF would be the probability
that T is less than or equal to t.

00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:11.405
That's a little bit, remember, this is
general advice when finding probabilities,

00:35:11.405 --> 00:35:14.219
you should think about is it
easier to find that probability or

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:15.260
find the compliment.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.290
In this case,
if you think about it a little bit,

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.210
you'll see that it's easier
to find the compliment.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.960
Let's find the probability
that T is greater than t,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.490
little t, so that's just 1 minus the CDF
so if we have this, we know the CDF.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:33.620
This is a little bit easier to think about
because if we imagine a time line here,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.890
where here's time t.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.323
And if we draw an x every
time we receive an email,

00:35:40.323 --> 00:35:43.820
T &gt; t means that the first email,
let's say it's there, so

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:48.360
that's time capital T,
is to the right of here, right?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:54.980
That says from times 0 to t,
you have no email, right?

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.320
That's exactly what this says.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.390
It says that in times 0 to t,
you have no new mail, right?

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:03.650
It's exactly equivalent.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:10.368
Therefore, that's the exact same

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:14.946
thing as saying that the P(N).

00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:23.469
(T&gt;t) says that Nt = 0 where Nt = # of
emails in that time interval from 0 to 2.

00:36:23.469 --> 00:36:27.692
So I'm defining Nt to be the number of

00:36:27.692 --> 00:36:32.596
emails in this time interval, 0 to t, but

00:36:32.596 --> 00:36:37.960
T greater than t says there are none,
right?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.840
So it's the exact same thing.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.825
And we assume that this is
Poisson lambda t, so this thing,

00:36:44.825 --> 00:36:49.211
just using the Poisson PMF
is e to the minus lambda t,

00:36:49.211 --> 00:36:52.519
lambda t to the 0, over 0 factorial.

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:56.847
Well, that's just e to the minus lambda t,
right, so

00:36:56.847 --> 00:37:01.174
the CDF is 1 minus that,
1- e to the minus lambda t for

00:37:01.174 --> 00:37:06.464
t greater than 0, and if we want
the PDF just take the derivative.

00:37:06.464 --> 00:37:13.251
So you got lambda e to the minus lambda t,
okay, so that's connecting the Poisson,

00:37:13.251 --> 00:37:19.371
counting number of emails to this is
called the exponential distribution,

00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:22.908
again related to our homework problem, and

00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:27.420
again we'll talk about
this distribution later.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.421
You don't need to know
the exponential distribution yet, but

00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:33.645
it will be reasonable to be able to
do a problem like this where we're

00:37:33.645 --> 00:37:36.323
just using the Poisson which is discrete,
to get a PDF.

00:37:36.323 --> 00:37:39.266
Well, lastly I just want
to remind you again,

00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:44.770
be very careful of the difference between,
we sort of have three classes of objects.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:49.430
We have our distributions,
the distribution is the blueprint for

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.200
creating a random variable,
that was our random house.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.480
And then don't confuse the random
variable with a constant,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.895
a constant would be a specific house,
the random variable is the random house,

00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:04.840
the distribution,
the CFD is the blueprint.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.330
And so mixing up those things causes a lot
of trouble, so be very careful about that.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.490
All right, so good luck.
