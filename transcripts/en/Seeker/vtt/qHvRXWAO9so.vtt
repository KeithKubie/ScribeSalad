00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.870
Turns out the old "opposites attract" adage
- isn't really true!

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.930
Just ask any guy I've ever dated.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.710
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - with new evidence
to support the idea that opposites really

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.710
don't attract.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.840
Psychologically speaking, the adage is considered
a myth - since people are generally more attracted

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.970
to those who share their personality traits
and beliefs.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.000
Biologically, however, spousal mating has
always been considered to be pretty random.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.230
Until now.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.300
Researchers at the University of California
studied the genomes of 825 heterosexual married

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.830
couples, and found that spouses in those relationships,
shared more genetic similarities than random

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.600
pairs from the same population.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.090
Not only that, but couples who share an increase
in genetic similarity by at least one standard

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.640
deviation - are 15% more likely to get married.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.140
This is a widely known phenomenon called Assortative
Mating, and it applies not just to our genes,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260
but also to our behaviors and physical appearances.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.020
A good example would be how people tend to
date others who have similar body types to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.020
them.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.020
It's not really clear WHY this happens.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.000
But the researchers in this study chalked
it up to 3 possible explanations: Birth region,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.200
ethnicity, and education.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.020
It's been shown that people born in the same
geographical area, are more likely to marry

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.750
and share genetic markers.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.740
Which extends to ethnicities as well.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.660
But even after controlling for those factors,
they still found a high amount of genetic

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.869
similarities between couples.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.130
So they looked at education.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.810
It's generally known that people with similar
educational backgrounds tend to marry each

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.960
other - that's called Educational Assortative
Mating.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.360
And studies have proven that education level
is at least partially tied to your genetic

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.030
make-up, so it makes sense that people with
similar educations would be more genetically

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.030
similar.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.650
Sure enough, the authors crunched some numbers
- and discovered that education accounted

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.729
for up to two thirds of that 15% increase
in genetic similarity - though it's unclear

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.409
which one influences the other.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.670
How do you guys feel about this?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.220
Obviously there are exceptions to every rule,
but do you tend to go for people who are similar

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.290
to you, or people who are very different?

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.159
