RALEIGH SEAMSTER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.060
My name is Raleigh Seamster,
and I'm a program manager

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.860
with Google Earth Outreach.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.900
I'm really excited about the
guest we have here today.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.290
I'd like to introduce to
you Cris Stainbrook, who's

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.710
the President of the Indian
Land Tenure Foundation.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.410
And he's here today to talk
about the past, present,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.250
and future of Indian lands
in the United States.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.732
Please welcome Cris.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:34.564
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:39.630
CRIS STAINBROOK:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.965
Cris Stainbrook, emaciyapi.

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:45.420
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], Raleigh.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.180
Good afternoon.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.940
My name's Cris Stainbrook.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.100
And thank you to
Raleigh for inviting

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.840
me to do a Google talk.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.030
You can tell by my
southern Lakota accent

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.960
that that would make me Oglala.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.810
And I'm sure you're
familiar with that, right?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.440
So today we're going to
talk about Indian land

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.310
and Indian land specifically
in the United States, the lower

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.670
48.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.220
We won't talk about Alaska,
because the land issues are

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.590
entirely different up there,
although they do share

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.980
some amount of commonality.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.140
Most of our work has been
limited to the lower 48.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.700
The Foundation itself
started nearly 16 years ago,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.550
and we started with a mission.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.750
And then those areas
outside of the boundaries

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.700
that have special
meaning to the tribes

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.470
still, either for cultural
reasons or religious reasons.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.660
This is Indian land before
the coming of the Europeans.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.530
It was the entirety
of the continent,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.110
about 800 different tribes,
and went from sea to sea,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.580
basically.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.220
Then we had the early
immigration period

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.850
where we had the 13 colonies
established and the Europeans

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.770
coming onto the shores.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.080
And that went through
pretty much the late 1600s.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.930
And then we started
getting even more pressure

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.770
from Europeans and others coming
to the shores on the East.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.540
And eventually, it led to
President Andrew Jackson

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.610
declaring that all
Indian people should

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.140
be removed from the East, at
least to the Mississippi River.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.060
And in fact, that's
when Oklahoma,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.980
what's now the
state of Oklahoma,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.830
became Indian country,
and they removed people

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.470
from the eastern
tribes to Oklahoma.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.710
That's why you see the
tribes in Oklahoma today

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.010
being the same ones that
were on the East Coast.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.020
In theory but not
in practicality,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.760
the land rights of those
tribes on the East Coast

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.200
were eliminated or eradicated.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.230
Then we started getting people
coming on the West Coast.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.760
We had the Hudson Bay Company.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.450
We had people looking for
gold and furs and others,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.390
and we started getting pressure
in Oregon and California

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.420
specifically, but also
Washington State to a lesser

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.240
extent.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.220
It was also in
1803, of course, we

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.120
had the Lewis and Clark
incursion up the Missouri River

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.300
and over the Rocky
Mountain Divide

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.100
and into the Pacific Northwest.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.320
All of this kind of got to
a point of what's called

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.580
manifest destiny.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.970
So it was this notion
that all folks,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.160
all the immigrant
folks had about,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.590
they were destined to
take over this country.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.310
You can see by this
particular picture,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.920
you've got this angelic
figure, of course,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.260
stringing the telegraph wire.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.180
You've got the bears
and Indian people

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.440
and Buffalo running
in fear further west.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.740
And you get the
railroads coming in.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.730
You've got industry, as it were,
pushing people out of the land.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.160
Which then led to any number
of Indian wars and settlements

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.840
and peace treaties and other
treaties that were primarily

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.320
land sessions to non-Indians.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.300
And today, this is
largely what you

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.040
would see if you looked at
a map of the treaties that

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.876
were done through 1871, which
ended the treaty-making period.

00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:29.250
One thing I would point out--
and this map needs a little

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.749
work--

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.790
I was showing this
at the Crow tribe.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.250
I was showing it to
a family of folks

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.070
who wanted to work out an
agreement with the Crow tribe

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.190
around land that they owned,
and I popped the slide up.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.180
And unfortunately, if you look
at the southeastern boundary

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.920
of Montana, the Crow reservation
and the northern Cheyenne

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.530
reservation were
left off the map.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.720
And now they blame that
on me being Oglala.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.190
[LAUGHS]

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.140
You know, it was
just an oversight.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.710
What can I say?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.670
If we want to summarize the
land loss up to that point,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.430
it's easy to do
it up until 1887.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.310
So in 1871, the
federal government

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.980
quit making treaties
with tribes.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.320
And after that, reservations
were established

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.710
by executive order only.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.670
There were a number of
those between 1871 and 1887.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.670
In 1887, the reason
that's important

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.920
is because that's when
Congress and others decided

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.680
that Indian people should become
farmers and ranchers, much

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.300
in the European mode.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.241
So what they did was they passed
the Dawes General Allotment

00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:40.740
Act.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.300
And the Dawes
General Allotment Act

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.800
said the reservations
would be allotted

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.710
to individual Indian
people in 80, 160,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.560
or 320-acre allotments.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.870
And on those allotments,
Indian people

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.420
would learn to be
farmers or ranchers.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.230
And all the tribal
lands would basically

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.250
be extinguished at that point.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.220
At that date in 1887, we had
130 million acres of land

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.950
inside the reservation
boundaries,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.940
and almost every treaty
reads for the exclusive use

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.610
and occupation by Indian people.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.110
And there was an acre or two
set aside for the blacksmith,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.230
there was an acre or two set
aside for the schoolmarm,

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.560
and there was an acre or two
set aside for the agency.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.120
Other than that, it was
to be entirely reserved

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.620
for Indian people and their use.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.900
By 1934, when the
Indian Organization Act

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.900
passed to put an end to
the allotment process,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.010
it was recognized by
a 1928 Meriam Report

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.750
to Congress that
said the Allotment

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.760
Act is an abysmal failure.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.470
It's created poverty.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.680
And Indian people have not
become farmers and ranchers

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.300
in the mode that
they anticipated.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.410
And so at that point, they
stopped the allotment process.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.370
And basically, we
had 48 million acres

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.340
of land left inside
reservation boundaries.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.050
The rest had been alienated
to other ownership.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.090
And I give you a
quick breakdown.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.740
The 90 million acres that were
lost, about 60 million got

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.850
lost immediately.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.460
38 million went to
what's called ceded

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.160
to the federal government.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.220
Once they did the allotment
process at each reservation,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.500
if there was land that
had not been allotted--

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.480
so they did an allotment to
every head of the family,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.060
and if there was
land left over, they

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.820
declared it in excess
of Indian needs,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.130
and the federal
government took it.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.760
And so that was the big loss.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.950
That was 38 million.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.090
Actually, that was 60.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.620
The other 22, they were
open to homesteading.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.425
And so 22 million acres
was open to homesteading,

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:07.230
and immigrants moved in.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.510
The other land that went
to the federal government

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.650
was held or sold.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.060
So they went to timber
companies or railroad companies,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.280
mining companies.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.860
Or the federal government
retained ownership

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.950
if no one else wanted it.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.980
So that's where the land went.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.940
And then we lost
30 million acres

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.720
through a whole host of
other means, usually sale.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.580
So Indian people would
get impoverished,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.049
they would be buying
commodities at the agency store.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.789
In order to pay off
their bill, they'd

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.110
end up selling their land
interest to the store.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.830
The other way-- a couple of
other ways that land was lost

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:54.420
is the Dawes Allotment Act
had a blanket declaration

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.080
of all Indian people and
tribes as incompetent

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.300
to handle their own affairs.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.390
And when they did that, they
converted the land title

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.170
from Indian ownership to
federal trust ownership.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.050
And the federal
government holds land

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:17.390
in trust for those individuals
and for the tribes, any land

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.340
that was left to the tribes.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.690
And so the federal government
then oversaw those pieces.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.080
Starting in 1903, the
federal government

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.630
decided that some
Indian people should

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.360
be declared competent to
handle their own affairs.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:40.590
So for instance, if an Indian
woman married a non-Indian man,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.050
she was declared competent.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.970
And some of you may
have seen the movie

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.130
that just recently came out.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.610
We lost lots of land in
Oklahoma because Indian women

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:56.760
married non-Indian men, and
then within a six-month, year

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.430
period, met with an accident.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.380
And we lost lots
of Indian women,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.760
and we also lost
lots of Indian land.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.156
The other way that really
hits a little closer to home,

00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:14.010
and especially it happened in
the Upper Great Plains tribes,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.350
is Indian men
could be declared--

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.840
I should first go back and
say if an Indian man married

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.840
a non-Indian woman,
that was seen as kind

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.570
of lateral incompetency.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.110
[LAUGHS]

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.210
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it was then.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.830
So an Indian man could
become declared competent

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.750
if he joined the military.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.980
And so in World War I, we
had any number of Indian men

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.490
who were warriors by
nature signing up and going

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.300
to the military.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.212
And what happened
when they did that,

00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:50.420
they were declared competent.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.700
They would come home
four years later

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.040
and find out that they had
been declared competent

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.550
and the taxes had
started to mount on what

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.990
they thought were trust lands.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.000
But since they declared
them competent,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.460
they had become fee land
and taxable by the county.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.820
And so while they
were fighting at war,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.540
the county sold their land
on the courthouse steps,

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.940
basically, through a tax sale.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.139
And we lost millions
of acres that way.

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:19.555
They're called
forced fee patents.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.090
So by declaring the incompetency
of the federal government

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.720
or the Indian people
and dividing the land,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.750
in doing all that,
it never occurred

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.320
to the federal government
that allottees would die.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.360
And so the original
allottees started to die,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.990
and there was no
way, no mechanism,

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.760
because they were
declared incompetent,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.050
to handle their estates.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.840
And so they had to
come up with a process.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.150
And they came up with
a process that said,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.940
the land will remain connected.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:03.050
But the land will
remain intact, but we'll

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:08.150
divide the ownership interests
as we go down the road.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.110
And eventually, you
know, all of the land

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:18.720
will somehow, in essence,
end the holding of the tribe.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.930
And so Teddy Roosevelt in 1901
declared "The General Allotment

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.920
Act a mighty pulverizing engine
to break up the tribal mass."

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.540
I mean, this was an attempt.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.050
The Dawes Allotment and
all the allotment processes

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.710
were arranged so that
eventually, the tribe

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.000
no longer exists.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.760
And that was the intent
of the whole direction

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.290
of the country at that time.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.100
And Teddy Roosevelt
was a big believer.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.820
So what did the allotment
process look like in practice?

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.495
This is the Salish-Kootenai
reservation,

00:12:52.495 --> 00:12:57.650
a Flathead Reservation
in Northwest Montana.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.370
Two tribes were
there, the Salish

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.500
and the Kootenai in the
1855 Hell's Gate Treaty

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.970
set to the side.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:10.370
You can see that green portion
is all tribal ownership.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.010
And you can see the
entirety of the reservation

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.350
is under tribal ownership.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.692
Allotment process
came in late 1900s.

00:13:18.692 --> 00:13:25.020
And in fact, in 1908 and
'09, I think, was completed.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.980
And so this is the yellow
in the valley there.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.200
The Salish people were
more mountainous people.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.030
If you know this
area at all, you

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.980
know there's a mountain
range that runs down

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.070
the east boundary and a
mountain range that runs down

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.200
the west boundary, and
down toward the bottom

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.990
is essentially the valley
outlet toward Missoula, Montana.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.110
Those were the allotments.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.680
They were selected by
the families themselves.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.190
So then it gets opened
up to homesteading.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.990
And all of the white,
all of the gray, all

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.810
of those other squares that are
on there, the purple and others

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.340
were taken from the tribe, even
though this land specifically

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.550
was reserved for the
exclusive use and occupation

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.050
by Indian people.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.370
Since that time, they've
lost a little more land,

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.910
but they've also been buying
back land and beginning

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.610
to get it back into tribal
ownership or members.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.270
I think this is one
of those pieces that

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.630
deserves a little noting.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.940
The big purple
circle in the bottom

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.250
is the National Bison Range.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.730
It was established
at the time of--

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.690
well, just after Teddy
Roosevelt was president.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.020
Interestingly enough,
the Salish-Kootenai folks

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.700
had a buffalo herd for years
and years in their area,

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.490
and the only way they saw
to save it from non-Indians

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.420
killing all the buffalo is they
sent their buffalo to Canada

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.070
and raised them up there.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.320
When they established
the National Bison Range,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.660
they brought the
buffalo, their buffalo

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.850
back down to the Bison Range.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.490
For the past almost
20 years, the tribes

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.460
have been trying to take over
management of the Bison Range

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.980
from the US Fish and
Wildlife Service,

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.700
and have been fought tooth
and nail, even though it's

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.230
their land and their buffalo.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.190
This is a more egregious
example of what happened

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.190
under the Allotment Act.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.930
This is the Leech
Lake Reservation

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.755
in North Central Minnesota.

00:15:27.755 --> 00:15:31.750
The little red dots
you see over that map,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.800
those are tribal trust, tribal
and individual trust lands.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.930
And that's all that
remains of their ownership

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.550
on the reservation.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.300
All of the rest of the land
is owned by non-Indians.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.760
Largest landowner on the
Leech Lake Reservation

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.820
is the federal government
through a national forest.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.580
Second largest is
a state forest.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.820
And then after that, it
becomes municipality and then

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.270
other non-Indian individuals.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.450
You can see that that's a
very small piece of land

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.420
that the tribes and Indian
people actually own.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.550
Even though, if you
drive up on the highway,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.010
there's a big sign on
every highway that says,

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.130
you're entering the
Leech Lake Reservation.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.180
And people think, wow.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.000
Indian people have
all this land.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.120
It's pretty impressive.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.925
But that's what we find.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.990
As I said before, there was no
real process for inheritance,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.390
and they had to develop one.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.940
And so they developed
that piece where it said,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.730
we're going to hold
those allotments intact,

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.760
and the title will
divide among the heirs.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.780
And their first efforts at
this were not very good,

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.110
but they looked kind of this.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.776
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:43.776 --> 00:16:45.590
- Going back to
the Allotment Act,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.060
my great grandparents might have
picked up a 160-acre allotment

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.460
or 640 acres.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.480
When they passed on, and let's
say they had four children,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.200
those land interests
were divided by four.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.640
And when those people passed
on and they had children,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.200
the land was further divided.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.880
And if there wasn't a will or
some mechanism for, you know,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.270
allocating the land interest,
over and over again,

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.240
you had a continued division
into smaller and smaller

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:19.740
pieces.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.673
So take a pie.

00:17:20.673 --> 00:17:21.589
You divide it in half.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.630
You divide it in quarter.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.325
Divide it eights, divide
it 16, 1/32, 1/64.

00:17:27.325 --> 00:17:29.700
All of a sudden, how much a
piece of the pie do you have?

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.230
You don't have a lot
of piece of the pie,

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.521
but you still have an interest.

00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:33.330
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.310
CRIS STAINBROOK:
We have people--

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:42.090
we have allotments with more
than 5,000 owners on 80 acres.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.510
Now there aren't very many
of you in the audience today,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.495
but can you imagine just
taking this audience

00:17:47.495 --> 00:17:48.870
and sitting down
and saying, what

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.180
should we do with our land?

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.800
Then think about doing that with
200 of your closest relatives

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.630
at Thanksgiving.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.170
And then think about it
in getting a gymnasium

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.250
and bringing 5,000 of your
relatives, some of who

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.540
you're undoubtedly not even
familiar with, to a gymnasium

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.790
and sitting down and saying,
should we lease our land,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.998
or what should we do with it?

00:18:12.998 --> 00:18:16.230
Well, what happens is it
by default starts getting

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.380
managed by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs or others,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.850
or it gets sold.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.350
And that's where we're at today.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.580
We have from some
information we received

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.740
from the Department
of Interior, we

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.040
have one woman
who's 45 years old

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.530
and owns 345 undivided interests
on four different reservations.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.840
But you total it up, and
she owns about 80 acres.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.910
And we have 1,000 landowners
who own 100 interests or more,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.120
some on as many as
12 reservations,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.730
and some where that 100
undivided interests doesn't add

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.670
up to more than
1,000th of an acre,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:06.860
which essentially is a
five-by-five-inch notepad.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.820
It's a chaotic
morass, if you will,

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.740
and it's up to the Bureau of
Indian Affairs to manage that.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.940
The problem we have, the
fundamental underlying problem

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.100
we have is that
all the tribes have

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.150
been very much a
land-based culture

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.300
where you are open and free
to exercise your activities

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.280
on the land and [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.320
And it was important
for the tribes

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.690
when they negotiated
treaties to maintain

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.940
that access to property,
both around the reservation

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.810
as well as in it.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.400
They're our homelands.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.020
Clearly, they're our homelands.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.870
The other piece that
sometimes gets overlooked

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.660
in just having
those reservations

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.210
is that people were often
moved from another site

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.110
to that reservation, removed
from an area that was given up

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.210
or ceded to the
federal government.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.190
There are religious
sites outside

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.400
of the reservation boundaries
where the tribes still

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.780
maintain interests.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.630
On the Columbia River,
they're fishing sites.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.290
In the Midwest, they're
promontories and what's

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.280
called Devil's Tower, Bear
Butte, some of those places

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.240
where the tribes gathered for
Sun Dance and other activities.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.520
In the Southwest, you've got
major canyons and other areas

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:36.485
that have some feature that
drew the tribes there, or had

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:41.520
some amount of importance
in terms of trade.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.100
So in the Pacific
Northwest, you had

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.190
what's called the old
Seneca race track.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.820
It's in east central Oregon.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.530
The tribes from both
the Intermountain West

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.630
and the Pacific
Northwest gathered there.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.180
They'd have horse races,
but they would trade.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.750
And that's where obsidian began
to move from the Crater Lake

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.910
area to the Plains was
through that trade corridor.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:11.510
So this is our vision
of where we want to go.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.630
We had a gentleman in our office
one day who was an artist,

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.750
and he was asking if he could
do some work for us, because he

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.980
needed a few dollars.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.290
And we happened to
walk by the earlier

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.910
picture of manifest destiny.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.730
I said, well, you could
paint our version of this.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:26.540
[LAUGHS]

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.660
And I'm was kidding
him, but he did it.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.110
So you can see we've got our
own angelic figure, picking up

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.100
the telegraph wire.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.250
We've got that
accomplished pretty much.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.190
But we've also got
pipelines laid down,

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.420
the railroad's there.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.170
But you can see our vision.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.960
We know we aren't getting
all of our land back.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.730
That's not our intent.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.410
What we want is
what was promised

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:56.000
to us, those lands inside
the reservation boundaries

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.260
that were promised to us for
the exclusive use and occupation

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.120
by Indian people.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.460
The Foundation pursues
four strategies.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.490
Education, economic
opportunities,

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.456
cultural awareness,
and legal reform.

00:22:09.456 --> 00:22:11.830
And I'm going to go through
some of these fairly quickly.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:17.910
So one of the things that we
started with was education.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.810
We did that because
Indian people as well

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.470
as non-Indian people know
very little about Indian land.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.080
In Indian country, we've
been separated from that land

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.540
for so long that we
aren't even sure--

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.840
most people in Indian
country aren't even sure,

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.350
how did we get in
this situation?

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.780
If you ask some
folks, they think

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.850
that it's part of the treaty
that we have allotments.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.100
You know, they think
it's a treaty right

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.820
to have that allotment,
and it's not that at all.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.820
We get folks to understand
that one of the big pieces,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.890
because of that fractionated
ownership that I described

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.980
to you, we've been writing wills
for Indian people since 2003.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.660
Part of the reason
we do that is there's

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.200
no history in Indian country
of writing wills and passing

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.630
your interests along.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:13.280
Because we were declared
incompetent until 1903,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.140
we weren't allowed
to write wills.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:19.460
And in fact, it wasn't till
1924 when Indian people were

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.000
recognized as citizens
of the United States,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.410
a will wouldn't
hold up in court.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.830
And so there was
no history of that.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.270
Our best guess is 7% of
Indian people have wills.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.800
And we're trying-- we've been
trying hard to get that up.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.930
We also do strategic
land planning

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:43.050
with the tribes and
others on a regular basis.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.580
We put out a message
runner on, I would say,

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.310
a periodic basis
on various topics

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.530
that Indian country
needs to know about.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.510
But this one was one
of our first ones,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.760
and we've got one since
then, that's really

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.080
about the general public.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.027
And you can find those online.

00:24:00.027 --> 00:24:01.860
The other thing we did
was we ask ourselves,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.990
so our mission is
one of 150 years.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.310
That's our plan.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.950
We aren't going to be
around to see 150 years.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.360
And so we ask ourselves, how
do you get a movement started?

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.000
And one of the things
that we looked at

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.320
was the nonsmoking movement,
the recycling movement.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.090
You know, what were
at the heart of those?

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.090
And it was the kids, right?

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.660
So the kids, you get this
message across to them and say,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.940
you don't want to start smoking.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.310
And they would take that
home to the parents.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.560
And so that's where we started.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.490
We have a K through
12 curriculum.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.930
We have a college curriculum.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.320
And we were approached about
doing a Head Start curriculum.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.090
In fact, we have a
coloring book now

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.730
for Head Start on Indian land.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.860
Our curriculum is in about--

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.390
well, it's in all
the states of Montana

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.730
or all the schools in Montana.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.170
It's in most of the schools
in South Dakota now.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.820
And it's in-- jeez, I don't
know what the count is now.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.090
50 or 60 schools in California.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.880
Primarily Southern
California, and then very

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.550
Northern California, up
in Yurok and Round Valley.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.671
The other thing we
did on a lark was

00:25:18.671 --> 00:25:20.670
a gentleman came to our
office one day and said,

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:21.564
I want to help you.

00:25:21.564 --> 00:25:22.980
And we said, well,
what do you do?

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.650
And he said, well, I'm in
the entertainment industry.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.980
And we said, OK.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.567
But what can you do for us?

00:25:28.567 --> 00:25:30.650
And he said, well, I'll
help you raise some funds.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.840
And we said, well,
you know, we aren't

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.310
ready to raise a bunch of funds.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.580
And he said, well, I can
make a movie for you.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:43.120
And we didn't know
him from Adam.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.610
Our support person out front
said, was that Barry ZeVan

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.275
the weatherman that was there?

00:25:48.275 --> 00:25:51.170
And it turns out, he was the
weather man in the Twin Cities

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.050
for a number of years before
he went to Washington and New

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.390
York.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.240
He gave us a good
price on doing a film.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.830
We did the film.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.550
He arranged to have Sam
Donaldson narrate the film.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.640
And it turns out that we won
the Telly award that year

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.740
for documentaries.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.411
And we've been happy ever
since about that, since we

00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:15.410
knew so little about it.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.639
They called us and said,
you won the Telly award.

00:26:17.639 --> 00:26:18.680
And we said, what's that?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.550
[LAUGHS]

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.910
We have a Buick hood ornament
that-- or I should say,

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.760
it looks like a
Buick hood ornament.

00:26:27.151 --> 00:26:28.400
This is one of the big pieces.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.380
Every time the federal
government realizes

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.010
they have a problem
with fractionation,

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.460
the way to solve it is
put it on Indian people.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.080
And so in 2004, the American
Indian Probate Reform Act

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.130
passed.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.190
And it basically
set up a process

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.170
that if Indian people
don't have wills,

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.690
they lose control
of their asset.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.430
And the federal
government decides

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.610
how their asset will
go, to be divided

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.430
among their heirs or not.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.640
We are going to lose a
whole bunch of Indian land,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.560
three generations
out, if we can't

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.270
get people to write wills.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.030
So we spend an
inordinate amount of time

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.930
trying to do pieces around the
American Indian Probate Reform

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.030
Act.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:16.160
Then we also work on using
land as an economic asset.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.500
How do you leverage
your land ownership?

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.380
How do you use that land
to be productive and make

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.190
a living off of it?

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.720
And we've done a
number of things,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.500
including acquiring the
alienated properties

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.740
inside reservation
boundaries, and also helping

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.780
some amount of agricultural
businesses to get started.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.270
Because ag, of
course, is the most

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.400
tightly connected to the land.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.210
And in the Great Plains,
it takes large acreages

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.350
in order to make a living.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.300
So we've been working on doing
some buffalo operations which

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:59.040
require astoundingly
large tracts of land.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.720
We also have a subsidiary, the
Indian Land Capital Company.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.720
And it lends to the tribes
in full faith and credit.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.470
We don't take collateral
from the tribes.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.840
We don't take land
as collateral.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.460
Once they have
that land back, we

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.310
are not going to put
it in jeopardy again.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:22.170
We wanted to demonstrate that
in fact, the banks should

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.530
be lending to the tribes
on full faith and credit.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.770
On the other hand, they
seemed reluctant to do that.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:34.450
But what we've demonstrated
to them is that, in fact,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.890
you can do this, and the
tribes will repay the loans.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.020
And we have not had
a default. We've

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.780
had one tribe get in
trouble, and that was a loan

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.720
that we rewrote for them,
and they paid it off early.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.670
The other thing that's
become interesting

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.830
is much of our
early capitalization

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:59.130
for Indian Land Capital Company
came from banks as EQ2 loans.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.570
So meeting their CRA challenges,
their Community Reinvestment

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.150
Act challenges,
that was a way they

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:11.550
could make a low-interest loan
to Indian Land Capital Company,

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.180
and then we would relend it.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.810
This year, we will get
Indian Land Capital Company

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.610
to about a $53 million business.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.750
We've been running
just below $10 million.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.010
And the banks, two of the banks
won't lend us any more money

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.660
to relend, because they
said we're now competitors.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.350
And these are banks that dwarf
Indian Land Capital Company.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.990
I mean, dwarf it.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.260
Big national banks and
international banks.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.180
But it's interesting.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.070
They could, in fact,
lend the same way.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.340
They lend to the state set
through full faith and credit,

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.524
and they could certainly
lend to the tribes that way.

00:29:53.524 --> 00:29:55.940
The other thing we started
working on with the Intertribal

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:02.520
Ag Council that we hope will
afford the tribes and others

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.059
the opportunity to
benefit from their land,

00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:08.100
we're doing it through
the National Indian Carbon

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.550
Coalition, which was set up to
help the tribes and individual

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.730
landowners be able to
access carbon markets.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.790
So here in California, you
have one of the largest

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.950
cap and trade markets.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.340
We worked with the California
Air Resources Board

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.430
to understand that some of the
provisions they were putting

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.840
in their regulations on who
could access that market just

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.520
weren't going to
fly with the tribes.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.260
So having the tribes
have to approve

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.600
all of the projects inside
the reservation boundaries

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.790
was going to limit anybody
living in the reservation

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.240
boundary from probably using
the tribal sovereignty in order

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.340
to do those projects.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.970
We got some of that changed.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.610
Right now, we've really moved
this quite a ways along.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.700
We're working with
Best Buy and a number

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.220
of other local entities
in the Twin Cities

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.060
to reduce their carbon market
or their carbon footprint,

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.300
if you will.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:13.110
It's not about offsetting
pollution as specific source

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.515
pollution, but rather their
carbon footprint overall.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.280
The other place, when we
first started the Foundation,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.840
we had a long debate about,
should this particular strategy

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:34.660
be using land to help
Indian people rediscover

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.770
their culture?

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.810
Or should it be
discover their culture?

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.370
And during that
whole conversation,

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.130
it finally came
down to discover.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.640
Because as I said
earlier, in many cases,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.090
we've been so disconnected
from our land for so long

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:55.720
that we don't even know
that culture anymore.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.370
One of our very first
grants from the Foundation

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.520
went to a tribe in Oklahoma.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.150
And they couldn't-- they
wanted to go back and document

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.580
their culture.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.530
And specifically,
they wanted to know

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.680
why they did an acorn
dance when they had no oak

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.450
trees on their reservation.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.160
Well, it turns out they
were removed from Ohio.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.550
And in Ohio, they had
all these oak trees,

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:25.180
and that's why they did
this oak dance in the fall.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.150
And for them, it was
kind of a revelation of,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.040
you know, well, we've
adapted, but we haven't

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.690
left all of our culture behind.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.950
For the most part,
we've been moving

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.360
toward preserving rather than
use some of our other pieces

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.690
on this particular slide we've
been moving toward getting out

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.720
there and preserving those
places where the tribes still

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.910
have a cultural interest.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.640
This happens to be Pe' Sla.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.020
Pe' Sla is a Lakota name.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.760
It means the heart
of everything.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:03.670
And this is a big prairie in
the middle of the Black Hills,

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:08.110
which of course was reserved
through 1868, Fort Laramie

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:14.380
Treaty, and then subsequently
lost during the Gold Rush.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.430
The family who
originally homesteaded

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:21.790
Pe' Sla once it was
open decided they

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.960
were going to sell the ranch
and all of the pieces to it.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.210
This is one of
five Lakota sites.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:32.230
It's the only Lakota site that
was still in private ownership.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.980
And we worked with six tribes,
six of the Lakota tribes,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.950
to purchase Pe'
Sla and protect it.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.420
That piece that
you're looking at

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.290
was subdivided before
the auction was

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:48.880
to be held into 22
different small ranchettes,

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.880
and they were going to
divide the prairie up.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.020
We've maintained it.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.710
We've bought more
property around it.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.270
We also have work at Bear Butte,
which is also in the Black

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.060
Hills, to protect
that from encroachment

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.440
from the Sturgis Motorcycle
Rally, which by chance happens

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.040
during pretty much the same
time that all of the Sun Dances

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.020
occur and prayers
occur at Bear Butte.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.690
As I said, we work on
large buffalo projects

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.880
because they require
large amounts of land,

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.630
and we can pick up
larger pieces of land.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.389
The tribes are very
much interested

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:29.110
in using buffalo, bringing
back buffalo onto Indian lands

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.139
and using those to
support the community.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:36.460
We have a 17,000-acre project
right now at Rock Creek

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.170
on the Standing
Rock Reservation,

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.239
which I think will be
a model for others.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.360
They're putting in
a community freezer.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.310
They're going to process
all their buffalo.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.940
Their kids actually own
buffalo that are in the herd.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:55.870
And one of the girls who
was there in their beef

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.910
program first and then came
over into buffalo as well,

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.180
she is now using
it for her tuition

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.460
to veterinary school
in North Dakota.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.860
We work on any number of
legal reform pieces, both

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.710
at the congressional
level, but also then

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.140
at a more local level.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.700
Especially with
state and county.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.340
We want the states and
counties to understand

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.970
what it is to have a
sovereign tribe in the area,

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.370
and how you can work with them.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:33.390
We also maintain a
fairly significant list

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:37.050
with legislation that's going
on as well as court cases.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.850
At any given time
in the US Congress,

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.070
there are anywhere
from 12 to 20 bills

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.130
pending that will
affect Indian land.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:53.500
Court cases are probably
100, 150 at any given

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.990
time across the country.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:02.350
Out of that 100 or 150, those
that get to the Supreme Court,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.810
when asking for cert
at the Supreme Court,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.990
the tribes have had
three cases accepted,

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:12.520
and one has been successful.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.120
All the rest are counties and
states bringing cases forward

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.180
that get accepted by
the Supreme Court.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.060
In order to make
all that work, we've

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.090
been trying to work with
all of the tribal lands

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.390
staffs across the
country through what

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.930
has become the National
Tribal Land Association.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.990
And we bring all the
tribal land staffs

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.560
who are interested in a
conference every year,

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.120
and we're dealing with
issues and resources

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.750
that we can bring to them.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.520
In fact, that's where our
relationship with Raleigh

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:54.210
developed, was Google was
doing all of the mapping work,

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.920
and the tribes obviously
had a very high need

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.510
for getting mapping and getting
as many layers on a GIS map

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.550
as they could get on there.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:09.710
And I was telling her of the one
tribe this afternoon at lunch.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.280
They started with an eight and
a half by 11 sheet of paper

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.590
for representing their
reservation, which

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.410
was somewhere around
150 square miles.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.950
And the allotments were just
simple red dots on there.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.050
They had no idea
how many acres were

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.380
under each one or anything,
what the size of it was.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.090
And we used Google
Maps, basically,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.560
and plotted them out so
that they could at least

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.850
see what they owned.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.050
We've been working
with families.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.650
This is the hardest
thing we've ever done.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.480
So we're trying
to bring families

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.840
who are co-owners on
allotments together to manage

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.880
their property collectively.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.840
And we've had lots of families
really interested, right?

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.960
And then they have
their first meeting

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.990
and find out that they aren't
in real agreement on much.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.386
And so we've had any
number of fits and starts

00:38:05.386 --> 00:38:07.010
under this thing,
but we're hoping it's

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:08.910
going to work out eventually.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:18.510
All of this led us to, I
guess-- what was it, 2007?--

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:22.320
we were at a point
where we kept running up

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.520
against the law that seemed to
us to be fundamentally wrong.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.680
And so we went out and
commissioned a piece

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.710
by the American Indian
Law Resource Center

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:36.150
in Helena, Montana, and we
worked with legal professors

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.360
from all over the country who
specialized in Indian law.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.400
And we went back and
looked at Indian law

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.960
starting in 1829 with
the Marshall Trilogy,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.830
with the discussion of
the Doctrine of Discovery

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.980
and the relationship
between the tribes

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.960
who were signing treaties
and the federal government.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.760
Thomson Reuters
published the book,

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.750
and the principles that
we developed along the way

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:07.470
were in fitting with
the United Nations

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.960
Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous People.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.060
So this was our manuscript
for how this country could

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.800
follow that doctrine and come
down to a different type of law

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.950
for Indian land.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.760
We shortened it up a whole
bunch so that the general public

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.790
wouldn't have to read
that legal version of it.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:33.690
And this is a piece that's
also available on our website,

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.280
and shorts it down to a
"Reader's Digest" version.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.790
The last thing I'll
kind of go through here,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.390
we have proposed to
the federal government

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:49.530
a social impact bond model for
funding the estate planning

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.780
work throughout the country.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.235
You can see in the
lower right-hand corner,

00:39:56.235 --> 00:39:58.200
it would rely on
outside investors

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.480
through a bond process.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.680
And then the work would
get done through contracts

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.680
that ILTF, the Indian
Land Tenure Foundation,

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.004
would let to contractors.

00:40:10.004 --> 00:40:12.420
And then that would be audited,
and the federal government

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.410
would pay in savings.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:18.250
We have about 1.3 million
undivided interests

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:22.470
in this country on Indian
land, and each one costs on

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.880
average $120 per year for
the Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.170
to manage.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.300
If you look at the Bureau
of Indian Affairs' budget,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.980
it doesn't have that much money
in there for land management.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.390
And so we know it's
not being done.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.540
It's not being done
properly, and that's

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.760
why we're offering this to them.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.110
Our reason for doing this was so
that Indian people could manage

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:51.960
their assets, so that we could
get in control of those assets.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.580
It turns out by putting
this piece together,

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.770
as you can see by the
pink box down there,

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:02.130
the total savings to the
Department of Interior

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.510
would be around $5.7 billion.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:11.260
And they would
get an $8.5 return

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.030
to every dollar spent to do it.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:20.950
Interestingly enough, we aren't
sure that's enough for them.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.350
[LAUGHS]

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.300
And I don't know what is.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.390
If they can't get them there
in this time of budgets

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:32.130
and what they're facing
with their employment

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.400
right now at the Bureau
of Indian Affairs--

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.920
60% of their employees are
eligible for retirement

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.980
tomorrow, and
they're going to be

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.400
losing this massive workforce.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.657
And when we presented this to
them, they said, but where will

00:41:48.657 --> 00:41:49.240
they get jobs?

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.710
And I said, that's not
going to be an issue.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.274
You're still going to have
plenty of jobs out there.

00:41:55.274 --> 00:41:56.940
The other thing we
were trying to change

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:03.040
in the same legislation,
the same process,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.650
in 2010, independent of
everyone else, the department

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:13.360
took to Congress on a change
in the American Indian probate.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.170
Reform Act, which said all
the permanent structures

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.890
on trust land should now
be considered fee land,

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:24.400
meaning they separated
permanent structures on the land

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.710
from the land ownership.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.690
And so what we've
got in Indian country

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.940
is this bifurcated ownership.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.920
If you buy a house in
a city here on a lot,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.430
600 years of real
estate law says

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.440
those two pieces are connected.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.930
In Indian country,
we've separated that.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:48.430
The unfortunate part is the
Bureau of Indian Affairs tracks

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.190
the trust land
underneath, and no one

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.050
tracks the ownership
of the property.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.500
The fee property, the buildings.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.650
And so we've got people out
there selling their trust

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:04.090
interest to the department,
but not selling their interest

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.950
in the other property.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.560
And that's becoming a real
problem for housing and other

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.030
pieces in Indian country.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.520
The other thing, 17--

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.240
18 states now, I think
maybe even 19 states now,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.240
allow for the use of
transfer on death deeds.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.960
So with simple estates, you can
say on the event of my death,

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.170
so-and-so gets my estate.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.960
In Indian country,
we can't do that.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.440
The federal government has not
passed the congressional act

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.690
that it needs to
allow us to do that.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.730
When money comes in
from Indian land,

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.190
it goes into what's called
an individual Indian money

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.500
account.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.500
Now some of you may
have said, jeez.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.340
All Indians get a check, right?

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.050
From the federal government?

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.720
Well, that's actually
their rent money

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.910
coming to them through
the federal government

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.860
issues by treasury.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.220
That account, the individual
Indian money accounts,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.820
because the undivided
interests have gotten so small

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.090
and the number of these
accounts has grown so large

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:10.390
that 50,000 of those accounts
have less than $15 in them,

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:14.440
and accrue less than $1 a year.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.740
If they go through
the probate process

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.720
that the federal
government has laid out,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.350
it costs $1,000 for
an expedited probate.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:30.400
And so for $15, we're paying
$1,000 in administrative fees

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.130
to probate that estate.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.100
With a transfer on death deed,
we could save all that money,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.380
and that's what we've
pointed out to them.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.460
We also want to allow for
electronic wills and storage

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.300
of the originals.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.850
So the federal government,
at least in Indian country,

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.380
is way behind the times.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.780
And you know, talking
to this group,

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.080
I'm sure you could get on
board with this, right?

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.250
So they won't accept any
electronic documentation

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.270
of a will.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.450
It has to be the original.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.670
Now if you file anything
in federal district court,

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.250
you'll know that you have
to do it electronically.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:13.580
They won't accept paper
pleadings anymore.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.550
It has to be done
electronically.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.050
But when it comes
to Indian wills,

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.180
they won't accept
an electronic will,

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.830
and we hope to change that
just simply so that people can

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:28.030
search the database of who
wrote a will and who didn't.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:33.460
We've had about 25% of the
Office of Hearings and Appeals,

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.260
the group that does the probate,
25% of that every year is spent

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.970
on going back and
reopening probates

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.930
that they thought
there was no will for,

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.180
and then somebody said,
oh, look what I found.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:55.860
All in all, I think what
happens in Indian land,

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.740
it can be somewhat summarized
by this next video.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.790
I mean, when he put this--

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:07.600
when we had him filmed,
I think he pretty much

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.974
summarized for everybody how
we all feel in Indian country.

00:46:12.974 --> 00:46:13.640
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:19.520
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:37.490
- This land today where I am,
this 320 acres, my grandma's

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:42.720
original allotment, it means
the world to me to be here,

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:48.190
to see that my grandma,
she herself had a vision,

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:54.330
to leave something for her kids
and keep her line, so to speak,

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:55.581
going in her family.

00:46:55.581 --> 00:47:01.350
And her son, which is my dad,
you know, passing it on to us

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.000
next.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.870
And I see the same
thing happening with me,

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.572
thinking for my kids.

00:47:08.572 --> 00:47:11.080
The land is critical to me.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.838
Without the land, I'm lost.

00:47:15.838 --> 00:47:17.991
I won't be me.

00:47:17.991 --> 00:47:21.135
I won't be excited
about doing things.

00:47:21.135 --> 00:47:23.964
I wouldn't be happy.

00:47:23.964 --> 00:47:25.180
And I'd probably be dead.

00:47:30.471 --> 00:47:31.914
[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.720
Like I said, I think
that pretty well

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.710
summarizes how an awful lot
of us in Indian country feel.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:41.940
This is what happens.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:46.580
This is what I feel like after
I blaze 200 years of Indian land

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.330
history in a 45-minute period.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.030
I showed that to some people
at the University of Wisconsin.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.972
A professor came up
to me afterwards.

00:47:55.972 --> 00:47:57.180
I think it was still playing.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.763
I didn't realize it
was still playing.

00:47:58.763 --> 00:48:02.940
And she goes, you know,
that's the most incredibly

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.590
disturbing thing
I've ever seen, but I

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.730
can't take my eyes off it.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.920
[LAUGHS]

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.750
So I'd be happy to
answer any questions

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.096
that folks might have.

00:48:15.215 --> 00:48:17.590
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: So I've been
getting a couple questions

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.673
from the audience that's
watching the live stream,

00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:22.510
so I'm going to start
with one of those.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.280
There's a question
about-- it's actually

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.870
two questions kind of related.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.620
The first is how
reclaiming Indian land

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.650
would impact Northeastern
Oklahoma where

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.429
there's a large population.

00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:36.970
And they were curious
whether there's

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.300
going to be any additional
impact by the ongoing "Royal

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.870
versus Murphy" case.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:46.764
Which, a lot of people
might not know what that is.

00:48:46.764 --> 00:48:47.680
CRIS STAINBROOK: Yeah.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.420
And I would hesitate to say
how far out that would go.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:59.420
Let me address the first
part, because I mean,

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.830
I think we get that a lot.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:04.140
We get a lot from
non-Indians as well.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.060
Our goal really is to
get back those lands that

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.280
were promised to us.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.170
Now there are some
pieces, especially

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:14.540
in Northeast Oklahoma,
where they did not

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.480
have traditional reservations.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:22.340
So they had what became
known as service areas.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:26.600
And we would still like to
get those areas, some lands

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.400
in those areas,
enough to support

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.510
Indian people and the tribes
back in Indian ownership.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.310
So yes, we're out there.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:41.180
The one thing I will
say for the most part,

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.050
we are not looking
for the courts

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:49.060
or the federal government to
return lands to the tribes

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.000
unless, of course, the
federal government still holds

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.410
that title.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.990
On private lands,
we're expecting

00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:00.130
and we're going to have to go
willing seller, willing buyer.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:06.220
So we, in fact, help the
tribes buy that land back.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.985
Will there be an impact
over time on an area?

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:17.060
What we're finding is wherever
there's a large population

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.650
of Indian people--

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:23.180
and this is a little
bit of one of those

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.720
no generalization is worth
a damn, not even this one.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.585
I think Mark Twain said
that or Samuel Clemens.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.670
Wherever you have an
Indian population,

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.200
you've got a fast
growing population.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.830
Like, mostly young people.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:46.460
And in the Plains especially,
the population of non-Indians

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:53.300
reached a peak generally
at the turn of the 1900s.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.850
The homesteading caused
this big influx of people

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:59.370
into the Plains, and
it became apparent

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:03.520
fairly quickly that you
couldn't survive on 160 acres.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.420
And so what we've
seen in the Plains--

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.410
North Dakota, South Dakota,
Eastern Montana, and Nebraska,

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:11.940
parts of Missouri, Kansas--

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.490
all of Kansas,
most of Oklahoma--

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.350
is that you need large tracts.

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:20.760
And what happens is the farmer
next door buys your tract,

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.340
and then he buys another tract.

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.350
And so we've got these
non-Indian landowners who

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.590
own big tracts of land, and
now they're 70 years old,

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.660
and they have no heirs.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.660
And so what we're
preparing to do

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.870
is really try and
buy those back.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.290
And the population in a
place like Northeast Oklahoma

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:42.780
over time will probably
start to expand again.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:49.630
Any other questions?

00:51:54.907 --> 00:51:56.865
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could explain,

00:51:56.865 --> 00:52:01.659
you used the word undivided
units or parcels or something.

00:52:01.659 --> 00:52:03.200
CRIS STAINBROOK:
Undivided interests.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.033
AUDIENCE: Interests.

00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:04.720
Thank you.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:10.660
CRIS STAINBROOK: So when
the land is in probate,

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.940
going from an original
allottee, for instance,

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:19.520
to the next set of heirs,
the land stays intact,

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.590
but the title divides.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:23.660
And so they're
undivided in the sense

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.420
that there's no physical
division of the land,

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.490
and they own it in common.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:32.030
So probably the best
way to think of it

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:36.230
is a glass of water, and you
each own a quarter of it,

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.090
but you can't pick
out your quarter

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:41.030
and hold it in your hand.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.250
That's the undivided
nature of it.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:48.110
And so what it
means in the end is

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:53.300
you have to have a process for,
who makes decisions over that?

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.580
And we've gotten
to the point where

00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:01.880
the Bureau of Indian Affairs has
defined that through US Code 25

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.270
as if you've got
more than 20 owners,

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:09.560
50% ownership has to agree
to any action on that.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.450
If you've got--

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:12.920
I don't know what
it is from there.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:19.850
It's like 11 to 20, then
60% have to agree to it.

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:25.730
And then from five to
11, 80% of ownership

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:27.240
has to agree to that action.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.470
And if there's five
or less, 90% has

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:33.620
to agree to it, which
usually comes down to veto

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.860
power more than agreement.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:42.080
But that's the undivided nature
of it is you own everything.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.079
You can't pick out your
part and say, that's mine.

00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:45.620
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:46.119
Thank you.

00:53:46.119 --> 00:53:47.689
CRIS STAINBROOK: Mm-hmm.

00:53:47.689 --> 00:53:48.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:50.030
Thanks for coming here today.

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.410
How can I help?

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:55.040
Like, how can I get involved?

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.060
CRIS STAINBROOK:
Well, two things.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:00.160
And first, let me dispense
with the one, right?

00:54:03.585 --> 00:54:08.030
Our development
person would be angry

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.450
if I didn't say you could
support us financially.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:12.560
You could do that.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.030
I think as important to
us and the Foundation

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:22.550
and the Indian people is to
become aware of the situation

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.730
so that when you
hear things like,

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:31.100
well, you know, reservations
are just a morass of poverty,

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.710
well, we have a fair
number that are destitute.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.020
There's no question.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:39.860
But part of it is because
we lost most of the land.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:43.730
And the land that we have
left is almost unmanageable

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:45.500
because of the
undivided interest

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.540
and the fractionated title.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:52.190
And so if we want to become
productive landowners,

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:56.670
we need to work on
getting that back.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.190
Being able to
inform your friends

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:02.890
and others of the situation.

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:07.320
I once said, I'd be happy
if we could get to a point

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.650
where we could show people
things like that social impact

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:14.190
bond piece and not
have people come out

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:18.590
of the woodwork to fight us just
because we're Indian, you know?

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.780
I mean, the social
impact bond piece

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.450
serves the taxpayers
of this country.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:30.315
It helps us move Indian country
further forward as well,

00:55:30.315 --> 00:55:31.980
and control our assets.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.050
And that's what we
would like from people

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:38.610
is that they just become
informed around some of that.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
again, as well, for coming.

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:41.730
So my question is
just in regards to--

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.392
I know you mentioned
that you obviously

00:55:43.392 --> 00:55:45.350
had Google's help in
regards to the GIS mapping

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.810
and different allocation of
the allotments and whatnot.

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:50.690
But you also mentioned that only
currently, I think you said,

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:54.750
you have about 7% of wills
already written at this point.

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.440
And I also know you said you
are unable to do currently

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.574
the electronic will.

00:55:58.574 --> 00:55:59.990
So I guess my
question for you is,

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.864
what's currently the
biggest barrier to entry

00:56:01.864 --> 00:56:04.400
in getting people to
participate or older generations

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.290
to actually go ahead
and write that will?

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.090
And how can technology
and everyone else

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:10.439
help in that regard?

00:56:10.439 --> 00:56:12.480
CRIS STAINBROOK: The
biggest impediment we've had

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.030
is we haven't had
enough people working.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.860
So for instance, we spent--

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:24.600
we have gone from foundation
grant to a small grant

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.690
from the federal government
to more foundation grant money

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:31.320
to finally, three years
ago, we had a grant

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.150
from the Office
of Special Trustee

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:36.510
to do three years
of will writing.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.470
But it's been this
happenstance of funding

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:42.800
to keep people in the field.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.220
When we first started,
people said, well,

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.220
Indian people won't
talk about death.

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.500
And in fact, they won't.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.800
But they'll talk about where
their assets are going.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.360
And that's what we
wanted them to do,

00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.430
and they're more than
willing to do that.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:03.180
We always end up in
a three-year project.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.950
At the end of the
project, we'll end up

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:10.040
with 200 wills in
process, but not done.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.460
And that's why we want to
do the social impact bond,

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.430
because it's of a scale
where we can move--

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:19.350
I mean, you write the wills.

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:24.910
Most of our clients
are 65 to 90 years old,

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.240
and that's why we can't
get more than 7%, right?

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.270
Because we go out and we write
all these wills, we go back,

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.380
we test it.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:36.280
We're probably at 7% because
we lost a bunch of people

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.560
along the way.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.560
The wills were probated.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.924
[LAUGHS]

00:57:39.924 --> 00:57:41.340
That's the nature
of the business.

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:45.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.780
I saw in your first
slide that you

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.363
said, like, the goal
of the foundation

00:57:48.363 --> 00:57:51.760
is to reclaim all
the land that still

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.080
retains aboriginal interest.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.200
And I was wondering
what exactly that means,

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.450
and how do you determine that?

00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:00.850
Is it just all the lands that
were promised at some point

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:03.114
to the Indians, or what is that?

00:58:03.114 --> 00:58:04.030
CRIS STAINBROOK: Yeah.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.780
The actual language of that is
inside the original reservation

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.440
boundaries.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.830
And so that's the
90 million acres

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:14.710
that we lost that were
promised to the exclusive use

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:18.340
and occupation by Indian people.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.940
And then the aboriginal
pieces of that

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.420
are those places outside
of the reservation boundary

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.920
where they still
hold an interest

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.230
for cultural or
religious reasons.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:35.539
But the 90 million is all
interior to the boundaries.

00:58:35.539 --> 00:58:36.080
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.480
Thank you.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.355
CRIS STAINBROOK: Yep.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:40.540
Thank you all very much.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.909
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:44.700
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: Thank
you so much to Cris

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.050
for coming for this talk.

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.080
We really appreciate it.

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.740
Thank you.
