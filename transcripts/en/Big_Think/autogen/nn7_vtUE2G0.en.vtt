I'm mostly excited I think these days
 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.040
I'm mostly excited I think these days
about kinds of technologies calls mixed

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050
about kinds of technologies calls mixed
 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.630
about kinds of technologies calls mixed
reality technologies or sometimes

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:10.640
reality technologies or sometimes
 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.290
reality technologies or sometimes
they're called hybrid technologies

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300
they're called hybrid technologies
 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.080

mobile phones are part of this we have a

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090
mobile phones are part of this we have a
 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.779
mobile phones are part of this we have a
motion capture lab at the school that

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789
motion capture lab at the school that
 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.159
motion capture lab at the school that
allows kids to work with wireless

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169
allows kids to work with wireless

that bleed between sort of physical

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289
that bleed between sort of physical
 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.409
that bleed between sort of physical
activity physical real-world spaces and

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419
activity physical real-world spaces and
 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.089
activity physical real-world spaces and
digital spaces I'm really interested in

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099
digital spaces I'm really interested in
 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.679
digital spaces I'm really interested in
this notion of getting the game off the

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689
this notion of getting the game off the
 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.190
this notion of getting the game off the
screen and thinking about gameplay as a

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200
screen and thinking about gameplay as a
 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.800
screen and thinking about gameplay as a
kind of lamination over top real-world

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810
kind of lamination over top real-world
 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.840
kind of lamination over top real-world
kinds of physical spaces and I think

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850
kinds of physical spaces and I think
 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.400
kinds of physical spaces and I think
technology is getting to a place where

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410
technology is getting to a place where
 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.170
technology is getting to a place where
that blended pneus is something that's

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180
that blended pneus is something that's
 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.550
that blended pneus is something that's
really possible today it used to be a

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560
really possible today it used to be a
 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.350
really possible today it used to be a
very science fictiony idea a couple

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360
very science fictiony idea a couple
 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.760
very science fictiony idea a couple
years ago people talked about alternate

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770
years ago people talked about alternate
 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.200
years ago people talked about alternate
reality all the time and you were

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210
reality all the time and you were
 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.270
reality all the time and you were
wearing these giant headsets be our

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
wearing these giant headsets be our
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.460
wearing these giant headsets be our
headsets and it just felt impossible

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470
headsets and it just felt impossible
 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.160
headsets and it just felt impossible
that that could be fun but technology

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170
that that could be fun but technology
 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.340
that that could be fun but technology
has evolved to a point where you can now

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
has evolved to a point where you can now
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.810
has evolved to a point where you can now
really think about gameplay being

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820
really think about gameplay being
 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.789
really think about gameplay being
blended with physical kind of real-world

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799
blended with physical kind of real-world
 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.800
blended with physical kind of real-world
spaces and that to me is is really

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
spaces and that to me is is really
 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.880
spaces and that to me is is really
exciting there's also been a lot of work

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890
exciting there's also been a lot of work
 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.959
exciting there's also been a lot of work
around artificial intelligence and sort

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969
around artificial intelligence and sort
 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.840
around artificial intelligence and sort
of digital characters recognizing

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850
of digital characters recognizing
 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.200
of digital characters recognizing
conversations with people and so I again

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210
conversations with people and so I again
 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.029
conversations with people and so I again
it gets into that blended notion of how

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039
it gets into that blended notion of how
 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.919
it gets into that blended notion of how
do we allow digital characters to feel

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929
do we allow digital characters to feel
 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.690
do we allow digital characters to feel
slightly more real than they do it in a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700
slightly more real than they do it in a
 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.580
slightly more real than they do it in a
sort of purely fictional space and and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
sort of purely fictional space and and
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.209
sort of purely fictional space and and
to me that's that's a really interesting

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219
to me that's that's a really interesting
 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.779
to me that's that's a really interesting
an interesting area to look at I tend to

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789
an interesting area to look at I tend to
 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.559
an interesting area to look at I tend to
be more interested in this notion of

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569
be more interested in this notion of
 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.849
be more interested in this notion of
playing games as part of the real world

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859
playing games as part of the real world
 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.090
playing games as part of the real world
and that's why the physical space ideas

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100
and that's why the physical space ideas
 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.499
and that's why the physical space ideas
are really of interest to me and why

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509
are really of interest to me and why
 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.090
are really of interest to me and why
mobile phones I think are increasingly

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100
mobile phones I think are increasingly
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.599
mobile phones I think are increasingly
of interest as game platforms the iphone

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609
of interest as game platforms the iphone
 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.010
of interest as game platforms the iphone
has changed everything i think in terms

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020
has changed everything i think in terms
 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.730
has changed everything i think in terms
of thinking about digital games and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
of thinking about digital games and
 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.010
of thinking about digital games and
gameplay and where games sit who plays

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
gameplay and where games sit who plays
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.849
gameplay and where games sit who plays
them what those games might be like and

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859
them what those games might be like and
 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.440
them what those games might be like and
that's really exciting I think

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.089
the thing that interest to me about

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099
the thing that interest to me about
 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.040
the thing that interest to me about
interest me really about games is the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050
interest me really about games is the
 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.320
interest me really about games is the
social fabric component of it the fact

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330
social fabric component of it the fact
 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.030
social fabric component of it the fact
that I am in this game with other people

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
that I am in this game with other people
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.070
that I am in this game with other people
and my interactions with them can become

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080
and my interactions with them can become
 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.720
and my interactions with them can become
increasingly interesting over time

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
increasingly interesting over time
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.850
increasingly interesting over time
depending on whether they're a friend or

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860
depending on whether they're a friend or
 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.059
depending on whether they're a friend or
foe in this space and so I'm very

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069
foe in this space and so I'm very
 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.360
foe in this space and so I'm very
interested in games that catalyze many

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
interested in games that catalyze many
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.170
interested in games that catalyze many
many people to be playing together but

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
many people to be playing together but
 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.570
many people to be playing together but
maybe doing that in an alternate reality

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580
maybe doing that in an alternate reality
 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.640
maybe doing that in an alternate reality
game sort of fit into the genre where

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
game sort of fit into the genre where
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.100
game sort of fit into the genre where
I'm doing things in my in the real world

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110
I'm doing things in my in the real world
 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.380
I'm doing things in my in the real world
that also may begin to have effects in a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
that also may begin to have effects in a
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.479
that also may begin to have effects in a
kind of digital virtual world so I'm

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489
kind of digital virtual world so I'm
 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.479
kind of digital virtual world so I'm
very interested in how beyond the social

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489
very interested in how beyond the social
 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.270
very interested in how beyond the social
how data can flow between actions and

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280
how data can flow between actions and
 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130
how data can flow between actions and
the real world and actions in a game

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
the real world and actions in a game
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.110
the real world and actions in a game
there's this whole new genre of games

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120
there's this whole new genre of games
 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.910
there's this whole new genre of games
that have just popped up called extra

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920
that have just popped up called extra
 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.030
that have just popped up called extra
games that connect exercise to gaming

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
games that connect exercise to gaming
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.220
games that connect exercise to gaming
and there's these ideas where you're

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230
and there's these ideas where you're
 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.289
and there's these ideas where you're
tracking how many steps people take and

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299
tracking how many steps people take and
 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.420
tracking how many steps people take and
its power that's powering up your

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430
its power that's powering up your
 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.039
its power that's powering up your
Pokemon there's a little device called

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049
Pokemon there's a little device called
 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.069
Pokemon there's a little device called
the Polka Walker that you can attach to

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079
the Polka Walker that you can attach to
 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.990
the Polka Walker that you can attach to
your shoe or carry with you and it's

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000
your shoe or carry with you and it's
 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.729
your shoe or carry with you and it's
like constantly powering up your video

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739
like constantly powering up your video
 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.379
like constantly powering up your video
game characters and I'm really

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389
game characters and I'm really
 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.289
game characters and I'm really
interested in that the data flow between

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299
interested in that the data flow between
 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.120
interested in that the data flow between
something and activity I might be doing

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130
something and activity I might be doing
 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.890
something and activity I might be doing
in the real world and some implication

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900
in the real world and some implication
 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.809
in the real world and some implication
in a virtual environment and also

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819
in a virtual environment and also
 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.629
in a virtual environment and also
potentially vice versa and so that's

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639
potentially vice versa and so that's
 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.289
potentially vice versa and so that's
more about notions of consequence and

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299
more about notions of consequence and
 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.780
more about notions of consequence and
impact and how that might change social

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790
impact and how that might change social
 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.970
impact and how that might change social
relations between who's in that game and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
relations between who's in that game and
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.100
relations between who's in that game and
what they're doing together

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110
 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.610
well generally I I put someone in a game

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
well generally I I put someone in a game
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.460
well generally I I put someone in a game
I play with them I think one of the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
I play with them I think one of the
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.570
I play with them I think one of the
reasons that there's been a lot of

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580
reasons that there's been a lot of
 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.370
reasons that there's been a lot of
criticism around games is there's a lot

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380
criticism around games is there's a lot
 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.530
criticism around games is there's a lot
of over-the-shoulder journalism going on

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
of over-the-shoulder journalism going on
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.390
of over-the-shoulder journalism going on
