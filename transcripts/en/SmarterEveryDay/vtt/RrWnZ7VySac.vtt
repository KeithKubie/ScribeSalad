00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.060
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.070
Today's observation that I'm gonna share with you is amazing. It's the discovery of

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
a new species of spider potentially, in the Amazon rainforest.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.160
I'm talking about the exact moment that we walked up and recorded

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.200
for science, video of a new species of spider that has

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.230
amazing behaviours. Let me set it up. Me, Gordon,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.250
and Phil, who's an entomologist were walking down this path in the rainforest with our headlamps

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.250
Gordon discovers something over here. He calls us. I hit record on the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.260
camera, turn around and walk towards Gordon.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.290
(Destin) So what happened?
- I don't know. They've- It's like they've evaporated.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
It's like something small living on there.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.410
Dude, is that a fake spider that that thing makes?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.440
(Destin) What's.. what's bumping that?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.480
- Yeah there's a bug living on there. That actually may have made a fake spider,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.490
out of debris.
- No!
- Not even kidding.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.510
(Destin) Oh man!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.550
- There's a ti.. It's a tiny spider disguised as a big spider.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.630
- Shut up!
- Or something.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.640
I can see over here..
- What's moving?
- It's a little spider on the other side.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.680
- I can't tell if it's a spider or a bug.
- It looked like a spider from this side.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.690
- Nuts! I've never ever ever seen that.
- Did we discover something?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.700
[laugh]
(Destin) Oh and let me manage my lizard bag.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.780
Where's the tiny spider?
- Dude it's a spider.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.820
- That is crazy. Oh I just realised I have my camera.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.870
- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Correct number of legs.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.870
On the fake.
- There's no way..

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.900
Cause that would mean that they could like.. they can count.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.930
(Destin) So he's vibrating it.. To make it look bigger. Is that what's happening?

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.960
- I think it might be.
- Yeah to make it look like it's moving.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
(Destin) He's so tiny though.
- Yeah but he's trying to look big.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.060
(Destin) OK. So we're in the jungle, and our current theory is

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.090
that this tiny tiny tiny spider at the top of this

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.140
keep me back-lit there Gordon, it's working good.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.200
This tiny spider has created.. is that dust?

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.230
are we thinking? Debris that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.250
looks like a big spider, and he's vibrating the whole

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.280
web to make it look like he is a big spider.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.290
- He's got.. he's counted legs.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.320
(Destin) Eight legs.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
This doesn't seem like it could be true.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.420
We have to..

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.450
research that. Vibrate it one more time mr.. There you go.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.500
Thank you. Alright, we'll go research.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Wow. We need Jeff's macro lens

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.550
is what we need.
- Well.. we know what this is.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.580
That's amazing.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.610
is it not? So the reason Phil and I were talking about a macro lens is we knew we had to get

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.620
that information out of the jungle and into the hands of the arachnologists back in the states.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.650
The camera lenses that we had on hand were only capable of taking photos like this, so we couldn't actually see

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.660
the spider on top. But Jeff however had a 60mm back at the lodge

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.710
so we went and got him and he took photos so you can actually see the spider up top. If you want to see what that looks

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.720
like go click here or in the link in the video description. You can see what that actual

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.720
spider looks like that made this whole decoy. So did we actually discover a new

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.790
species? If you look at the class for arachnids underneath it there's a genus

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.810
called cyclosa. And in cyclosa there's a specific type of spider called a trash-line

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.840
orb weaver. Now this orb weaver is able to go get debris, bring it back to his web,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.890
and create little bitty decoys and things like that in his web. So it sounds like we're

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.930
getting close, but here's the difference. We have not seen anything near this accurate

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.990
in these little trash-line orb weavers. First of all there's eight legs. That in itself is

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.030
mind blowing to me. But there's two other things I think are pretty cool as well. You notice that there's

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.080
both an abdomen on each one, but also there's a cephalothorax which is the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.100
combination between the head and the thorax. That is amazing. So the verdict is still out

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.110
on this one. We don't know if this is in fact a new species, however the arachnologists

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.150
at both Harvard and Cornell say they haven't seen anything like this before but they are reviewing

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.170
the data and they're gonna let us know. So, here's what we're gonna do. What would you name

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.180
this new species if you had the opportunity to name it? So leave me a comment and tell me

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.230
what it would be, however, I'm gonna tell you what we thought. I thought a really

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.270
good one would be the effigy spider. Jeff liked the debris spider,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.300
Phil liked the decoy spider, Gordon liked the mosaic spider.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.320
So anyway, leave a comment below. Tell me what you think it should be called,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.340
and I don't know, who knows? Maybe those researchers will read the comments and come up

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.360
with a name that you guys selected. So there you go. I hope you enjoyed it. News media outlets

[music]

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.500
So when I first walked up on this species, I thought I was looking at something that had been

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.510
attacked by cordyceps, which is a fungus that will go and attack the host species

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.560
and replace all the living tissue inside, while it's still living,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.570
with fungus. It's nasty stuff.
