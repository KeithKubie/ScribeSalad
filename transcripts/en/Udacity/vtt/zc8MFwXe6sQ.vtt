00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, we're going to investigate what happens when you connect a block

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to two springs not just one, and unlike in the shock absorbers problem, we're going to connect

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
these springs to each other not both directly to the block.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is what we call putting springs in series rather than

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in parallel like we did with the shock absorbers.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It turns out we can view a block dangles from two springs in this configuration

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as exactly the same as a single spring there with a different spring constant.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In other words, if I covered up the springs and you just watch the block oscillating up and down,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you wouldn't actually be able to tell the difference between these two cases.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The case where there are two springs connected and the case where there's just one.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For these two scenarios to be exactly equivalent, there actually has to be a very special relationship

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
between the spring constant K₃ and the spring constants K₁ and K₂

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and that's what I want you to solve for this problem.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I want you tell me what's the value of K₃ in terms of K₁ and K₂

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
such that these two scenarios produce exactly the same behavior,

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and at each of these block boxes here, you can put either plus, minus, or times--good luck!
