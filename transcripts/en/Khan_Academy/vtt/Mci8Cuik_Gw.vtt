00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.800
Let's see if we can take
the derivative with respect

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.360
to x of 2 to the x power.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.860
And you might say,
hold on a second.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.540
We know how to take the
derivative of e to the x.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.030
But what about a base like 2?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880
We don't know what to do with 2.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.590
And the key here is
to rewrite 2 to the x

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.310
so that we essentially
have it as e to some power.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.540
And the key there
is to rewrite 2.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.300
So how can we rewrite 2
so it is e to some power?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.800
Well, let's think about what e
to the natural log of 2 power

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.500
is.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.590
The natural log
of 2 is the power

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.090
that I would have to
raise e to to get to 2.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.990
So if we actually
raise e to that power,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.826
we are going to get to 2.

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:52.950
So what we could do, instead
of writing 2 to the x,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.600
we could rewrite this as e.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.890
We could rewrite 2 as e
to the natural log of 2,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.410
and then raise that
to the x power.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.140
So this is the x
power in yellow.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.420
And so let's do that
right over here.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.420
So instead of taking the
derivative with respect

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020
to x of 2 to the x,
let's say, let's just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.930
take the derivative
with respect to x

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
of the exact same
expression rewritten,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:31.580
of e to the natural log of
2 raised to the x power.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.930
Let me put this x in
that same color, dx.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.670
Now we know from our
exponent properties

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.630
if we raise something
to some power,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.230
and then raise that
to another power,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.150
we can take the product
of the two powers.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.710
Let me rewrite this
just to remember.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.270
If I have a to b, and then
I raise that to the c power,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.040
this is the exact same thing
as a to the b times c power.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.230
So we can utilize that
exponent property right here

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.360
to rewrite this as being equal
to the derivative with respect

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.457
to x of e to the natural
log of 2 times x.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.660
And what's neat
about this is now

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.370
we've got this into a form
of e to the something.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.330
So we can essentially use the
chain rule to evaluate this.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.550
So this derivative is going to
be equal to the derivative of e

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.414
to the something with
respect to that something.

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:34.580
Well, the derivative e to
the something with respect

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.496
to that something is
just e to that something.

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:42.640
So it's going to be equal
to e to the natural log of 2

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.626
times x.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:46.500
So let me make it clear
what I just did here.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.646
This right over here
is the derivative

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:55.640
of e to the natural
log of 2 times x

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.737
with respect to the
natural log of 2--

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:02.820
let me make it a little
bit clearer-- with respect

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.100
to the natural log of 2 times x.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.547
So we took the derivative
of e to the something

00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:10.880
with respect to that something--
that's this right here,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.730
it's just e to that something.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.784
And then we're going
to multiply that by,

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:16.700
this is just an application
of the chain rule,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.970
of the derivative of that
something with respect to x.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.570
So the derivative of natural log
of 2 times x with respect to x

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.910
is just going to be
natural log of 2.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.600
This is just going to
be natural log of 2.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.975
The derivative of a times x is
just going to be equal to a.

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:34.600
This is just the
coefficient on the x.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.900
And just to be clear,
this is the derivative

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.360
of natural log of 2 times
x with respect to x.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.460
So we're essentially done.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.200
But we can simplify
this even further.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.114
This thing right over
here can be rewritten.

00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:51.780
And let me draw a
line here just to make

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.196
it clear that this equals sign
is a continuation from what

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:55.320
we did up there.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.530
But this e to the natural log
of 2x, we can rewrite that,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.850
using this exact same
exponent property,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.710
as e to the natural
log of 2, and then

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.520
all of that raised
to the x power.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.420
And of course, we're multiplying
it times the natural log of 2,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.269
so times the natural log of 2.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.824
Well, what is e to
the natural log of 2?

00:04:20.824 --> 00:04:22.240
Well, we already
figured that out.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.690
That is exactly equal to 2.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.390
This right over
here is equal to 2.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.650
And so now we can simplify.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.060
This whole thing, the
derivative of 2 to the x,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.060
is equal to-- and I'll switch
the order a little bit--

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.760
it is the natural log of
2, that's this part right

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.700
over here, times 2 to the x.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.938
Or we could write it as 2 to the
x times the natural log of 2.
