00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.260
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.720
be discussing trade here, in the Indian Ocean.
Oh, my globe had a globe! We’re gonna do

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.330
some new-school history where we talk about
a system instead of talking about individuals

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.950
or some boring boring dynasty — no, Stan,
not that kind of Dynasty — yes, that kind of dynasty.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.620
So many world history classes still focus
on People Who Wore Funny Hats, and how their

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.080
antics shaped our lives, right? And while
it’s interesting and fun to note that, for

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.880
instance King Charles VI of France believed
that he was made out of glass, relentlessly focusing

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.860
on the actions of the Funny-Hatted-People who
ruled us makes us forget that we also make history.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.769
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Did Charles VI of France
really believe that he was made out of glass?

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.870
Yes, he did, but today we’re talking about
Indian Ocean trade and it’s going to be

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.930
interesting, I promise. So pay attention.
ALSO, NO HATS! This is a classroom, not a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.590
Truman Capote beach party!

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.630
[theme music]

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.660
So Indian Ocean trade was like the Silk Road,
in that it was a network of trade routes that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.310
connected people who had stuff to people who
wanted it and were willing to pay for it.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.420
And just as the Silk Road was not a single
road, there were lots of Indian Ocean trade

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.159
routes connecting various port cities around
the Indian Ocean Basin, including Zanzibar

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.869
and Mogadishu and Hormuz and Canton.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.549
By the way, before you criticize my pronunciation,
please remember that mispronunciation is my

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.520
thing and I’ve been doing it since episode
one, and nobody ever notices that it’s a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.350
thing! Sorry, I lost it there... But Indian
Ocean trade was bigger, richer, and featured

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.149
more diverse players than the Silk Road, but
it is much less famous probably because it

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.530
does not have a snazzy name.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.530
What do you think, Stan? Like the “Neptunian
Network”? No. “The Wet Web”? No, that’s

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.509
definitely not it. “The Sexy Sea Lanes of
South Asia”? No, that’s too hard for me

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.159
to say with my lisp... “THE MONSOON MARKETPLACE!”
Thanks, Danica. And now the tyranny of dates:

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.700
By about 700 CE, there was a recognizable
Monsoon Marketplace, but it really blew up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.429
between 1000 CE and 1200. It then declined
a bit during the Pax Mongolica, when overland

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.929
trade became cheap and safe, Thanks to-- wait
for it-- The Mongols. [Mongoltage] But then

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.229
Indian Ocean trade surged again in the 14th
and 15th centuries. So who was trading? Swahili

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.670
coast cities, Islamic empires in the Middle
East, India, China, Southeast Asia, and NOT

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.640
EUROPE, which is probably one of the reasons
that Monsoon Marketplace isn’t as famous

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.360
as it should be. Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.300
So if you live in China, and you need some
ivory to make the handle for a sword, you

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.000
have to trade for it, because elephants only
live in India and Africa. One of the reasons

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.910
Indian Ocean trade took off is that there
were a wide range of resources available and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.280
a wide range of import needs -- from ivory
to timber to books to grain. But the most

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.420
important thing was the wind.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.840
The Indian Ocean is home to a set of very
special winds called Monsoons. You generally

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.250
hear about Monsoons in the context of rain
in India, but rather than thinking of Monsoons

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.460
as the rain itself, think of them as the wind
that bring a rainy season. The great thing

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.960
about seasons is that they come regularly
-- and so do the Monsoon winds. So if you

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.160
were a sailor, you could count on the wind
to bring you from Africa to India if you sailed

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.240
between April and September, and one that
would bring you back to Africa if you sailed

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.340
between November and February. In fact, these
winds were so predictable that early maritime

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.300
travel guides often listed ideal times of 
down to the week and sometimes even the day.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.060
Predictable winds make trade a lot less risky:
Like, back in the day when the only power

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.260
for ships were sails and oarsmen, your cargo
might not arrive on time, or it might spoil,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.480
or you might die, all of which are bad for
the health of global economic trade. But predictable

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.890
winds meant lower risk, which meant cheaper
trade, which meant more trade, which meant

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.830
more people could have awesome sword handles.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.320
Okay, there are a few more facets of Indian
Ocean trade worth mentioning. First, Indian

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.210
Ocean trade incorporated many more people
than participated in Silk Road trade. There

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.470
were Jewish people and people from Africa
to Malaysia and India and China, all sailing

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.060
around and setting up trading communities
where they would act as middle men, trying

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.040
to sell stuff for more than they bought it for and trying
to find new stuff to buy that they could sell later.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.040
But despite this diversity, for the most part,
especially on the Western half of the Indian

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.350
Ocean basin, the trade was dominated by Muslim
merchants. Why? Largely because they had the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.320
money to build ships, although we will see
that in the 15th century, the Chinese state

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.100
could have changed that balance completely.
By the way, I need to point out that when

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.810
I say that the trade was dominated by Muslim
merchants, the emphasis should be on the merchants-

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.900
not the Muslim or the dominated.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.190
As previously noted, we tend to think that
states and governments and the funny-hatted

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.060
people who rule them are the real movers and
shakers in history, but that’s really not

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.340
the case. In the Indian Ocean, the terms of
trade were set by the merchants and by the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.190
demands of the market, not by the whims of
political rulers. And the self-regulating

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.320
nature of that trade was remarkable and pretty
much unprecedented. I mean, the most amazing

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.120
thing is that, except for a few pirates, all
of this trade was peaceful!

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.880
For the better part of seven hundred years
these merchant ships were free to sail the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.740
seas without the need for protection from
any state’s navy. This despite the fact

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.770
that some pretty valuable crap was being traded.
No, Thought Bubble, I meant that colloquially.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:04.650
Alright, we need to do the open letter before
Thought Bubble tries more puns. Magic!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.950
For today’s Open Letter, to further discuss
the relationship between merchants and nobles,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.010
we’re going to go inland to Kashmir where
Kota Rani was the ruler until 1339. Mostly

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.400
I just love this story. But first, let’s
find out what’s in the Secret Compartment.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.670
Oh, it’s Blowouts. Stan, are you asking
me to make a diarrhea joke? Because I’m

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.430
above that. I will, however, give you a party
blower solo.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.830
Dear Kota Rani, So, you had a pretty crazy
life. First, when you were a kid you were

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.200
kidnapped by a rival noble who disguised his
army as a bunch of merchants. Then you were

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.950
forced to marry your kidnapper who was the
ruler of Kashmir, but, then he died. And then

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.340
you became the ruler and you were really good
at it and everything was going awesome and

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.530
you were lining things up for your sons, but
then some dude comes in and decides he’s

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.090
going to marry you and forces you to do it
by attacking you. And so what do you do? Immediately

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.340
after your second wedding you commit suicide
by slicing open your belly and offer your

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.630
intestines to your horrible new husband as
a wedding present. Oh, Stan. I don’t want

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.360
to say it but I have to; That really took
guts, Kota Rani! Sorry... And all this because

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.050
your father welcomed an army into his house
thinking they were merchants.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.430
Best wishes, John Green

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.120
So, right. You wouldn’t let an army, or
a rival noble, into your house, but everyone

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.950
welcomes a merchant -- and not just royalty.
The great thing about seaborne trade is that

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.110
you can trade bulk goods like cotton cloth,
foodstuffs, and timber that’s all too heavy

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.020
to strap onto a camel or mule. So for the
first time we see the beginnings of goods

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.260
being traded for a mass market, instead of
just luxury goods, like silk for elites.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.650
Wood, for instance, can be used to build houses
-- but it’s not all that plentiful in the

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.520
Arabian peninsula, however, when it becomes
cheaper thanks to trade, suddenly more people

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.900
can have better houses. Much of the timber
that was shipped in the Monsoon Marketplace

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.450
came from Africa, which is kind of emblematic.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.790
Africa produced a lot of the raw materials
like animal hides and skin and ivory and gold.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.760
The Swahili city states imported finished
goods such as silk and porcelain from China

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.810
and cotton cloth from India. Spices and foodstuffs
like rice were shipped from Southeast Asia

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.740
and especially Sri Lanka where black pepper
was a primary export good, and the Islamic

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.710
world provided everything from coffee to books
and weapons. But it wasn’t just products

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.900
that made their way around the eastern hemisphere
thanks to the Indian Ocean.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.870
Technology spread, too. Like the magnetic
compass, which is kind of crucial if you like

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.540
to know where you’re going, came from China.
Muslim sailors popularized the astrolabe which

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.770
made it easier to navigate by the stars. Boats
using stern-post rudders were easier to steer,

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.870
so that technology quickly spread throughout
the Monsoon Marketplace. The Islamic world

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.870
also produced the triangular lateen sail,
which became super important because it allowed

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.919
for ships to tack against the wind. This meant
that a skilled crew could make their way through

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.580
the ocean even if they didn’t have a strong
tailwind. And just as with the Silk Road,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.710
ideas also traveled in the Monsoon Marketplace.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.270
For instance today, more Muslims live in Indonesia
than in any other country. And yes, I know

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.460
Indonesia has more than two islands. This
is not to scale, obviously. Knowing what you’ve

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.510
already learned about the growth of Islam
and the spread of trade, it won’t surprise

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.120
you to learn that Islam spread to Indonesia
via the Monsoon Marketplace. After the 1200s,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.550
the region which had previously been heavily
influenced by the Indian religions of Hinduism

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.580
and Buddhism, like witness this temple, for
instance... became increasingly Islamic as

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.300
rulers and elites adopted the religion so
they could have religious as well as economic

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.479
ties to the people they were trading with.
The conversion of most of a region to Islam,

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.850
where it continues to flourish today is a
pretty big deal. But Islam didn’t spread

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.410
as effectively to the to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia
or Vietnam because they weren’t centers of trade.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.270
How do you become a center for trade? Well,
let’s zoom in here to the strait of Malacca.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.870
You can see how it could act as a choke point
for trade. Any city that controlled that strait

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.740
could stop the ships from going through it,
or more likely tax them. And that’s exactly

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.630
what happened, to such an extent that a powerful
merchant state called Srivijaya rose up on

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.119
Sumatra. And for a while, Srivijaya dominated
trade in the region, because there were so

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:37.240
many ships going through the Strait of Malacca
to and from China. But, as we’ll see in

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.789
another episode that this trade abruptly declined
in the 15th century. And with it, so did Srivijaya.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.920
This brings up a key point about Indian Ocean
Trade, which is that it was indispensable

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.949
to the creation of certain city states, like
Srivijaya and the city states of the Swahili

00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:54.840
Coast. Without trade, those places wouldn’t
have existed, let alone become wealthy and grand.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.980
Trade was a huge source of wealth for these
cities because they could tax it; through

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.740
import and export duties or port fees. But
the fact that they are no longer powerful

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.880
shows that trade can be a pretty weak foundation
on which to built a polity, even a small one.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.540
There are many reasons for this: like high
taxes can motivate traders to find other routes,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.740
for instance, but the main one is this: Reliance
upon trade makes you especially vulnerable

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.540
to the peaks and troughs in the global economy.
The legacy of the merchant kingdom in Southeast

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.019
Asia is still alive and well in Singapore,
for instance. But one of the great lessons

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:26.350
of cities that have declined or disappeared
is that there’s usually a town nearby that’s

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.829
eager to take your place and happy to offer
lower taxes. It’s almost as if the merchants

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:34.990
decide where the people with the funny hats
go, rather than the other way around. Thanks

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.759
for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:41.540
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.639
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself. Our graphics

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:49.790
team is Thought Bubble, Last week’s Phrase
of the Week was: "Unless you are the Mongols."

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.589
If you want to suggest future phrases of the
week or guess at this week’s you can do

00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:57.059
so in comments where you can also ask questions
related to today's video that will be answered

00:09:57.059 --> 00:09:58.639
by our team of historians.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.160
Thanks for watching. and as we say in my hometown,
Don't Forget To Be Awesome. Oh! It's going

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.689
to be a crash!! Everything's fine...
