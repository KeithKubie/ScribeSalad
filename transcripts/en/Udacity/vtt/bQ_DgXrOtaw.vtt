00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
Developers, entrepreneurs,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.190
designers and all the rest,
please come a little closer.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.130
Here's one of the secrets
that we wanted to tell you.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.970
&gt;&gt; The key is to focus on
the long time value of the users.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.530
This is the best way for
sustainable, profitable businesses.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.474
If there's one thing you should take
out from this lesson, this is it.

00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:22.612
&gt;&gt; So we're done.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:24.640
&gt;&gt; Almost.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.940
Let's go just a bit deeper here.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.520
You want to avoid a quick sell,
Netflix, Basecamp, Zendesk,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.150
and many more are giving the user
the opportunity to try before they buy.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.660
Moreover, they let users
use their service on almost

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.950
any device from any shape and form.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.720
This is another critical success factor,
be everywhere.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.290
One look at the amount of devices that
Netflix supports will reveal to you

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.930
what we mean by saying be everywhere.
