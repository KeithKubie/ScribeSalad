00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.489
If you’ve ever walked through a museum or
an art gallery you may have noticed that a

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.969
lot of the art and historical treasure on
display is completely exposed.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.799
In fact, with the exception of some of the
world’s more famous pieces of art, you could

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.449
easily fall over and damage much of the artwork
on display worldwide, right now.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.340
So, what would happen if you did trip and
accidentally damage an irreplaceable priceless

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.340
piece of art?

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.600
As it turns out, not all that much.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.850
This is mainly because of two things- first,
museums and galleries will almost always have

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.390
insurance to cover any such damage.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.750
Second, accidents happen and the people running
the museums understand that.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.830
In fact, in nearly every case we could find
of a piece of artwork accidentally being damaged,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.549
no charges were pressed by either the museum
or, in some cases, the owner of the art in

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.549
question.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.690
In fact, it appears that the worst that might
happen in such a scenario is that you’ll

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.330
get banned from the museum.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.939
For example, consider the case of Nick Flynn,
a man who in 2006 tripped over his shoelace

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.080
while walking around the Fitzwilliam Museum
in Cambridge and knocked over three 17th century

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.390
vases worth about £175,000 (~$225,000).

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.670
Flynn noted of the experience,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.240
I snagged my shoelace, missed the step and
crash, bang, wallop.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.950
There were a million pieces of high quality
Qing ceramics lying around underneath me…

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.310
Although [I knew] the vase would break I didn’t
imagine it would be loose and crash into the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.310
other two.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.700
I’m sure I only hit the first one and that
must have flown across the windowsill and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.920
hit the next one, which then hit the other,
like a set of dominos.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.172
I can say with my hand on my heart that it
was not deliberate … it was just my Norman

00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:19.030
Wisdom moment, just one of those unbelievably
unlucky things that can sometimes happen.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.220
The museum official’s response was to merely
send him a letter advising Flynn “not to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.480
visit the museum again in the near future.”

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.670
Yes, he didn’t even technically get banned;
just politely asked to abstain from visiting

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.670
for a while.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.540
In fact, the museum didn’t even identify
Flynn to the public to spare him the embarrassment

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.700
of being known as the guy who tripped and
knocked over three vases that, before encountering

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.730
Mr. Flynn, had managed to survive about four
centuries and a full six decades sitting on

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.230
those very windowsills.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.859
(We only know his name because British tabloids
tracked him down after the fact.)

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.390
In another example, this one in 2015, a 12
year old boy tripped while visiting a Taiwanese

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.780
art exhibition.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.650
During his fall forward, he managed to punch
a hole through a 350 year old painting, Flowers,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.780
by Paola Porpora, valued at about $1,500,000…

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.959
(You can watch the video of this happening
here.)

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.870
The organisers of the exhibition went out
of their way to assure the boy and his family

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.269
that they wouldn’t be liable to pay any
damages nor in any trouble legally.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.009
In fact, one of the organisers, Sun Chi-hsuan,
publicly insisted that the boy wasn’t to

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.009
blame.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.680
In yet another case, in 2010, a young woman,
who as per usual with these sorts of things

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.810
went unnamed publicly, damaged a $130,000,000
Picasso painting called The Actor by falling

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.340
into it during an art class.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.859
The result was a six inch tear in the lower
right-hand corner.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.400
In this specific case, the museum officials
were more concerned with reporting that the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.930
woman was uninjured than the fact that her
accident had potentially wiped away half the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.930
painting’s value.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.550
So those are pure accidents.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.250
What about more negligent cases?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.810
All evidence would seem to indicate that museums
and galleries similarly seem hesitant to do

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.579
anything to the patron in question.

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.620
Beyond countless selfie-related accidental
destruction of art that has become something

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.970
of a frequent occurrence in recent years,
there is the case of a clock made by artist

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.301
James Borden that hung in Columbia Pennsylvania’s
National Watch and Clock Museum for over two

00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.520
decades before being destroyed.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.220
How did it meet its end?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.570
An elderly couple began touching and pulling
on its various bits, seemingly trying to see

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.670
what the clock looked like when working; this
ultimately caused the clock to come crashing

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.670
down.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.670
(You can watch a video of this here.)

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.070
The museum chose not to press any charges
nor seek compensation for the damages.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.370
In fact, as in other examples, they didn’t
even berate the individuals in the press,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.100
choosing not even to name them at all.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.530
That said, we did find one exception to this
“no fault” negligent destruction of art

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.530
general rule.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.389
This happened when a tourist scaled the facade
of a Portuguese train station to take a selfie

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.539
with an 1890 statue of Dom Sebastiao, resulting
in the statue’s destruction when said tourist

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.389
accidentally knocked the statue over and it
shattered on the ground below.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.810
The unnamed man was later charged with destruction
of public property.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.720
As for the non-public, even in cases where
museum or gallery staff damage or destroy

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.599
the art, the individual usually gets off with
only a slap on the wrist if it truly was an

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.599
honest accident.

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.580
For example, in 2000, some porters at the
Bond Street auction house accidentally put

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.349
a painting by artist Lucian Freud, valued
at £100,000 (about $130,000), into a crushing

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.349
machine…

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.210
The painting was stored in a large wooden
box, which the porters assumed was empty and

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.050
put out with the rest of the trash.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.639
The auction house assured papers that the
porters wouldn’t lose their jobs over the

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.930
matter, and that it was an honest mistake.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.759
In another case, an unnamed cleaning lady
tossed a bunch of modern art valued at about

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.919
$15,000 into the garbage in 2014.

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.370
To be fair to the cleaning lady, the “art”
in question, created by modernist Paul Branca,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.270
was a bunch of cardboard boxes haphazardly
strewn across the floor of a section of the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.270
gallery (modern art everybody).

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.090
Again, no action was taken against the cleaner.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.870
(We can only hope Mr. Branca was on his game
that day, and he simply took the opportunity

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.259
to go full meta-on it, displaying his former
cardboard box art now in the garbage bin,

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.380
perhaps even increasing its value in that
case…)

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.460
All this said, while it appears most museums,
galleries and even artists will take the destruction

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.680
or damage of their work in good humor if done
accidentally (even if there was a fair bit

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.650
of negligence involved), the same can’t
be said if the damage is malicious.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.949
In these cases, the museum can and will press
charges, and one might expect a bit of jail

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:16.949
time.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.569
For instance, in the aforementioned vase-smashing
story, sometime later there was some thought

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.830
that Flynn had smashed the vases on purpose
for the publicity of it (given his going out

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.440
of his way to give interviews about it and
some of his comments therein, despite that

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.270
the museum had so carefully avoided assigning
any blame or mentioning his name).

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.590
As a result, he was eventually detained for
a night, though noted he was treated very

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.039
well while under arrest, with the police simply
trying to determine if he’d done it on purpose.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:45.249
Once they decided it had indeed been an accident,
he was let go with no further consequences.

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:48.930
In another instance, one Andrew Shannon punched
a Monet painting, Argenteuil Basin with a

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.300
Single Sail Boat, then worth about £7m (about
$9 million).

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.189
He later claimed he tripped and fell and it
was an accident, but security footage clearly

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:57.789
showed him intentionally punching the painting.

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.740
When he was detained by security guards, a
can of paint stripper was also found in his

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.740
pocket.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.030
He was given a five year prison sentence.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.300
This brings us to perhaps the most obvious
question that arises from all this- why is

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.020
such valuable, and often irreplaceable, art
stored in such a way that people can just

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.500
walk up to it and damage it (whether accidentally
or not).

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.879
Well one reason is cost- placing every painting,
sculpture and fresco behind protective glass

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:26.590
or under the careful watch of a burly guard
is expensive.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.289
Contrary to the value of the pieces they sometimes
contain, museums and art galleries often aren’t

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:32.289
swimming in money.

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.500
A second, perhaps more important reason, is
that it would disrupt the experience of viewing

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.629
the art in question; ensuring the art can
be properly appreciated is of tantamount importance

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.839
to those running various museums and galleries.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:48.099
It’s noted that said institutions have to
constantly strike a balance between “keeping

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:51.789
works of art accessible to the public, and
protecting them at the same time”.

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:56.039
Such a balance necessitates a degree of trust
be placed in the public to not paw at the

00:07:56.039 --> 00:10:30.709
priceless works of art on display and to otherwise
be careful 

00:10:30.709 --> 00:11:11.620
around them.
