so if we start with the premise that we

so if we start with the premise that we
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150
so if we start with the premise that we
need to reduce substantially the amount

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
need to reduce substantially the amount
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.910
need to reduce substantially the amount
of greenhouse gas emissions by roughly

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
of greenhouse gas emissions by roughly
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310
of greenhouse gas emissions by roughly
an order of magnitude we'll need to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
an order of magnitude we'll need to
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.010
an order of magnitude we'll need to
start rethinking the way we produce use

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.290
States well if it is that the if that is
the case then we need to start series of

the first instance is that most of the

a substantial portion of money was
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.120
a substantial portion of money was

you - can we actually reduce by pursuing
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.199
you - can we actually reduce by pursuing
energy efficiency strategies so we've

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209
energy efficiency strategies so we've
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.479
energy efficiency strategies so we've
done so by creating a model that looks

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
done so by creating a model that looks
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.220
done so by creating a model that looks

so what you see in the fear is on the

so what you see in the fear is on the
 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.820
so what you see in the fear is on the
y-axis the cost of effectiveness of

the amount of co2 emissions that can be
avoided through those interventions so

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360
avoided through those interventions so
 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.479
avoided through those interventions so
every little point in that curve

every little point in that curve
 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.550
every little point in that curve
corresponds to for example switching

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560
corresponds to for example switching
 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.860
corresponds to for example switching
from incandescent to fluorescent lamps

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870

corresponds to actually things that will
 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.640
corresponds to actually things that will
save money to consumers and that are

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
save money to consumers and that are
 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.860
save money to consumers and that are
cost effective the red area corresponds

cost effective the red area corresponds
 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.660
cost effective the red area corresponds
to things where consumers would need to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
to things where consumers would need to
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.960
to things where consumers would need to
spend money to reduce co2 emissions so

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
spend money to reduce co2 emissions so
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.759
spend money to reduce co2 emissions so
in an in a nutshell what we found is

in an in a nutshell what we found is
 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.910
in an in a nutshell what we found is
that we could achieve 30% of emissions

there are several factors some related

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
there are several factors some related
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.199
there are several factors some related
to markets some related to behavior that

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209
to markets some related to behavior that
 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.220
to markets some related to behavior that

prevents this potential from being
 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.000
prevents this potential from being
achieved so what are those factors what

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010
achieved so what are those factors what
 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.039

those rebound effects actually matter or

those rebound effects actually matter or
not some argue that those effects are so

argue that they are so large that they

argue that they are so large that they
 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.580
argue that they are so large that they
can actually backfire this means that

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590
can actually backfire this means that

to the indirect ones so the gasoline

from driving but also to build your car
and etc so the scenario that we're

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879
and etc so the scenario that we're
 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.879
and etc so the scenario that we're
trying to look at is when you pursue an

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889
trying to look at is when you pursue an
 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.339

the figure how much of that is going to

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909
the figure how much of that is going to
 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.329
the figure how much of that is going to
be used to drive more and how much of

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:14.339
be used to drive more and how much of
 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:16.670
be used to drive more and how much of
this is going to be allocated to other

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680
this is going to be allocated to other
 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.969
this is going to be allocated to other
end users so by using income and price

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979
end users so by using income and price
 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.980

elasticities and the series of different

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.629
scenarios for different income levels
what we found is that in fact there is

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639
what we found is that in fact there is
 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.389
what we found is that in fact there is
no evidence of backfire so the emissions

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:29.399
no evidence of backfire so the emissions
 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.860
no evidence of backfire so the emissions
are always reduced and the energy

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870
are always reduced and the energy
 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.600
are always reduced and the energy
consumption is always reduced after

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610
consumption is always reduced after
 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.149
consumption is always reduced after
those interventions it is also the case

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:35.159
those interventions it is also the case
 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.279
those interventions it is also the case
that the rebound effects both the direct

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:37.289
that the rebound effects both the direct
 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.769
that the rebound effects both the direct
and indirect are not overwhelming they

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:39.779
and indirect are not overwhelming they
 

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:41.510
and indirect are not overwhelming they
are always less than 30%
