00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.565
- What I want you to do is pause the video

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:05.480
and think about what 27 minus one is,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.322
and then think about what 27 minus 10 is.

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:11.578
Alright, you might have found it pretty straightforward,

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.828
but I want to think about it in terms of place value.

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:18.669
So let's focus on 27, so 27,

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.620
I have two in the 10's place so that two means two 10s

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.332
and we seen them here, two groups of 10,

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:27.612
and then we have seven in the one's place

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:30.445
and we see those seven ones right over here.

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:32.253
Now I'm going to subtract one,

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:35.740
I'm subtracting one, one is another way to think about it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.260
because this is in the one's place here,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.568
so I'm going to take away one.

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:40.626
So let's just take away one like that,

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:42.223
and then what am I left with?

00:00:42.223 --> 00:00:44.266
Well I still have my two 10s

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.900
so I could put a two in the 10's place,

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.591
so I still have a two in the 10's place.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.814
And now how many ones do I have?

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:53.989
Well I used to have seven, I took one away

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.665
now I have six ones,

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:03.421
so two 10s and six ones, well we call that 26.

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.785
Now let's think about 27 minus 10.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:10.595
So once again this is 27, two 10s and seven ones

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:13.241
and now we're not going to take away any ones,

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:15.663
but we're going to take away one 10.

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:20.497
Let's just remind ourselves, a 10 is literally one 10.

00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:22.243
I know that sounds like I'm saying the same thing

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:23.437
over and over again,

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.930
but I really want you to appreciate the place value.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.217
This is the 10's place and I have a one there

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:32.140
so I am going to take away one 10 and zero ones.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.210
So let's take away that 10.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.623
So let's take away, maybe I'll take this one away.

00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:40.316
I'll do it in a color that's easier to see.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:43.530
So I could take that away, and then what am I left with?

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.690
How many 10s am I left with?

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.121
Well now I only have one full group of 10

00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.493
so I have one 10, so that's the 10's place right over there.

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:54.413
And how many ones do I have?

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.615
Well I still have seven ones,

00:01:56.615 --> 00:02:00.892
so I still have seven in the one's place.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:05.975
So 27 minus 10 is one 10 and seven ones, or 17.

00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:08.298
And another way that you could think about it,

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:09.770
and this might be the way that you did it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.286
when I first asked you to do it.

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:13.410
Hey, if I'm taking away a one

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.567
I'm going to reduce my one's place by one,

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.888
so I'm going to go from 27 to 26.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.732
But if I'm taking away a 10,

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:21.992
then my ten's place is going to go down by one

00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:23.850
so I go from a two in the ten's place

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.309
to a one in the ten's place,

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.581
I go from 27 to 17.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:30.231
The one's place didn't change.
