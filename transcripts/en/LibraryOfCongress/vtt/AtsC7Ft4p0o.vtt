00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.330
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.750
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: I am very excited
to be able to introduce one

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.820
of my children's and my
favorite illustrators,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.750
Sophie Blackall, who I love.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.910 position:56%
There's so many books of hers that
I love that I didn't know which ones

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.450
to start with but certainly
the Ivy and Bean series,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.110
The Big Red Lollipop, Ruby's Wish
and most recently Finding Winnie,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.640
which won the 2016 Caldecott Medal.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.910
It's a wonderful story and I can't
believe we're just learning now

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.610
about the true story of the real
bear that became Winnie The Pooh.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.880
In addition to her books,
Sophie's art has appeared

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.450
in numerous publications
and as part of the Measles

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.170
and Rubella Initiative,
an international effort

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.140
to eliminate those two diseases.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.880
But, anyway, now here
to tell you more

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.510
about herself is Sophie Blackall.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.390
[ Applause ]

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.600
&gt;&gt; Sophie Blackall: Thank
you very, very much.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.580
Before I even get started,
I have a magic microphone

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.360 position:56%
so I don't even have to stand there,
which is very exciting and I'm going

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.900
to try not to fall
off on top of you.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.530
I'm very excited to be here and
before I get started I just want

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.460
to thank all of the
thousands of volunteers

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.360
who have been here today
doing things like helping me

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.210
and bringing me water
and helping everybody.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.370
It's been an extraordinary effort.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.000
Somebody told me there were
100,000 people here today,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600
which is mind-boggling.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.290
So, my name is Sophie Blackall
and I'm going to tell you mostly

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.670
about Finding Winnie today.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.640 position:56%
I grew up in Australia, which looks
like this so you can all understand,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.710
obviously, why I left it to live
in New York, which looks like this.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.420
Not yet, but it will soon enough.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.080
I was once a child,
it's hard to believe,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.290
I looked pretty much the same
except younger, and when I was

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.510
about seven my mother worked in an
antique shop and every afternoon

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.280
after school I had to go and
hang out in this antique shop

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.100
and I don't know about you
but when I was seven I was not

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.630
that interested in antiques,
especially furniture.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.090
It was really boring.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.100
So I had to spend all this time
in the shop and I was so bored

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.600
in the antique shop that I had
to pick up the only book that was

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.220
in there and it was a very dusty
looking book and I picked it up

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.410
and I started reading
it and do you know what?

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.980
It was fantastic.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.700
It was this book.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.110
I still have it.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.940
It was Winnie the Pooh.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.890
And I had never read
a book like this!

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.150
It was a book that meandered and
backtracked, that had digressions

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.030
and interjections,
that kind of pulled you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.190
into the very forest itself
and also, at the same time,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.540
kind of let you step back and see
what a book is actually made of

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.140
and I fell in love with the
characters in it and I never wanted

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.420
to leave them behind
and I kind of didn't

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.620
because it is still
my favorite book.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.810
When I grew a little bit
older and I didn't have to go

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.280
to the antique shop anymore I was
allowed to walk home on my own

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.400
and I would walk the long way
home past the butcher shop

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.120
and I wasn't buying meat, you
know, I was seven or eight,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.140
but the butcher, I would get to
the door and I would open the door

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.660
and he would see me and he
would roll up three sheets

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.690
of butchers paper, which is big,
white sheets of paper that he used

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.920 position:56%
to wrap sausages up in and he would
roll that paper up for me to draw on

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.640
and he would also give
me a piece of boloney.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.590 position:56%
And in my memory he kind of threw
it to me and I caught it in my mouth

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.250
but I think I'm confusing
myself with my dog.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.640
Anyway, I took the paper home
and ate the boloney on the way

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.170
and I would draw and I would
trace my favorite drawings,

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.080
which were Ernest Shepherd's
drawings in Winnie the Pooh

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.010
and I thought maybe one
day I might do this,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.680
maybe one day I might
make pictures in books.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.250
So I didn't do that for awhile
but I went to art schools

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.200 position:56%
and I did paintings of butchers
because I have always loved butchers

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.110
and then to make money, because
it's really boring as a grown up

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.110
but you kind of have to make
money, I did paintings of things

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.280
like stain removal and
household tips for a magazine.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.490
It was a high point in my career.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.600
Around this time I had a baby and
then another baby and then I came

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.440
to live in New York when I won
a green card in the lottery.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.060
I've been here for 16 years and
sometimes I inadvertently dress

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.420
as your flag because I love it so.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.580
And in those 16 years I've
made about 35 books, I think,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.970
and here are some of them
that you might've seen.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.110
And around 2013 I received a
manuscript from the editor,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.390 position:56%
Susan Rich, at Little Brown, and
Susan Rich sends all her manuscripts

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:32.310
like this and it was the story
of the true bear, the true story

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.890
of the real bear that
inspired Winnie the Pooh.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.080
And I talked to Susan; we had
an amazing breakfast with a lot

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.420
of pancakes and we talked
about Winnie the Pooh

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.420
and how it had been my first book
that I bought with my own money

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.590
because I think we all
remember the first book

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.110
that we bought with our own money.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.800
Not the one that was given to us,
not the one that we chose ourself

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.110
from the library but had to
give back but the first one

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.210
that we bought with our
own money and got to keep.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.960
And I bought this puppy from
my mother; she sold it to me.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.400
She didn't give it to me she
sold it to me and I was seven

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.720
and I didn't have any money
because seven-year-olds are,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.230
you know, not usually rich.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.570
But it cost a dollar and I polished
the steps up to the antique shop,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.680
10 cents a step until I earned it.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.010
And I was so worried the whole time
that somebody else would buy it

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.580
and so I'd hide it in the shop
while I was polishing the steps.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.700
So I have this book and it means
so much to me, this first book

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.080
that I bought and the drawing.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.520
So Susan and I talked about all
of this and then I started work

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.860
on this book and it was such a joy.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.590
The book, Finding Winnie, is
about Captain Harry Colebourn,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.890 position:56%
and it's written by his real-life
great granddaughter, Lindsey Mattick

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.260
and it's written as a story that
she's telling to her son, Cole,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.430
who is a little boy
about 3 at the time.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.120
And the story is about
Harry, who in the beginning

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.750
of World War I was a veterinarian.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.870
He looked after horses and cows and
he joined the army to go and fight

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.980 position:56%
in the war and he was going to be in
the Second Canadian Infantry Brigade

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.010
and he was going to take
care of horses on the front.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.100
And he joined many other young
men and they went to train

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.450
in [inaudible] Canada and on the
train on the way there they stopped

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.740 position:56%
at a station and Harry got out to
stretch his legs because they'd been

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.020
on the train for days
and on the station there

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.680
in White River he saw an
orphaned black bear cub

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.530 position:56%
that was sitting there with a
trapper and he said to that trapper,

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.830
"I'll give you $20
for that bear cub."

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.610
Twenty dollars was all the money
he had, which was about $300

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.350
in our money and he just took it
out of his pocket and he gave it

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.040
to this trapper and
then he had a bear cub.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.600
And what was he going
to do with a bear cub?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.580
And what was he going
to do with a bear cub?

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.880
He was going to war.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.450
But he took this bear and he
knew there was something special

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.130
about this bear and he
thought, what will we call her?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.120
We all came from Winnipeg;
all the soldiers

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.770
that were together
came from Winnipeg.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.170
So they decided to call her
Winnipeg, Winnie for short

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.240
so they would never
feel far from home.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.480
So they went to train on the
green fields of [inaudible]

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.950
and that's the hospital where
he was looking after the horses

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.040 position:56%
and so many other young men
trained with them and they were keen

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.970
and excited to get to war,
at least I imagine they were

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:24.120
and they had no idea
what was to come.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.810
Harry and Winnie were inseparable
by this point and when it came time

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.260
to sail across the
Atlantic to England,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.210
Harry had to make a
difficult decision.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.610
His head argued one way but
his heart argued the other

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:46.080
and he took Winnie with him on what
was probably the greatest armada,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.390
the greatest passage of
ships and horses and men ever

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.040
to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.130
I don't know if you can see
Winnie up there on the bow.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.220
When they arrived in [inaudible]
it rained and rained and rained

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.260
and the men posed for
photographs with Winnie

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.160
so they could send them
back to their families

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.540
and then the order came to
fight in fronts and the trenches

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.990
and Harry knew he couldn't take
a bear really to war so he had,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.800
for the second time, a
difficult decision to make

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.070
and he borrowed a car and
drove Winnie to the London Zoo

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.930
and he said goodbye to her
there knowing she would be safe.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.700
And she was safe and she
charmed everyone who met her,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.880
most notably a small boy
called Christopher Robbin,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.950
whose father was A.A. Milne.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.710
And A.A. Milne would go on to
write stories about boy and bear

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.360
that are some of the most
beloved books of all time.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.450
When I set about making a book
I read the story and I think

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.590
about how the pictures are going
to go and how they're going to fit

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.820
with the words and I make a
kind of map of those drawings

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.940
and then I make each
drawing a little bit bigger

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.720
and a little bit neater and around
this time I show them to my editor,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.420
Susan, and the art director
and we talk about them

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.610
and they tell me everything
that's wrong with them and I try

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.110
and fix all those things and then
I make neater, bigger drawing

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.120
and then eventually I paint

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.500
that once we've all decided
it's probably going in more

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.100
or less the right directly.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.800
And you can see little differences
like Winnie was before she was

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.770
on the bench and then she
moved to be behind the bench

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.000
so there were still some little
changes to be made at that point.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.620
Here's another pencil sketch
and here it is in color.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.400
With a book like Finding
Winnie, which is a true story,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.520
it's non-fiction, there's a lot
of research involved which is,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.820
fortunately, one of my
favorite parts of making a book.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.680
This is Captain Harry
Colebourne's real diary

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.570
that we kept during the war and
it's noted there on August 24th

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.370
that he bought a bear for $20.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.990
Because the author is Lindsey
Mattick and she had all

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.510 position:56%
of her family artifacts and
ephemera that I could actually touch

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.010
and look at, which was
an amazing experience

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:08.030
and made my job a whole lot easier,
photographs of Harry and Winnie.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.570
This drawing was based
on this real photograph.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:18.290
You can see Winnie up
there in the front.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.450
I went looking for bears,
as you do, out in the woods

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.010
and I called them and,
you know, they never came,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:29.940
which was very disappointing
and I not very wisely think

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.240
that bears would like me.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.210 position:56%
I have no foundation for this but
they still have not come so I looked

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.200 position:56%
at photographs of bears and I flew
to London and went to the London zoo

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.260
and the archives in the London zoo,
which is like a library in the zoo

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.280
and the librarian showed me a
great big book called the daily

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.280 position:56%
occurrences in which the zookeeper
would write everything that happened

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.980
that day in the zoo, everything
from when an animal got sick

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.780
to a new animal was born
or one arrived or departed

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.770
and this is the day, he brought
it out of a big box to show me,

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.790
the very day that Winnie
arrived at the London Zoo.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.880
I looked at pictures of the
brand new [inaudible] terraces,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.030
which was just built when
Winnie was put there,

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.210
it was where the bears lived,
and I looked at the zoo now

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.030
at the [inaudible]
terraces and oddly enough,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.430
it's where they keep the
Australian marsupials.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:25.810
So was able to visit my countrymen,
the wallabies and kangaroos.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.570
This photograph, which I had seen
again and again in my research,

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.010
of Christopher Robbin feeding
Winnie condensed milk on a spoon,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.320
the original photograph
was there in the archives

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.420
and when you saw the whole
photograph you could see,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.070
a little blurry at
the top, A.A. Milne

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.330
and nanny looking down
into the enclosure.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.310
And it just struck me, it actually
strikes me every single time I look

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.590
at this photograph, just how
odd it is to allow your child

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.860
into an enclosure with a wild bear.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.970
But Winnie was no ordinary
bear, as we know.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.430
I wanted to show the day that
Winnie is left at the zoo,

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.400
I wanted to show just that
parting and how profoundly full

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.110
of sorrow it was so I wanted to
show her tiny in this vast zoo

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.100
and I had an idea to make it
like an aerial photograph,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.140
and this was the math, which
was closest in time period.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.150
We were talking 1914 and this map
was 1913, but I wanted it to look

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.400
like this much earlier map, which
was more of a bird's eye view

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.010
so I had to research every
single building to see,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.830
because they had all moved, to
see what they looked like in 3-D

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.210
so that I could draw them in the
correct space of the 1913 map,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.870
which was, you know, I've
already lost you I'm sure.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:46.260
It was weeks and weeks of dead
ends and backtracking but,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.560
you know, that's what I live for.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.860
It was fantastic fun and I put all
sorts of little secrets in there.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.360
Like in 1913 they thought
it was a great idea to try

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.760
and make the enclosures a little
bit more like natural habitats

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.420
so they put the seals and the
penguins in together because,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.410
you know, they coexist in real
life so that makes sense, except,

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.850
of course, that the penguins
were extremely delicious

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.750
and that their numbers
diminished day by day

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:14.480
so I just left one unsavory penguin
in the enclosure with the seals.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.770
I went to the war museum in
London and read soldiers' diaries

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.540
and looked at maps where they
would have walked and learned

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.770
that the Canadian soldiers
had boots with cardboard soles

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.780
that disintegrated in the mud
and these details never went

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.700
into the book but I know that
they're there and it helped me

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.630
to really feel the story and
how Winnie and Harry and all

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.140
of the soldiers might have
felt in these conditions.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:45.600 position:56%
Looking at the maps I realized that
when Harry and Winnie went to London

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.750
from the [inaudible]
they passed Stonehenge

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.130
so I had the perfect excuse to put
Stonehenge in except, of course,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.000
I had to find photographs of what
Stonehenge looked like in 1914

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.570 position:56%
from the very direction I was going,
which is not as easy as it sounds

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.570
because people care
about these things.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.620
A lot of people know a
lot about Stonehenge.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:09.340
The crossing of the ships, another
thing that people know a lot about.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.650
This is the only visual reference
that exists and it's a lovely,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.010
patriotic painting
called Canada's answer

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.970 position:56%
but it didn't give me a whole lot of
help of what each ship looked like

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.880
and I had a list of the
formation that they sailed in

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.360
and I knew what Winnie and
Harry's ship looked like,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.670
which was the S.S. Manitou.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.690
So I did a sketch and
then I looked at the list,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.950
which was on the military
archives, and it was sort

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.730
of like a game of battleships.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.070
I had to kind of figure out
by process of elimination

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.770
which ones I couldn't find, which
ones I could, how to show them

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.320
in the right order and
while I was thinking

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:49.050
about battleships I found this game
that I loved as a kid but clearly,

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.360
girls and their mothers are not
allowed to play battleships.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.080
Their job is to enjoy from afar as
they do the washing up as the sons

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.990
and fathers have a
rousing game [laughter].

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.420
Ahh, back in the old days.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:11.700 position:56%
In the eleventh hour, somebody saved
my skin by noticing a terrible flaw,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.020
a possibly fatal flaw
in this painting.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.290
Can anybody see what it is?

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.090
It's 1914, we are crossing
the Atlantic.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.610
The Canadian flag!

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.910
Thank you.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:29.930 position:56%
The Canadian flag, the beloved maple
leaf was designed I think in 1969,

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.370
67, something like
that, not in 1914.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.890
So thankfully a Canadian person
in the post-production department,

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.390
the book was about to be
printed, it was all there,

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.790
he said, "wait a minute."

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:47.370
So thank goodness it
was changed [laughter].

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.770
The book would have been
a disaster otherwise.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.960
I wanted very much
to show the context

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.280 position:56%
of the war even though this book
doesn't really deal with the actual,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.220
the actual war itself,
it skirts around it,

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.260
but I wanted to show something of
what was happening at this time.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:12.370
And so I book ended Harry's
departure to war with the sort

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.750
of iconic image of families
parting with his arrival home

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.530
and if you look closely,

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.890
and children always notice these
details, it's the same families

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.510
and we see some of them
haven't returned at all and some

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:30.500
of them have returned with a
limb missing or otherwise kind

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.680
of showing the devastation
that was the Great War.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.680
I painted [inaudible] papers, which
was one of the many joys of working

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.080 position:56%
with Little Brown where they sort of
said yes to everything and hid all

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:53.180
of the animals in the woods, in
the idea that we're finding Winnie

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:59.580 position:56%
and around this time Lindsay, the
author, was organizing an exhibition

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.050
in London for the centenary of
World War I and she said, "Um,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.550
Prince Charles is opening
the exhibition and I wondered

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.180
if you could do a painting
for Prince George.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.420
I'm leaving tomorrow but
if you do it really quickly

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.070
and send it we could
give it to him."

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.210
And so we did and she actually
handed it to Prince Charles,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:18.570
and this was the painting and I
feel now that I can win any game

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.120
of six degrees of separation
because I have met someone

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.380
who has met Prince Charles
and he's met everybody.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.760
So, the very last thing I did
on the book was a special treat,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.480
partly because I didn't want
work on the book to end.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.180
I had seen this photograph
in my research of soldiers

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.880
over the trenches and it
reminded me of something

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.330
and I couldn't quite shake what
that thing was until I remembered

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.210
that it was the end papers of
my edition of Winnie the Pooh

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.210
and so I combined them too, in my
nod to my beloved Ernest Shepherd,

00:18:53.210 --> 00:19:00.690 position:56%
and that's the case cover, that's
the secret answer inside the jacket.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.260
When you make a book there's a
very strange lull when it goes off

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.670
to the printer and it has a long
gestation when you've done it

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.720
but it's not out yet and I took
to carrying the printed proofs

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.820
around with me like an expectant
parent carries a sonogram

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.540
and around this time
I did a school visit

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.410
and I did the usual things
I do in a school visit.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.470
I painted with Chinese ink upside
down and I told the kids stories

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.890
about the terrible dog that lived
next door that ate all the artwork

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.970
from Ivy and Bean when
it was sent back;

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.340
the dog literally ate my homework.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.760
I told them about travels I
had done recently with UNICEF

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.900
and Save The Children to schools
in Congo and India and Bhutan,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.500
which is a country where
the mountains meet the sky

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.140
and monasteries are built
into the sides of rocks

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.380 position:56%
and there are unicorns and
children dress like silk butterflies

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.280
when they go to school and every
morning they sit in the classroom

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.420
for a minute with their eyes
closed and they think in silence

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.270
about what they learned the day
before and what they're going

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.930
to learn the next day and it's the
most beautiful way I have ever seen

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.110
a school day beginning.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.240
And I showed them a classroom in
Rwanda and this is what it looks

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.530
like when it's empty and then
I showed them what it looks

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.800
like when it's full and there are
80 kids can fit into a classroom

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.920 position:56%
and there aren't desks or paper much
or books but how there's a program

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.900 position:56%
with Save The Children where they're
bringing books by local authors

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.950
and artists into these classrooms
and I showed them a picture

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.930
of children opening the very
first book they had ever held

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.000
in their hands and these are
those children and they're making

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.760
out the words and they're
reading the story

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.380
and they're seeing the pictures
and it was so wonderful to be part

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.480
of that and I told the
kids all of these things

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.700
and how we drew together on paper
and how the world over it seems

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:57.810
that girls will draw girls and
boys will draw cars [laughter].

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:02.480
And how they drew until every
inch of that paper was full

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.110
and then I said, "Are
there are any questions?"

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.450
And a girl said, "Yes, yes, yes!"

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.750
And I said, "What is it?"

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.100 position:56%
She said, "Can you read us a story?"

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.320
And I said, "After all
that you want a story?"

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.280
And she said yes and they all said
yes and so I pulled the proofs

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.190
of Finding Winnie out of my bag
and I read it to them and it was

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.140
so wonderful and the
teachers were all crying

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.880
and the kids weren't crying
but we got to this bit

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.110 position:56%
where Harry leaves Winnie at the zoo
and Cole says, "Is that the end?"

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.480
And we learn that sometimes
you have to let one story

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.790
to end for another to begin.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.590
And Cole says, "How do you
know when that will happen?"

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.510
And his mother says, "You don't,

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.840
which is why you should
always carry on."

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.840
And I think then you turn the page
and you see Christopher Robbin

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.760
and his bear and this new story
begins and I think this idea

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.150 position:56%
of letting one store end so
another can begin is quite profound.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.610
I think it's how, as human beings,

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.490
we deal with change whether it's
grief from the loss of a loved one,

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.790
whether it's moving house

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.170
or changing schools
or simply growing up.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.470
But we tell these stories to
each other and we are part

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.970
of each others' stories
as they are part of ours

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.860
and we pass those stories down
from generation to generation

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.310
and the wonderful thing about
a book is that you can go back

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.280
to those stories and those
books are your friends

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.810
and they are there
whenever you want them

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.480 position:56%
and you have only to open the cover.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.510
Thank you very much.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.250
[ Applause ]

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.080
Do we have a few minutes
for questions?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.540
We do. Are there any questions?

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.370
Do you have a question
for me, young man?

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.640
Yes, fantastic!

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.360
Don't make it too hard,
nothing about dinosaurs.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Fine.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.560
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Okay, go.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What caught you about
the first book that you bought,

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:17.830
Winnie the Pooh book, that made
you so happy and so wanting to make

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.200
like the history about it?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.800
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: That's
such a great question.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.440
Well, I was little at the time and
it was the first book that I read

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.900
that kind of told a story but also
talked to me at the same time.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.690
It was sort of, the writer starts
telling the story and then sort

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.970 position:56%
of says, you know, this is happening
right now and he kind of chats

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.180
to you like he's really talking to
you and you read it and it's funny

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.980
and it makes, it's the
first book I read as a kid

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.500
that made me feel grown up, even
though I was only 7, you know?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.700
And I loved the characters so much.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.670
Have you ever read
it, Winnie the Pooh?

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.370
You have, do you like it?

00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:02.090
Ahh, we're friends you and I;
anyone who likes Winnie the Pooh.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.690
Oh, over here, I'm sorry;
I'm blinded by this light.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.190
Tell me, hello?

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: How long
have you been writing?

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:13.500
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Um, well,
I've been writing for a long time

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.420
but most of the books, I've
written maybe three or four books,

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.620
and all of the other ones I've
done other people have written

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.340
and I draw the pictures for those.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.570
And both ways are fun because do
you know the Ivy and Bean books?

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I've seen them
but I've never read them.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.510
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Oh!

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.460
You should absolutely read
them, they're really funny.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.710
And they're written by Annie
Barrows, who is amazing.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.960
She's just so funny
and great and clever

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.650
and these books are really good
and so it's so much fun working

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.900
with an author who has great
ideas and great stories.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.040
It's really fun; I recommend them.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.910
Yes?

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:54.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You did a good
job on the book [laughter].

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.240
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall:
[applause] Thank you.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: How do you make books?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.680
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall:
How do you make books?

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.370
You start with an idea and then you
tell a story and then if you want

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.940
to make pictures to go with
it you make those pictures

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.460
and then usually you have to send
them to someone like an editor

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.710
who is kind of like a teacher
who tells you if you need

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.390
to do some revising and then
it gets sent off to a printer

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.500
and then it comes back in boxes
and they go off to book shelves

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.470
and libraries and then
you have a real book.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.770
It's easy, see?

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:31.500
Just easy, you could do it,
you could totally do it.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.800
Oh, over here.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: I've always
loved the Ivy and Bean books

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.330
and I always love your drawings

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:44.800
and I can totally visualize what's
going on with your drawings.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.100
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: That's great!

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.230
Do you have a secret burning
question about Ivy and Bean?

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.280
I'll make it up if I
don't know the answer.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: How do you get
like, how do you like visualize?

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Well, that's
part of where Annie is so fantastic.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.030
Because you know when
you're reading Ivy and Bean,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.530
they are like they're real.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.980
Annie and I sometimes
believe they're real.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.390
Sometimes I feel like I'm not
even drawing Ivy and Bean,

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:15.160
that they just exist and I'm just
drawing these people who are real

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.070
and are actually doing these
things because her writing is so,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.060
like the voices are so real.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.750 position:56%
They're like real kids, aren't they?

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.880
I think so, yeah.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.770
That's a great question, thank you.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.200
Yes?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: How do you feel
when you get, like commented

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.210
on your mistakes on your book?

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.510
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Oh,
that's a really good question.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.390
Has that ever happened to you?

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: No.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:41.990
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: No [laughter]?

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.290
Well, you're lucky.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.590
You know what?

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.620
Sometimes when I first get
that comment I think, that,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.480
you're wrong, you're
absolutely wrong.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.190
And then, and then I
don't say that out loud

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.090
but that's what the voice
in my head is saying.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.570
And then I think, ah, maybe there's
something in what you're saying

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.910
and then often the other person is
right, which is why it's so great

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.760
to work on something with
someone else who you really trust

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.960 position:56%
and really love and their ideas are
great too and sometimes you're right

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.650
and sometimes they're right and
you make this thing that's better

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.770
because you make it together.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.630
So a thick skin, I
think, is the answer.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.360
Two minutes left, [inaudible]
over here.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: When you were little-

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.960
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Yeah.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Have you always
been good at writing and drawing?

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.370
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: You know what?

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.970
No, I was terrible at drawing
but I loved doing it so much

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.550
that I kept doing it even
though I was really bad

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.850
and I promise I'm not just saying

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.550
that because my mother
kept my drawings

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.980
and I can see them
and they're terrible.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.630
You know, I would try and draw
an animal, have you ever had

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.620
that experience where you're trying
to draw something in your head

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.090
and you can see it so clearly
and it's amazing, right?

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.570
It's an amazing, beautiful drawing
and then you start putting it

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.900
on the page and that's
not what I can see

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.120
in my head, and it's so unfair.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.780
It's just rotten but if you
keep doing it and keep doing it,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.490
it eventually gets
to something else.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.460
And it may not ever look as
good as it does in your head

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.790
but sometimes you kind
of embrace those,

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.900
I talk about embracing
my limitations.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.270 position:56%
I'm really bad at drawing things how
they actually look but I draw things

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.220
in my own weird way and now I'm
okay with that and I love doing it

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.310
and it's partly how much
you love doing it, I think.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.280
That's a very nice
question, thank you.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.830
Yes?

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: How long did it
take you to write this book?

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.240
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: Well, I did
not write it so it took me no time

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.390
at all, it was the
easiest book I ever wrote.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.760
It was written by Lindsay Mattick,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.230
who was Harry's real
life great-granddaughter.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.270
So the story came to me
already written but sometimes

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.510 position:56%
when I write a book it's much
quicker than when I do the pictures.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.460
Sometimes I have an idea and
sometimes I write it really quickly

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.840
like maybe in a few hours but
then, usually, I spend months kind

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.040
of changing a word here
and a sentence there

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.780
and then rewriting the whole thing

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.330
but drawing usually takes
me about a whole year, so.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:05.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: So, yeah, it takes
you about a year to draw and like.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.580
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall: And just a
few hours to write, which is why,

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.790
you know, authors, their job's,
pfft, really easy [laughter]

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.010
and illustrators have
the hard job, yeah.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: My mom's
an author, so [laughter].

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.480
&gt;&gt; Sophia Blackall:
Yeah, right, right?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.050
So you probably see that at home.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:24.230
She probably just lies around
eating cupcakes and just

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.850
like writing a little
book now and then,

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.490
it's no trouble at all [laughter].

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.710
Oh, we're all out of time, thank
you all so much, especially,

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.270
fantastic questions from
you guys [applause].

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.300
Thank you, thank you.
