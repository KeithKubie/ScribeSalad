00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:02.005
We always saw them as sculptures

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.625
even though they didn't look
like three-dimensional objects.

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:07.041
Because we felt sculpture, for us...

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.000
We gave up
the term "sculpture" later on

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.083
because we realized the vast
general public

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.666
finds that a confusion.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.208
So we call our...
they're called pictures now.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.623
But at that time,
we felt that everything we do

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750
is a sculpture
as that's how we were trained.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.250
When we did "The Singing Sculpture"
in Dusseldorf

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:24.958
and all over Germany

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.833
Konrad said to us,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.541
"You have to do a show
with me in the gallery."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.583
-We thought...
-We had to think.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.791
We had to think what to do,

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.541
we realized we had to leave
something behind.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.250
We realized you cannot
just be a living sculpture alone

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.083
and leave nothing behind.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.583
So, we thought we can
leave suggestions behind.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:49.541
Feelings behind.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.656
And we thought we don't want
the model up to date.

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:54.783
It would look like
a modern artwork.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.041
We wanted them
to look like we found them

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:00.625
somewhere in...
What do you call?

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:02.875
In a museum,
in the basement, no?

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:04.625
They already existed.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:07.291
The idea of us in the nature.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:11.583
We thought, "What are we
always doing?" We're always walking.

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.243
Everybody is doing that.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:16.666
It's a general human state,
we're viewing all the time

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:20.666
and then we're relaxing.
We felt, "Let's have three...

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:24.125
descriptions of walking,
viewing and relaxing.”

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.000
That's what we did and...

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.250
we did just
a posing sculpture at the opening,

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.041
just us standing still
for two or three hours.

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.791
And then,
the drawing is this new idea.

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.923
We made them antique
because we felt...

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.291
if something is antique
it's not judged

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:44.083
in the way a contemporary artwork
can be judged.

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:48.708
If you see a vast document
from Henry VIII in the museum

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.000
you don't decide
whether you like it or not.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.541
It's there to be seen
for what it is.

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.291
And by making the paper antique

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.791
and by scorching the edges,
the burnt edges,

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:01.125
it gave it a reality that...

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:03.750
as Gilbert said
that it exists anyway.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:06.000
That it's not a funny
piece of modern art

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.791
that you like or dislike.

00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:11.541
And so Konrad Fischer
sold it the next day.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.125
That was the first
big shock we had.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:18.125
Because before the opening he said,
"So how much shall it be?"

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.333
And never having sold a work of art
or even thought of doing that,

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.750
we just named the biggest sum
we could think of in the world.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.328
-Which was 1,000...
-1,000 Guineas.

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.458
1,000 pounds,
it was 1,000 Guineas, yeah.

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.291
Just as a nonsense sum of money.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.125
I mean a house cost £7,000 then,

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:38.125
so it was an enormous
sum of money.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:41.250
And to our amazement
he sold it the following day.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.500
That's when we started
to do the drinking sculptures.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:47.458
Then the trouble began.
