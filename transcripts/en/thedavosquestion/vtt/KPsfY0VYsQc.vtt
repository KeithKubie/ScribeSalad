00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
&gt;&gt; My name is Mark Spelman.
I'm the Global Head of Strategy at Accenture.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.590
And one of the big debates here having here
in Davos is this whole

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.850
question of where are we going with energy
 -- particularly, this issue

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.801
of the mix between looking at oil and renewables.
And when you talk about energy, you have to

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.760
really sort of think about
what's happening on the demand side and what's

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.109
happening on the supply
side.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.330
On the demand side, the downturn has meant
that demand for oil is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.910
actually fallen by about three percent although
the underlying

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.850
assumption that oil would continue to rise.
But the thing that everybody needs to remember

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.430
about energy demand is
that when you look at the forecast, particularly

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.980
going out to sort of
2030, the demand for energy is just going

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.730
to increase massively,
particularly because of the increases in middle

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.190
passes in countries
like India and China.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.070
And what that means is that they want energy
for obviously domestic

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.390
living but they also need it for transport.
So the demand for energy is not going to go

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.500
away.
The big thing on the supply side is how do

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.390
we find the right balance
between particularly oil and gas, nuclear,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.060
renewables, and the key
question that we've got is the speed at which

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.779
we can ramp up
renewables.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:14.079
And the key thing about renewables is that
what you actually, is a

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.959
flexible, if you like, energy Internet smart
grid systems, to be able

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.200
to bring those renewables on stream to to
sort of give customers more

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.619
flexibility.
So as we look at the energy debate, I don't

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.289
think it's all about oil
and gas or renewables.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.979
It's about ends.
We need to look at how we optimize energy

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.490
efficiency.
We need to manage oil and gas carefully.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.069
Clearly, nuclear is going to be part of the
mix.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.329
But critically, we need to ramp up renewables,
we need more investment

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.289
in solar, winds, clean coal.
Sequestration will be critical.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.049
But ultimately we also need smart grids in
order to be able to

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.439
facilitate the introduction of those new renewables
at scale, into both

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.669
the domestic and residential areas, but also
to help, I think, with

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:10.689
just facilitating more effective use of energy
and matching supply and

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:11.680
demands.
Thanks very much.
