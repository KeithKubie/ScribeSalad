00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:25.300
You know, we live in
a world of wonders--

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.750
high-tech gizmos that
boggle the imagination.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.060
We enjoy every single day.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.489
Devices that have
more complexity

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.860
and more technology
condensed into them

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.710
than $60 million
supercomputers had 40 years ago

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380
are something we get
to enjoy every day.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.400
The supercomputers of yesteryear
are in everybody's hands.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.490
A young person with a
cell phone in Africa

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.250
has better communications
technology than the US

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.320
president had 25 years ago.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.830
So there's no doubt that
these are magnificent machines

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.425
that we use to extend the
boundaries of our thinking

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:55.840
and of our reach.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.520
Nonetheless, people have
this problem with technology,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.000
because they think
it's somehow unnatural.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.990
Enter Kevin Kelly.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.440
Kevin Kelly's book What
Technology Wants introduces

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.750
the concept of the "technium."

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.610
He calls the technium
the aggregate

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.875
of all of our technology.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:13.450
He calls it actually the
seventh kingdom of life.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.540
He says the technium is
self-organizing, and has wants

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.840
and needs, and is subject
to evolutionary forces.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.910
He literally says that
evolution is playing out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.410
through the evolution
of technology.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.110
Technology is birthed
out of the human mind.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.480
If you were able to
time-lapse reality,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.440
you would see our
thoughts spill over

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.350
into the world in the
form of technology.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.700
We erect matter in
accordance with our will.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.240
We reorganize the physical
materials of reality

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.520
and turn them into objects
of higher organization,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.470
and we give them
transcendent qualities.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.685
Today we have a device
made of plastic and metal

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:49.980
that sends our thoughts
traveling at light speed

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.210
across oceans of sky.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.335
The fact that I can talk
on the phone with somebody

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:57.670
and have what Amber Case
refers to as "technologically

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.300
mediated telepathy,"
mind-to-mind communication,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.920
is not just
astonishing, but also

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.150
according to Kevin
Kelly's idea, proof

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.442
of the flowering of
new possibilities.

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:11.220
Proof that technology
is a part of us.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.149
It's made of atoms.

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.690
It's natural.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.465
It sits on a continuum
between the born and the made.

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:19.410
Buckminster Fuller said start
with the universe, the Earth,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.970
one single system,
an integrated system.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.160
We are of nature.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.025
Anything that is birthed out
of us is birthed out of nature.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.880
So it's all good.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030
Nothing to worry about.
