00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:02.541
- [Voiceover] When for the
first time the United States

00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:05.101
imported more oil than it exported,

00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:07.121
Americans should have realized

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.161
than an energy crisis was imminent

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:11.867
and could happen in the future.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.441
So this was a little strange,

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.044
because if you're saying that
something is or was imminent,

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:20.113
so imminent means it's about to happen,

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:21.713
and you're fairly sure
it's going to happen.

00:00:21.713 --> 00:00:24.001
You have a high degree of confidence

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.748
that something is about to happen.

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.764
Then you're saying this is imminent.

00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:29.888
You're pretty much sure
it's about to happen.

00:00:29.888 --> 00:00:31.881
So they're saying it was imminent,

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.811
but then they say, and
could happen in the future.

00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:36.709
Well if you're saying
something is imminent,

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:38.265
then you shouldn't have
the uncertainty of,

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:39.729
well, maybe it happens in the future,

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.822
maybe it could happen in the future.

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:44.354
This seems a little
bit contradictory here.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:47.109
So I don't like it as it's written.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.818
You're either imminent or it
could happen in the future.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.380
So let's think about other options.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.666
I actually would have
liked this a lot more

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.502
if it literally just said was imminent,

00:00:59.502 --> 00:01:01.176
or if it just said,

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:03.310
an energy crisis could
happen in the future,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.876
if it just said that one.

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:07.622
So, I don't like having
both of them there.

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:09.449
So let's think about the other options.

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.549
Americans should have
realized that an energy crisis

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.549
could happen imminently in the future.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.276
So this feels a little bit clumsy.

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:22.659
At least it doesn't have kind
of the weird contradiction

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.125
of something both being
imminent and maybe happening.

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:29.622
So, I don't know, but it still
feels a little bit clumsy.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.325
Could happen imminently in the future.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.124
And actually this is not contradictory,

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:37.349
but this one's a little bit redundant.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.969
Imminently means it's about
to happen in the future,

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.322
and then they say, in the future.

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:42.742
Well you don't have to write in the future

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:43.969
if you wrote imminently.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.222
Something's about to happen imminently,

00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:47.576
it's not going to happen in
the present or in the past.

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:49.089
It's about to happen in the future.

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:52.575
So you wouldn't put in the
future right over there.

00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:55.890
So I would actually rule
this one out as well.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.113
Americans should have
realized that an energy crisis

00:01:59.113 --> 00:02:02.129
will be imminent and happening soon.

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.849
Well, this is very redundant, just like B.

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.813
If something is imminent,

00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:09.726
that's the same thing
as it's happening soon.

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:12.389
You don't have to say, and happening soon.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.449
So let's rule that one out.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.509
Americans should have
realized that an energy crisis

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.509
is an imminent thing.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:25.509
And here it's actually
more of the verb tense

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:28.255
that I'm a little concerned about.

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:29.461
Americans should have.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.064
We're talking about something in the past.

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:32.792
Americans should have realized.

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:34.352
This was the first time the United States

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:35.747
imported more oil than it exported.

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:37.392
This happened in the past.

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:40.104
Americans should have
realized that an energy crisis

00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:42.053
was an imminent thing.

00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:44.324
So this, I would have put a was in there,

00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:44.936
and maybe I would have felt

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:46.447
a little bit more comfortable with it.

00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:48.815
So I'll rule that out.

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:49.446
So we're left with one.

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.215
Let's hope this one works.

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:54.275
Americans should have
realized that an energy crisis

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:57.051
might be imminent.

00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.561
That one feels right.

00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.842
That one feels right.

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.276
It might be imminent.

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:04.275
We aren't sure whether
something is imminent.

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:06.956
You can't say that it will be
imminent and you're not sure,

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:09.115
but you could be unsure of

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:12.243
is the thing going to happen soon.

00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:14.127
So this one actually feels really good.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:15.773
Let me read the whole thing.

00:03:15.773 --> 00:03:18.035
When for the first time the United States

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:20.915
imported more oil than it exported,

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:25.035
Americans should have
realized that an energy crisis

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.837
might be imminent.

00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:28.085
Yeah, nice and clean.

00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:28.995
Nice and simple.

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:30.422
Not redundant.

00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:31.776
Feels good.
