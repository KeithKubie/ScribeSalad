KARSTEN VON HOESSLIN:
At this stage,

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:07.400
I'd love to board a working
Taiwanese longliner to see what

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.667
they make of the murder videos.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.834
But they rarely come
into Port Victoria,

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:17.433
and they're not
exactly keen to talk.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:25.066
Instead, I've been invited
onto a local longliner.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.767
It's smaller than
the Taiwanese ships.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:27.834
How's it going, gentlemen?

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.633
But catches fish
in the same way.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.667
Captain, how are you?

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:32.467
I'm fine, thank you.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.834
Good, very good to see.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.667
Longliners are named after
the long, thin line that often

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.400
stretches 60 miles behind them.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.967
There are thousands
of hooks spaced

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:47.367
at intervals down the line.

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:57.800
But each fish has to be reeled
in by hand one at a time.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.300
The catch on these
local longliners

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.400
is closely monitored.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.767
But the foreign boats seem
to play by different rules.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.266
How much control, realistically,
do you think the Seychelles has

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.800
over those boats?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.800
Do they even ever come
into Port Victoria,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
or do they just stay out
there and do what they want?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.567
I believe a lot
of these boats are

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.900
flagged and licensed without
even calling in Port Victoria.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.834
The observers in the
ports will never know

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.300
what's really being fished.
- They will never know, exactly.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.834
You don't get access
to the logbooks

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:39.900
to know of their movements,
the catch per day,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.567
hooks being set per day.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.400
And you don't know
what's happening.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.400
You hear that they are
offloading in whatever port.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.633
And there has to be tons of
illegal activities going on.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:58.834
KARSTEN VON HOESSLIN: Commercial
fishing boats are always

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:01.367
meant to register
their catch, to check

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:02.467
it conforms with their quotas.

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:09.900
But by transshipping their
load to another boat,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.033
they can escape detection.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.233
Their catch gets
mixed up with legally

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:21.400
caught fish and
appears legitimate.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.266
This is known as
fish laundering,

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:27.166
and it cost the global economy
billions of dollars a year.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.300
Our economies, our
livelihoods, and our food all

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.600
depend on our oceans.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.233
Illegal fishing depletes
the world's fisheries.

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.367
KARSTEN VON HOESSLIN: Were
the longliners from the videos

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.600
into this sort of
racket, fishing

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.166
illegally in the Indian Ocean?
