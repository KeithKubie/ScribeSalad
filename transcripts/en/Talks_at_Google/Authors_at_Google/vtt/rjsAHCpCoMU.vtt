MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.750
Thanks a lot for coming out.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.130
It is my great pleasure to
welcome Prasad Kaipa to

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.420
Authors at Google.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.755
He's here today to talk about
his book, "From Smart to

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:13.350
Wise."

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.480
And it's actually a great
honor to have him.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.700
Dr. Kaipa is an executive coach,
mentor, author, and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.930
founder of the Center for
Leadership, Innovation, and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.180
Change at the Union School
of Business.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.670
He is also a long-time part
of Silicon Valley.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.620
He has presented.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.850
He has led executive
development, career-coaching,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.840
everything at multiple different
companies here at

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.010
Silicon Valley.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.610
And it's an honor to welcome
him to Google today.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.523
So if we could please all give
him a big round of applause.

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:52.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:54.238
PRASAD KAIPA: Thank you.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.180
Good afternoon.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.590
I think what today we'll talk
about is to look at why the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.710
smartness is the baseline now.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.540
It is no longer something that
gives us the privilege.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.890
When I was growing up in India,
when I went to IIT,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130
that was something very,
very special.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.020
Or when I worked for Apple
Computer in the '80s, that was

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.810
something very special.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.110
But coming and giving
a talk at Google,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660
everybody is very special.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.500
Otherwise, they wouldn't
be here.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.260
So from that aspect, it's
like a baseline.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.400
If the smartness is the new
baseline at Google, and many

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.800
of the Silicon Valley companies
at this moment, how

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.360
would you stay one step ahead?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.250
How do you demonstrate
personal leadership?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.310
That is the theme which
I address a lot more.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.820
So next step I thought I should
look at is, how many of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.430
you think you are smart?

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.240
Other people may feel that
you are smart or not.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.840
But from your own perspective,
would you raise your hands if

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.760
you think you are smart?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.380
It's an interesting scenario,
because depending on different

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.950
cultural context and norms,
everybody has their own

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.920
expectations and standards
of whether to raise

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
their hands or not.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.130
Can you keep it up
for one minute.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.530
OK, great.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.290
So some of you didn't
raise the hands.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.170
I won't exactly ask at this
moment why, but let

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.920
me get to the next.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.785
Can you raise your hand if
you think you are wise?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.310
Yeah?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.140
Could be sometimes
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.580
Interesting.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.210
So definitely smaller number
of hands than smartness,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.330
number one.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.310
Number two, they
went up slowly.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.330
Maybe we associate smartness
with speed,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.970
and wisdom with slowness.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.250
That's a frame pattern
which we'll talk a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.560
little bit more about.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.650
I was curious about that.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.920
Next thing, have you read the
book "From Smart to Wise,"

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.540
which I have written?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.050
Any of you?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.400
Have you done--

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.360
there is a baseline assessment
which we came up with, which

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.070
is a five-minute assessment
on FromSmarttoWise.com.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.640
If you go, there are 18
questions, because you have

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.920
not read the book.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.900
Of course, there is also a link
to that to [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.440
to assessment.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.640
You can go there.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.500
I recommend, before you start
the book, if you can actually

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.040
do that assessment, then
read the book and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.390
start applying it.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.500
That may, actually the value of
what you need will become a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.520
lot more applicable, and
a lot more grounded in

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.680
what you want to do.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.840
So let me start with
a definition.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.570
Because the smartness is the new
currency in the knowledge

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.480
age, how do you really
define it?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.870
We defined it in the book,
smartness is the application

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.330
of intelligence for
self interest.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.120
So practical smartness is about
using your knowledge to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.120
get ahead, using your knowledge
to become a leader

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.890
when other people are not having
the same opportunity,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.350
or to make money, to get
a job, to move ahead--

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.580
different ways.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.960
It's all connected with, how
do you make sure your

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.000
smartness based off your own
growth and development?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
That's traditional, simpler
way to define it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.260
But of course, smartness is
not just about people.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.110
It is actually something that
is pervading our culture.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.040
For example, this IBM has been
calling this decade as the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.030
decade of smartness.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.330
They're trying to create what
you might call a smarter

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.230
planet, and how do we really
begin to use our smartness for

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.820
the larger context of
environment, population,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.220
technology, to work
for everybody?

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.930
And of course, I don't have to
talk at Google about the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.690
smartphones.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.716
If you notice, I put
the iPhone all

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:19.060
the way in the back.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.420
The other thing is the
smart televisions.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.400
It is not just the
smart television

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.930
that is becoming popular.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.270
You are also talking
about smart meters

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.540
of different kind.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.670
In California, P&amp;G--

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.330
actually, it's PG&amp;E--

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.070
introduced smart meters, and
of course, Nest smart

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.680
temperature control.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.360
Not just one unit,
one appliance.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.660
Now, everybody talks about an
entire house, an entire

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.590
community is becoming smarter.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.420
Because of this pervasiveness
of smartness as the new

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.550
currency, I wonder whether the
smartness is a new definition

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.820
for dumbness.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.430
Because if you try to really
look at everybody being smart,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.110
you have to focus on something
other than smartness if you

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.140
need to get ahead.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.460
So in that context, sometimes
holding back on self-interest,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.500
holding back on being too smart
actually could be wise.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.320
At some level, reflecting,
introspecting, slowing down to

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.670
make sure that you have actually
paid attention to the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.050
context of value, and taking
care of people on your team,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.450
taking care of your organization
not just to a

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.660
self-interest, could be
considered not just

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.330
smart, but also wise.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.540
In fact, when I used to work
with several entrepreneurs and

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.030
the venture capital firms in
the Valley, they talked

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.440
generally about if an idea has
a 70% chance of success to

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.890
make it as an entrepreneurial
success, they say don't do it.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.830
Why?

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.280
Everybody in the Valley would be
focusing on something that

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.250
has a 70% chance of success.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.160
So that means on the ground,
your entrepreneurial company,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.980
based on that idea, may
not actually fly.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.850
If you reverse it, if an idea
has only 30% chance of

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.800
success, but if you can really
put attention to it--

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.630
because not many other
entrepreneurs are also

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.520
interested in that idea--

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.190
you have a 70% chance of success
for making the company

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.540
successful.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.190
So what I'm trying to raise is
it is counter-intuitive for

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.710
people to be successful in
the age of knowledge.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.190
You have to think outside the
box of, what is in it for me?

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.220
How can I be successful
in the short-term?

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.770
You may have to be expand your
circle of not only influence,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.070
your circle of interest to
include your team, your

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.900
organization, sometimes your
community, and bring in the

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.840
context of noble purpose, if
you want to be successful,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.890
with your smartness.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.900
Interestingly, somebody says--

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.800
like, of course, William
Shakespeare

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.510
puts it quite nicely.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.730
"A fool thinks of himself to be
wise, but a wise man always

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.630
knows himself to be a fool
first." So at some level, we

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.640
are trying to say, smartness
doesn't cut it to be

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.080
successful, let alone in Silicon
Valley, because of

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.360
complexity that we live in,
the ambiguity [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.250
Nobody can tell you exactly
what to do, how to do it.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.600
And especially, when Larry comes
up and says, we need to

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.780
have it as a 10x, you need
to do 10x thinking.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.940
In Google, it is no longer
sufficient for you to look at,

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.160
how do I make incremental
improvement?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.680
If I need to create a
breakthrough innovation, and

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.180
if my products and solutions are
always online, even a few

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.730
minutes of going out could have
significant headlines,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.820
saying that Google is out for a
few minutes, three, minutes,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.360
two minutes.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.080
In that type of a context, you
have to figure out a way to

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.760
say how to be wise.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.050
But becoming wise has got
a lot of connotations.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.130
In the earlier stage, when my
co-author, Navi, and myself,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.010
when we started writing a book,
one gentlemen whom we

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.080
were interviewing, he asked us,
do you think you are wise

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.350
enough to write the book?

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.460
If not, why are you
writing it?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.490
If you are not wise, what gives
you the authority to

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.920
talk about wisdom?

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.410
That's a very legitimate
question, because everybody in

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.610
different cultures have their
own opinions about what it

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.130
means to be wise.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.150
Of course, I thought I'll give
some practical examples,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.990
collaborating with the
myths that we have.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.040
People say once you are wise,
you will stay wise.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.490
This gentleman was
head of IMF.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.840
He was pretty much a shoo-in
for the President of France

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.440
till he couldn't keep
his clothes on.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.110
Sometimes, nobody talks
about how to use

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.300
your wisdom or smartness.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.820
But unfortunately, latest--

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.920
what you call--

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.940
records say that he's being
charged with all kinds of

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.830
charges, which are so demeaning
to what could've

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.270
been an IMF president or
a President of France.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.050
So once you are wise, you
cannot stay wise.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:55.950
This is a grounded, pragmatic,
action-oriented scenario where

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.130
every day, you need to take some
steps to ask yourself,

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.940
this is a smart approach,
this is a wise approach.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.330
Can I make a wiser decision
today for is?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.660
Can I take a wiser
action today?

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.470
That's the only way you can
continue to keep updating on

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.280
your wisdom.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.120
The second myth says that age
and maturity make people wise.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.410
General Petraeus was celebrated
general in

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.595
Afghanistan.

00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:27.440
He was the director of CIA.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.980
But I wonder what happens when
it comes to thinking when you

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.720
are doing the largest spy
organization in the world, but

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.360
you think some of the stuff that
you do can stay private?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.530
Sometimes, I just don't know.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.240
And of course, we have
the latest hero.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.710
He thinks about what it is,
and there was a nice comic

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.590
about a couple of weeks ago.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.080
So if you think that the only
chosen few have access to

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.310
wisdom, without a question, what
kind of a wisdom is that?

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.490
So I wonder whether the wisdom
is actually a birth rite when

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.650
we are young.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:14.160
If you have children, you do
know, some of the common sense

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.130
questions that the children
raise, some of that kind of

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.770
comments they make, some of the
honesty and authenticity

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.170
children have--

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.670
I wonder whether we beat it
out of their system in the

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.390
name of socializing, in the
name of politeness, in the

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.580
name of what you call emotional
intelligence, in the

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.480
name of everything else.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.050
I wonder we try to focus them
more on trying to be smart,

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:47.250
according to all standards, but
let go of the common sense

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.630
wisdom that would give them the
larger perspective, little

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.630
bit more broader way of
looking at the world.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.200
Now let me get it closer
to the home.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.490
If you take some of
these people--

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.440
many people I asked, when I give
talks around the world,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.710
would you call them smart?

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.040
Lots of hands went up.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.830
Would you call them wise?

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.310
Not many hands went up.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.700
Why is that?

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.240
Do we associate wisdom
with age?

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.300
Do we assume that only old
people with a lot of gray hair

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.090
have to be wise, but if you're
young, you cannot be wise?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:34.770
Interestingly, we talk to one
of the analysts who used to

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.710
work with this gentlemen,
Mark Zuckerberg,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:40.770
in the early stage.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.970
She said when he came to her
research firm talking about

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.820
social network, she was not
at all convinced about his

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.510
smartness, let alone
his wisdom.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:58.460
But a year, year and a half
later, when he came back, she

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.400
almost thought it was a
completely different person.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.630
She began to realize within the
year time period, he had

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.580
associated himself with a lot
of good advisers, wise

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.930
leaders, and he learned.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.900
And because of his learning,
he was able to transform

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.080
himself, which is what your
founders seems to have done.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.400
They started it, brought
somebody else in, and then,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.170
when the time is right, and
when they felt they were

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.460
mature enough, Larry took
the CEO role again.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.380
So there is a role in which
there is humility; willingness

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.660
to say, I need to learn from
others; and willingness to

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.130
say, this may not be
the right thing.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.000
Those are some characteristics--

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.400
it doesn't matter whether
you're a young or old--

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.450
that can come in.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.300
And finally, if you look at some
of these people, I don't

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.290
think there will be much of
disagreement if we talk about

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.980
their wisdom.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.770
One thing you might want to
think about is, did they give

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.920
up their smartness to be wise?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.270
Interestingly, when Navi and I
were looking at the title for

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:15.410
this book, we wanted to call it
"Smart and Wise." That is

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.610
when the editor told us, you
guys are writing the book, but

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.430
you haven't figured out how to
come up with a wise cycle.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.540
We said, why?

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.080
He said, if you call it "Smart
and Wise," where is the hook

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.480
in the book.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.070
Why would anybody buy it?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.840
You need to have a title by
creating a journey or a

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.250
pathway from smart to wise so
that people get some doubt.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.200
Maybe their smartness is not
good enough, they'll buy it.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.390
So they said, first, it is going
to talk about wisdom,

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.700
but you have to be smart in the
beginning to come up with

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.000
the right title.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.890
So we are learning that
some of these

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.060
are extremely important.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.960
But of course, finally, it is
also important to recognize

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.820
wisdom is not about coming up
with answers, but it is about

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.060
asking the right questions.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.480
Considering the kind of what
do you do-- whether it is

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.280
YouTube, whether it is Google,
whether it is many of the

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.740
other things--

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.790
your innovation, especially
breakthrough innovation, will

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.640
come not by incrementally
tinkering what you already

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.590
have, but being able to ask
difficult questions, recognize

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.730
your products are online
all the time.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.670
And if you have to make changes,
sometimes you may

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.990
have to fail bigger before you
can succeed even bigger.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.130
When you don't have the courage,
when you don't have

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.150
the wherewithal, and when you
don't go for the 10x as you

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:48.000
are talking about, the ability
to stay afloat--

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.790
let alone the ability to grow
and become bigger and bigger--

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.230
is going to be questionable.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.300
But of course, we can talk from
a Google perspective, but

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.280
the key it comes down to is
Google is nothing but all of

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.210
you, and a few more out there.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:09.270
That means each one of us have
to take responsibility for

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.740
what I'm doing, how will it make
a difference to my team,

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.970
my division, my company?

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.280
If I can have that larger
perspective, when what you do

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.510
becomes successful, you also
become successful with it.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.150
In the book, I call it
enlightened self-interest.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.210
That means if you want to be a
personal leader, if you want

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.290
to be extraordinary and be
recognized for what you do,

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:40.280
you have to think about how we
expand that pie, like a game.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.040
Being in Silicon Valley, we'll
use another metaphor, right?

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.240
I'm sure you're all
familiar with it.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.830
Many times, when smart people
get together to create an

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.860
entrepreneurial company, they
talk about, what is your

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.820
share, what is my share,
what is the investor

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.740
share, and all of them?

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.710
One gentlemen taught me.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.750
He said, when you're coaching
these people, you need to help

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.870
them to see--

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.670
even if you have 70%
of the grape--

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:11.660
70% share of a small company
doesn't mean very much.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.250
Your job as entrepreneurial
team is to make that grape

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.140
into a watermelon.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.270
When you make the grape into
orange or a watermelon, even

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:27.030
at 5% stake in that watermelon
is going to be many, many,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.380
many times larger
than the grape.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.010
So that means being smart is
looking at what share do I

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.470
have, how much stock
do I have?

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:42.040
Being wise means, how can each
of us work together to make

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.762
whatever we have into
much bigger?

00:18:44.762 --> 00:18:48.710
It shifts the perspective
significantly.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.530
But that doesn't always
come true properly.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.805
Let me give an example of
Microsoft, for example.

00:18:55.805 --> 00:18:59.500
In 1999, the Department
of Justice

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.420
wanted to break up Microsoft.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:08.640
And Bill Gates' testimony didn't
go very well, and got a

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.400
bad rep for the Microsoft.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.300
Bill Gates stepped down.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.880
He wanted to go ahead and create
the Gates Foundation.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.950
Of course, since then, he has
given away $26 billion, and

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.830
went ahead and started
doing something.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.880
And now, he has become, from
a smart Bill Gates, he has

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.600
become a wise Bill Gates.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.380
But on the other hand,
he left the Microsoft

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.180
to the smart Ballmer.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.110
Just to give some of
his wise quotes.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.720
You might have heard
of some of this.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.780
"There is no chance that the
iPhone is going to get any

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.890
significant market share.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.350
No chance." You can see this
on YouTube, by the way.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.650
"Linux is a cancer that the
attaches itself to an

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.420
intellectual property sense to
everything it touches." And

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.490
this is the classic--

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.410
"Google is not a real company.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.940
It's a house of cards."
Very interesting.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.000
And of course, Bill Gates
himself wrote a book on future

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.330
of technology called "Road
Ahead." It didn't have any

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.010
mention of internet,
by the way.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:22.140
So sometimes, I wonder there are
more limits to smartness

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.690
than we pay attention to.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.630
The key to remember about
smartness is today, you may be

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.660
the smartest person in the room,
but tomorrow there are

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.020
no guarantees.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.430
Somebody else will come and
take your position.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.750
So it's a moving target.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.100
You can't actually try
to outsmart people

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.560
on a constant basis.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.560
It's exhausting, and
it is not worth it.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.600
Second--

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.000
smartness is always about either
a vision of the future,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.390
or what you have done
in the past.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.920
Not worth it, because it
doesn't give you the

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.920
mindfulness of [INAUDIBLE]
in the present moment.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.520
Third--

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.610
what is smart from one
perspective may be foolish

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.150
from another, and it doesn't
translate very well to one

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.720
culture to another.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.440
You may have to really begin
to think about, maybe

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.520
smartness is not the only way
to be successful, and

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.640
recognize that knowing and
seeing the patterns ahead of

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.880
everybody else is a trap,
because it leads to ultimately

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.390
self-denial, because you--

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.520
I came up with a phrase called
core incompetence.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.640
Your signature strength of
yesterday that got you to this

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.240
job today is nailing your foot,
and prevents you from

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.990
going somewhere else.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.050
So where is your foot
nailed to the

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.730
floor is in your smartness.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.960
So watch out, and make sure
smartness is not an addiction

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.650
that you keep feeding, because
unless you recontextualize it

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.180
as wisdom, your personal
leadership does not get

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.700
recognized as much as you want
it to be recognized.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.150
So what is this wise
leadership?

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.100
How do you really
recontextualize

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.350
smartness into wisdom?

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.530
I believe the smartness
is like a pendulum--

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.470
it swings to two extremes.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.860
One extreme, if it swings, I
call it a business smartness,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.750
like an entrepreneurial
smartness.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.590
The other extreme, what you
call swings, I call it a

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.160
functional smartness.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.000
That means I want to be the head
of my staff, I want to be

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.270
the chief technologist, I want
to be the CEO, even Nobel

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:51.130
Laureate I had a good to
interview several Nobel

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.060
Laureate over a period
of time.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.240
I found out even they get
stuck in one end of the

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.150
spectrum or other end
of the spectrum.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.670
The wise leadership is anchoring
the wisdom to your

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.220
larger purpose.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.600
when you anchor your smartness
with something larger as

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.150
wisdom, then you can swing
from one end to other end

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.920
without the loss of face,
because you're no longer

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.000
committed to the questions, or
becoming an expert in the

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.220
room, but you're willing
to look stupid.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.260
You're willing to ask
dumb questions.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.450
You're willing to ask some
things which other people are

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.560
not raising, like emperor
has no clothes.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.420
Because of that, you may be able
to find something very

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.620
interesting.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.280
Arno Penzias, one of the Nobel
Laureates, talks about how he

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.730
actually ended up getting
a Nobel Prize.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:48.360
He said once, he was driving
from New Jersey through the

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.470
Midwest with his wife and a
nine-year-old daughter.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.020
And who was telling it seems--

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.090
why is that when you change
from one radio station to

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.540
another radio station,
you have this buzz?

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.700
How can you not prevent
this buzz?

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.980
You are the physicist,
what can you do?

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.450
And where is this coming from?

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.620
He said, oh, this is an
electronic noise.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.880
But later, he realized he
doesn't know where the noise

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.540
is coming when you are going
from one station to another,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.160
and he spent some time.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.340
He realized, it is an
intergalactic cosmic noise,

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.810
which got him a Nobel
Prize for that.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:32.220
So sometimes, it is extremely
important that smartness gets

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.470
us focused on knowledge
and what we know.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.180
But if you want to do 10x
contribution to you or to your

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.320
company, you may have ask more
questions, and more questions

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.260
for which you have no
clue how to answer.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.230
Then, the ambiguity you have,
the stress that you are

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.880
dealing with, and the complexity
of work that we

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.320
deal with, that can be leveraged
to gain more wisdom,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.770
instead of proving yourself
to be more smart.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.530
So let me summarize a couple of
things, and I'll give you a

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.610
few examples.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.910
Ultimately, leadership--

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.770
whether you manage other
people or not--

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.190
to be a leader, to be a personal
leader, it all comes

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.290
down to three things.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.920
How do you make decisions?

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.230
Do you use judgment and

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.180
discernment in making decisions?

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.170
Second, how do you
take actions?

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:38.150
Are those actions towards your
own benefit, or with an

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.760
enlightened self-interest that
benefits your team, your

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.470
family, or your organization?

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.520
Third, how do you communicate?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.940
Do you communicate saying,
what I talk, I take

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.930
responsibility; what you
listen, I have no

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.950
responsibility?

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.110
That's one way to communicate.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.980
Another one is to look at and
say what I communicate is

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.560
based on what you
have received.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.870
It doesn't mean I have to talk
a lot, but maybe much of what

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.410
I have to do in communication--

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.260
maybe listening, maybe asking
questions, reading your body

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.770
language, using a lot more
emotional intelligence,

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.850
context sensitivity--

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.500
all of this become extremely
important.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.220
Especially when we are smart,
it becomes a lot

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.990
harder to do this.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.790
So wise leadership--

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:35.910
we define it as same
intelligence application, but

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.060
this time, we ask you
to do two things.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.670
One is reflection on the
context around you.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:48.090
Second, introspection on the
skills that you bring.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:55.090
If you can couple reflection and
introspection, and focus

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.700
on the larger good--

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.520
that larger good could extend
as far as you want it to be.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.365
For Steve Jobs, larger
good extended only up

00:27:05.365 --> 00:27:08.140
to he and his company.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.410
But for you, you need
to make a choice.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.550
How much good is larger
good for you?

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.840
In other words, it is
repurposing your intelligence

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.010
and smart leadership in
the present moment.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.780
It is about being mindful, not
just about the past or the

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.470
future, but it is about being
here and now at some level.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.770
What does wise leadership
get you?

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.270
It gets you ethical clarity
in times of complexity.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:44.070
Second, judgment when you
need discernment.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.320
And finally, humility,
recognizing I might have come

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.770
up with a great solution today,
but it has happened

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.750
because of help with
other people.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.960
And when you honor other people,
when you respect other

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.230
people who help you, chances
are that can become a

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.440
sustainable relationship.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.310
So let me just give a court,
and ask whether

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.650
you have any questions.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.180
And I can give examples of wise
leadership, and I can do

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.560
a lot of different things.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.080
But for you to become wise,
there are three

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.760
most important stuff.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.850
As I said, reflection is
a very powerful tool.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.890
Second, we call it politically
correct word--

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.390
best practices.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.570
We try to look at the
best practices.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.980
In my book, we wrote a lot of
examples based on interviews

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.430
and narratives of various
successful leaders, which is

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.120
the easiest.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.090
Third, experience.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.950
What I recommend is once you
complete this talk, actually

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.190
think about-- when
you go back--

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.500
three areas.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.840
What do I need to communicate
in my project?

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.390
What decisions do I need to make
to take the next step?

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.300
What actions are imperative
for me?

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.780
In both of these scenarios, if
you can think every day at

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.780
least one decision, one action,
and one communication.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.340
Is this a smart one,
or a wise one?

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.510
Can I begin to take one decision
a day that is wiser,

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.410
one action a day that would
move me towards wise

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.250
leadership.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.660
I have a feeling over
a period of time--

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.130
as somebody said, can I
be wiser sometimes?

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.890
I think you raised
the question.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.240
I think that is the way
in which we go.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.300
Even though wisdom may be the
birth rite, because we have

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.360
forgotten and got conditioned,
we may have to unlearn and

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.610
selectively forget what
we have picked

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.590
up, how to be smart.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.750
And step by step, we can make
progress towards wise

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.210
leadership.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.330
Let me stops for a minute
and check--

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.340
any questions?

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.420
Comments?

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.120
Yeah, please.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.200
You have a question
in the back.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.800
There is a microphone
coming [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.030
AUDIENCE: You're not speaking
about being genuine.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.070
And I know that it's embedded in
those concepts, but that is

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.390
one particular concept, I think,
first and foremost,

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.770
needs to be spoken to.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.190
And obviously, maybe
in your book.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.970
PRASAD KAIPA: I use the word
"authenticity." For example,

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.690
Steve Jobs was very authentic,
but he was not necessarily

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.540
mostly appropriate.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.320
I think there was a movie that
came out last weekend.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.140
I just saw it.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.070
It was so flat for me, because
I worked for Apple, and I had

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.260
known Steve Jobs at
different times.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.200
So for me, it was like, duh.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.850
There wasn't anything
that got into what

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.130
made somebody special.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.730
That didn't come through.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.910
So all the key points, all the
checklist has been done, but

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.780
there is no learning
that can come.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.370
There is no insight in there.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:59.140
On the other hand, Tim Cook
is very appropriate.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.120
He didn't care about when he
was number two, Chinese

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.260
workers, all of them.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.440
But as soon as he became CEO,
he started paying more

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.460
attention to.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.480
But at the same time, he's very
politically sensitive,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.500
politically correct,
wonderful.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.190
But now, some people are raising
questions, is he the

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.040
right person?

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.300
Is he leading Apple
in the right way?

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.160
So you may need to think about
when it is appropriate for you

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.040
to be genuine and authentic, and
say what you have on your

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.780
mind with your team members and
other people, and when is

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:37.800
it appropriate to hold back
your genuine feedback, and

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.870
look for the right time
and right place

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.590
to give that feedback.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.960
In India, as I grew up, there
is a wonderful proverb that

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.480
says, the truth has only meaning
when somebody is

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.470
looking for it.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.610
If somebody is not looking for
your genuine feedback, if you

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.580
give that feedback, they'll look
at it like a criticism,

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:04.600
only negativity, or you
just don't like me.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:10.510
So in a negative context,
authenticity and genuineness

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.370
is not appreciated as much.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.640
But if you can create a context,
if you were to say,

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.570
you know, I see that you
have done one, two,

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.800
three very, very well.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.370
And there a couple of things, if
you do, you could even take

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.480
it to a whole new level.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.900
If you have interest in it, I
have identified a couple of

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.080
suggestions for you.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.490
Let me know when you
want to implement.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.990
I will give it to you.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:40.370
So what you have done in the
minute, one-minute coaching is

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.880
you have created a context for
other people to ask for the

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.940
feedback, and recognize that you
have given your positive,

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:54.070
appreciative stance to your
feedback already, and you have

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:58.100
created a gap for them to
really look at, how do I

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.390
transcend that gap?

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.270
Because they are intentional,
because they are asking for

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.560
it, they will receive your
genuine feedback much more

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.230
appreciatingly, and they become

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.960
friends, and stay friends.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.930
So that is what I think is the
way in which authenticity is

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.640
not always good.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.240
You have to watch for it.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.270
That's what I call wisdom is not
about staying on one end

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.080
or other end.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.320
It is not right or wrong,
good or bad.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.640
How do you balance it in a way
that is appropriate to the

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.770
context, and still being
true to yourself?

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.670
Any other questions?

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:36.920
Comments?

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.090
Then shall I move on with
a couple more examples?

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.650
And then, I can take
more questions.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.710
You can prepare for
that, if you like.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.600
Here is a gentleman, Alan
Mulally I had a good chance to

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.000
interact with in Boeing,
and later, in Ford.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.150
He comes out of--

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.060
he had aeronautical
background.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.080
At one time, he wanted
to be an astronaut.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:09.400
And unfortunately, because he
has some eye issue, he could

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.500
not become an astronaut.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.739
He was very disappointed.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:15.170
But then he said, you know, at
least let me make the planes.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.310
So he joined--

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.190
from Kansas, he came
to Seattle.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.730
He joined Boeing.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.210
He became the president of
Boeing Commercial Aircraft.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.900
Somewhere down the line, he was
invited to Ford, and that

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.350
was 2006 time period.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:35.920
And then when the financial
malaise hit the nation, most

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.840
of the companies took
the bailout--

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.190
government bailout.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:45.010
Instead, Ford went ahead-- and
under the guidance of Alan

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:48.909
Mulally-- took about
$24 billion loan.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:53.139
They actually had to
get that moniker

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.730
mortgaged, that Ford moniker.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.000
Everybody looked at it and said,
isn't it stupid for you

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.790
to not take the easy money?

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.600
Not only that--

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.940
there so many other actions
which it took, everybody

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.840
questioned, we should have never
brought that person from

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.820
outside the automobile
industry.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.710
What are some of
those actions?

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:19.090
He went ahead, and sold the
most expensive, profitable

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:23.160
Ford businesses, like Land
Rover and Jaguar.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.230
He sold Indian Tata Group.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:32.510
And Ford was making a lot of
money making trucks and SUVs.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:36.280
He said, you know, we need to
start focusing on smart cars.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.440
Ford said, we don't
make money on it.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.600
Then he said, you better figure
out how to make money

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.660
on the small cars, because
that is the future.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.130
Then he found out that--

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.430
what you call--

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:53.700
Ford Taurus, which used to be
a famous car, they shut done

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.830
that brand because they said
nobody is buying it.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:01.000
He said, well, if you have
already built a brand value,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.400
figure out how to come up with
something, and make that brand

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.820
value to pay for itself
instead of trying

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.420
to build a new brand.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:13.090
So in more ways than one, he was
very counter-intuitive to

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.560
what they were doing
in and out.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:22.770
But now, five years later, Ford
is much, much more green,

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:27.280
much, much more profitable, and
it is on a path to success

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.620
that was unprecedented.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.090
And even when compared to their
competitors, they have

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.800
done exceedingly well.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.080
So in that respect, I believe
certain ways in which Alan

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.800
Mulally had taken decisions,
taken actions, and how he

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.050
communicated are some things
that increase the value of not

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.940
only the Ford brand, but
also his own brand.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.900
And some of you might want to
check out Alan Mulally videos.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.170
There are--

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.140
Alan Mulally, some of the
articles about him.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.260
He is extremely positive.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.220
When I went to interview him, he
knew more about me, and he

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.120
was really preparing various
stuff for me

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.820
rather than for himself.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.960
Then when I came out--

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.610
actually, it was at Boeing--

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.310
I asked the secretary, is
Alan always like that?

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:17.380
He said, yup.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.850
He's always the cheerleader.

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.800
For anything he takes on, he's
positive, appreciative,

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.680
gung-ho, and 100% into it.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.670
Interesting.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.240
But those are some things which
we don't know how to

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.780
deal with sometimes in
different cultures.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.730
You need to think about, what
is your authentic style, and

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.830
what appropriate style?

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.420
How do you really make it work
in whichever group, whichever

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.670
company you are in.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.940
Let's look at the context
sensitivity and discernment

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.230
for a minute.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:56.620
Sam Palmisano, when he took over
IBM in 2002, he saw the

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.630
writing on the wall--

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.400
PCs are becoming commodities.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.090
Hardware is not where
the energy is.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.320
So what did he do?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.360
He sold the entire PC
business to Lenovo.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.620
He sold the hard disks
to Hitatchi.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.540
He got rid of even the
chips manufacturing.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:18.720
He completely converted IBM
into services business.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.020
Few years later, Leo
Apotheker, from

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.170
SAP, took over HP.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.360
He tried to do the same thing.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.700
He wanted to get
rid of the HP--

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.880
what you might call the
hardware business.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.696
Even though they bought the
Palm for $1 billion a year

00:38:36.696 --> 00:38:41.420
ago, within a month of
introducing the Palm Tablet,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.260
he closed it down.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.870
Of course, they closed him down
before he had a chance to

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:52.500
do more of what they called
damage to HP.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.770
What was smart at one time was
no along wise by the time it

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.950
came to Apotheker.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:03.490
That means you cannot just
blindly follow successful

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.810
people, even though they may
be your bosses, they may be

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.000
your seniors, or someone else.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.440
You will have to pay attention
to what is appropriate, and

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.090
use discernment and judgment
to make it work.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.840
In India, when I studied,
there was a gentleman.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.200
This gentleman--

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.690
called Dr. V., for a short
way to think about--

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:31.190
he created, after he retired
as an eye surgeon

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.970
at the age of 55--

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.490
he said, I'm too young
to retire.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.990
I want to make a contribution
to the world.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:42.250
So he converted his family
housing to an 11-bed hospital.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.620
And he convinced everybody he
knew in his family and his

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.040
friends to becoming the eye
doctors, or to provide eye

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.110
medicine supplies, or to create
an organization, or to

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.020
create training.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:01.860
As of last year, Aravind Eye
Care is the largest eye care

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.590
system in the world, operating
at one 10th the

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.540
cost of United Kingdom.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.800
They provide more services
than the entire

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.660
United Kingdom provides.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.280
Just to give you a comparison,
they got license for the

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.080
cataract lenses.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.330
They got the patent from the
United States, they got the

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.240
license from United States.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.273
Same cataract lenses
are being sold for

00:40:27.273 --> 00:40:29.490
$150 in United States.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.760
In India, they offer
it for $2.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.050
I was told it has come
down to $1 now.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.760
And for every one paid surgery,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.410
they do two free surgeries.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:45.210
Check out this book, "Infinite
Vision." It is written by

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.800
[INAUDIBLE], one of the authors
actually lives in

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.980
So when you have a larger
purpose, when you have a noble

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.740
purpose, your smartness
can actually

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.100
serve a larger community.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.210
So each of you being
extraordinarily smart, you

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.240
might want to think about and
say, where am I contributing?

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.220
What is my North Star?

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.650
What is my noble purpose?

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.220
Where do I want to be 10 years
from now, 20 years from now?

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.470
It is good to do 10x
contribution at this moment,

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:22.780
but 10 years from now or 20
years from now, what would you

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.350
like to say to your children--

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.440
and for some of you later than
that-- maybe to your

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.230
grandchildren, what have you
contributed to the planet?

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.400
If you can begin to think
about it, then your

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.610
performance--

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.830
whatever do today, tomorrow--

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.730
it will come with a purpose.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.120
That is what Indra Nooyi
did in PepsiCo.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.350
Not only they are looking at
making the drinks, Coca Cola

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:54.040
drinks, and pizza,
and all of them--

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.120
doing food, what you
call a fun food--

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.080
it's OK.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.420
They said, we want to get more
profit from good-for-you

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:07.200
foods, not just fun-for-you
foods.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.560
Because of that, they've went
ahead and said, we buy Quaker

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.490
Oats for oatmeal.

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.500
We want to create more kinds
of healthy food.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.690
Of course, their own stock
holders don't like it.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.040
So she's actually fighting
sometimes for her own

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.950
position, because everybody
wants you to make money right

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:30.440
now, but they don't care about
anything-- where it goes, and

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.750
how it happens.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.310
So at some level, you need to
look at it and say, how do you

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.870
reconcile your long-term
vision with

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:40.230
your short-term delivery?

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:41.910
That is where the
wisdom comes.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:45.260
You cannot just say, I will only
focus on the vision; or

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.950
you cannot just say, I will
only focus on quarterly

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.190
results of what I need to do.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:54.010
The wisdom is to be able to
balance both of them, and

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.550
align your head and your
heart and the hands.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:00.670
When you bring that alignment,
the wisdom is something that

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.980
actually naturally emerges
in all of it.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.610
So again, Steve Jobs
and Ron Johnson

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.280
created the Apple Stores.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.280
But as you know, he tried to
take it to JC Penney, and

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.160
tried to apply the same recipes
of no sales, focusing

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.280
on marketing, and creating
stores within stores.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.760
Again, he got booted out,
because what worked for Apple

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.060
didn't work for JC Penney.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.900
So you need to have, again,
three things which I said

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.410
about personal leadership.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.580
Am I having a discernment and
right judgment to use what

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.980
needs to be used
where and when.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.430
I can't use what made me
successful in Apple

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.310
stores in JC Penny.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:51.050
Remember, I used the word
core incompetence?

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.630
You need to ask yourself,
whatever got you this job, for

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.840
you to go beyond it, you have
to see where is your foot

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.290
nailed to the floor.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.720
Most chances are, your foot is
nailed to what got you the

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.480
success the last time.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.230
Think about your success formula
Think about your

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:14.390
winning formula, and see what
you need to learn beyond that.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:19.640
And here is another lady, who is
considered to be one of the

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.520
richest entrepreneurs in India,
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.480
She has a company called Biocon,
and she focused on

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.620
oral insulin.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.860
When it didn't work out, she
realized her focus is on

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.180
actually diabetes therapy.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.160
She cannot become very anal
about one of the product, and

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.090
lose focus on the big picture.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:44.520
So last thing which I'll say
is Ratan Tata, the guy who

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:49.240
bought the Jaguar and Land
Rover, he also realized it is

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.350
not just the most expensive cars
that he needs to sell,

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:57.500
but being in India, he wants to
make automobiles affordable

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.330
to everybody.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:03.210
So he came up with a car which
costs only $2,000.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.750
Right now, it has become even
cheaper because a dollar is 62

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.030
rupees right now.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.220
So that means, for $2,000,
he could do.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.120
Marketing didn't work out very
well, because he called it a

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.030
poor man's automobile.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.770
So not poor men want to buy it,
because they want to buy a

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.900
rich person's automobile.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.880
They don't want to buy a
poor man's automobile.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.110
So marketing kind of messed
up a little bit.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:29.070
But I have a feeling the concept
really caught on, and

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.800
there are many other companies
are beginning to make it.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.590
This is an example of
enlightened self-interest--

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.720
you have everything what you
have, but question is, how do

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.400
you support other people?

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.030
So in my book, I talk
about any of this.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:45.940
But right at this time, I would
love to take questions.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.990
Yeah, please?

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.220
AUDIENCE: You touched upon it
a little bit, but if you can

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.080
expand in more detail about the
barriers from going from

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.340
smart to wise.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.880
Especially in the context of,
you have a vision, you're

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.430
looking at the bigger picture,
you're looking beyond

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.670
self-interest, and more for
community or for your company

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:04.930
or your family.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:08.440
Of course, the people who are
around you that should be

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.370
supporting you are the
biggest barriers.

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.950
And how do you overcome
these ones?

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.270
PRASAD KAIPA: OK, thank you.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.470
One action orientation.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:19.580
Smartness is about thinking,
wisdom is about doing.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.760
Wisdom is always here and now.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.760
Smartness is always about the
future you are creating.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:30.850
So you need to realize that the
wisdom will not come by

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.570
reading out of a book.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:36.100
But if you can-- let us say,
some of you, because you got

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.752
the book as you came in--
let us say you create

00:46:38.752 --> 00:46:40.740
a small book club.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.840
Start talking about every week,
one chapter, or one part

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.490
of a chapter, and see how you
can apply it in your immediate

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:53.710
work or in your family
outside.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.570
Try to share those things.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.520
You can even create
a Google Hangout.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.270
You can create some of other
ways of sharing it.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:03.600
Begin to apply one
step at a time.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:09.120
If you can do that, chances are
90 days from now, you will

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.260
be much wiser.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.700
But you see, saying that
is much easier.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.090
I'm sure you have hundred
reasons why you don't have

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:21.160
time, you don't have enough
people, it takes energy--

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.820
you have too many things on
your plate to be able to

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.900
organize any of this stuff.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.360
So what it means is, one,
it is cognitive framing.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.050
Don't look at wisdom as
something away from

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.180
what you are doing.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.480
As a matter of fact, whatever is
written about in the book,

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.220
or what I'm talking about, is
about application of what

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:47.150
you're doing in a smarter,
in a wiser way

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.430
right now, right here.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.470
So wisdom is not just
about long-term.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.780
So that is one thing
you need let go.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.370
That means focus
on applying it.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:03.400
Second, do it with other people,
because wisdom grows

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.900
when you have multiple
questions, and people

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.200
challenge you.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.500
It is not about showing off
how smart you are in the

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.040
group, but asking questions so
that all of you can learn.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.530
Wisdom multiplies
and synergizes.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.870
So that is something which is
hard for people to look at.

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:25.280
Third one I found is a barrier,
if several times we

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:30.030
look at, it is outside of
what I'm supposed to do.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:33.790
I will do this, and if I have
time, I will read the book.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:37.640
If I have time, I will apply
it, without recognizing

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.750
whatever you have to make
it more executable, more

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.800
successful, you need wisdom.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:51.400
Because as you saw Larry doing,
it is not about adding

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.390
more projects that makes
Google successful.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:58.450
It is about removing certain
things which are not having a

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:02.835
high impact, and focusing on a
smaller number of them with

00:49:02.835 --> 00:49:06.990
the discernment, and making them
deeper, more profound,

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.366
more meaningful, and more
higher quality.

00:49:10.366 --> 00:49:13.260
For that, you need
discernment.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.310
So similarly, if you can begin
to recognize, acting with

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.600
wisdom, you have everything
what it takes.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.390
You did just that.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.640
You need to put it
in practice.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.070
Acting with smartness, you
may need more knowledge.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.990
You may need to read more, or
you may need to actually talk

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:33.230
more, or do something else.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.260
These are three major barriers
I have seen.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:40.360
Many smart people, despite
having the resources--

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:45.130
time, our cognitive framing,
and third, application--

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:46.590
this are some things which you
need to pay attention.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.340
AUDIENCE: So I'm just wondering
how you applied all

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.350
these concepts in your own life,
and my significant parts

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.190
of your life where you
decided, OK, this is

00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.560
more wise to do?

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.220
PRASAD KAIPA: OK.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.080
Well, my daughter says--

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.110
like, I remember when
she was in school.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.340
I traveled so much that one
day, I came in and she was

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.240
going to school.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.120
And I was reading paper early
morning, and she was busy

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.200
getting ready.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.900
And then my wife was there, and
we were talking, and she

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.770
my wife was giving me update
on what happened during the

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.310
week that I was gone.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:30.870
I was saying, uh-huh, and then
continuing with the newspaper.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:35.410
My daughter comes in and says to
me, why do you keep saying

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.260
uh-huh when you're reading
newspaper as if somebody is

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.860
listening to you reading it?

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.000
Then I put my best, caring,
patronizing tone, and I said,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.010
sweetheart, your mother is
giving me an update.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.400
I'm acknowledging her.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.260
It is not quite to listen
without acknowledging.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.080
She said, Dad, you talk
about communication.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.750
My mother has gone to bathroom
five minutes ago.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.880
Now I know how much
you are listening.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:08.900
What I learned was that more
you talk about wisdom, the

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.820
lack of it shows up a lot more
clearly to other people.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:18.380
But what I'm learning is, places
where nobody's paying

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.420
attention to me, places where
I am not in front of other

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.310
people, that is where actually
I have an opportunity to

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.690
contribute, and learn,
and grow.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:32.590
So I'm paying a lot more
attention to learning from

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:38.190
home, and paying attention to
areas where I can make a

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.610
contribution, just because
I want to learn,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.150
and I want to practice.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.680
So I should also say, after my
colleague and myself, we

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.900
finished the book,
I have learned a

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.780
lot more about wisdom.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:58.140
And I'm ready to do 2.0 the book
already, because some of

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.440
these are all based on
practical stuff.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:05.270
But I'm also learning which of
these are easier for me to

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:09.380
practice, which of these are a
little harder to practice.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:15.270
So that is how I'm beginning to
make a move myself, to take

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.750
what I have written and apply
it in my own life.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:19.550
And it is working.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.380
That is one thing.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.500
Most of the time, I used to
say, what you write is for

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.470
others, what you learn
is for yourself.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.770
But I'm actually been figuring
out that some of what we have

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.260
learned from others, I can
apply it for myself.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:36.130
So this book is as good for my
own learning as it is for

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.610
other people.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.710
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so with
that, I think we're

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:40.530
almost out of time.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.660
So once again, I'd like to thank
Dr. Kaipa for coming and

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.390
talking to us.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.530
And if you have any more
questions, or would like your

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:50.540
book signed, I believe he has
some more time to sign your

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.450
copies of the book.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:52.920
So if we could all thank him.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:58.347
