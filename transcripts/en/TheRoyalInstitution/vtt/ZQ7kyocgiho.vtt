00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.270
Particle accelerators are complex and
fascinating machines

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.480
and it might be surprising that there's about
35,000

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.629
of them in the world

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.079
and around half of those are used for one
specific

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.969
practical application.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.630
And that is treating cancer.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.470
The earliest mention of
cancer dates back to 1600 BC,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.210
where the Edwin Smith papyrus describes the
ailment.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.449
And for as long as humanity has
suffered under it and known of it,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.749
we've also try to cure it.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.060
The same papyrus outlines instructions on
how to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.460
surgically remove a breast tumour.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.470
Over the following centuries our knowledge
and understanding grew,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.600
but it wasn't until 1895 when Wilhelm R�ntgen
discovered x-rays that we got our

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.050
first real modern breakthrough in cancer
treatment.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.430
R�ntgen used a cathode ray tube
like this one which has a vacuum inside

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.940
the glass sphere and a cathode at one end,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.120
which when heated with high-voltage

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.820
gives out electrons,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.330
which would have been pulled towards the anode
at the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.970
other end, and when it hits the anode it generates
x rays.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.110
Within weeks of R�ntgen's
discovery the damaging properties of

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.680
x-rays were already being applied
positively to treat cancer.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.300
X-rays kill cancer cells by damaging their
DNA

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.480
through the mechanism of ionization.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.090
The x-ray photons carry enough energy to
remove the electrons from water molecules.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.659
When molecules lose one or more
of their electrons they become charged and

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.660
highly chemically reactive.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.740
They bind to available DNA molecules nearby
and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.020
attack both the bases and the backbone
of DNA in the cancer cells.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.950
However the x-ray beam doesn't differentiate
between cancerous cells and healthy cells

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.510
so it's possible in a course of
treatment to actually kill some of the healthy

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.170
cells.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.390
These machines are incredibly precise
but getting the right dose distribution

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.690
is really challenging because of the
fundamental property of photons

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.440
that once x-ray photons go into the body
they'll keep on travelling and go out the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.760
other side.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.899
One way to address this
challenge is to use a different type of particle,

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.730
say a heavy charged particle like a proton.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.810
And particle accelerators can take protons
from inside the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.779
hydrogen atom, form them into high energy
beams,

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.159
and that can then be directed at
a tumor inside the body.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.029
In a similar way to radiotherapy the particle
enters the

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.099
body and hits the tumor.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.419
However instead of passing through the
body it stops at its target.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.510
this happens due to a phenomenon called the
Bragg

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.510
peak.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.120
So if i I was to plot the depth inside the
human body

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.669
when a fast-moving charged particle comes
in,

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.439
it comes in at high speed and loses energy
gradually

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.739
through ionization

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.050
until it stops at the end of its range.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.889
The dose deposited
when it does that starts quite low when

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:04.109
it's at high speed and as the particle
decreases speed, it increases the dose it

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.319
deposits,

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.930
until it stops at the end of its range.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.689
The higher the initial energy of the
beam, the deeper that Bragg peak is inside

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:13.919
the body

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.340
and that means that we can
tune the energy of the beam to reach the exact

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.930
depth of a tumour.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.590
The main benefit for proton therapy over
conventional radiotherapy is that the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.849
dose to the surrounding healthy tissue
is lower, and that's particularly useful

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.299
for cancers which a deep inside the body
or close to sensitive organs,

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.079
and there are researchers around the world
looking at

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.069
ways to make this treatment even more effective

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.969
by using heavier particles
like carbon ions, or even increasing the

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.379
dose delivered during a single treatment
to the cancer cells, while keeping the

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.989
low-dose in the surrounding tissue.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.489
From early x-rays in the 19th century to
cutting-edge proton beam treatments in

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.700
the 21st century,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.189
particle accelerators have played a key role
in our treatment

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.189
of cancer.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.299
And while they're just one treatment modality,

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.790
we're constantly working to make better cheaper
and more efficient accelerators

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:20.570
to make sure that doctors have the best tools
available.
