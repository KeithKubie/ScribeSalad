&gt;&gt;Announcer: Thanks for coming, I’m happy
to introduce David Stephenson today. David

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:14.140
shared with me that there are several Google
links to the book and to his work. The idea

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.410
for this book has a pedigree that goes back
Eric Schmidt and Tim O'Reilly and the conversation

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:30.550
they were having soon after the 2008 election.
The topic of this book came up and Eric told

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.879
Tim O'Reilly someone should write a book about
this. Soon enough David was doing so. And

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.960
that’s one of the sources of this book.
David is principle of Stephenson Strategies,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.239
Medfield enterprise in government web 2.0
consultant firm. He is a leader in data liberation

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.539
and the open government movement. He was a
consultant on transparency strategies to the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.370
District of Columbia Office of Chief Technologist.
That was when Vivek Kundra was holding that

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:13.010
post. He was also the co-author of Data Dynamite,
except he was poached ruthlessly by someone

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:21.150
named President Obama to be the nation's first
CIO, and apparently decided to take him up

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.390
on that. Stephenson's lectures worldwide on
data liberation, writes great books and also

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.140
articles and blog post on data and other issues
including homeland security and environmental

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.220
tragedy. Dave, thank you very much for coming
and joining us today.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.290
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON: Thank you David, I really
appreciate it. So, today I'm going to give

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:55.610
you an overview on my book, Data Dynamite.
And also try to relate that to Google and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:05.730
particularly to Google's mission. But before
I get going I have admit a couple of things

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.520
about myself. First of all, I was a religion
major in college. While I never had any intentions

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.550
of becoming a minister I have become an evangelist.
Only, I'm an evangelist for change. And I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:27.080
hope that my enthusiasm for this subject comes
across today. Secondly, if you are familiar

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:37.090
with the Myers-Briggs personality test. According
to research about 95% of engineers are classified

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:45.760
in the Myers-Briggs as INTJ's: Introspective,
intuitive, thinking and judging which makes

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.020
you the polar opposite of me, ENFP: Extroverted,
intuitive, feeling and perceiving. That can

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.100
be one of two things, either we are going
to talk right pass each other or we can find

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.190
a synthesis where we benefit from the best
of each other's thinkings. I like to think

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.550
that that is what we are going to do today.
The third thing about myself is that I think

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:25.270
of it sometimes as a cosmic joke that I should
be writing a book about data. Because of a

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.820
gruesome incident that I will not go into
detail, about a 7th and 8th grade algebra

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.740
teacher who didn't know how to deal with people
with ADD left me permanently scared when it

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.319
came to dealing with data. So, for the longest
time, as far as I was concerned there was

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.349
only one reason to deal with data. And that
was to go over the Red Sox batting averages.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:59.390
Look what that got us. Eventually I did come
around and became convinced of the value of

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.150
data. And when I became convinced of that
value of data, I found it really difficult

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:13.040
to get hold of it. For the longest time that
was very legitimate. It was costly, difficult,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.489
a lot of technological barriers to gathering,
processing, and disseminating data. But as

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.770
you and I know, those have all been taken
care of and yet this mind set still remains.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.259
It’s very much, as far as I'm concerned,
like that last scene in Raiders of the Lost

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:37.699
Ark. Where the Ark was boxed up in a crate
and put in a government warehouse. And you

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:48.639
knew that it was never going to be accessed
again. And it seems to me that when you substitute

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:58.539
data warehouse, it’s such a wonderful term.
In its symbolic aspects that, unfortunately,

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.120
often stuff gets into the data warehouse and
we never see it again.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.029
But I maintain that time has come to end that
practice and that it is time for data for

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:16.860
the rest of us. The time has come to liberate
data. Liberating data makes it automatically

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.729
available for all who need it, when and where
they need it, in forms to use and with freedom

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:31.599
to use as they choose, while at the same time
protecting privacy and security. And I maintain

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:39.639
that this is really crucial for a lot of today’s
challenges. I think that the whole concept

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.410
of liberating data is crucial to deal with
some of the issues we are facing today. First

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.059
of all, within the corporate workplace, if
you give people real time data for the first

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:59.080
time ever. In the past we have had a situation
where that has been primarily limited to senior

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.789
executives and elites in areas like marketing
and things like that due to do the costs of

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:12.409
DI dashboards and other barriers of that sort.
When you start giving people access to real

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:19.541
time data they can really use, you are going
to get better decision making, particularly

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:25.479
if you add in social media tools to be able
to collaboratively analyze and act on that

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.249
data. I think you are going to get fundamentally
better decision making because you are going

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.962
to get a number of different perspectives
brought to bear on it. Secondly, you are going

00:06:33.962 --> 00:06:39.430
to be able to automate a lot of processes
that have been manual in the past. That certainly

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.809
has economic benefits to it. Thirdly, one
of the big demands of the republicans in the

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:53.849
US. I did a lecture in Montreal on a related
subject this week with an international audience.

00:06:53.849 --> 00:07:00.520
And I was saying to them that this is equally
applicable on worldwide basis. But focusing

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.830
just in the US right now, one of the concerns
with the GOP is cutting the cost of government

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:13.319
regulations. There is a tremendous potential
when you have seamless flow of data to cut

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:20.580
the cost of regulatory reporting. And at the
same time, this is somewhat paradoxical. The

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.520
experiences in Australia and the Netherlands,
the two places that have really done this

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.440
to the greatest extent. They've actually been
capable of improving the quality of regulation.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.909
And that’s because of the fact that for
the first time ever when companies file a

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:42.360
single unified data file that goes to the
central government and then automatically

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.830
flows into all of the different agencies,
for the first time ever all those agencies

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:56.349
can survey a given company at the same time.
And equally important, and I think this is

00:07:56.349 --> 00:08:03.919
true both within the business sector. I would
argue that banks, probably more than any other

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:08.479
sector of the economy would benefit from this.
Because I don't know about you, but frankly

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:15.770
I don't trust any bank anymore. And the only
way they are going to earn my trust is through

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:24.919
transparency. There is actually a professor
who I finally met in this conference in Montreal

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:33.250
who was saying that, had a system of the sort
I'm talking about been in effect in the mid-2000s

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:42.580
we actually might have totally avoided all
the bank shenanigans and the whole economic

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.740
collapse never would have happened. Can you
imagine that? That is rather damning. And

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:56.230
finally, so that you can restore this through
transparency and earn the public trust. And

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:03.509
finally, probably on a most imaginative stand
point, you can also make the public partners

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:12.620
and crowdsource a lot of innovation. Now how
would you actually go about doing this? In

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.810
the book I outline a five step process that
starts with making the organization truly

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:27.649
data centric. I mean that almost as much literally
as figuratively. That thinking of, in a very

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:35.970
systemic way, on your date flow coming from
the center of the corporation. No matter where

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.460
it is housed but coming from the center and
they flowing through massive feedback loops,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:49.490
coming back in again, so you have this continuous
flow of data. Secondly, and I can’t emphasize

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:57.240
this enough I’m going to call Google on
this to some extent also. The second step

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:07.079
is tagging and syndicating data. The goal,
I’m convinced that we need to be pursuing

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:16.350
is entering data one time, only one time.
That’s perfectly feasible now, with tagging

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.960
of data.&nbsp; Because all I have to do is enter
once and then repot those tags elsewhere and

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:29.220
the date will automatically flow to those
places and the language that I’m particularly

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.560
obsessed with right now is XBRL. The eXtensible
Business Reporting Language which from everything

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:42.779
I’ve been able to learn about Google until
now seems that even Google is not using.&nbsp;

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:48.350
There is only a handful literally of companies
worldwide who are using the extensible business

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:54.300
language reporting. Behind the firewall everybody
now is required to us it when they report

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.589
to the SCC.&nbsp; But behind the firewall you
have literally five organizations in the whole

00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:08.279
world from the cutting edge change that are
realizing all sorts of incredible benefits.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:15.640
But Google is not one of them. So one of the
things you get is as benefit.&nbsp; When you start

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.860
with this and you only enter the data once
is that you get a single version of the truth.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:26.410
All you have to do, [cough] the data doesn’t
get altered when you enter it into an Excel

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:33.199
Spreadsheet.&nbsp; It retains what one of my friend's
calls its status as a data nugget where the

00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:39.960
metadata is attached to that from the tag
and it retains its identity wherever it ends

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.730
up being used. the next step is to provide
tools. I was hoping that my friend Gordon

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:52.480
Wattenberg would be here today because this
is a tool that Martin developed before he

00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:04.089
joined Google when he was over at IBM called
Many Eyes and its symbolic of a wide range

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:09.470
of tools that.
For those of us who are not left brain and

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:15.649
analytical can really make data come alive.
This was the very first data visualization

00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:22.750
that I even did. I had never used any of the
tools before, I had to scrape the data because

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:32.949
it has not been structured from a PDF, upload
the data and then enter it into this particular

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:44.470
visualization tool. And believe me if you
see the original chart, even the most highly

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:53.320
trained statistician would be hard to find
the symbolic or the importance of all this

00:12:53.320 --> 00:13:02.279
stuff. And yet when you did that with Many
Eyes it comes to mind right away, now how

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:10.649
did I manage to get to this? I’ve locked
up and I can't seem to get beyond it. Hmm.

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:11.870
Anybody have an idea?

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.850
&gt;&gt;Male AUDIENCE #1: Try the escape key.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.709
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON: The escape key, of course.
Ok, the next thing is to get workers the data.

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:25.459
It doesn’t help to have all this data available
if you don’t get it to workers. And I’ve

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:33.899
maintained that that means every worker gets
the data that is relevant to his or her specific

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:38.160
needs. In the District of Columbia one of
the things they did was that they actually

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:45.160
got down to the level of the individual worker
or the crews who were filling pot holes In

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.639
the past they used to get a list of the pot
holes they were to fill and the order they

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:56.329
were to fill them in. It gave no credit to
these guys who had been working on the streets

00:13:56.329 --> 00:14:01.180
of the District of Columbia for years. For
the knowledge that they had accumulated of

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:08.879
what was the logical order to do this in.
So now they get a display of the pot holes

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:13.290
that have to be filled and they get choose
the order on which they have to do it. And

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.839
if that means that they find themselves across
the street from Dunkin Doughnuts at 10:15

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:26.079
in the morning, so be it. It's an understanding
of the real world aspect of all this so you

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:33.480
have to get the people the data that they
need. And then finally the last step that

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:40.160
I outline in the book is of actually sharing
your data. I did and extensive thing about

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.420
the Netflix price back before Netflix started
to stumble.&nbsp; You may remember that they did

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:52.620
this incredible crowdsourcing trying to improve
their algorithm. And they released millions

00:14:52.620 --> 00:15:02.130
and millions animized records of rental patterns
and challenged. I go into a little bit of

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:11.310
detail in the book but I urge you to go to
the web and find the narratives that actually

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:21.089
accompany the entries into this because it
was the most incredible social media mediated

00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:26.910
type of process that brought everybody in.
This is another example, Beth Noveck who recently

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:33.040
left the Obama administration as the deputy
CTO before she joined the administration had

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.310
done something called "Peer to Patent" that
actually crowdsourced the whole patent review

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:45.430
process.&nbsp; As you may know the patent review
pressed is way behind the times and by opening

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:52.759
that to the public&nbsp;they where able to cut
significantly into that back log and actually

00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:59.370
improve the quality of the process. So how
does this actually work in real life? I would

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:06.019
like to give you two example from right here.
One of them right here in Cambridge with a

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:15.889
company call Vitality Inc. that makes a really
high tech product called apill bottle cap.

00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:21.370
Now this is not your grandmothers pill bottle
cap each one has its own IP Address.&nbsp; Each

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:29.450
one has a low power transmitter in it and
a little LED and each one is programmed for

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:34.810
your particular prescription and the time
at which you are supposed to take it and about

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:40.420
a half an hour before you are supposed to
take . It starts to glow slightly there are

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:47.839
little tinkling sounds to remind you. As soon
as you take the top off a single is sent to

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:54.589
the Vitality servers. At the end of the month
your doctor gets a report on how frequently

00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:58.640
took the pill. This is one if the thing where
I don’t know about you but when you go to

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.230
see your doctor. Particularly the first time
after you had e new prescription for a maintenance

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:12.800
drug The doctor says, "How frequently have
you been taking it?" "Well, I think I took

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:19.640
it most of the time." Well it turns out in
fact there is a 23 billion dollar a year problem

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:26.030
because about half of the population is on
maintenance drugs. And about of that only

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:34.240
half actually take them on regular basis that
mounts up to 23 billion dollars a year in

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.670
excess hospitalizations, unnecessary illnesses,
prescriptions that aren't refills and things

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:47.760
of that sort.
And Vitality Inc. system deals with that in

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.300
a very, very clever fashion I should say also.
If you don’t take the pill on time a neighbor

00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:03.520
or an adult child gets either a text or a
phone message saying "Dad didn’t take his

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:12.310
pill." And then you get on the phone to dad
and harass him to take that it's an amazing

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:19.010
system. The second one is developed across
the river at Beth Israel Deaconess, Dr. John

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:26.050
Halamka who is a polymath if I ever heard
one.&nbsp; If you haven’t seen it check his

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:34.870
blog my life as a health care CIO. He has
five official titles as well as many others

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:40.320
including, he's not just CIO at the hospital
he is also a ER doctor there,&nbsp; and he points

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:46.680
out that if you are a patient in the ER you
want to make darn sure that has got access

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.630
to every line of your record&nbsp; because you
may not be in a position to tell him anything

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:59.290
about it. On the other hand a physician in
the same hospital or billing clerk or somebody

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:05.370
of that sort doesn’t need access&nbsp;and shouldn’t
have access to the whole record. And so they

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:13.700
designs in a whole series of redundant controls
to make sure that information is available

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.310
to those who need it.&nbsp; But only on a need
to know basis and if you can imagine I can't

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:26.940
imagine any more data centric application
that is both&nbsp;literally a matter of life or

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:35.290
death and where security and privacy are also
paramount, so it's a great example of that.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:40.950
So,how can we actually build a data centric
society and what in particular can Google

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:48.450
do to play a role on this? I think that if
your mission as just being perfectly in line

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:57.240
with what I'm talking about and I'd like to
suggest a couple specific steps that I think

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.820
you could do and I would be glad to meet with
some of you over lunch to talk about some

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:10.920
other things. First of all you can be a model.
As I mentioned unless I’m sadly mistaken

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:19.970
Google is not using the extensible business
report language global ledger behind the firewall.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:25.880
So I’m here by throwing down the virtual
gauntlet.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.670
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:34.220
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON: [laughing] Well hopefully
they’ll see the video.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.250
&gt;&gt;Female Audience #1: can you explain whets
special about that?

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:42.730
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON: Sure, let me just finish
and then I'll be glad to do that. Secondly,

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:56.830
provide tools. this happens to be the nonprofit
Gapminder. You all have bought the commercial

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:03.740
rights to it and it's known now as Public
Data Explorer but Martin and his group and

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:09.440
a number of others have developed all sorts
of wonderful data visualization tools within

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:16.590
Google. I am also challenging you to do more
to get those out to the general public so

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:23.780
that they can use them. If you haven’t I
strongly urge you to do at least one visualization

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:30.450
with Public Data Explorers. Anybody ever used
that? It's incredible because you know, it

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:39.410
actually animates the data and it is so compelling
what you can do with that. It's remarkable.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.480
Next thing would be promote data, that was
one of the things that intrigued me the other

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:53.730
day was what if, on the results page, up here
maybe between videos and news if there was

00:21:53.730 --> 00:22:03.350
a new line on the results page that said data
and had links to relevant data associated

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:11.731
with the results of your search. I think that
would be absolutely incredible; that’s another

00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:16.110
challenge to you.
Now, I happen to be very optimistic about

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:24.250
making this transformation and because of
my belief on the work of Steve Martin. I’m

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:31.960
sorry, I meant to say Steve Jobs and Martin
Luther that makes me optimistic about this.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:38.220
When you think about it, a friend of mine,
Wendy Jameson is CEO of high tech firm in

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.960
Phoenix when&nbsp; she saw the first chapter in
my book she said "You know, what you are talking

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:49.090
about here is really for data the same kind
of thing Martin Luther did for the written

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:55.630
word." And look at those statistic that is
actually amazing, Gutenberg had invented the

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:04.990
movable press,&nbsp;I guess 50 years before Luther
did his work with translating the Bible into

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:12.280
German and then printing it. But it was really
with Luther that the printing press took off.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.230
And I see a direct analogy there, this is
a thing that Wendy pointed out to me. That

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:25.710
Luther got rid of the necessity of relying
on a trained Priesthood, in this case it was

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:37.250
literality a Priesthood of the monks&nbsp;who
had to translate the bible into vernacular

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:43.010
German. Suddenly he did that so everybody
had direct access to the Bible. And then secondly

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:50.260
instead of having it copied by hand by the
monks it was instead available on a printed

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:57.700
bases. So you have 390 editions published
in the year 1523. Think about that. With it

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:05.110
the small population in general in Europe
and then the even smaller population who were

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:11.450
actually literate, that is an astounding number.
By 1525, three million copies of pamphlets

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:18.810
relating to Luther were in print and equally
interesting, he actually transformed the nature

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:25.890
of scholarship. Up until then the best and
the greatest were these monks who spent almost

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:33.360
their entire day hand copying illuminated
manuscripts&nbsp; And after Luther came along

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.650
that was no longer necessary so this same
monks were suddenly able to actually engage

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:45.590
in original scholarship. And my other source
of inspiration is Steve Jobs in this regard.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:53.100
One of the things, I don’t know if Walter
Isaacson has it in his new biography of Jobs&nbsp;

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.760
but there was a very revealed interview that
Terry Gross from Fresh Air did with him in

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:05.000
1996 before he came back to Apple where he
said that&nbsp; "Our goal is to bring a liberal

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.330
art perspective and a liberal arts audience
to what has traditionally had been a very

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:17.550
geeky technology and a very geeky audience."
So my final challenge to you and I think that

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:24.830
the Google search interface to me represents
very much the same kind of esthetic&nbsp; as Jobs

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:32.320
accomplished with all of his products. So
my challenge is to keep up the good work in

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:41.520
that regard and to do everything you can to
demystify the collection of data and dissemination

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:47.970
of data. So thank you very much and I'd be
glad to take questions now.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:53.190
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #2: So one of main challenges
from the Google perspective is you can't give

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:59.510
the user all the data related to a question
they pose.&nbsp; So it has to be narrowed down

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:10.300
a lot, whether you do such a thing as have
people subscribe to a feed of data matching

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:16.560
certain criteria have them do queries grammatically
in some way. With the client side tool to

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:25.050
specify it without programming and there are
various things like this already going on.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:41.710
They are just not web wide standardize. So
once you get to the vast amount of data the

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:53.500
little that goes into it. The reward for standard
encoding drops a lot because now it's about

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.260
the interface. So I think until we see this,
maybe already exists, see enough desire to

00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:04.290
match up different things together.&nbsp; For
example you might do queries for all books

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.490
matching certain criteria and news about those
authors.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.580
&gt;&gt;David Stephenson: Hm Hmm.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:15.250
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #2: [inaudible] Such things
start being done

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.410
&gt;&gt;David Stephenson: Right.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.490
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #2: or expressed as a desire.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.140
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON:I think you are right about
that. One of the things that I did ton include

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:34.570
I this but I had in my talk in Montreal that&nbsp;gave
me a great deal of optimism about the task

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:44.210
of structuring data and the benefit that could
bring about is what is already happening spontaneously

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:56.420
with Flicker photos, Facebook photos , hashtags
on Twitter. I happen to be user number 262

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:03.420
on Twitter so&nbsp;I’ve been there from day
three with Twitter and I remember distinctly

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:10.860
when hashtags were introduced and I also remember
distinctly nobody telling me a thing about

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:19.680
what they were for and I also remember within
probably two days or so just intuitively figuring

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:27.420
in it out in my own what it was.&nbsp; And I watched
with great interest; my other fields is home

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:34.830
land security and particular use of social
media in disasters and terrorism attacks.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:41.770
I’ve watched with a great deal of interest
the increasing sophistication of the use of

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:52.010
hashtags when it comes to things like the
Arab spring and so I think that there is an

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:58.030
inherent understanding. I think the bottom
line on this is people are doing it not just

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:04.480
to be altruistic but because they realize
the benefit to themselves of tagging that

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.970
information. So it doesn’t seem to me to
be a big leap of faith to go from tagging

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:17.330
photos to tagging original data. And in of
the things I have sort of taken on as my particular

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:24.100
niche and I will get to the question about
XBRL in just a minute that I have taken as

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:32.660
my own particular niche in that field is that
I think what we need to do. Another very legitimate

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:38.620
concern that people have is the sheer volume
of data within any large organization and

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:47.730
how the hell are you possibly going to get
a handle on all of that? And I maintain that

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:55.380
the way to do that is to actually give the
person who has to physically enter that data

00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:02.310
the first time, give them ownership of that
data. You know, in reality you already have

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:11.350
ownership of that data in the negative standpoint,
if something goes wrong, if it's entered incorrectly

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:19.450
the full wrath of Khan will descend upon you.
You’ll be appropriately punished. But I’m

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:24.650
talking about it in a more positive sense
of giving people ownership for the data and

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:30.930
I’m convinced that we can create perhaps
through a collaborative effort of government

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:38.840
and industry a whole bunch of tools that will
demystify tagging&nbsp;and make it feasible for

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:45.680
people without a great deal of expertise to
accurately, people can tag data right now,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.320
but if you can't do it accurately, what is
the value? But I’m enough of an optimist

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:57.460
to think it would be possible to do that.
Let me get to the question about XBRL. Its

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:04.150
the acronym stand for eXtensible Business
Reporting Language and Google and every other

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:13.250
publically trading company now is required
by the SCC&nbsp; to report to them using XBRL

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:19.160
and what they have done its been captured
by the accountants. I love accountants they

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:27.850
are some of my best friends the Maryland Association
of CPAs thinks I’m a rock star because of

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:36.560
this book. But accountants are paid to be
diligent and orderly and methodical. They

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:44.700
are not played to be visionaries. So unfortunately
in the public mind, in the corporate mind

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:53.640
XBRL has been equated almost exclusively and
this a big theme of this conference in Montreal,

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:59.710
with regulatory compliancy which is the kiss
of death. If there is a tool that has to be

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:04.770
used to comply with regulation nobody in their
right mind is going to use it otherwise. Now,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:11.060
here is the cool thing. There is a subset
which is the one that I showed that slide

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:19.930
of called XBRLGL, Global Ledger which uses
all of the term in general ledger accounting.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:26.280
Which are all the standard business terms
is anyone in the audience from the business

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:33.930
side of stuff. Well that's good because anyone
of us could actually understand any one of

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:42.961
those tags. There is no mystery at all. They
are basically business accounting terms. And

00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:53.510
Wacoal, a Japanese lingerie firm, Fujitsu
and Hitachi are the only films I know of and

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:59.480
then there is this nonprofit, the Maryland
Association of CPAs&nbsp; Has also just very recently

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:06.940
done it and they just singing the praises
of the XBPRGL because then, what is so cool

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:16.850
about it, because it uses the subset of the
tags of XPRL in general, your regulatory compliances

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:23.230
that companies all over the place bitch about,
and for good reasons,&nbsp; It really is complicated

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:34.520
and costly to comply with regulatory requirements.
The actual completion of your regulation documents

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.980
becomes almost automatic,&nbsp; It becomes basically
part of doing business. A friend of mine,

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:47.980
David Siegel wrote a book called Pull actually
argued in there, I hate to say it to my accounting

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:53.731
friend, the role of accountants might almost
vanish in 100 years or so because of this.

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:54.731
So, yes.

00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:55.990
&gt;&gt;Male AUDIENCE #3: So the advantage if you
represent everything is this language is that

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:06.020
there is accounting standards and compliance
cut for free.&nbsp; But that’s basically the

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:11.230
work up front by representing everything in
this language, why are, this four examples

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.260
you gave us, why are they all using this?

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.570
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON: Because they also realizing
of sort of day in and day out economic advantages

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:28.230
as a result of this. Wacoal has been able
to go.&nbsp; They were able to take 34 legacy

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.380
accounting systems and unify them without
going back and reworking the code. They were

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.470
able to standardize everything on Oracle all
they had to do is to add. The truth is that

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:43.260
I wish I could remember off the top of my
head in this specific savings but they really

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:49.490
have been astounding. The truly incredible
thing as far as I'm concerned is that one

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:57.400
the XBRL.org website the case study that they
show is this one from Wacoal from seven years

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:06.360
ago.&nbsp; And I think the problem has been, it
has nothing to do with the merits XPRLGL.&nbsp;

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:15.150
It's become associated with regulatory compliance
so people are totally ignoring the other side.&nbsp;

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:23.020
I urge you being enlightened people to check
it out and I do write about it in the book.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:31.890
&gt;&gt;Male AUDIENCE #4: It seems to me the similar
benefit going from paper ledgers to computerized

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.680
ledgers. You have a medium that communicate
between systems and of course it could be

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.570
a huge improvement. &nbsp;But this standard suggests
from the name that it's about money. Most

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:48.812
the data we have is not about money. &nbsp;I don't
just mean Google, but the world, is it actually

00:35:48.812 --> 00:35:49.812
adaptable?

00:35:49.812 --> 00:35:55.180
&gt;&gt;DAVID STEPHENSON: It adapts to other types
of information as well. Yeah, exactly. Any

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:01.080
other questions? Well, thank you so much.
I really appreciate the opportunity.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.180
[applause]
