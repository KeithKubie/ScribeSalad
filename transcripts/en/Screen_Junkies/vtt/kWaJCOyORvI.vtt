00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.790
From the visionary director who only makes big visionary hits or big ambitious disasters

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.118
Comes the clunky theatrical cut of his 80s classic

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.180
Improved by a director's cut ten years later and further refined by his final cut in 2007

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.040
We good to go Ridley? Sure you don't want to go mess with the ending again? Throw the voice over back in?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.700
[Clip: In history books he's the kind of cop who used to call black men n*****s]

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500
Ugh, probably not.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
Blade Runner

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.570
In 1982

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.359
Audiences knew Harrison Ford as the charming rogue Han Solo or the charming rogue, Indiana Jones

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.620
Now watch him ditch the whole charming act in the grumpiest Harrison Ford performance since any time he's forced to promote a movie

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.680
[Clip: "This one, 35 years after the original" "So what?" "Well I'm just wondering.." "'Got any problem with that? It's a living."]

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.180
Meet Deckard, private dick and public jerk with a serious drinking problem

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.900
[Clip: Wanna drink?]

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.100
[Clip: Wanna drink? I'll get you a drink.]

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.100
[Clip: Drink some for me, huh pal?]

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.200
He's a Blade Runner: part bounty hunter,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.400
part awkward psychiatrist,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.600
[Clip: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.300
Suddenly you realize there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.260
The entree consists of boiled dog.]

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.380
And as for why that's called a Blade Runner

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.840
Shut up. It sounds cool

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.580
He'll struggle with the morality of killing things that seem to be alive

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.990
But he won't struggle with the morality of porking them against their will

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.340
[Clip: "Say 'kiss me'"...  "Kiss me"]

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720
That's not how consent works

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.860
Thrill as Deckard hunts robots known as replicants, soldiers and sexbots built with false memories,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.460
[Clip: Those aren't your memories, they're somebody else's]

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.420
An upgrade as cruel and pointless as giving your fleshlight a family history.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.800
And witness the break-out performance of Rutger Hauer, a replicant who speaks in monologues the actor wrote himself

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.940
[Clip: All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain]

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.680
Literally the only time that's worked since Apocalypse Now

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.860
[Clip: You're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect the bill]

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.340
And savour a film that saves its biggest twist for last

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.880
Deckard might be a replicant too - or is he

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.340
Maybe? It's pretty subtle and depends on the cut.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.340
[Clip: You ever take that test yourself?]

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.720
Whatever, everyone acts like a sad robot anyway.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.460
Get ready to think, because this slow ass movie is gonna give you plenty of time for that.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.320
As you spend hours staring at old photographs,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.380
Staring at eyes,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.500
And staring at Deckard staring out the window of his car.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
*Yawns* What a masterpiece...

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.040
Experience a visual masterpiece that influenced countless animes,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.900
cyberpunk films, and all those times someone says enhance at a screen over and over again.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.700
[Clips: *"enhance" repeated by various characters from Blade Runner and other movies*]

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.220
Cuz this ain't your daddy's bright and shiny sci-fi

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.168
This one has rain and cigs and hookers and stuff and forget about plucky rebels fighting the evil empire

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.920
This one's about corporations making your life short and meaningless, and if that's too dark for you, at least the umbrella sticks light up

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.680
Oooh glowy

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.060
So enjoy this story that sees so clearly into the future

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:25.440
predicting our modern anxieties about genetic engineering, corporate ownership, and Ridley Scott's unicorn fetish

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.440
[Clip: Forgive me...]

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.580
That may not have done well at the box office, but broke the all-time record for the number of film geeks insisting it's genius.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.400
All right, come on guys. It looks amazing at all, but this is film noir with robots.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.240
If it was perfect, they wouldn't have recut it a hundred times.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.500
Starring:

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Definitely shoots first

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.430
Billy Idol

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.520
Finkle is Einhorn. Einhorn is finkle!

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.120
Littering

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.430
Coptain Adama

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.260
William ain't macy

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.940
four eyes...

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.800
Errr, no eyes

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.380
Sex machina

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.320
and Los Angeles two years from now huh kind of nailed that one

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.120
Robocop?

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:12.770
You know it's cool

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.419
Harrison's rebooting all his iconic roles

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.920
but there's not much left after Deckard. How long until we get Re- witness, Re-regarding Henry, Air force two?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.120
Actually, I'd totally watch that

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.040

Danger is my middle name. Actually, it's Phil.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.740
I'm voice guy. EPIC voice guy.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.180
Shut up, Wesley
