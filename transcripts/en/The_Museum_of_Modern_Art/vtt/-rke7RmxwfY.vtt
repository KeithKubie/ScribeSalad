00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:11.355
- In 1952 Matisse had taken a short trip

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.882
with one of his assistants
to a favorite pool

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:16.155
in the south of France to see divers

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.879
and it was so hot, and so sunny he said

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.699
"I'm gonna die of the heat, let's go home.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.586
"I'll make my own swimming pool myself."

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:28.358
He asked his assistant to
install a white paper frieze

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.848
at a height of about five and a half feet

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:35.119
and he cut blue painted paper into forms

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.822
of swimmers, divers, sea creatures

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:41.800
and the forms were
pinned by his assistants

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.567
on to the burlap wall one by one.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:48.134
The work stayed that way
until his death in 1954.

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:50.763
After his death the work was traced,

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:53.871
it was sent to Paris in
pieces, and glued onto

00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.309
new burlap despite the
known acidity of burlap

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.519
and its propensity to
change color over time.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:04.264
The white paper frieze was also new.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:06.565
- The Museum of Modern Art acquired

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.567
the "Swimming Pool" in 1975.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.245
It's arguably one of Matisse's

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:12.436
most important cut-outs and certainly

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:15.582
one of the most popular works
of art in our collection.

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:17.403
People loved looking at it because

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:19.353
it's so lively and animated and gave you

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:20.881
a real sense of the way in which

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.971
Matisse worked with cut paper.

00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.723
Unfortunately, by 1993
it had become discolored.

00:01:27.723 --> 00:01:30.354
The burlap background had
started to change color

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:32.517
and it had affected the paper itself

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:35.369
and so we decided it was no longer capable

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.244
of being displayed to the public.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.924
About five years ago we started an

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:41.809
intense research project to figure out how

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:44.216
to make it viewable
again, what we could do to

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:47.369
restore it, and conserve it,
and bring it back to life.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.134
This meant working with
conservation scientists,

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:52.079
with art historians, with conservators,

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.927
to try and figure out a way in which

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:55.843
to return it to display.

00:01:55.843 --> 00:01:57.662
In doing that, the cut-outs, which we

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:00.574
thought we understood, became alive again

00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:02.513
as we realized that he had worked

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:04.661
in a very different way
than we had thought.

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:10.320
- From the very beginning
I had three goals.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.520
The first was to return the
color balance to the work.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.812
That is tan burlap, white
paper and blue cut-outs.

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.269
The second goal was to install

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.379
the work at its proper height.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.707
Because of MoMA's ceiling heights

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.607
this had never been feasible.

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:28.688
Third goal was to mimic,
as best as possible,

00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:31.251
the architecture of the original room

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.045
to allow the viewer to
really feel surrounded

00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:36.969
by the cut-out and immersed
in the "Swimming Pool".

00:02:37.192 --> 00:02:38.766
A central part of the research was

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:41.100
to explore the way the cut-outs looked

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.242
when Matisse lived with
them in his studios.

00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:47.448
Claude Duthuit, the grandson of Matisse,

00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:51.330
gave me a piece of the original burlap

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.053
from Matisse's dining room so I was able

00:02:54.053 --> 00:02:57.315
to see the original color and the weave

00:02:57.315 --> 00:02:59.726
that would have been my goal.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.713
And I was very happy to find
in the conservation archive

00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:07.929
this small sample of
the fabric used in 1955.

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:11.948
Never seen the light of day,
not aged, not discolored.

00:03:11.948 --> 00:03:16.095
You can see that over
time this burlap changed

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.625
because of light exposure,
because of atmospheric pollution,

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:21.293
and that's why I was so concerned

00:03:21.293 --> 00:03:24.137
to replace this and get back to this.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.784
The most time consuming
part of the whole process

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:32.618
was the removal of the
burlap from the cut forms.

00:03:32.618 --> 00:03:37.095
I used a rotary tool,
and then took a scalpel

00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:39.381
and scraped off the remaining fibers.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.943
When I felt that this was
hurting the paper too much

00:03:42.943 --> 00:03:47.943
I just took a fiber and
i pulled it one by one

00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:51.781
which took approximately 2000 hours.

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:59.127
My research led me to replace
it with this new burlap

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:02.654
which the work will be mounted onto.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:05.874
- The nature of burlap
is that it's sort of an

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:08.428
imperfect industrial material, it's not

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:11.251
produced to be used on fine art.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.049
It has a lot of imperfections.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.801
There were a lot of clumps of dark fibers

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:18.232
and we found ourselves combing through

00:04:18.232 --> 00:04:20.360
and picking out impurities.

00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:24.966
- There was an idea, that
because the way paper

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.103
has discolored over time, perhaps it

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:29.043
would have been possible to replace the

00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:31.936
white paper with a new, whiter paper.

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:34.311
I made the decision not to do that

00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:36.524
because the white paper has aged

00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:38.561
the same amount of time as the blue

00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.004
and if a new white paper had been inserted

00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:42.901
it would have seemed jarringly white

00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:44.894
as compared to the blue.

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:47.914
- So surface cleaning was performed on the

00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:50.752
white paper using a vinyl eraser.

00:04:50.752 --> 00:04:54.129
That couldn't be done on
the painted blue pieces

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.672
due to the sensitivity of the gouache

00:04:56.672 --> 00:05:00.268
and that meant going in with
a very sharp colored pencil

00:05:00.637 --> 00:05:02.511
and just touching out those little

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:05.304
scratches and dings that
have happened over the years

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.239
so that the viewer only sees the

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:09.627
beauty of the blue cut paper.

00:05:11.412 --> 00:05:13.378
- One of the controversial aspects of this

00:05:13.378 --> 00:05:16.556
conservation process has been that instead

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:19.776
of mounting the white
frieze and blue forms

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:21.879
with a new adhesive, the forms will be

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.462
pinned to new burlap panels.

00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:26.457
This has never really been done before

00:05:26.457 --> 00:05:29.195
on a Matisse conservation project.

00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:31.734
This process has two goals.

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:34.594
One is to return to the work a little bit

00:05:34.594 --> 00:05:36.471
of the three-dimensional liveliness

00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:37.553
that the works would have had

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:39.950
in the studio when he lived with them.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.042
And secondly, the white and blue will be

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:44.683
against the burlap only for the months

00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:45.794
that they are on view.

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:49.438
Once the exhibition is
over the works are unpinned

00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:52.896
and they will no longer be
in contact with the burlap,

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:55.761
which even though it is
new, is still acidic.

00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:58.831
- This is really important
for future display

00:05:58.831 --> 00:06:01.768
and for the future
stability of this piece.

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:05.537
- The research that we
did on the "Swimming Pool"

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:08.144
informed how we thought about
all of Matisse's cut-outs,

00:06:08.144 --> 00:06:10.180
and that's what makes
this exhibition different

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.386
than any other exhibition
about Matisse's work before

00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:16.049
because this exhibition looks
at the way in which Matisse

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:19.313
lived with these works of
art, how he animated his life

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:22.005
by manipulating the paper
forms that he cut out,

00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:24.691
how he understood these works as organic

00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:26.607
and I think that really comes through

00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:29.211
in the way in which we've
created displays here

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.822
that allow people to
get a sense of what it

00:06:31.822 --> 00:06:34.230
must have been like for
Matisse to be surrounded

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.359
by this world he created for himself.

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:39.309
- This will offer both to the public

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.605
and to the conservation field
an incredibly important way

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.709
of thinking about how the
cut-out should be seen

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:47.047
and also how they should be conserved.
