- What's up, I'm Ryan Beck
and I'm at Clusterfest

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.003 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and I'm gonna do
everything in my power

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.838 line:0%
to get Stephan Jenkins
from Third Eye Blind

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:07.007
to sing to my dog.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:08.942 align:start size:84% position:16%
(laughing)
Look, I'm doing it.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.110
- This is his hair.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.111
Ryan.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.346
- Yeah?

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.281
- We got a boom,
it's out of frame.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.115
- Yeah.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.016
- We got a puppy.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.150
Let's make some basic cable.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.352
- It'll be on the internet.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.087
I'm Ryan Beck, I'm
here at Clusterfest

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.355 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
with one of my all time
favorite musicians,

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.856 line:0%
Stephan Jenkins of
Third Eye Blind.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.125 line:0%
- Is that true?
- It's true, man.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.426 line:0%
It's the first CD I ever bought.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.195
- Really? You didn't
say that before we met.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.996
- Well I didn't wanna tell
you because I felt like it--

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.332
- It's important
not to talk it out.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.300 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah.
- Well anyway, this is Bruce.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.602 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Bruce, she's a sweet girl.
- She is.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.036
- And she is a rescue dog.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.371 align:start size:97% position:3%
- She is a Rocket Dog
rescue, and when I got her,

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.207
she had mange, she had worms.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.308
She had an ear infection.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.043
She was malnutritioned.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.545
She was just beat to shit.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.048
Well, 'cause I wanted a
boy, but girls are better

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.516 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause when you
stroke their belly,

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.352 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's not all that
annoying dick in the way.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.653
- That's true.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.621
My dog's a girl, and
she's also a rescue,

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.958
and, uh, I think I have
a picture here, some,

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.560
oh yeah, here we go.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Oh wow.
- This enormous--

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:02.795
- That's a big picture.
- This is it right here.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.030
My dog.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.130
- Lily's so cute,
she looks fake.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.566
- She's home alone right now,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.035 align:start position:0%
and all she has is my girlfriend
and my girlfriend's parents

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.736
and her sister and
some dog walkers

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.305 align:start size:84% position:16%
and some other family
friends with her.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.573 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It's like abuse.
- I know.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.574
And so, I know she's
really missing me,

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:16.743
and probably feels really alone.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.211
- She doesn't give a damn.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.912
- No, man, come on.
- She's your dog.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.547 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't have any
musical talent.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:22.748
I can't play any instruments,

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.683
and people generally
just don't respect me.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.920 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, uh, I wrote this
song from the perspective

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.522 align:start size:75% position:25%
of my dog--
- Lily's Ballad.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:33.860
- Yeah, it's her song that
she feels when she's alone.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.062 line:91%
And you want me to sing it?
-I would love for you to sing i.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.030 line:85%
Thing is, I'm like high on anti.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.599 line:85%
Because I think I got bronchiti.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.835 line:85%
Are you on, I'm allergic to amo.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.171 line:85%
I don't really know what amoxic.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.105 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's the pink one.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.841 line:0%
So, I think it goes like this.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:12.925
- That's it?

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.093
Is there one more page?

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.462
- That's it.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I want to have something
that rhymes with, like,

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.200
you know, "Come on, let's play."

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:22.868
♪ Your name is Bruce 

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start size:97% position:3%
♪ It doesn't matter if you're
straight or you're gay ♪

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.607 size:88% position:44%
♪ Ta da 

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.210
- "Ta da."
(laughing)

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
That was incredible.
- That's a really great song.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.946 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.215
- You can play it
later if you want.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.616
- I've got it, it's
all locked in here.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.884
Is your dog a rescue?

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.019
- My dog is a rescue.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.119
- That's great.

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.188 align:start size:81% position:19%
Here's the thing.
- Yeah?

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.122
- We both have these, like,

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:47.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
like, lovely,
happy, healthy dogs

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.227
and they're both rescues.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:53.799
It's really great and easy
and karmically lovely to

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:54.867
get a rescue dog.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.835
There will be shit
all over your kitchen

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:58.704 align:start size:94% position:6%
for longer than you
think that you can stand,

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.240
but you'd be amazed at
what you can put up with

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.308
when you cuddle with them.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.342
- That's the journey.

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:04.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
Shit in your kitchen.
- Yeah.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.345
- Folks, I'm Ryan Beck.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.313
That's Stephan Jenkins.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.215 align:start size:84% position:16%
We sang the song,
thanks for watching.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:12.418
(upbeat music)
