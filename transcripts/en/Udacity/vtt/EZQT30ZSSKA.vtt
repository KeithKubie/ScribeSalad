00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem we're told that to an observer down here Andy,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who is standing 2 m away but who is 1 m above the ground,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
will look just as tall as this church 90 m away.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The trick to solving this problem is to realize that in order for the building and Andy

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to look the same height from the observer's perspective down here,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we have to be able to connect a line that goes from the top of the building

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
through Andy's head and finally ends at the observer's eyes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When we draw these lines corresponding to the height of the building

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the height of Andy, we get these nice similar triangles.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, we don't know anything about the angles of these triangles,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
except for the fact that these are right angles, but we don't need to.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Remember that with similar triangles we have this nice property

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that the ratio of any two corresponding sides of the smaller triangle

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the larger triangle have to be equal.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This means that the ratio of 1 m to 2 m

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
has to be exactly the same as the ration of the height of the church

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to the distance the church is away from the viewpoint of the observer.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We can express this relationship using this equation here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That 1/2 is exactly equal to the height of the building,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which I've labeled here with a question mark, over 90 m.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Using this equation to solve for the height of the building,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I find that the building is 45 m off the ground. Great job.
