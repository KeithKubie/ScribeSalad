00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.371
Good morning, I hope your
having an amazing day.

00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:03.400
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Sri Lanka.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.000
We are going to a,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.030
Vedda tribe village,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.910
and the Vedda are an indigenous group,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.380
from native to Sri Lanka.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.610
We are gonna go to the village,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.840
we're gonna learn about the culture,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.470
we are gonna experience the culture,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.700
they have arranged to cook local,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.790
this is as native as local Sri Lankan food

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.600
as possible from the land.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.280
So it's gonna be a journey,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.670
it's gonna be a learning opportunity,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.240
it's gonna be extremely special,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm gonna share the culture, the food,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.310
the entire experience
with you, in this video.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.227
(upbeat ska music)

00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:47.262
(car engine roars)

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:50.179
(upbeat ska music)

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.440
18 bends down the side of the mountain,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.630
but it's so lush, it's so tropical.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.912
It's an amazing road.

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:11.157
(door slides)

00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:13.657
Okay, we made it.

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.530
Good morning Ruzaina.
- Good morning.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.120
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.823
- Awesome, what is the name of the,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.410
are we in, we're in a small town,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.243
close to a small town, right?

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:25.769
- Yeah, this is called Sor-a-bur-a Wewa

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.281
(upbeat drum music)

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:28.601
(distant chatter)

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.768
(footsteps crunching)

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:33.790
- [Ruzaina] Whoa.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.750
- Just like a five minute
walk to get to the lake,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.683
to get to the boat.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:39.503
And then we're gonna take
a boat ride from here,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.430
to get closer to the village,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.760
before we need to take another walk,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.130
to get to the actual village.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.000
Beautiful to be here early in the morning,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.310
it's still so quiet, so peaceful,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.199
not much people, not many people at all.

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:54.040
(talks in foreign language)

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.873
(water trickling)

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.640
Paddle boats are the best
because it's so peaceful,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.473
it's so quiet, you just see
the ripples of the glassy lake.

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.374
(gentle water trickles)

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:14.483
(lively drum music)

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.380
We are just pulling up to
the other side of the lake,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.510
and just the view, it's so
peaceful, it's so quiet.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.070
I love how the trees just
come out of the water.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.870
The grass it's so jungly, it's so lush.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.460
Whoa, there's a tree going up there,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.410
but yeah what a spectacular ride,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.410
we made it to the other side,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.331
we're gonna then hike into the village.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:47.414
(background chatter)

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.700
The greenery, the lushness, the wetness,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.093
it's just spectacular,
and it's actually like,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.010
it's not so remote,
there's still took tooks,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.990
there's still motorbikes,
there are small villages,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.740
and homes every now and then.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.680
But it's so peaceful it's so serene.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.150
you see the birds, I just
saw a flying peacock!

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.710
I don't think I've ever seen a
flying peacock, wild peacock.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.280
It started raining.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.368
Okay maybe we're just gonna
take cover quickly, right here.

00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:22.010
(foreign language)

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.203
Hello, hello, oh some tea.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.696
I think you do want one.

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:29.879
(background chatter in foreign language)

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.379
(water pours)

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.920
It's always perfect
when it starts raining,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.310
and the nearest covering is
a tea house, a tea stall.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.320
So we're gonna use this opportunity,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.780
to have a quick cup of tea

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.754
- [Ruzaina] What do you call it?

00:03:50.754 --> 00:03:54.161
(foreign language)

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:57.305
- Huh (chuckles) hmm.

00:03:57.305 --> 00:03:59.994
- Ah, the kin, the jaggery,

00:03:59.994 --> 00:04:01.620
- Yeah it's so special.
- or the tea?

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.760
- Both.
- [Mark] Both.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.960
So you just drink a cup of tea
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.120
- and then you sip on the
tea and then you alternate,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.070
with the, okay I gotta try
that, just take a little nibble.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.890
Oh yeah that's sweet but you taste like

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.761
the grainy, like molasses-y.

00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:20.178
(child speaking in foreign language)

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.219
What is your name?

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.780
(speaks foreign language)

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.903
- Can you see yourself?

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.409
- [Ruzaina] He's so fascinated with it.

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.540
- (laughs) Who is that, who's that?

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.420
(speaks foreign language) buh-bye.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.593
Okay just a very quick rain,
we're back on the road.

00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:43.680
And feeling great,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.410
That tea was some...
- [Ruzaina] Refreshing.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.870
- Yeah, very refreshing,
even though it was hot,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.703
and yeah that cools you.

00:04:50.703 --> 00:04:53.703
(upbeat drum music)

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.651
(footsteps crunch)

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.651
(upbeat drum music)

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:05.940
(speaks foreign language)

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.740
- Hello, thank you, (foreign
language) nice to meet you.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:13.360
(foreign language)

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.193
- Hello.

00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:18.910
(chuckles)

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.553
- This is amazing, wow!

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.930
And I'm just drenched in sweat,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.190
the humidity has really come
out, cool, thank you Ruzaina.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.890
He is one of the oldest
members from the tribe,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.940
and then some of his
children and some of his,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.220
the people in the village have started,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.440
growing crops in this
area, have started to more,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.950
build schools, there's
doctors, there's small clinics.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.010
Ah, but the older generation
is still living traditionally.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.000
Lots of hunting and
gathering for sustenance.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.200
Yeah this is a learning
experience, a cultural experience,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.450
we've had a warm welcome.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.993
Hello, hello.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.840
Stepping into the family hut now,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.560
all made from mud, and then
there's, yeah there's wood.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.970
Inside the back is the kitchen
hut, where they are cooking.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.140
She has the fire going,
she's cooking uh, something.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.420
But then you can see the whole rack,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.960
where they dry wood, where they dry meat.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.360
They eat a lot of game meat,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.580
that's the method of preserving the food.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.996
Lets go take a look at what's in the pot.

00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:31.546
(bubbling)

00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:35.046
- [Woman] And they're covered with leaves.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.793
(foreign language)

00:06:39.793 --> 00:06:42.290
- [Ruzaina] Okay it's corned
rice, I've never had it before.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.513
- That's awesome.
- Yeah (laughs)

00:06:44.513 --> 00:06:46.210
(speaks foreign language)

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.590
- She's boiling some
corn, there's some corn,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.410
and beans and looks like coconut,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.453
and then there's like a vegetable stew.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.233
Yeah looks very all natural,
all fresh, looks beautiful.

00:07:01.117 --> 00:07:04.450
(in a foreign language)

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:11.855
(man sings in foreign language)

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.935
- Calm the babies, when they're crying.

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:39.768
- So he was like showing us.
- [Mark] Ah,

00:07:39.768 --> 00:07:41.000
so it's like a song for,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.264
- Babies.
- Ah okay,

00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:45.360
so uncle was just showing
us, it's like a traditional,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.660
baby calming song, so he was using the ax,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.790
just to rock the baby, like
almost like a chant of a song.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.950
And now stepping outside,
they've got some game meat,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.970
that there also gonna cook.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.006
So they're getting ready to chop it up.

00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:00.920
(village hustle and bustle)

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.753
It is diff...

00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:07.943
(speaks foreign language)

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.640
It's deer meat, which they
caught earlier in the morning,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.710
and then it's already sectioned out,

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.320
because they share it with the community.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.153
Oh deer fat.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.880
(speak foreign language)

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.360
- By the way Ruzaina
is also making a video,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.530
so go check out her video, she's gonna be,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.300
covering the food but
then also taking it back,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.911
to her kitchen to cook, because
she makes recipe videos.

00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:35.530
(foreign language)

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.033
Oh that's like a ... whoa.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.267
(foreign language)

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:44.184
(upbeat ska music)

00:08:51.408 --> 00:08:52.250
(laughs)

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.083
- [ Woman] The head is the target,

00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:54.248
the head is the target of the...

00:08:54.248 --> 00:08:56.070
(upbeat ska music)

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.083
- [Mark] Wow, that aim.

00:08:58.083 --> 00:08:58.993
- [Man] Okay, okay.

00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:03.200
(upbeat ska music)

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.024
- Looks like it could backfire
so easily though because

00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:09.766
(laughs) oh so you've kind
of got to shoot it sideways.

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.683
(upbeat ska music)

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:19.947
- Ah okay, you gotta hold it like this,

00:09:19.947 --> 00:09:21.760
and I'm sure you have to
sort of shoot it to the side,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.730
otherwise it will hit the
wood, bounce back at your face.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.412
I won't, oh I can see okay.

00:09:27.412 --> 00:09:29.450
(laughter)

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.970
Yes I did hit the, okay
wait one more time,

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.973
okay angle it, here we go.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.540
Okay (laughs) that went like 10 feet.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.443
That's pretty cool.

00:09:43.443 --> 00:09:46.063
Okay we better go see what's
gonna happen with that deer.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.740
In the kitchen she's making some roti,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.750
which is made from a millet flour,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.830
and she mixed in water
and I think that's it.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.160
The oils of the banana
leaf keep it hydrated,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.220
keep it moist so that it doesn't stick,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.743
um that's just like looks
solid and thick and hearty.

00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:14.972
(background chatter in foreign language)

00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:20.860
And right in the kitchen also is the,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.710
the beetle nut refilling
stations, that's a little.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:26.210
They have the beetle nut,
they have the leaves,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.230
they also put lime, I'm gonna
try just the beetle nut,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.490
he's shaving one for me with
the leaf, but not the lime,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.599
'cause the lime can really
like burn your gums.

00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.250
(speaks foreign language)

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.800
(leaf crunches)

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.633
Ball it up.

00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:46.232
- [Ruzaina] Thank you
(laughs) this is awesome.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.530
- I like the taste
though, it's like chalky,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.150
or better yet it's like woody,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.870
it really makes your mouth
water, but then at the same time,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.920
your mouth is like dry at the same time.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.610
That doesn't really make
sense but it's true.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.420
How's the, how's the
beetle chewing Ruzaina?

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.676
- Oh, I'm feeling the same thing.

00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:04.509
(laughs)

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:06.773
I don't know what's happening
to my mouth right now.

00:11:06.773 --> 00:11:07.606
(laughs)

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:08.973
- So she's gonna make the fresh meat,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.100
chopping up some garlic,
some onions are going in,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.817
there's gonna be some spices,
oh the curry leaves, nice.

00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:18.242
(pan sizzling)

00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:21.159
(foreign language)

00:11:23.504 --> 00:11:26.004
(pan sizzles)

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.330
First she dried up some spices,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.610
with the curry leaves, it's so fragranted,

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.910
this entire hut is just
filled with delicious aromas.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.980
But then in the deer meat
she added more spices,

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.980
she added sea salt flakes,
she added turmeric, chili,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.170
she added pepper, she added curry powder,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.290
mixed that around and
then poured that into

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.940
the oil curry paste, already
smells unbelievably delicious.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.773
That's gonna be great.

00:11:58.773 --> 00:11:59.800
And then lots of spices,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.578
for the gaminess of that meat as well.

00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:04.828
(sizzling)

00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:09.617
(background chatter in foreign language)

00:12:09.617 --> 00:12:11.890
- [Ruzaina] Bye bye, bye bye.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.723
- Here and he's gonna show us,

00:12:12.723 --> 00:12:14.790
how to dig out one of the yams,

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.705
which is also traditional
food that they eat.

00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:20.705
(upbeat drum music)

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.320
I think it's a pretty
big size, that's big.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.783
And I think they're gonna
boil that to eat as well.

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:33.102
(calming drum music)

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.500
I just wanna ask uncle a couple questions,

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.010
maybe about the tribe,

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.778
about how long his family has been here.

00:12:40.778 --> 00:12:44.803
But we're gonna need like
three sets of translation.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.620
Vedda that's all like indigenous,

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.310
Sri Lankan groups right?
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.250
- But then they have specific tribes.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.083
- [Ruzaina] Yeah they
have specific tribes...

00:13:00.186 --> 00:13:03.936
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.750
What he's saying is that,
like in other countries,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.340
they don't have like a lot
of sections for their tribe,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.000
so they're coming from one
type of, one bloodline sort of,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.300
so then it's called Uru
Warnge, so it's from the pig,

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.984
like Ura is pig, so it's from a pig tribe.

00:13:21.984 --> 00:13:25.018
- [Mark] Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:28.240
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.150
So traditionally the
tribe would be a hunter,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.160
gatherer society, fish,
hunt, gather seasonal crops,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.160
and produce, use the
lush land of Sri Lanka,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.080
and live off the land.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.400
And so like the skills that
they have, they're expertise,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.430
and their skill at living off the land,

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.070
it's a beautiful thing.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.970
But it is not an easy, it's a tough life,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.000
and so lots of the younger generation,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.990
has started growing crops,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.530
have started, more going to school

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.943
to become educated to get better jobs.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.840
But it's still important to
remember, important to reflect,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.670
important to acknowledge, to
appreciate the elder generation

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.340
and it's such, this is
so incredibly special,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.880
it's such an honor, this is a
privilege just to be sitting,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.100
next to uncle, this is
a moment I will cherish,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.670
and never forget, thank you.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.409
How would you say thank
you in their language.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:31.659
(man shouting in foreign language)

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.369
- I cannot, I cannot
catch that, I'm sorry.

00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:39.640
(speaks in foreign language)

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.869
- Okay, that's how you say thank you,

00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:45.452
(repeats foreign language)

00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:51.624
Thank you for having
us (foreign language).

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.940
The same millet dry, millet flour,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.700
but mixing it more into like a porridge,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.783
like a paste, over the fire.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.910
The cooking method, the
preparation, and the starch,

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.660
it looks so similar to some things,

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.520
that I've eaten in
Ethiopia or across Africa,

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.365
like such a a similar,
so many similarities.

00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:18.900
(in foreign language)

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.800
Right out of the fire, she's
molding them into balls,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.017
that's like so burning hot.

00:15:23.017 --> 00:15:25.184
(in foreign language)

00:15:25.184 --> 00:15:28.101
(upbeat ska music)

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.350
Still kind of drizzling but not too hard,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.760
so we're gonna try to eat outside,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.340
they've set all the food out
on mats and banana leaves.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.840
The dishes are, some of them are simple,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.480
but it smells so good, so natural.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.570
The whole grains, the corn, the coconut,

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.154
the deer curry is in the center.

00:15:59.154 --> 00:16:00.420
(in foreign language)

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.253
- [Ruzaina] What you do is you just,

00:16:01.253 --> 00:16:02.280
- [Mark] Take the whole thing?
- [Ruzaina] Yeah take,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.651
the whole thing and then
you dowse it with the gravy.

00:16:04.651 --> 00:16:06.390
- [Mark] Ah, okay.
- [Ruzaina] So.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.347
- [Mark] He dished to one of these guys.

00:16:08.347 --> 00:16:10.633
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.
- [Mark] Maybe I'll...

00:16:10.633 --> 00:16:11.553
- [Ruzaina] And this is...

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:12.386
- [Mark] Sambol.

00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:13.250
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.
- [Mark] That looks great.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.290
- [Ruzaina] The authentic one.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.371
- And that's just pure chilies with,

00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:16.204
there's nothing else.
- just pure chilies,

00:16:16.204 --> 00:16:17.037
- Okay,
- pure chilies,

00:16:17.037 --> 00:16:17.950
and salt, yeah.
- maybe salt in there, okay.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.759
- [Mark] It's like dough almost feeling,

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:23.760
I can squeeze in, I'm
just gonna try that first,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.055
just the bean soup.

00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:27.989
(upbeat ska music)

00:16:27.989 --> 00:16:30.989
- Mm, mm!
(laughter)

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.398
- Oh it's amazing.
- Mm hmm!

00:16:35.398 --> 00:16:40.398
- Mm, yes (laughs) it's so good.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.450
- Yeah.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.933
- Like the, the grainy
doughiness of the starch,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.010
but then that like gravy with
the beans, it's delicious!

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.501
And for this one I'll try the
deer, a chunk of the deer.

00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:58.239
(upbeat ska music)

00:16:58.239 --> 00:16:59.146
Oh wow!

00:16:59.146 --> 00:17:00.005
(laughs)

00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:00.970
This deer is amazing,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.400
it's not like the most tender
meat you'll have but like,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.420
it's so flavorful, and
like it's not that tough.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.276
- [Ruzaina] it's not tough.
- Its really good.

00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:10.020
Not too tough.
- [Ruzaina] Okay wow.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.610
- So flavorful though, she
added in so much dry spice,

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.500
in there like not necessarily
too like chili spice,

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.720
but like it's like thick with dry spice.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.290
How do you get the sambol just, it's okay?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.139
- Yeah just stick that.
- Okay.

00:17:21.139 --> 00:17:23.533
I'm gonna get some of the
sambol, this is just pure,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.500
pure green chilies into
my bowl, the next bite,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.620
and then gonna go, I'm just
gonna mix everything now,

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.893
with the green chilies, with
the deer, with the beans.

00:17:38.618 --> 00:17:41.527
Mm mm hmm, sambol is awesome.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.050
Yeah you can taste the
vibrancy of the green chilies.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.170
And then this is the roti made with the,

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.690
millet flour as well.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:50.890
We'll just scoop it up with this.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.775
- [Ruzaina] Gather the deer and the...

00:17:52.775 --> 00:17:54.297
- [Mark] Mix it up with the deer,

00:17:54.297 --> 00:17:56.009
- [Ruzaina] And the sambol.
- [Mark] with the sambol,

00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:57.573
with the everything.

00:17:57.573 --> 00:18:01.253
(upbeat ska music)

00:18:01.253 --> 00:18:02.086
- It's good.

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:05.203
- It's so good.

00:18:05.203 --> 00:18:09.398
It's the same grain, but
completely different texture.

00:18:09.398 --> 00:18:11.470
Thank you and there's beans
in here though too right?

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:12.870
- Yeah, beans and coconut.
- beans, corn,

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.843
coconut.
- Yeah.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:16.630
Some more?
- Thank you.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.463
Just reach in it's okay?

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.257
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Okay, Thank you.

00:18:19.257 --> 00:18:21.550
And that's the yam that they just plucked,

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.892
out of the ground like 30 minutes ago.

00:18:23.892 --> 00:18:25.564
(upbeat ska music)

00:18:25.564 --> 00:18:26.875
(in foreign language)

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.270
- [Ruzaina] Ah, the chili
is riding behind you.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.260
- [Mark] Oh nice!

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.343
oh yeah, sure sure sure.
- grab one and run (laughs)

00:18:32.343 --> 00:18:35.303
give you the herbal drink yesterday,

00:18:35.303 --> 00:18:38.010
and then he'll be happy
tonight, even I'm gonna have it.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.140
- Awesome, it's like starchy,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.390
starchy from the corn,
starchy from the beans,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.543
but then refreshing and
crisp from the coconut.

00:18:49.475 --> 00:18:51.130
(in a foreign language)

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.043
This is the yam,

00:18:54.611 --> 00:18:55.560
oh wow!

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.470
- [Ruzaina] Good?
- it's like a totally,

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.256
different texture, almost like creamy.

00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:02.200
And not like really starchy tasting,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.650
kind of like lighter tasting.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.220
Like it's not overly spiced it's not,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.830
but the sambol is wonderful,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.740
and they just showed us that the,

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.610
the chilies come from
this plant right here, oh!

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.323
A little more chili up in there too.

00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:23.190
Whoa, the freshness of that,

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.540
it's almost like green bean tasting,

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.610
until the spice hit's you.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.301
Now everything is just kind
of mixed with the sambol,

00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:30.240
with the beans and rice and the,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.471
oh no the millet and the corn.

00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:36.380
(upbeat ska music)

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.152
Mm that deer curry is amazing.

00:19:39.152 --> 00:19:42.069
(upbeat ska music)

00:19:47.966 --> 00:19:49.549
Wow, I'm loving it.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.963
The love in the food, the
naturalness, the grains.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.155
Mm would you like chili.

00:19:58.155 --> 00:19:58.988
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:19:58.988 --> 00:20:00.717
- One of the reasons Ruzaina is so cool

00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:01.550
(laughs)

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.620
she's down to, down to pop chilies.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.248
- Oh yeah!
- Down to pop chilies.

00:20:05.248 --> 00:20:06.191
- Cheers.

00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:09.108
(upbeat ska music)

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.230
They're so fragrant though

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.670
- Yeah it's really really fragrant,

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.573
but I'm waiting for the
kick, how come that is hard.

00:20:14.573 --> 00:20:15.997
- The sambol is spicier
than the chilies, right?

00:20:15.997 --> 00:20:19.710
- Maybe they chose the really
hot ones before, and now

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.243
these are really young.
- Yeah.

00:20:21.243 --> 00:20:23.070
- That one is a little
bit spicy, but like,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.140
it's more fragrant, it's more like,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.106
like almost citrusy, sour.

00:20:27.106 --> 00:20:27.939
- Yeah.

00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:28.772
- Mama,
(laughter)

00:20:28.772 --> 00:20:30.430
Ma-gah ketchup, (speaks
in foreign language).

00:20:34.844 --> 00:20:37.944
(in foreign language)

00:20:37.944 --> 00:20:41.990
- We just asked uncle, how
old he is, 73 years old!

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.190
I thought that he was like 50,

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.743
look how young his features are.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.700
Living off the land, yeah.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.780
It was an honor to be in his presence,

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.570
to share a meal with him,

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.580
even though we don't
speak the same language,

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.320
even though we,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.270
I'm sure like our entire thought process,

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.810
and world view is totally like opposite,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.180
but just being able to share a presence,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.070
to hang out with him, to sit next to him.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.783
He is an amazing, amazing man.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.126
Thank you.

00:21:16.126 --> 00:21:18.261
- [Woman] And have a
little chili on it, better.

00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:21.178
(upbeat ska music)

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.350
- Whoa, now that hot!

00:21:26.548 --> 00:21:28.390
Mm, I have so many
childhood memories of this.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.200
This is one of my favorite snacks.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.073
With that sambol it's starchy,
it's smokey, it's roasted.

00:21:38.258 --> 00:21:39.115
That's really good.

00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:41.870
(upbeat ska music)

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.650
The simple miss of the food,

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.410
but everything prepared by
hand, prepared with love,

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.653
grown with their hands, and then prepared.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.350
The respect for the land and
for Sri Lanka that they have,

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.685
and this is, it's awesome, it's awesome.

00:21:57.685 --> 00:22:00.102
(bird sings)

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.340
- Yes, we've all just finished lunch,

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.300
we are gonna line up for a quick photo,

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.300
outside of their home
and I'll say thank you,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.300
to the entire family, to
auntie who cooked, to uncle.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.527
An amazing cook, thank you so much.

00:22:16.527 --> 00:22:17.731
(upbeat ska music)

00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:22.720
This has been a, an incredible,
memorable experience.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.797
So I want to say thank you,

00:22:23.797 --> 00:22:27.356
to auntie for cooking, and everybody.

00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:29.523
(applaud)

00:22:30.504 --> 00:22:33.625
(in foreign language)

00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:34.874
(upbeat ska music)

00:22:34.874 --> 00:22:38.041
(in foreign language)

00:22:43.297 --> 00:22:45.320
(laughter)

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.100
- Thank you, (foreign language)

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.148
- [Woman] Bye!
(in foreign language)

00:22:49.148 --> 00:22:51.108
(laughter)
- [Mark] Thank you!

00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:54.025
(upbeat ska music)

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.050
It's hard to even process
the entire experience,

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.030
and then to put it in words,
but all I can say is that,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.670
that was incredibly special.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.240
It was a privilege to have
an opportunity to meet,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.620
to learn from the wisdom,
from the lifestyle,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.960
from the generosity of the Vedda tribe,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.120
and the people that we met,
they were so welcoming,

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.170
they had never really done
anything like this before,

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.330
and they showed hospitality.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.850
What always touches my heart
in situations like that is,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.070
even when you cannot communicate verbally,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.170
you can still communicate
with your actions,

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.170
with your feeling, with the
general like feel of everything.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.620
And so if you can just hang out,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.080
if you can just genuinely
appreciate the food,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.400
if you can smile, if you can
make gestures of positivity,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.730
that's what really comes
through and that's what,

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.640
those are the memories
that last, those are the,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.840
the people are just amazing.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.220
And that's one of those situations,

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.450
the food I loved the food, I
loved how it was home cooked,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.390
I loved how everybody shared,

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.930
has graciously shared that meal with us.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:15.260
But it was the people, the
community, the sharing,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.990
that's what really stood out.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.880
And so I wanna say a huge thank you,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.930
to the entire village for hosting us,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.120
and especially a massive
thank you for Ruzaina,

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.960
she organized everything,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.980

she has such a passion,

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.260
and a love for people,
for Sri Lanka, for food.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.650

big thank you to you,
