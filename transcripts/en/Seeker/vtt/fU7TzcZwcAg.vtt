00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.109
Electronics work by shuffling electrons through
circuits and logic gates to perform calculations,

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.540
but in doing so they have to overcome resistance,
which wastes energy and generates heat.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.400
So instead of forcing electrons to push each
other along, what if

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.440
we just made them do the wave?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.179
Electrons have a negative charge; it’s a
fundamental part of what they are.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.789
They also have a property called spin, and
this spin can be oriented either up or down.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.640
If the spins of the outermost electrons in
an atom are aligned the same direction,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.340
they’ll generate a magnetic field, 
making the atom a tiny magnet.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.800
If all the atoms in a material have their
magnetic fields aligned the same way,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.900
the material will act as a magnet.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.000
(I could make the Insane Clown Posse joke, but I won’t. I'm not going to do it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.900
It’s 2018 and we’re officially laying
the magnets joke to rest.)

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.940
Anyway, it’s possible to reverse the direction
of the magnetic field of an atom in a material

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.180
by applying energy.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.760
When that happens, the strength of the magnetic
field in that area drops a bit;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.240
it's effectively the same as a partial reversal
of all the tiny magnets in that group.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.199
This partial reversal spreads, like a crowd
doing the wave at a stadium, passing the energy

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.360
that dampened the magnetic field along.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.340
This wave of energy can also be thought of
as a particle, called a magnon.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.650
Just like electrons in a circuit, a magnon
can be used to carry information, with some

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.910
advantages over moving electrons, like using
less energy and generating less heat

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.240
(which is good, because sometimes I worry about what
my laptop is doing to me

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.000
when it’s atop my lap.)

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.860
But while the silicon circuits that conduct
electrons are relatively easy to make,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.460
the magnets that transport magnons are not.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.390
One reason we’re still using electronics
instead of magnonics is because the media

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.050
that carry magnons well are notoriously hard
to make and harder to combine with other materials.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.210
Currently most magnonic researchers use a
material called yttrium iron garnet -- or

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.380
YIG -- to carry the waves.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.190
A film of high quality YIG has to be grown
on a matching lattice structure like gadolinium

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.950
gallium garnet. Hard to say, harder to combine
with other substrates, like silicon.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.260
So researchers started exploring elsewhere,
and came across a material first made in 1991.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.040
This material, called vanadium tetracyanoethylene,
was the first carbon based magnet that was

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.860
stable at room temperature.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.330
Well so long as it wasn’t exposed to oxygen,
in which case it can burst into flame.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.250
But aside from the surprise fire, it’s great
for studying magnonics, keeping the magnons

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.780
just as stable as YIG while they persisted
for record-breaking times.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.480
If researchers can make a practical material
for magnons to travel through, then the next

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.480
step is making digital logic gates like the
transistors in a chip.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.400
Fortunately researchers don’t have to figure
out entirely new transistors that can respond

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400
to magnons.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.340
It’s possible to convert a magnon into an
electrical signal thanks to something called

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.569
the inverse spin Hall effect, and then it’s
just a matter of sending electrons through

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.680
the transistor like we’ve always done.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.130
This means researchers could combine magnonics
and electronics, bringing them one step closer

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.019
to smaller, faster, more efficient computers.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.470
For now though researchers are exploring other
materials that might work even better than

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.370
vanadium tetracyanoethylene.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.370
Hopefully they find one that doesn’t catch
fire when you crack a window.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.599

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.340
using photons in computers instead of electrons
could make light-speed computing possible.
