Hi. I'm Steve Huffman. Eight years ago I started reddit.com, and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.890
more recently I started hipmunk.com as the lead engineer. When I

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.020
started these websites, I basically knew nothing. So everything I learned,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.890
I learned through trial and error, and I had many lessons learned

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.690
the hard way. This course is basically going to be me teaching

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.240
you those lessons. So we'll take it from the top, we'll

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
start with internet and browsers, and how they fit together. We'll

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.350
talk about form validation, databases, APIs,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.690
integrate with other websites, and we'll

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.530
even touch on some scaling issues.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.030
Throughout this course, we're going to be building

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.750
a blog together, and by the end of the course, this blog'll be

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.710
fully functional, online for anybody to

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.290
use, with user account registration and the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.180
whole deal. So, I'm really excited to get started, and let's jump right in.
