00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.490
The last set of issues has to do with domain standards.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.470
One area of ongoing concern is the component,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.920
in the component marketplaces, the role of domain standards where there's

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.170
a tension between proprietary solutions and open standards.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.900
Dominant vendors try to lock in customers with proprietary technology, while

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.030
the competition promotes the use of standards to encourage customer migration.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.830
In the longterm the community benefits from standard solutions.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.050
However, such standards take a long time for approval and penetration.
