00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.080
How would you rather go extinct? Starvation,
spears or syphilis? The Rapa Nui had all three!

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.400
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today. It’s
been long thought that the original people

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.410
of Easter Island killed themselves off through
war. But new information is suggesting otherwise.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.840
Easter Island, the 64 square mile remote Chilean
territory that lies over 2,300 miles off the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.720
South American coast, is known to most of
us as that island with the giant heads. Called

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.629
moai, these statues of human figures with
oversize heads were made by the Rapa Nui,

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.499
the island’s native Polynesian inhabitants
at some point between the 10th and 16th centuries.

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.539
But not long after erecting the impressive
statues, the Rapa Nui disappeared, and for

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.929
years archaeologists have suspects they were
killed by an environmental catastrophe they

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.480
brought upon themselves.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.409
The commonly held theory is that humans, somewhat
miraculously, reached the small island more

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.929
than a millennium ago and quickly colonized
it. But, with these new residents also came

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.909
rats, which they either brought as a food
source or as stowaways. In any case these

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.710
rats thrived on the isolated volcanic island,
finding an ample food supply in the lush palm

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.140
trees, and with no risk of starvation, the
population quickly swelled to a few million.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.030
The rats ate the vegetation faster than it
could regrow, eventually taking away their

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.710
own food supply. Less rat food meant less
rats and less rats meant less food for the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.610
humans.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.539
Tack on the fact that the local people were
also cutting down vegetation for farmland

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.850
and building materials, and you have an island
that is no longer environmentally sustainable.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.430
Again, meaning less food for humans.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.460
Those that didn’t die from starvation went
to war over the dwindling food supply, killing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.640
each other with the many arrowheads archaeologists
found scattered around the island. By the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.789
time European explorers reached the island
in 1722, there were few natives left. Those

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.000
that remained were quickly killed by western
diseases like syphilis and smallpox the Europeans

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.140
brought with them.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.250
This theory on Easter Island’s history is
so prevalent that historians use it as a cautionary

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.030
tale of the perils that comes from abusing
the scant natural resources available in a

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.789
small environment. But new research is challenging
this long-held theory. Archaeologists’ continued

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.399
fieldwork on the remote island now suggests
that disease and slavery brought by Europeans

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.750
played a much larger role in killing the Rapa
Nui than their own environmental demise.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.819
The findings, published in the journal Antiquity,
point to one specific thing. Do you remember

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.510
when I talked about those arrowheads the Rapa
Nui used to kill each other with? Well, it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.980
turns out, they aren’t arrowheads at all.
They’re not even weapons.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.180
Those carved, sharp pointed pieces of obsidian,
a rock made of volcanic glass, are called

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.340
mata’a, and after analyzing 423 of them,
a team of scientists has has now determined

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.849
that the objects aren’t suited for killing
humans, they’re more suited to be a general

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.870
purpose tool. They could have been used for
anything from cultivating the land to ritual

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.790
scarification to tattooing.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.090
As lead author on the recent study Carl Lipo
of Binghamton University, New York, explained

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.670
to the BBC, a weapon would be long and thin,
like a sword, basically something primed for

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.930
piercing an organ without having to get too
close to an enemy. The points on Easter Island

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.129
are just too short and flat. They are more
reminiscent of a spade than a spear making

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.379
them tools for survival, like digging and
farming.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.080
So if the Rapa Nui didn’t kill themselves,
that shifts the blame firmly onto the Europeans

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.459
explorers. While rats eating the palm trees
and the Rapa Nui felling them the trees to

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.920
clear land and make fires would have changed
the environment, it seems they remained a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.280
sustainable community for centuries. It wasn’t
until the Europeans brought disease and enslaved

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.549
the native Islanders that they were put on
the road to near extinction.

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.340
So the Rapa Nui might be gone, but at least
we can rebuild their history through rich

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.549
archaeological analysis. But analysing pointed
stones isn’t the only way scientists are

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.640
recovering lost civilizations. Julian’s
got the skinny on how scientists are using

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.470
LiDAR to unveil lost cities.
