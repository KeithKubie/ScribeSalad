00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.260
We use the Gradle Wrapper way back
the start of this class to run our

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.090
first task.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.375
Before we had even installed Gradle.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.430
That's a cool party trick, but
the real strength of the wrapper

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.390
is that you can put your build
tool under version control.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.520
So everyone building your project is
building it with the exact same tool.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
The Gradle Wrapper is composed of four
files, a jar, our properties file, and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.330
a pair of scripts, a shell script for
UNIX and Mac, and a batch script for

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.480
Windows.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.710
When you pass a command to one of these
scripts, it'll first check if Gradle

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.630
is installed, download it if necessary,
then execute your command.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.720
A wrapper can be created by running
the built -in wrapper task.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.560
Here we go, let's give it a try.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.630
And here we see the files of the Gradle
Wrapper, the two build scripts, and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.727
then inside the Gradle directory
we'll find the gradlewrapper.jar and

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:46.380
the gradlewrapperdir.properties.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.520
We can now run our Gradle
build using the wrapper.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.450
We use the wrapper identically to
how we would use the Gradle command.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.875
Let's get our task list.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:55.920
Oops, looks like we don't have
this version of Gradle installed.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.270
Since this was our first time using
the wrapper, it went ahead and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.830
downloaded the appropriate Gradle
distribution, and cached it locally.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.970
We can also explicitly configure
what version of Gradle we want

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.270
the wrapper to use by setting the Gradle
version property of the wrapper task.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.130
Let's change the version to 2.2 and
run the wrapper task again.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.200
Now if we use this new wrapper to get
the task list, it'll have to download

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.840
Gradle again because we don't
already have version 2.2.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.390
If we run gradle --version to see
which we're actually using here,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.420
looks like we were using version
2.2 just like we asked for.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
Configuration options of
the Gradle Wrapper is stored in this

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.260
Gradle Wrapper properties file.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.160
We've got it opened up down here.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.790
As you can see, what URL to get
Gradle from is defined here.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.010
Is currently using Gradle version 2.2,
just like we set from the build file.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.740
Let's change this back to 2.3.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.120
Now if we try running Gradlew version
again, we see we're back on version 2.3.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.520
This is a really important feature, as
it allows us to centrally control what

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.260
version of Gradle is used
to build our project.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.410
In practice, the Gradle Wrapper files,
including the scripts, jar, and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.210
properties file,
will be committed to source control.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.350
This serves two main functions.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.280
First, it means that everything that
is needed to get up and running with

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.820
the development of our project is
included in the source repository.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.020
Second, it means that the Gradle
version is also version control,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.910
which eliminates the possibility that
a developer encounters problems with

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.240
the build due to using
the wrong version of Gradle.
