NARRATOR: This sea
turtle was found

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:09.200
surrounded by cocaine worth
tens of millions of dollars.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.967
It was spotted by a
US Coast Guard Cutter

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.533
in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.734
The sea turtle was entangled
in lines connecting over two

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.900
dozen bundles of cocaine.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.533
The boat crew worked
quickly to cut

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.233
the lines that
had become wrapped

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.367
around the turtle's neck.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.367
The Coast Guard
recovered 75 feet of line

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:55.834
and 1,800 pounds of cocaine.

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:59.900
The bundles were filled with
an estimated $53 million

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.834
of the illegal narcotic.

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:14.066
Sadly, sea turtles
continue to be

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.967
killed for their meat and eggs.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:18.934
They are an endangered species.
