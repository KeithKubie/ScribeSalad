to stimulate themselves they began to
 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.570
to stimulate themselves they began to
stimulate themselves so that was the

expression if you go a long pair what's

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440
expression if you go a long pair what's
 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.200
expression if you go a long pair what's
happening in the brain is over longer

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210
happening in the brain is over longer
 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.719
happening in the brain is over longer
periods of time even over shorter

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729
periods of time even over shorter
 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.759
periods of time even over shorter
periods is that the the brain waves is

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769
periods is that the the brain waves is
 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.119
periods is that the the brain waves is
slowing down the basic arousal patterns

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129
slowing down the basic arousal patterns
 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.030

in the brain the the alpha waves are
 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.719
in the brain the the alpha waves are
getting slower okay and that the most

any kind of stimulation in sensory

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220
any kind of stimulation in sensory
 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.710
any kind of stimulation in sensory
deprivation even looking at the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720
deprivation even looking at the
 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.070
deprivation even looking at the
meaningless blotches of color they will

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080
meaningless blotches of color they will
 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.500
meaningless blotches of color they will
have at least press a bar to do that

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510
have at least press a bar to do that
 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.800
have at least press a bar to do that
know they're being deprived of something

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810
know they're being deprived of something
 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.710
know they're being deprived of something
variety and variety of stimulation and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720
variety and variety of stimulation and
 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.020
variety and variety of stimulation and
when you deprive people of that that is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
when you deprive people of that that is
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.510
when you deprive people of that that is
very immersive to them okay it's one of

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520
very immersive to them okay it's one of
 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240
very immersive to them okay it's one of
the ways of torturing actually of

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250
the ways of torturing actually of
 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.820
the ways of torturing actually of
putting people it's not just the social

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830
putting people it's not just the social
 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.070
putting people it's not just the social
and sensory deprivation when you put

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080
and sensory deprivation when you put
 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.810
and sensory deprivation when you put
someone you know it's the sensory

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820
someone you know it's the sensory
 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.750
someone you know it's the sensory
deprivation you put people in the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760
deprivation you put people in the
 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.060
deprivation you put people in the
environment they may not be in the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070
environment they may not be in the
 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.620
environment they may not be in the
sensory deprivation but if nothing is

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
sensory deprivation but if nothing is
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.290
sensory deprivation but if nothing is
varying in their sensory environment it

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300
varying in their sensory environment it
 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.830
varying in their sensory environment it
is becoming increasingly aversive

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.210
no it's not humane and it's not and over

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
no it's not humane and it's not and over
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.620
no it's not humane and it's not and over
solitary confinement that's gold and you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630
solitary confinement that's gold and you
 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.640
solitary confinement that's gold and you
know in prison this one they want to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
know in prison this one they want to
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.660
know in prison this one they want to
punish them and they put them in

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
punish them and they put them in
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.180
punish them and they put them in
solitary confinement which is usually a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190
solitary confinement which is usually a
 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.070
solitary confinement which is usually a
sensory deprivation as well because

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
sensory deprivation as well because
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780
sensory deprivation as well because
they're even if there's light in the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
they're even if there's light in the
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900
they're even if there's light in the
cell there's no variation okay nothing

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
cell there's no variation okay nothing
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.330
cell there's no variation okay nothing
is changing no one to talk to you know

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
is changing no one to talk to you know
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.729
is changing no one to talk to you know
part of social isolation is the lack of

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
part of social isolation is the lack of
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.110
part of social isolation is the lack of
social stimulation okay so this this is

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
social stimulation okay so this this is
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.050
social stimulation okay so this this is
over times is very torturous you might

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
over times is very torturous you might
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.040
over times is very torturous you might
say it's a it's a mental torture of a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050
say it's a it's a mental torture of a
 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.370
say it's a it's a mental torture of a
sort that's very could be very effective

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380
sort that's very could be very effective
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670
sort that's very could be very effective
the torture is often usually isolate

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
the torture is often usually isolate
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.250
the torture is often usually isolate
their prisoners before they begin

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260
their prisoners before they begin
 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.130
their prisoners before they begin
interrogating them because then they

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140
interrogating them because then they
 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.830
interrogating them because then they
respond but the tendency to respond to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
respond but the tendency to respond to
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.420
respond but the tendency to respond to
any stimulation even interrogation

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
any stimulation even interrogation
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.080
any stimulation even interrogation
there's more there's more primed by the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
there's more there's more primed by the
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.470
there's more there's more primed by the
leg by the sensory deprivation
