00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.500
SPEAKER: I'm not a surgeon.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.620
I don't think that's
what God wanted me to do,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.640
to make things better.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.430
But he did give me some sense
of judgment, temperament,

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.200
patience, and
discipline that enables

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.980
me to be good at helping
shepherd resources.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.080
Everybody has a role to
play, and this is mine.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.360
Friends, our guest for
today is Thomas Gayner,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.870
the Chief Investment
Officer at Markel Corp.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.430
He serves on the boards
of several organizations.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.260
And a recent Wall
Street Journal article

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.150
quoted, "Every investor can
learn something from him.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.530
Instead of trying to mimic the
inimitable brilliance of Mr.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.870
Buffettt, maybe more investors
should emulate the common sense

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.530
and patience of Mr. Gayner."

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.610
Quoting from a recent chapter
in a book about him. "

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.980
"Markels's success
has made Gayner rich,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.580
but he lives in a simple
townhouse and drives a Toyota

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.110
Prius."

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.170
I like getting 50 miles per
gallon because I'm cheap,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.660
he says.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.110
And if we did not
need oil, I think

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.780
the world would be a better
and more peaceful place.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.910
By living modestly, he can also
give more money to charity.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.220
But I don't want to exaggerate.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.680
This is not a Mother
Teresa-like existence, he says.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.530
Friends, I'm personally
delighted to have him here.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.880
We share a common
hero in John Wooden

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.680
and Tom's letters speak to
the spirit of Coach Wooden's

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.340
definition of success.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.580
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.290
please join me in
welcoming our special guest

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.160
for today, Mr. Thomas Gayner.

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:56.620
TOM GAYNER: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.500
Well, thank you very
much for having me.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.881
I know it's sort of
a custom and a cliche

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.630
to say that I'm really
honored to be here.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.360
And I am.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.270
That's true.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.370
I'm also a bit intimidated,
because I guess

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.740
you're all smarter than I am.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.810
It must be a rule around
here that the dumbest

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.270
guy has to wear a coat.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.650
So it is what it is and I'll
try to compete as best as I can,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.240
but I am very much honored to
be here and very impressed.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.390
What you do is known
on the world scale,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.450
and Markel is a tiny little
company compared to you.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.570
We have a nice record over
a long period of time,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.370
but I recognize the group that
I'm here in front of today,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.870
so I'm very honored and
privileged to be here.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.850
[INAUDIBLE] called me.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.550
He attended one
of the gatherings

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.770
we do out in Omaha, where we
meet with most of our investors

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.220
in Markel.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.030
And he called and asked if I
would come and give this talk.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390
And of course, I said yes.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.080
So I agreed to give a talk,
but what I really like to do

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.500
is talk with
people, not at them.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.260
So I'm going to share a few
comments and some discussion

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.850
about investing,
but then very much,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.110
I hope that you'll start
to ask some questions

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.068
and then we can have an
interactive discussion.

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:14.230
Because I don't know
what's on your mind,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.916
so the only way that I really
can do that, and address

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.790
the issues and things
you want to talk about,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.170
are to hear them
directly from you.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.500
When [INAUDIBLE]
and I were talking

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.570
about what we should
call this talk,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.360
would be "The Evolution
of a Value Investor."

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.350
And I thought that
was a good way

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.890
to try to describe
things, because as I look

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.250
around the group today, I
think in addition to the fact

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.490
that you're all
smarter than I am,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.220
you're all younger than I am.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.360
And so you have some
evolving and learning

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.960
and some passing through
time to do on your own,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.760
that I've done as
well, and perhaps I

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.340
can accelerate your learning
curve a bit in that process.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.150
And speak a little bit about
my own story of how I evolved

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.110
and the things that have
changed over time for me

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.360
as an investor.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.860
So the way it begins--
my technical training

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.260
is that of an accountant.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.650
I'm a CPA, professionally.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.339
My father was an accountant and
that was what my degree was in.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.860
And I always tell people
when they're sort of trying

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.720
to figure out what it
is they want to do,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.310
among the things that would be
a reasonable choice for what

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.510
you're studying,
would be accounting.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.310
And people ask me,
"why accounting?"

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.830
And I said, well, if you're
going to go to Germany,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.420
and you wanted to be a
successful person in Germany,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.700
what would be the very first
thing that you should do?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.180
And my answer is, you
should learn German,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.640
because that is the
language that people

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.450
are going to communicate
in, and work in, in Germany.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.730
So if you want to go
to Germany, and you

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.240
want to be a
success of any sort,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.010
I think it would be very hard
to do that without having

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.440
a working knowledge of German.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.570
Well similarly, in
business-- and by business,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.760
let's translate that further
to investing-- the language

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.320
of business is accounting.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.930
So to understand what's going
on-- you don't need to be CPA,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.784
but I think it's very important
to have a rudimentary knowledge

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:16.450
of what accounting
is, and how it works,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.150
and what words and
numbers mean when they're

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.980
in the context of financial
statements in business

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.510
and the language of accounting.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.090
So that's how I started.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.450
And similar to, I
think, many people

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.470
as they begin to go
down the path of trying

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.830
to become an investor, I had a
very strong quantitative bias

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.840
in selecting investments.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.262
And one of the ways I would
describe that, and one

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:46.720
of the tendencies
that we all have,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.780
especially when we're starting
out, for a variety of reasons,

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.480
is to have quantitative metrics
that you really can rely on.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.879
And one of the reasons
that that would be case,

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.670
is when you're starting
out and you haven't

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.520
done this a whole
lot, you'd really

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.470
like to have some confidence
supplied by something external

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.070
that you're on the right path.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.860
And if you can do some
well-established, well-trod

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.390
paths of disciplines of
things that have worked-- boy,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.890
that seems like a pretty
good basis to make a decision

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.250
and to think about what's
going to happen in the future.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.520
And there is absolutely nothing
in the world wrong with that.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.280
I encourage that.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.290
That's really the
best way to start,

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.760
but I think that is
only a partial step

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.664
along the journey of becoming
an accomplished investor.

00:06:34.664 --> 00:06:37.610
That worked spectacularly
well for Ben Graham

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.870
in the 1930s, who's the
grandfather of all investing

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.980
and the professor who
really taught Warren Buffett

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.244
the disciplines of investing.

00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:48.660
But that was a period of time
when we were just coming out

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.130
of the Depression,
and there were

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.240
a lot of securities
that were mathematically

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.290
and quantitatively cheap.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.660
So it was a great technique,
a great discipline.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.380
It had not been
practiced, but that pond

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.540
has gotten a little over-fished.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.470
So today, while it's important
to know the technical skills,

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.140
to know the accounting,
to know things

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.590
like the net working capital,
and to think about price

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.870
earnings ratios a price
to book value ratios,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.580
and have the series of
quantitative metrics

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.570
that would tell you
something is cheap,

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.830
that's good as far as it goes.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.400
But it doesn't tell you enough.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.760
There are more things.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.595
And I call the notion of
doing that sort of work, which

00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:28.970
is the first step,
and you really

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.010
should do it-- that's the
idea of spotting value.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.160
So it's a picture of
time stands still.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.110
When you're looking at a picture
of something that you think

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.640
is worth this, and
it's selling for this.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.212
So there's a price a gap there.

00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:45.836
And you want to buy
it at this, and you

00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:47.150
think it will get to that.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.270
And that that's great if it
works, but that's a picture.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.620
What I have evolved
to, and the path

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.680
that I've been on for a long
time-- and the reason I got

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.481
on that path is because I found
that that notion of spotting

00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:00.230
value and thinking
that there's value gaps

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.710
would close right after I
showed up to buy some stock,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.240
it didn't work.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.160
So it's not as if I found that
technique, and I learned that,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.050
and it worked, and
produced great wealth.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.140
It didn't.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.862
So you gotta take
the next step and try

00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:14.070
to figure something else out.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.170
So I moved from spotting
value to spotting

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.760
the creation of value,
value creators as opposed

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.960
to value spotters.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.550
So instead of a snapshot,
instead of a picture,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.410
how about a movie?

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.951
What's this movie
going to look like?

00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:30.150
How's this reel going
to unfurl over time?

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.770
So instead of saying that I
firmly believe that something

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.799
is worth this, I'm now
asking myself, well,

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.850
what will it be worth next year?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.900
And the year after that?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.900
And the year after that?

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.572
And the decade after that?

00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:43.030
And to have some
sense of something

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.014
that is increasing in value over
time at an appropriate rate.

00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:48.680
Well, that's what I'm
really hunting for

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.460
and that's what I'm really
trying to find and spot.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.090
And I think this
has applications,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.290
not just for investing,
but for leadership,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.665
for management,
for relationships

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.470
that you would have
on a social, as well

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.720
as a professional basis. so it's
an integrated thought as to how

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.150
my life is unfurling.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.940
So with that thought
in mind, I came up

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.360
with a 4-Point view of what
it is that I'm specifically

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.350
looking for, and how I
specifically think about things

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.850
that I might invest in.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.670
So the first thing that
I look to invest in,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.140
is a profitable business
with good returns

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.230
on capital, that doesn't use
too much leverage to do it.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.880
And again, each and
every one of those words

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.050
came about because I
made a mistake somewhere

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.960
along the line.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.610
Things did not work
and as a consequence,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.160
it was a hard,
searing lesson where

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.560
I lost some of my own money.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.810
And as [INAUDIBLE] said in
his introduction, I'm cheap

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.480
and I really hate losing money.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.540
So hard lessons are
learned of the kind that

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.690
sink in and sear most deeply.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.020
So the profitable business
with good returns on capital.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.950
Now, you live in a
part of the world

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.400
here where there are a lot
of dreams, a lot of venture

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.900
capital things, where people
will describe things that

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.900
are going to happen some day.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.920
And a lot of that does come
true, especially around here.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.630
This is a vibrant
community, and this place

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.830
stands as a testament
to sometimes there's

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.110
people who have an idea about
something that has never

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.490
been done before, and
we're going to do it,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.070
and it'll be spectacular.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.450
And that does happen sometimes.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.912
And it's marvelous when it does,
but I don't have to do that.

00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:31.120
I'm not a venture capitalist.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.530
It's a legitimate
discipline, but that's not

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.500
what I'm good at.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.320
In Virginia, we joke about
once you do something twice,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.900
it becomes a tradition, so
they have to keep doing it

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.896
unless there's some
reason not to do it.

00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:47.520
So Virginia might
have a different sort

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.702
of sense about history than
what might be the case here,

00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:52.660
and thinking about things
that were in the past

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.880
as opposed to the future.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:00.050
So I like to see a demonstrated
record of profitability.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.810
Now the other reason that I
like to see that, in addition

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.220
to just my own limits, and
not having the skills to see

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.000
into the future as well as
some others do, is that,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.020
if you think about what a
business is designed to do,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.920
and it is to serve others.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.930
So the most successful
business you will ever find,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.490
is one that the customers are
glad they're doing business

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.037
with you.

00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:25.120
Because that means their
lives are getting better.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.850
There is some value that is
being created for the customer,

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.430
not for the business, but for
the customer, because of that

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.890
company being in business.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.430
And the mark of the business
doing that well, is a profit.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.940
Because if you have a business
that is not making a profit,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.500
that means one of two
things is the case.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.870
A, the business is either doing
something that the world just

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.100
doesn't really care about.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.810
People don't need it.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.684
People don't want it.

00:11:48.684 --> 00:11:53.150
For whatever reason, it's
not getting the recognition

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.931
or demand in the
marketplace, such

00:11:54.931 --> 00:11:57.180
that the business is able
to do all the things that it

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.210
needs to do, and still have
a margin of profit left over.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.480
So that's of no interest
to me, because in order

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.780
to invest and
invest successfully,

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.210
a business needs to be able to
have profits to pay dividends,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.440
to pay its employees, to grow
and invest over time, so I

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.990
want to see a profit there.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.260
The second reason that
a business might not

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.710
be profitable, is that
they're not very good at it.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.840
So I don't know
how much anybody's

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.100
interested in
sports around here,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.365
but I'm the Washington
Redskins fan.

00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.240
And I hate to admit
that, because they're not

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.400
very successful.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.880
But neither are the
Oakland Raiders,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.440
which are very close here.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.690
So those two teams are in
a decade-long competition

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.300
for what the worst team
in the NFL is going to be.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.689
And I can't believe
that they do,

00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:45.730
which is kind of surprising,
but think about that

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.720
as a business, that if you had
a business that's consistently

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.624
at or near the
bottom of the things,

00:12:50.624 --> 00:12:52.790
you would not think that
that is very good business,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.415
and as a consequence, how could
that be a very good investment?

00:12:55.415 --> 00:12:58.351
If I really want to give some
of my hard-earned capital

00:12:58.351 --> 00:12:59.850
to that business,
and think that I'm

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.410
going to get more
of it years later,

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.570
I want that business
to be successful.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.075
So that's why look for
businesses that are profitable

00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:09.970
and earning good
returns on capital.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.010
And I add the part about
leverage, because again,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.722
from mistakes in the
2008-2009 financial crisis,

00:13:17.722 --> 00:13:19.896
I had some tough losses.

00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:21.270
And again, I think
you learn more

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.490
from things that don't go well
then when things do go well.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.460
And I looked at some businesses
that I did not really

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.420
appreciate how much leverage
was inherent in what

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.214
they were doing.

00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:33.630
So if you have
financial leverage,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.090
you might have
very good business.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.690
You might be taking
care of your customers.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.981
You might be serving them well.

00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.060
They might be happy to
do business with you,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.140
but you might have to
refinance your debt

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.220
and have capital
resupplied to you at a time

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.390
when the markets just don't
want to give it to you.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.620
And if you're in that
situation, basically, that's

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.760
like being a card
player and you've

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.490
got some really good
cards in your hand,

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.990
but somebody just comes and
rips the cards out of your hand,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.340
before you can finish
playing the hand.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.370
And I've seen that
happen firsthand.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.920
I've had gobs of flash
taken from, figuratively,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.530
not literally.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.391
I've still got my gobs
of flesh, but I've

00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:09.890
seen that, so as a
consequence, I've

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.490
become very sensitive
about leverage

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.230
and not having
too much leverage.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.310
There's also another
factor of leverage,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.700
and that is character.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.980
And I'll segue into the
my second lens in a bit.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.460
And I remember when
Markel first started down

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.880
the path of buying
non-insurance businesses

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.880
and expanding what we did, there
was one elderly gentleman who

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.100
gave me a spectacularly
good piece of advice.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.530
And he said, if you're
looking to buy businesses,

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.710
don't buy businesses where
they use a lot of debt.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.140
And I wondered why.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.730
And he said, well,
if you want to make

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.938
sure you're dealing with
high-quality, high-integrity

00:14:44.938 --> 00:14:47.860
people, generally speaking,
high-quality, high-integrity

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.220
people don't use a lot of debt.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.400
Or not so much that, but
if you're a bad person,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.540
if you were sort of a
little bit of a crook

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.710
or had a little bit of
larceny in your heart,

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:01.204
it's unlikely that you would
use 100% equity finance.

00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:02.620
Because when it's
equity financed,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.507
it means it's your own money.

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.340
When it's debt, you're
running your business

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.340
on other people's money.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.330
He says crooks don't
steal their own money.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.840
They steal other people's money.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.570
So when you see a business
that sort of relies

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:20.760
on a bunch of debt to
operate and be successful,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.810
that adds a layer of concern or
diligence that you have to do,

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.841
that you have to think
about that you don't have

00:15:27.841 --> 00:15:29.840
to if you look at the
business that just doesn't

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.990
use very much debt.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.300
So it's a margin of safety.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.480
That's a word and a phrase that
Ben Graham used quite a bit

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.940
in thinking about investing,
by looking at companies

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.940
that don't use much debt.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.885
That just really
protects your downside

00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:47.200
and protects you from
bad things happening.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.930
The second lens that
I look at anything

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:53.241
through is the management
and the management teams

00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:54.490
that are running the business.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.690
I'm not running these businesses
that either we invest in

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.000
as shareholders and buy
stock in, or that we buy,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.950
that we're majority owners
of or 100% owners of.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.380
I mean, there are people who
are running these businesses,

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.080
and those people will
make those businesses

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.836
the success or failure
that they are doomed to be.

00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.460
And when I'm looking at people,
I'm looking for two attributes.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.760
One is I want
character, integrity.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.360
And ability.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.890
Two things: character
and the ability.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.900
Because one without
the other is worthless.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.570
If you have people who
have high integrity,

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.420
they're good character people,
but they're not very talented--

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.860
well, they may be nice people.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.610
You may like them.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.770
They may be good
friends, good neighbors,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.200
good coaches of your
kid's soccer team,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.280
things of that nature.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.860
But in the context of business,
they can't get the job done.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.010
So as a consequence, that
doesn't do you any good,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.510
because the business
does have to be

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.100
profitable to continue
to persist and grow

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.370
and last over long
periods of time.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.560
So you got to see
that talent there.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.950
The character is nice,
but it is not sufficient

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.380
in and of itself.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.710
If you have people who are
talented, who are whip-smart,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.900
who are very skilled at
what they do, but yet

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.770
have a character or integrity
flaw of some sort-- well,

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.460
they may do well,
but you as there

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.329
outside, silent,
non-controlling partner are not.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.190
That will not end well.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.730
And again, I'll get
to your questions

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.260
in just a few
minutes, I sure will.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.810
That's not just
about picking stocks,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.350
that's about relationships.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.750
So if you're picking a spouse,
or a partner in a venture--

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.010
anything like that.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.700
To see both of those
features in place

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.460
in large enough
quantities, that you

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.170
have confidence
that you're dealing

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.200
with people of character
and integrity and talent.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.015
That's an important
thing to look for.

00:17:52.015 --> 00:17:55.800
In fact, I can't think of
anything that's more important.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.540
I'll go through four
bits, four lenses,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.260
and then we'll start opening
the floor for questions.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.000
The third thing that
I think about when

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.075
investing in anything, is what
are the reinvestment dynamics

00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:07.315
of the business?

00:18:07.315 --> 00:18:09.860
And that's a somewhat
complicated way

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.607
of saying things.

00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:14.440
[INAUDIBLE], as a
graduate of the University

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.690
of Pennsylvania-- we were
chatting about this earlier.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.140
So Ben Franklin was
the founder of Penn,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.600
and sort of the revered
figure of the Penn Quakers.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.380
And Ben Franklin said
money makes more money,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.590
and the money money
makes, makes more money.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.740
So he intuitively understood
the power of compound interest.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.300
Einstein said it was the most
powerful force in the universe,

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.290
compound interest.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.230
Einstein further went
on to say, that those

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.650
who understand compound
interest earn it and those who

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.680
do not understand it pay it.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.550
So what is the reinvestment
dynamic of the business?

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.222
What's the compounding feature?

00:18:47.222 --> 00:18:49.180
And one of the ways you
could think about that,

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.770
is think about the
restaurant business.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:57.950
In a spectacular five-star,
gourmet, lovely restaurant--

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.600
typically, those tend to
be owned by the people who

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.350
are there every day.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:08.430
They're not chains of the
best restaurants in the world,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.920
from sort of a
gourmet perspective.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.037
Usually the owner is
the chef, or right there

00:19:12.037 --> 00:19:13.120
in the front of the house.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.286
And he's there all the time.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:16.120
So that business,
that restaurant,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.860
can be very successful.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.770
But typically,
that is not a model

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.840
that is set up to be able to
replicate it again and again

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.370
and again and again and again.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.500
It may provide a
very nice living

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.170
for the owner and their
family, and employ

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.400
their family, and great service
to the world, great food,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.224
great prices, all that sort of
stuff, but it's not replicable.

00:19:37.224 --> 00:19:38.890
So there are some
businesses that you'll

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.830
see that are like that,
that are boutiques,

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.980
in some form or fashion.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.855
It's a limiting factor to
really be able to apply capital

00:19:45.855 --> 00:19:47.210
and to see it grow.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.850
There are other
businesses, and in the news

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.270
these days that people may
wonder whether their time has

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.860
passed, and I won't
enter into that debate,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.120
but clearly this would be
an example of where somebody

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.350
was able to figure out
a restaurant model that

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.850
was able to be replicable, and
able to be done over and over

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.750
and over again.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.450
But go back in time 50 years,
and at the start of McDonald's.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.130
And then another McDonald's and
another McDonald's and another

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.100
McDonald's.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.560
One right after the other.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.530
That's a perfect example
of where that reinvestment

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.720
dynamic kicks in.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.110
So what I'm looking at
something, I'm thinking how big

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.190
can this be?

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.570
How scalable is it?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.820
How replicable is it?

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.790
Because in order for you to
really apply a bunch of capital

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.100
to it, it has to be
something that you

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.940
can keep reinvesting in.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.282
And if you think about
things in a spectrum,

00:20:34.282 --> 00:20:35.990
and I would encourage
you to always think

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.770
about things in more than one
dimension and in a spectrum.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.334
Things, generally
speaking, are not binary.

00:20:41.334 --> 00:20:42.250
They're not yes or no.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.590
They're not white or black.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.090
They're shades of gray all
the way along the line.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.300
So a perfect
business is one that

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.800
earns very good
returns on its capital,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.980
and can take that capital that
it makes and then reinvest that

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.330
and keep compounding at the
same sort of a rate year

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.300
after year after year.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.370
That's the North Star.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.189
That would be the
absolute perfection.

00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:03.730
The worst kind of
business is the one

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.100
that doesn't earn very
good returns on capital,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.300
and yet seems to need
gobs of it all the time.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.954
And again, this
might be old data,

00:21:10.954 --> 00:21:12.370
because the world
seems to change,

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.840
but I used to joke that
airlines fit that category.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.380
So there were all
these airlines,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.610
and they realize what
was coming and going.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.860
And people seem to want to
always get in the business,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.040
but they never really make
good returns on capital.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.000
These days they are.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.210
Whether they will continue to
do so or not, I don't know.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.170
But that's kind of the
spectrum of business,

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.980
so I just try to get as close
to this end of the spectrum as

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.190
possible.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.580
Now in the real world,
this does not really

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.330
exist very often
or very frequently

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.310
and oftentimes it's very
richly priced when you see it.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.380
But how close can you get to it?

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.230
Because the second-best
business in the world,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.890
is one that earns a very
good returns on capital.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.170
It can't reinvest it, but
the management knows that.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.550
They're intellectually
honest that they

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.660
have to do something
else with the money.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.830
And what are their choices?

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.737
Well, they can
make acquisitions,

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.070
they can pay dividends, they
can buy in their own stock.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.030
But they are thoughtful
and they know that.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.970
And Berkshire really
is the best example

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.360
of a company that
had that in place,

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.357
where you had the
genius at the top who

00:22:12.357 --> 00:22:13.940
knew that the original
business, which

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.520
was a textile business--
whatever money that made,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.190
it was best to invest
that somewhere else.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.520
And that's what Buffett
has done for 50 years,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.290
is to reinvest the cash flows
of the various businesses

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.930
the come feed into
Berkshire in other places,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.350
so that is the maestro-like
effect that he has had.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.400
So that's a legitimate way of
handling the notion that you

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.350
can't reinvest in the
business that you have,

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.220
but you can be thoughtful
about what you do

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.980
that money when it comes in it.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.790
And then the fourth and final
lens its price, evaluation.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.680
And that's really
where a lot of people

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.746
start in investing because
there are books you can read.

00:22:54.746 --> 00:22:56.370
There are spreadsheets
that you can do.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.280
There are well-trod
paths you can

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.630
follow that talk about what's
a reasonable price earnings

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.120
ratio, what's a reasonable
price to book ratio,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.910
or what's a reasonable
divident-- all

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.060
these quantitative factors.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.820
And those are all good, but
as I said, they're not enough.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.610
They go in to the thinking.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.560
They go into the thought
process of whether this

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.210
is a good investment
or not, but the mistake

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.780
that I see-- there's
two types of mistakes

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.910
you could make when you're
doing your evaluation work.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.710
One is that you pay
too much for something.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.260
So you make this judgment
about what something is worth,

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.450
or you make an error
in those calculations,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.380
and you pay more than
something is worth.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.900
And that that's a
frustrating error,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.160
but you've laid out some
money and it doesn't really

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.104
earn much return
or less of return

00:23:44.104 --> 00:23:45.520
or maybe even loses
money compared

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.746
to what you paid out for it.

00:23:46.746 --> 00:23:48.120
That's not the
worst thing that's

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.950
ever going to happen to you.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.450
That's an error that
you can recover from.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.520
The kind of errors
that are harder,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.740
and that really cost
you more, although it's

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.230
a hidden cost and
it's an implicit cost,

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.210
is that you've thought about
what something was worth,

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.600
and you thought about what
you wanted to pay for,

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.280
and this was something
that actually did compound,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.640
and you never bought
it, because it never

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.780
met your test evaluation.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.260
But it's just kept on
compounding over time.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.440
That example, it's easy
not to talk about it.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.290
And I think if there's
one thing that I've

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.650
been thinking about a lot
recently is as human beings,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:33.520
we tend to have very vivid
memories of things that we did

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.270
and things that happened
to us, especially

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.970
things that happened
to us recently.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.640
We tend to not
have vivid memories

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.330
and not do well about
thinking about the things

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.130
that didn't happen to
us or that we didn't do.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.460
And we can brush away those
experiences relatively easily,

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.530
because we don't firsthand
experience with it.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.704
So we probably all have
stories about something,

00:24:53.704 --> 00:24:55.620
and the older you get,
the more stories you'll

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.430
have like this, where you
thought about something

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.850
or you thought something
might have been a good idea,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.190
or you thought that might
have been good business,

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.690
or you thought that might
have been a good stock.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.110
In a certain point in time.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.780
But for whatever reason,
pricing or whatever,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.050
you didn't buy it at
that time, and then

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.410
you never got
around to buying it.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.310
Those are the things
that really hurt.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.290
That money that you
didn't make, will

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.140
end up being a far
bigger subtraction

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.640
from your theoretical end
net worth, then the things

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.470
that you did buy that
perhaps did not work

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.000
as well as you hoped it would.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.040
So those are the four
points, and the four lenses

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.930
of how I think about
investing and how

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.370
I've learned to
think differently

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.180
than the way I thought when
I was first starting out

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.600
as an accountant.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.055
I was very
quantitatively-driven.

00:25:44.055 --> 00:25:47.480
I was very disciplined about
sticking to certain metrics

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.480
that I thought were
markers of valuation.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.850
And I'm started to think
more qualitatively.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.080
And if there was
one of those four

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.130
that's the one that I
would think about the most,

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.980
it would be the third
point, the reinvestment.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.680
What will happen over
time to this business?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.460
Will get better?

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.870
Will it get worse?

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.302
Are the conditions behind it
improving or deteriorating?

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:11.510
And it's a tough world.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.230
It's tough.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.240
It is very tough to find things
that you have confidence in,

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.364
that will continue in
your best judgment,

00:26:20.364 --> 00:26:22.280
to continue to compounding
in value over time.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.150
But when you do that,
don't be a penny pincher--

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.340
and I'm as tight as they come--
but don't be a penny pincher

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.030
when you find
businesses like that.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.380
So with that, I want to stop
and start taking some questions.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.170
And I know sir, you did.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.430
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned evaluating

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.450
management-- you think about
character and integrity.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.840
First question is, how do you
actually, specifically evaluate

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.720
that?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.720
And for us that can actually
interact with management

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.090
of companies, and we just look
at prices and stuff like that,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.230
how do we actually go
about figuring that out?

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.340
TOM GAYNER: Well again,
I'm looking around the room

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.430
and I'm seeing that I'm older
than you guys, but I'm married,

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.050
and I've been
married a long time.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.190
Just by show of hands, some
of the people who are married?

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.220
A bunch of you.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.740
How did you decide who
you're going to marry?

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.989
You dated.

00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:17.280
And what's the point of dating?

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.480
It's not really to
see a movie, or go

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.880
to a restaurant, or a
ballgame or roller skating,

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.450
or whatever you did.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.880
It's really to spend
time with somebody,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:32.050
to see if their values
overlap enough with yours,

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.850
that you'll be able to get
along for a long period of time.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.220
That's the whole
point of dating.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.060
And with management teams,
and people running businesses,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.270
in effect, what I'm doing,
is analogous to the idea

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.080
of dating.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.150
It's to try to find people
running these businesses where

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.240
our values, at least in
the worlds of commerce,

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.800
overlap enough that I'm
happy for them to have

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.080
the responsibility and authority
to run that business as they

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.160
see fit.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.870
Now you mentioned a
limitation, that you

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.120
suggest that I'm able
to get an appointment

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.230
and see people who run business
and interact with the managers

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.940
and to some degree, that's true.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.970
But at the same time, I
really spend a lot more time

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:21.170
reading about people, and
using the exact same resources

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.680
that you would have
access to as well.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.440
So I read the annual reports.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.950
I read the proxy statements.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.410
I read magazine articles.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.990
And I try to think
and just sort of look,

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.220
and get a gut feel
and make some judgment

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.250
and discernment about
whether these people are

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.760
acting in a way
that's reasonable

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.910
and makes sense to me.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.862
And your calibration
is going to be

00:28:45.862 --> 00:28:47.070
somewhat different than mine.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.350
You're just different.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.030
All of us are going
to set those things

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.400
that we think are
important, and where

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.670
we think the bounds of behavior
should be, differently.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.030
Because we're all different,
but you have them.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:03.199
And I encourage you to think
about things in that dimension,

00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:04.740
because one of the
things you'll find

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.420
is, you'll make a judgment.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.510
Your judgment will
not be perfect,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.270
but by virtue of the
times you get it wrong,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.210
when make an error,
you'll learn something.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.776
It's like, ooh, I don't
like that so much.

00:29:15.776 --> 00:29:17.150
And that will be
a marker to you,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.570
that the next time you see it,
you will be sensitized to it

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.200
and it will help you
make better judgments.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.040
In looking at you guys, when I
first started in the investment

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.260
business, I have a
very wonderful mentor

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.940
named Ned Reynolds.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.220
And this was a gentleman
who's probably 70 years old

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.710
and I was brand new in
the investment business.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.510
And he was very
interesting character,

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.480
and it's not like he
was formally my mentor,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.250
he was nice.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.510
He was kind and he was
just helpful to people.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.160
And one day, I happened
to be standing next to him

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.800
on a hot, summer day
in Richmond, Virginia.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.820
And not much was going on.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.610
We were just sort of-- market
was open, and in those days,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.530
you didn't have the CNBC
with the ticker tape

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.946
but you actually had a physical
ticker tape in a brokerage

00:30:04.946 --> 00:30:07.860
office, so it would create
this sort of hum and drone

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.320
of this tape going by.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.960
And he was standing there.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.530
And he had his arms
folded like this,

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.220
and he really wasn't engaged
in conversation with me.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.170
He was standing by my side,
was not making eye contact,

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.470
but I had been in the business
for three months at this point.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:33.390
And he said, Tom, the secret
to success in the investing

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.270
is lasting the first 30 years.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.670
It's a powerful statement.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.980
What he said is, everything you
see in the world of finance,

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.740
you will see again.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.460
And every excess
that you see happen

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.140
and not just over-valuation,
but under-valuation.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.530
So like the '08, '09 period
when we had a real financial

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:06.150
crisis-- I suspect and I hope
that that's a once-a-generation

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.220
kind of event.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.620
I don't think we'll go
through that again real soon,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.600
because all of us who lived
through it in a firsthand way

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.660
have had a taste of that and
we don't want to do it again.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.540
And anybody who hasn't
had that happen to them,

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.632
they think it can't.

00:31:20.632 --> 00:31:22.840
But you just sort of have
to have to live through it.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.190
There's an old joke that
says, every generation

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.060
is the one that thinks
that they invented sex.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.980
Not so.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.750
But everybody has
that sense about them

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.041
as they go through this path,
and once you've sort have

00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:38.520
been around for a while,
you sort of see things,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.710
and you recognize things.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.360
And making those judgments
about the character

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.470
and the values in the way
people behave, in a way

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:51.040
that works for you-- that's just
a process of trial and error,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.100
with an emphasis on error.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.740
And you get to it eventually.

00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.200
If we're talking about selecting
stocks, or buying stock,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.140
or buying investments,
you don't need

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.950
to have a personal
relationship with the CEO

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.670
in order to make a reasonable
judgment about whether you

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.620
think that company's
being run well or not.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.500
There's a good paper trail
and a good set of evidence

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:21.732
out there for you to think
about and draw judgments about.

00:32:21.732 --> 00:32:23.190
AUDIENCE: My question
is how do you

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.770
feel about investing
in companies

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.910
in rapidly-changing industries?

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.860
So versus like a brand name
company like Coca Cola?

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.600
TOM GAYNER: It's harder.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.910
It's not right or wrong,
or better or worse.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.280
It's just harder.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.870
So for instance, one of the
things that's under appreciated

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.190
is that-- and
[INAUDIBLE] and I were

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.330
talking about this yesterday--
so on his desk in his study,

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.600
he had a book of the Graham and
Dodd security analysis, which

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.240
is the equivalent of the
Bible for security analysis.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.210
Everybody has to
study Graham and Dodd,

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.970
if you're going to
be in this business.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.450
And I noticed on the cover,
it said, sixth edition.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.300
And I said, well, I don't know
what the sixth edition is like.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.150
When I was in school
and I was studying it,

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.800
it was the fourth edition.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.310
And I can remember on the
50th anniversary of the class

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:13.510
or something, they came out with
a reprint of the first edition.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.112
And just for grins, I bought
it, and I said to [INAUDIBLE],

00:33:17.112 --> 00:33:19.570
I said, you might want to get
a hold of that first edition.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.300
Because the difference
between the first and fourth--

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.580
it's an entirely different book.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.080
So in the first
edition, which is really

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.820
the one that I would recommend
that you read-- and it might

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.310
sound antique when they're
talking about railroads and all

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:36.970
those kinds of all business,
but the concepts-- Ben Graham

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.270
was a classicist as much
as he was a finance guy.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.620
He was talking about Greek
and Roman civilizations.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.170
Greek myths, and all that sort
of stuff, which are really

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.930
about human nature, and values.

00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:54.660
Sorry for the long
answer to make a point,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.480
but people jump on Ben
Graham, and they think about

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.960
all his qualitative
statements that he made.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.920
And when somebody says a
Graham and Dodd style investor,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.160
typically that has
come to mean, someone

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.070
who's tearing apart a balance
sheet, and is a value spotter,

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.540
and finding the
difference in price.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.750
But Ben Graham, in
the first edition,

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.020
said that growth,
which is your point

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.880
about rapid technological
change, and things are changing

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.004
and you're implying
changing for the better.

00:34:23.004 --> 00:34:25.170
But you have to admit that
also sometimes things can

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.920
and do change for the worse.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.570
Growth is extremely important.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.949
It's just hard to calculate
and it's hard to value that.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.805
Ben Graham further
went on in the book

00:34:37.805 --> 00:34:39.429
that he wrote that's
just a little more

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:43.830
approachable and not so
much technically detailed

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.330
as security analysis, but
the "Intelligent Investor",

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.409
which he meant to write just for
anybody who wanted to pick up--

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.350
should be able to
read that book.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:55.560
In one of the later editions
of the "Intelligent Investor",

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.330
Ben Graham made the point that
he made more money in Geico,

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:04.230
in the stock of Geico, than
in every other investment

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.940
he made combined.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.540
Because Geico was
the growth company.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.290
That's the one that
got that third point

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.580
about the reinvestment
dynamic right.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.620
And if you further went on
and researched that decision

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.830
about how you he got to
be connected with Geico

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.960
and how he got a hold of that
big block of Geico stock,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.600
he relied on his
partner Jerry Newman

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.380
to make the final deal with
the family, the Goodwin family,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.930
to buy that stock.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.960
He did not get that over
the finish line himself,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.170
and he struggled
with that, because it

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:41.610
wasn't the classic sort of
investment that he was used to.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.180
He said, if it wasn't for
Geico, you never know my name.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.580
So that idea of growth, of
rapid technological change,

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.040
of changing the world-- I
mean, this is a classic example

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.565
of something they did not
exist not that long ago,

00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:58.690
and now it's one of the
leading, dominant companies

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.340
in the world.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.120
All you need to do is get that
right once in your whole life,

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.130
and it will change your
investing career forever.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.870
But it's hard.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.340
It's hard to do that.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.720
SPEAKER: Thank you, Tom,
for your visit here.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.900
So one thing
[INAUDIBLE] mentions

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.090
is, being in the
investment business,

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.880
having the right structure,
that right kind of clients.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.260
And one thing that
Markel has-- it

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.250
rightly structured a
similar to Berkshire

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.160
[INAUDIBLE] source of capital.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.040
Would you mind
sharing your story

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.520
of how you came about at
Markel, from your prior carrier.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.170
Help us to transition, how
did you-- seems like a dream

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.160
job for most people.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.460
TOM GAYNER: Yes.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:41.710
Indeed.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:42.210
Thank you.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.310
I appreciate the question.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.816
And I think a lot of the
reason you're here today's

00:36:45.816 --> 00:36:47.690
is you have a personal
interest in investing.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.670
So I'll actually connect
that notion of structure

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.730
at the end of the answer to
what might be applicable to you

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.660
as individuals and
individual investors.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.570
So just a short
snippet, is a sale.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.160
I started out in accounting,
and my father was CPA

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.710
and we were in a small town,
and he had a tax practice

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.690
and he owned a liquor
store and he had a farm

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.189
and did real estate
deals, so that's

00:37:10.189 --> 00:37:12.330
what I thought that's
what accountants did.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.970
But then I went to work for
Price Waterhouse Coopers,

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.220
and it was a little
more structured and not

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.987
quite as entrepreneurial as what
I remembered my father doing.

00:37:20.987 --> 00:37:23.570
And as an accountant, I always
joke that I was more interested

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.120
in dollars than numbers.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.750
And there's a profound
difference between the two.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.797
So just by accident,
I had always

00:37:32.797 --> 00:37:34.880
been interested in the
stock market and investing.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.980
It was something my dad and I
talked about was I was a kid.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.960
So I found a broker in
Richmond, Virginia, where I was.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.440
He was also an ex-accountant.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.210
And he worked for a firm
called Davenport and Company

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.400
of Virginia.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.460
And he had two
hats that he wore.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.295
He was an analyst, so he
covered companies, and wrote

00:37:51.295 --> 00:37:53.660
research reports for
the firm, but he also

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.420
had individual clients.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.290
And I got referred to him.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.540
He became a broker.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.060
We got along.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.140
And then after a relatively
short period of time,

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.920
he extended a job offer to me.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.820
He said, well, you look like
you know what you're doing here.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.520
How'd you like to come
over here and work with me?

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.560
And we'll be analysts and be
brokers, and do investment.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.380
And I said, well,
that sounds like fun.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.410
So I went there.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.200
And that was 1984.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.310
And from '84 through
1990, I was at Davenport

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.680
and had those two roles.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:29.070
Well, in 1984, that's when
I read an article in Fortune

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.020
magazine about Berkshire
Hathaway, and about Buffett,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.600
and just to tell you how stupid
and naive I was at the time,

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.550
and just trying to shake
it off as best I can.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.540
I can remember
reading that article,

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.810
and thinking to
myself, wow, every word

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.750
just dripped common sense.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.130
So I went into the guy I
was working for at the time,

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.290
different guy than my
partner, but I said, hey Joe,

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.401
have you ever heard of
this guy, Warren "Boo-fay"?

00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:56.650
And he said, it's Buffett,
you idiot, and threw me out

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.820
of his office and whatnot.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.880
And I saw Berkshire
Hathaway, and I was so stupid

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.815
that when I looked at the
price and it was $380 a share

00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:08.740
or something like that, I
said no stock could possibly

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.480
be worth that kind of
money, so it didn't buy it

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.230
to my everlasting regret.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.930
But life has a way of
teaching these painful lessons

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:22.080
and things working at, so
in 1986, Markel went public,

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.840
and it happened to
be headquartered

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.160
in Richmond, Virgina.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.420
And they had an
insurance business

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.500
that made underwriting
profits, and Steve Markel,

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.990
who was the chief financial
guy at the company,

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.510
was interested in
investing the underwriting

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.870
profits longer-term,
in equity securities

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.270
and ownership of business.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:44.200
So the light went off for me.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.340
I missed the first
part of Berkshire,

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.610
but at least I had been
given a second chance.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.790
Now here's a company that
has the same structure,

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.220
the same architecture.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.140
Not the same accomplishments,
but at least the same theory

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.110
of having an insurance
company as the base engine

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.430
and using the profitability
of the insurance company

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:07.150
to provide capital to make
other investments over time.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.020
So aha!

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.320
So I bought some Markel
stock and 1986 to 1990,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.130
I was covering Markel
from Davenport.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.670
In 1990, Markel did a deal
which more than doubled

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.062
the size of the company.

00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:20.270
Steve Markel had been managing
investments by himself

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.770
and thought he might
like a partner.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.240
Said something to me about
coming out there with him.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.130
And I said, well,
that sounds like fun.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.900
That was 25 years ago, so
I've been there ever since.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.620
And the day I walked in the
door, he gave me $2 million

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.540
to manage.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.200
And the total pot, at the
time, was roughly $50 million.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.110
That was all there was.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:42.870
Today, the total balance
sheet is $20-some billion.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.745
And we mentioned the
four and a half billion--

00:40:45.745 --> 00:40:48.120
that's the equity investment
that we have from actually--

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.744
I'm the Chief Investment
Officer so I'm

00:40:49.744 --> 00:40:51.620
responsible for the
fixed income side.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.740
I'm responsible for
the whole thing,

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.823
which is $20-some billion.

00:40:53.823 --> 00:40:56.497
And that has been grown
largely, organically

00:40:56.497 --> 00:40:58.330
with a couple of
acquisitions along the way.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.640
So it's been a good ride.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.089
That's how I got there.

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:01.880
And you're correct.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.810
One of the beautiful things
about being at Markel

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.090
is it has been a
profitable insurance

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:08.450
company all the way along.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:09.560
I mean, there have
been some years

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.893
where they didn't make profits,
which is normal in years

00:41:11.893 --> 00:41:13.032
of heavy duty catastrophes.

00:41:13.032 --> 00:41:14.740
We're going to lose
a little bit of money

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.070
on the insurance
side but not much.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.130
But more often than not,
the insurance company

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:23.300
has been profitable and has been
putting money into the account.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.010
And then we could apply
those four lenses, those four

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:30.060
disciplines that I spoke of
in selecting equity securities

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.990
and been compounding
value that way.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.930
So for instance the day I
showed up, and the stock was $8,

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.090
and now it's $800.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:43.150
If you do the math, in broad
brush rough terms, roughly half

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.290
of that has come from cumulative
probability of insurance

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.460
operations and half of it has
come from investing that money.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.360
So it's a mutually
supportive sort of deal.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.950
Now connecting that
to you individually,

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.950
the great advantage that
you have individually,

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.160
is that you're
investing your money.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.760
It's your money.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.800
And you don't have
a board of directors

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.199
looking at you or other people.

00:42:08.199 --> 00:42:10.490
I mean, other people might
criticize what you're doing,

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.970
or second-guess
what you're doing,

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.720
but they have no
authority over it.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.540
It's your money.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.320
It's your decision that you get.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.180
And if you live
within your means,

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.790
you have an income of this
and you're spending this,

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.400
you have excess cash flow.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.720
And that excess cash flow,
you get to invest personally.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.800
And you go to invest
it for your own time

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.010
horizon, your own purposes,
for as long as you want.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.590
And that's the
exact same structure

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.610
that I get to live in.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.550
So I don't have
to solicit clients

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.240
that may take their money
away at inopportune times.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.740
And if you look at
the studies which

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.060
talk about the average
return of mutual funds

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.930
over a long period
of time, is x.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.000
The average return of
investors in mutual fund

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.540
is a fraction of that.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.570
Well, why?

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:00.040
It's because when you have
a market that's like this,

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.490
and it's going up,
people put money in.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.320
And when it's down like
this, they take money out.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.470
So whatever the base rates of
return are, by their behavior,

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.980
they make them worse.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.570
And fortunately, in
our company, we're

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.930
structured such that we try to
take that notion of the table.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.017
We're pretty much
always investing.

00:43:21.017 --> 00:43:23.100
Whether the market's doing
this, or this, or this,

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.080
we're just steady pounding
away at it, and compounding.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.520
And you can do the same
thing as an individual,

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.700
if you're living on
less than what you make.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.800
And I think about one of the
great, wise people of all time,

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.900
is Charlie Munger.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.080
And if you think
about his example--

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.550
we all know who
Charlie Munger is now.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:45.740
He's 92 years old-- and think
about sort of his whole life.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:50.980
And he started out as smart
as anybody you'll ever know.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.990
He was an attorney.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.080
I think he had seven
children if memory serves.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.413
They all went to private school.

00:43:55.413 --> 00:43:57.850
That's a lot of overhead.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.700
So I suspect, given a very
pleasant, personal lifestyle,

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.780
Carlie Munger was not
a billionaire when he

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.490
was 30 years old, or 25 or 35.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:12.510
But cumulatively, Charlie
Munger always, somehow

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:14.450
or another, lived
on less than what

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.120
he earned, so he
was creating cash

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.010
flow that he was able to invest.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:24.180
And intrinsically, and
talking about John Wooden

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.070
and having an internal
versus an external scorecard,

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:31.470
Charlie Munger didn't care what
other people thought of him.

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.189
Still doesn't.

00:44:32.189 --> 00:44:33.230
Didn't then, doesn't now.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.420
So as a consequence, just think
about this from a definition

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.690
point of view.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:44.320
If you are living on less
than what you are making,

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.300
you are Rich.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:47.870
Period.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.100
Paragraph.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.730
I'm not saying that
in a relative term

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.840
to what other people might
be making or not making.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.636
Compared to your needs, compared
to what you're able to do,

00:44:56.636 --> 00:44:58.510
you are rich, because
there's a margin there.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:03.650
You have more than what you
need, by virtue of choices

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.930
that you have made.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.685
Well, if you keep
doing that, and you're

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:10.790
as smart as Charlie
Munger or at least

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.221
you're smart enough to know
that he is a wise person

00:45:14.221 --> 00:45:16.470
and you should try to be as
much like him as possible.

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:20.310
Well that gap, every year,
of positive cash flow,

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:23.840
investing, making a
positive return, over time,

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.450
begins to compound.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:28.760
And if you graph it on
a piece of-- not a log

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.220
graph, but a regular
graph-- it'll

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.560
hockey stick somewhere
along the way.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.030
So live on less than what you
make , invest it reasonably,

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.170
and live a long time.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.310
It's a formula that
can't not work.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.599
And your kind enough.

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:47.390
I'll just tell you one
more personal story.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.102
So I remember as a
kid, one of the things

00:45:50.102 --> 00:45:51.810
that kind of got me
hooked on this notion

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.700
of compound interest
and compound returns.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.530
And I can remember this
vividly, even today.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.630
So there was this commercial.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.966
And it was about
savings and loans.

00:46:01.966 --> 00:46:04.340
which hardly even exist anymore.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.220
And it was this
picture where you only

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.200
got to see this
shot from here down.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.410
So you would only see this hand.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.640
And so there was this
hand and it had $50 bills.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.620
And it was pointing out,
if you put $50 a month

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.095
into your savings account
and it showed this pile being

00:46:23.095 --> 00:46:25.220
created with people putting
these $50 bills on it--

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.570
it was growing.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.680
After seven years
or whatever, you'll

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.780
be able to take out
$50 a month forever.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.840
And the pile you were
taking it away from

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.489
was bigger than the pile
that you started with.

00:46:39.489 --> 00:46:41.280
I might have been seven
or eight years old,

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.510
but a light bulb went off
for me about just the notion

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:48.990
of compound interest
and what compound meant

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.450
in a gut, visceral sense.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:55.848
I want to figure
something out about that.

00:46:55.848 --> 00:46:58.280
That seems pretty cool.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.905
As an individual,
structurally, as long

00:47:00.905 --> 00:47:02.280
as you can live
on less than what

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.660
you make, you have
every advantage of what

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.910
Berkshire has, what Markel has.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:12.380
There is no better structure
where the odds of success

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.220
are higher.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.700
Now again, this
company stands as

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.890
testament-- There are certain
times when something happens

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.180
that just is out of the blue.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.300
And I call that catching
lightning in a jar.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.740
And that's what Google did.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.700
And that's what gets done
around this part of the world

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.110
on a regular basis.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:34.720
But catching lightning in a
jar, that's really hard to do

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.860
and that's really hard
to repeat, and to make

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.181
that process consistent
year after year after year

00:47:42.181 --> 00:47:44.430
after year, which is much
of the challenge, I suspect,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.471
when you go back to work.

00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:47.970
That you're tasked with
it, how to catch some more

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:48.750
lightning in jars.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:51.840
That's hard to do.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.550
AUDIENCE: Hi, so
my question relates

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:57.070
to companies that are
staying private for longer

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:58.360
than it used to be.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.410
Like, for example,
Uber is worth,

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.320
$40 billion or $50
billion in market

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.450
cap and it's still private.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.610
And like, Airbnb is worth
more than $10 billion.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.070
It's private as well.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:13.110
So are you worried about missing
this huge compounding time

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:14.180
period?

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.950
Well, as an example,
and I saw that number

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.550
the other day,
that said roughly,

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.160
that the market value in
the private last round

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.110
of fund-raising for
Uber was $50 billion.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.880
Also FedEx, the market cap at
that particular point in time,

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.030
was $51 billion dollars.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:36.930
So the net market value
of both those institutions

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:40.910
is roughly-- let's
call it the same.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:45.470
I'm not sure which one would
be a better investment.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:47.530
I really am not.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:52.110
So the notion that those two
are importing to be the same,

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:56.050
the FedEx number is a harder,
more document-able number,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.800
because if you wanted to
pull out $5 billion of value

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.510
from FedEx right now, you could
do it on the floor of the New

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:03.910
York Stock Exchange.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:09.360
The Uber valuation is within
the context of private markets,

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.990
and what people are
saying it's worth,

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.156
and what people are funding.

00:49:12.156 --> 00:49:16.860
But if you owned $5
billion reportedly of Uber,

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:21.300
that is not as liquid as what
$5 of what FedEx would be.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:26.340
So let's have some nuanced
judgment about the fact those

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.970
are on top of one another.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.220
I missed your question a
little bit in the sense that,

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:34.530
OK, so the fact that an
Uber can come into being

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.800
and get to $50 billion
without us as the public ever

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.989
having had a chance at it?

00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:42.280
Does that mean that there
won't be other things that we

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.661
as public participants do have?

00:49:44.661 --> 00:49:45.160
No.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.090
I mean, there will
be other things.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:51.860
So we didn't get Uber as just
public market participants,

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.510
but there are other
things, and by the way,

00:49:55.510 --> 00:50:01.320
you don't need to
catch an Uber, which

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.800
comes from nowhere
within a period of what,

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.550
less than a decade.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:08.200
is thought to have
that sort of valuation.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.720
FedEx, by contrast, I
think that started what,

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.530
in the '60s or
'70s, so that's been

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.410
40 or 50 years in business.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:20.890
Well, anywhere along the line
that you decided to buy FedEx,

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.840
if you'd hung in
there with it, you've

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.700
probably earned a
reasonably good return

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.410
and you've compounded
it over a longer time.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.320
And going forward, with
the world growing as it

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.385
is and packages moving around.

00:50:35.385 --> 00:50:37.260
I mean, I know there
are alternative delivery

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.885
systems, Uber being
one of them, trying

00:50:38.885 --> 00:50:43.680
to be one of them-- I
would be willing to bet you

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.570
a beer anyway, that 10
years from now, FedEx

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:53.140
is still a pretty dramatically
important and profitable

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.050
and good earning sort of thing.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.800
And again, it's
not right or wrong.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.740
It's just knowing
who you are and how

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.380
you do things and things
that resonate with you.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:09.860
I am very content and
happy, delighted, thrilled,

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.090
to compound my money
at reasonable rates

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:16.590
with something like FedEx,
and not bemoan the fact

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.220
or have angst or be
stirred up about the fact

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.910
that I didn't get
to invest in Uber.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:22.804
It's OK.

00:51:22.804 --> 00:51:23.720
I know how to do this.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.490
I don't know how to do that.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.247
So do what you do.

00:51:27.247 --> 00:51:29.090
AUDIENCE: The numbers
make Uber a good one.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:35.450
The question is about you
learning from the greatest

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:38.260
investments you did not make.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.030
How do you go for that process?

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.362
And how do you decide
that there is no learning

00:51:43.362 --> 00:51:45.320
to be made, even if you
can make an investment?

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.570
Or how do you recognize
the importance traits?

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:53.410
TOM GAYNER: Believe me, when
you didn't buy Berkshire

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:58.090
at $384 a share, like I did,
you think about that every day

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.950
for the rest of your life.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.490
And I have my partner Steve
Markel to thank for the fact

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:07.660
that by the time I joined
Markel, it was $5750,

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.450
and then I did.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:11.240
But it was because
Steve twisted my arm.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.510
To say, you idiot,
go ahead and buy it.

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:15.910
Kind of like Jerry
Newman, helped

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:17.590
Ben Graham get over
the hump with Geico,

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:22.110
which just wasn't the way
he was wired at the time.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.570
It'll happen to you,
and when it does,

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:29.220
you will know that lesson every
day for the rest of your life.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.410
AUDIENCE: Do you keep
track of companies

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.993
that you're not
investing in, but they

00:52:32.993 --> 00:52:35.880
were close to your
investments [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.410
or something where you did
not make an investment,

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.826
and do you revisit them after
a year, after five years.

00:52:40.826 --> 00:52:41.700
Is that how it works?

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.285
TOM GAYNER: Yes, Not as formally
as what you might think.

00:52:44.285 --> 00:52:46.410
But I don't think you need
to be formal about that.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.300
I think if you're
paying attention,

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.610
if you're involved in
the financial markets,

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:52.610
and you're reading every
day and you're thinking

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:55.970
and you're exposed, you
know what's going on.

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:58.737
And in fact, here's
one change that I made.

00:52:58.737 --> 00:53:01.070
When I started out in the
investing business in the Wall

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:02.153
Street Journal, every day.

00:53:02.153 --> 00:53:03.660
And they still do
this every day.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:08.280
They have a list of stocks
that are making a new high

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.010
and they have a list of stocks
that are making a new low.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.550
And when I started out in
the business every day,

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.800
I looked first at
the new low list.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.590
I think, what's on sale?

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.595
What can we get a deal on here?

00:53:20.595 --> 00:53:22.720
And I really didn't even
look at the new high list,

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.840
because I figured
if I own something

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.099
and it was making a
new high, I knew that.

00:53:27.099 --> 00:53:29.140
I didn't need it to be on
a list to tell me that.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.930
I knew it, because
I'd already owned it.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:35.140
These days, I look
at the new high list

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.930
first, and then
the new low list,

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.580
because if there's something
on the new high list,

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:41.580
there might be a reason.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.570
There might be a good reason.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:47.740
And if I don't own it, and
I see it making a new high,

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.430
I'm more inclined
to look at that

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:53.390
and say, what does the market
know that I don't know?

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.930
And is this a
really good company?

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.530
And is what they're
doing likely to make it

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:00.280
such that next year and the
year after that, and five

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.090
years from that, and
10 years after that,

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:05.640
they'd be more likely to be
making new highs than new lows.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.110
It's a very gross
distinction, but I

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.325
found to be tremendously
effective in pushing me

00:54:11.325 --> 00:54:14.010
more towards better quality
companies and better

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.450
investments that
compound over time.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:20.655
As Charlie Munger said,
time is the friend

00:54:20.655 --> 00:54:23.740
of a wonderful business and the
enemy of a mediocre business.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.910
And that was one
technique, that I

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:28.700
used to help find
good businesses

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.015
and wonderful businesses rather
than mediocre businesses.

00:54:32.015 --> 00:54:34.390
AUDIENCE: How does Google do
according to your investment

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:35.050
criteria.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.705
So all of us are
pretty exposed to it.

00:54:37.705 --> 00:54:39.930
A lot of us get
stock vesting, so I'm

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:41.640
interested to hear your opinion.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.300
TOM GAYNER: And tell
me your question again.

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.380
AUDIENCE: How does Google do
according to your investing

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.320
criteria.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.050
TOM GAYNER: Well.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:50.260
AUDIENCE: Be candid.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.717
TOM GAYNER: I own some Google.

00:54:51.717 --> 00:54:53.800
And I don't own a lot and
it's one of those things

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.590
that I feel that I've missed,
and I feel stupid about that,

00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:59.140
because you know, I use it.

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.780
I'm on Google 20 times a day.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.570
And how could I
have missed this?

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.610
And the thing that was the
most challenging for me,

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.050
and remains the most
challenging to me

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:15.220
is and how the compensation
at senior levels works,

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:20.797
and what this company intends to
accomplish for its shareholders

00:55:20.797 --> 00:55:22.880
at the same time that
they're trying to accomplish

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.220
these things in the world.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.360
And I don't know
the answer to that.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.450
And I'm not I'm not
skilled at discerning that.

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:32.560
I'm not a good investor
in this part of the world.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.722
It doesn't match up to
my skill set as well,

00:55:35.722 --> 00:55:36.930
and I'm trying to get better.

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.610
It's one of those things
that I'm trying to learn.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.651
And that's one of the fun
things about investing,

00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:44.860
is things you don't know you
should learn something about.

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.990
So it's not boring.

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:48.910
It's not like I learned
something when I was in school

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.840
and now I'm done.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.619
It's a nice life challenge.

00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:56.910
Like I said, I own some up
Google, and a friend of mine

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:58.557
has an expression--
they call it when

00:55:58.557 --> 00:56:00.640
they buy a little bit of
something and I do this--

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.070
they're buying a library card.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:05.800
So one of the reasons
I buy some of something

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.280
is to make myself think
more deeply about it

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.507
and read the reports and just
be more aware of something.

00:56:12.507 --> 00:56:14.840
It's like if you're-- and
[INAUDIBLE] and I were talking

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.240
about sports and you were
talking about American sports

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:17.739
and whatnot.

00:56:17.739 --> 00:56:20.260
And I hadn't thought of
this until just now-- I'm

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.320
trying to sort of connect
with the culture of sports,

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.380
if you didn't grow
up playing in sports.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.840
Well I know, immediately, if
I was going to go to India,

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.040
and live there, and
there was cricket,

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.880
that was this national sport
that everybody was consumed by,

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.550
but I didn't know
a thing about it.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:41.590
What I would do is bet
money on a cricket match.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.550
And it's just kind
of way I'm wired,

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.506
because if I put $20
down on something.

00:56:45.506 --> 00:56:47.880
Well, I'm going to know who
the players are, who's better

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.970
and what their records were,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.160
So I do that sometimes.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.300
I will buy positions
in stock to make

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.800
myself think about
it in the same

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.800
that I'll bet $20
on a ball game,

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.510
just so I have some rooting
interest when the Oakland

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.660
Raiders play the
Tennessee Titans.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:07.576
I don't care who wins that,
but if I'm having a party

00:57:07.576 --> 00:57:08.950
and we drink a
few beers and I'll

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.260
bet $20 on one side or the other
just so that I'll have somebody

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.610
to root for.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:14.930
And do a little work on it.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:19.070
AUDIENCE: In the analogy to
Berkshire Hathaway and Warren

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:22.720
Buffett, do you think
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.660
grows, if you like the size.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:30.160
Would it be like a barrier of
[INAUDIBLE] for investment.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.860
For example, the last thing
[INAUDIBLE] acquisition

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.110
you can have, and you
have a lot of fixed income

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:40.510
right now, so if you're
gonna increase your equity

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:44.042
investment to the level
you had before, then there

00:57:44.042 --> 00:57:47.340
would be a lot of investment
you'd need to make,

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:51.575
so do you think size
eventually becomes a problem?

00:57:51.575 --> 00:57:55.220
Not a problem, but like
a factor consideration?

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.615
TOM GAYNER: I will try as hard
as I possibly know how to,

00:57:57.615 --> 00:58:01.152
to make that a problem for us.

00:58:01.152 --> 00:58:02.610
Yeah, so we're
talking about that's

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.276
our goal to have those
kind of problems,

00:58:04.276 --> 00:58:07.130
because that means things will
have gone very, very well.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:09.070
And that's a very high
class problem to have,

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.614
to try to figure out how to
invest the flows of capital

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:13.780
that are coming in the door.

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:17.450
So we started out with a little
bit, it has grown to more,

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.800
and we will try to
make it grow to more.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.990
So we're faced with trying
to handle that problem.

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:27.030
SPEAKER: So with that, thank
you so much for coming here.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:29.280
It's been a pleasure
to listen to you.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.340
And we hope to have
you visit again soon.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.140
TOM GAYNER: Thank you very much.
