00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, as always, I'm going to try this a little more simply.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's my lawnmower, the weight, the normal force, and the push force that comes in like this.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But that's not how I would like to draw my forces.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'd like to draw them coming from the object, not going into it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm going to draw like this and it has a value of 20 N.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to break that into a parallel component and a perpendicular one,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then I'm going to remember that this angle here is 60°.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, I know that this is my equation for work and Δx, I know is 150 m.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, I just need to know F parallel.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, looking at this right triangle here, I can see F parallel at the adjacent side

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and carrying out the math, I find F parallel is 10 N, multiplying this by 150 m,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I get total work of 1500 J. You got this? Very good.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's go back to our man, moving water along the dike to see exactly what was going on.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So in this case, the man was lifting upwards with some force,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but the direction of motion is this way.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Actually, let me just extend this arrow, so that we can see this is a right angle.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When our vectors are perpendicular in this way, no component of force,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
whatever will be parallel to Δx.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In fact, whenever the force is perpendicular to the displacement of the Δx, no work is done.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
One thing we haven't thought about,

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is what happens when the force is in the opposite direction of the displacement?
