00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.140
One of the great pleasures of relationships is the sense that another person knows us deeply.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.900
While we are either ignored or misrepresented by most of the world,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.280
in our relationships we can thrive from a gratifying sense that out identity has been accurately

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.520
tracked, drawn, and committed to memory.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.740
They know our favourite foods, our childhood traumas,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.440
our quirks around travel, our morning habits, and our ambivalent feelings about certain friends.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.720
But it is the extent and overall accuracy of this knowledge

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.300
that can provoke sudden moments of claustrophobic irritation

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.200
when our partners use their privileged overview of our characters to level a claim about who we are

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.640
that seems to reduce, caricature, or limit us unduly,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.760
and is blind to our evolutions and aspirations for change.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.340
"Don't be silly! You're not someone who ever enjoys holidays." they might assert with the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.660
confidence and authority of someone who's shared our bed for close to a decade,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.580
or they might say "That's far too late for you.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.480
You're always asleep by ten."

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.480
or, "You've never liked dancing.",

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.900
or, with real surprise when we come back from the library, "But you don't even like books about politics!",

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.980
or, to the attendant at the deli counter, "No, no, no. They don't like pickles."

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.680
The comments and the sure manner of their delivery reflect an experience of us built up over time

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.960
through the patient work of love

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.180
but they can also prove wholly enraging.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.820
It feels as if the authority that the lover possesses has malignly been deployed to fix us into a role

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.020
that actually no longer feels quite true.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.940
They're telling us who we are, the nicest thing in theory,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.320
but getting it rather wrong, which is the about worst thing in practice.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.600
Though a particular trait might admittedly have existed for many years,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.760
we may, beneath the surface, quietly be attempting to change.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.180
We are tentatively trying to evolve.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.240
We no longer want to remain who we once were in every detail.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.240
We have new, original, aspirations.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.240
We want to shed our skins.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.160
We're trying to open ourselves up to different experiences.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.220
We maybe want to give pickles a go.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.360
And yet the partner has set themselves up as the jealous guardian of a self we no longer quite identify with.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.040
They insist that who we are now claiming to be must be false, pretentious, mean spirited

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.940
or an attempt to hoodwink others,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.780
all because it isn't who we have traditionally been.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.560
It's clear that, alongside physical development, we are all engaged in a lifelong process of physiological evolution

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.300
which is far harder to spot, to discuss, and give room for in others.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.720
Because we look more or less the same from the outside

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.020
those around us naturally assume that we must remain, more or less, the same on the inside too.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.020
Yet we are continually on the way to discovering new sides of ourselves.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.000
We're shedding allegiances, stretching ourselves in unfamiliar directions,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.340
and clearing out irrelevant positions and enthusiasms.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.620
Perhaps we're gaining a new zone of confidence at work,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.440
or we're getting more cautious and circumspect where we were once rather reckless.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.780
We might be discovering the beginnings of a new kind of passion for the arts

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.720
where we used to be quite judgemental,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.060
or perhaps we're firming up certain opinions around money or politics.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.780
These changes may not yet be very clear, even to us;

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.300
there are no birthdays to mark them, or public occasions to lend them weight.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.040
We can't easily explain them to our partner and may not be too sure how to make them plausible.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.980
And yet the changes matter to us hugely.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.620
They are, in a way the most important things going on in our inner lives right now

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.840
and we are therefore acutely sensitive to anyone who might sweep away, or with a mocking laugh

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.540
destroy the tentative foundations of our future selves.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.700
Children show us most clearly the passions unleashed

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.040
when another person holds us too tightly to an earlier version of ourselves.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.220
At a party a parent might explain of her child "Oh, he's five."

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.920
Only to find the child approaching them a moment later and protesting in an intense angry whisper,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.120
"That's not true at all! I'm five and three quarters next Tuesday."

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.900
Giving due weight to our evolutions, be they bodily or emotional, can matter an awful lot.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.200
That's why we can find ourselves in such intense arguments when a partner makes a remark that

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.780
would have interested the person we used to be back in the spring,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.640
or they make a criticism which could have been very true of our outlook at Christmas,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.680
or buys a jacket we would have loved three summers ago.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.600
What rankles is the static picture of who we are that's implied in what our partner has done

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.820
and that defends the part of us that associates intimacy with being given the space to evolve.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.940
Despite their love out partner hasn't kept pace with our growth.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.460
They failed to be sympathetic to the impulse for change.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.860
They are fixing us too tightly to a portrait that, though it was once satisfying, is truly no longer accurate.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.300
The partner isn't being mean.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.180
Change is frightening because the one evolution we're all terrified of

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.440
is the kind that will take our beloveds away from us.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.840
The reason we get stubborn about a new love of pickles may be that it stands as an awful harbinger of

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.600
what might be a new love for, say, another person.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.240
The ideal solution would be to develop a view of the essential normality

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.980
and unthreatening nature of growth.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.960
We will all, over a long term relationship, be growing in a range of ways

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.440
which can undermine any settled claim by one person to 'know' the other.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.440
What we grasp of our partner can only ever be partial an temporary and we shouldn't grow

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.100
jealous or angry on that score alone.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.520
We're not like books, written once and shelved in a static library.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.720
We are like continuously updated, edited, and expanded online texts,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.760
where a core set of themes is daily enriched and nuanced live before our eyes.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.000
True love requires us to allow our partner to become someone rather different than they were

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.200
when we met them

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.540
and to welcome their evolutions, rather than use the portrait we painted of them at the start,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.300
as the fixed reference point from which any deviation has to be considered a disloyalty.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.000
The creature who emerges from they chrysalis is likely to love us more intelligently and deeply

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.980
as they are to want to fly away to someone new.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.580
We should use the phrase "I don't really understand you anymore." not as a despairing exclamation,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.620
but as a hopeful call to renew our sources of intimate insight.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.780
It's common to accuse long term relationships of being a bit boring,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.640
but our tendency to evolve offers us a way out of the limitations of monogamy.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.660
We are, if we are correctly attuned to the phenomenon, only ever with one person for a very short time.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:14.180
In truth we cohabit with a constantly shifting array of people who just happen to have the same name,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.480
and inhabit more or less the same body, and lie next to us in similar ways in bed,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.580
yet, beyond these common points, such are the differences they may really just as well

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.700
sometimes be wholly new people.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:35.100
We can, in one relationship, without drama, enjoy an array of new lovers, embracing all the different versions

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.880
of the one person we are with.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:47.760
