00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.410
JAMES CLEWITT: I think this is
going to be a really exciting

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.710
video, because today we are
going to generate some random

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.920
numbers with strontium-90--

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.840
radioactive strontium-90.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.030
I find all of this quite
unnerving because this stuff

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.550
is dangerous.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.900
You have to really respect it.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.430
It will hurt you.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.680
Let's do it.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.410
You've asked me to generate
for you a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.870
random number, right?

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.850
And I want to throw that
straight back at you.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.299
I want to play a
game, actually.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.580
What I want you to do-- all of
you, everybody, all right?

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.090
You watching?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.910
Everybody, I want you to clear
your head for a moment and I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.530
want you to think of a random
number from 1 to 10.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.090
Got it?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.970
OK.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
BRADY HARAN: Choose a number
between 1 and 10.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.680
MALE SPEAKER: Do
I tell you it?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.180
OK.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.128
I'll choose 6.

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:50.076
MALE SPEAKER: 7.

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:52.446
BRADY HARAN: Choose a number
between 1 and 10.

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:52.920
MALE SPEAKER: 7

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.868
MALE SPEAKER: 9.

00:00:53.868 --> 00:00:54.342
MALE SPEAKER: 7.

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:56.290
7 is more likely to be chosen.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.570
And I'm annoyed.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.600
JAMES CLEWITT: I'm learning
that very quickly.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.820
MALE SPEAKER: I'm annoyed that
I picked 7, actually.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.320
JAMES CLEWITT: 45% of you are
going to have said 7.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.190
BRADY HARAN: Choose and
then tell me a number

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.784
between 1 and 10.

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:11.608
JAMES CLEWITT: 7.

00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:12.020
7.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.080
Everybody says 7.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.670
Obviously, you're not going to
choose 1 or 10, because that's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.170
not very random.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.220
You're not going to choose an
even number, because they

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.450
don't sound particularly
random, either.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300
And you're not going to go for
5, because 5's in the middle.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.900
Hell, that's not random.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450
So you probably want
a prime number.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.030
So 9's out.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.790
3 is too small.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.870
3 is like you're not trying.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.650
You haven't worked hard
enough to get to it.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.330
So what are you left with?

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.220
You're left with 7.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.250
So everybody chooses 7.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.900
So is there something innately
random about the number 7?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.810
No, of course not.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.850
That's ridiculous.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.830
There's nothing random
about any number.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.330
If I said to you pick a random
number, and you said 5, how do

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.250
I know that's random?

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.810
If I ask you do it again and you
came up with 5 again and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.240
again and again, clearly, that's
not a random number.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.590
The property that makes a number
random isn't in the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.130
number itself, but it's in
the sequence of numbers.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.640
Any individual number
isn't random.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.490
1--

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.160
is the number 1 random?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.229
It entirely depends on
the context, right?

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.290
Just 1 on its own-- there's
nothing random about that.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.120
But if I have 1, 5, 2,
8, 7, 4, is 1 random?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.740
Yes, 1 is a random part
of that sequence.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.770
Or at least, it's as random as
the human mind can make it,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.800
which, as we've just seen from
my little game, isn't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.460
particularly random at all.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.750
As a scientist, I model gases.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.280
And as a part of modeling gases,
I need to give them a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.860
random kick to get them started
so that I don't model

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.340
an identical gas every time.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.130
I can't go through and give each
molecule a random value

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.310
from my own mind.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.043
I use a computer to choose
my random numbers.

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:52.620
And it's spectacularly
bad at doing that.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.660
There's no chance of getting
a computer to generate a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.120
completely random sequence.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.690
It's not a random machine.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.290
We have to generate a sequence
of numbers which look and feel

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.765
random to us.

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:05.880
But they're not random.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.670
If we look closely enough,
we're always

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.790
going to find patterns.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.840
So the easiest way to go
about doing this-- can

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.510
I write this down?

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.390
Let me write this
down for you.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.590
BRADY HARAN: Please.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.190
JAMES CLEWITT: Typically, the
way that a computer engineer

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.090
is going to go about generating
a sequence of

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.340
random numbers for you is
to think of a number.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.610
And we'll just call that number
x0, our first number in

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.640
the sequence, or our zeroth
number in the sequence.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.470
And we're going to multiply that
number by something big,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.050
something that feels random.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.770
And we're going to call that,
rather unimpressively a.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.460
Typically, it's going to be
something of the order of tens

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.230
of thousands.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.280
At this point, there's
absolutely nothing random

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.480
about this whatsoever.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.210
Then I'm going to take another
big prime number in the tens

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.510
of thousands and we're
going to add it on.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.515
And with a spectacular lack
of imagination, I'm going

00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:51.650
to call that b.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.870
Still not random.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.270
I know it's not random.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.340
The next step is probably the
only complicated bit.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.025
I'm going to take the number
that we've just got and I'm

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.790
going do a modulus-- which we
normally define as just being

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.150
a percent sign--

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.980
m.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.170
And this is a cyclic division.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.110
So essentially, it's the
remainder of a divide.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.709
So if I were, for example, to
use m of 8, if I do a cyclic

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.149
division of 64 divided
by 8, I get 0.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.920
If I use 66 divided by 8,
I'm going to get 2.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.390
It's the remainder
of that division.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.000
BRADY HARAN: So you make this
big number and then you do

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.130
that process to it using
this number?

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.710
JAMES CLEWITT: Correct.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.780
BRADY HARAN: So you must
still get the same

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.470
number every time.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.500
JAMES CLEWITT: You still get
the same number absolutely

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.250
every time.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.640
And the answer-- we're
going to need an

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.920
equals sign in here.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.460
What we get out of here is the
next number in a sequence--

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.760
x1.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.890
Then I'm going to take x1 and
I'm going to feed it back in.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.650
And we're going to use
that to generate x2.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.120
And then I'm going to feed that
back and generate x3.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.600
So I get the sequence of numbers
that feel like they

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.280
might be random.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.430
If I were to start with x of
0, then I'm always going to

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.820
get an identical sequence.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.160
So if I'm going to write a piece
of software where I want

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.870
a random sequence, I need the
value of x0 to be different

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.510
every time.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.940
If I kick my computer off again,
I need it to be in a

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.080
different state to start with.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.450
And the most obvious way of
doing that, and the way I do

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.290
that, is I simply
use the time.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.780
I use the number of merely
seconds since January

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.080
[? 1970. ?]

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.290
And then I'm going to
feed that into x0.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.850
And then x1's different.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.110
x2's different.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.090
x3's different.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.900
But--

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.020
and this is the important
thing--

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.450
because this is a cyclic
division, it's going to

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.510
eventually repeat.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.850
And depending on which numbers
you choose for a and b and n,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.050
it'll repeat sooner
rather than later.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.000
You're going to get
cyclic patterns

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.040
in your random numbers.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.560
Now, we don't call these
random numbers.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.650
We call these pseudorandom
numbers because

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.650
they're kind of random.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.450
They're not really random.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.860
We can do better than
that, though, right?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.110
OK.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.410
So if you asked me to generate
a random number-- let's go

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.580
back to the game we played
at the start.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.490
And I'm going to say, let's
generate a random number, this

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.590
time between 1 and 6.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.380
There's a really obvious
way of doing that.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.550
I brought a die with me.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.310
We throw it and we generate
a random number.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.810
And each of those numbers, 1 to
6, has the same probability

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.530
of coming up.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.540
But that's not always true.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.910
What if I want to generate a
number between 1 and 12?

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.290
Let me get another die.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.100
First of all, I can't generate
a 1 with two dice.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.760
I recognize that.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.655
So it's going to be a number
between 2 and 12.

00:06:36.655 --> 00:06:37.540
We throw that.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.610
We get 6.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.230
There are many, many more ways
to throw a 7 than there

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.480
are to throw a 2.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.810
There's only one way
I can throw a 2.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.910
I've got to throw double 1.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.280
If I want to throw a 12, I've
got to throw double 6.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.430
But I can throw 7 with a 3 and
4 or a 4 and 3 or a 5 and a 2

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.220
or a 6 and 1.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.630
There's loads of ways
to do that.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.660
So you're far more likely.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.860
Let me draw this for you.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.510
For one die, this probability
is the same, and it's 1/6.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.670
But for two dice, then you're
going to get a probability

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.450
which is quite sharply peaked.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.850
What if I brought
more dice out?

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.510
I'll just throw three for now.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.810
So now, we're throwing--

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.940
that's random, right?

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.320
BRADY HARAN: Well done.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.450
Almost a yahtzee.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.650
JAMES CLEWITT: So now, I'm going
to throw three dice.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.320
And what we find is that we
get a similar plot, but it

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.430
starts to curve over
like this.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.435
So we can go from 3 up
to [? 18 ?] now.

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:36.370
What we're starting to produce
is a thing called a Gaussian

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.180
distribution, a normal
distribution.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.220
It's called normal because
almost everything

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.860
in nature does this.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.260
If there's some probability
distribution which is based on

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.520
dice or based on the probability
of the behavior of

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.430
lots of things which are
behaving identically, then you

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.640
get a Gaussian distribution.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.530
So it's absolutely everywhere.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.910
And a Gaussian distribution
has a shape which

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.080
looks a bit like this.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.480
And it's very sharply peaked.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.350
You're very, very likely to
get this average value.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.180
But it's still completely
random.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.510
I can't tell you what value
I'm going to get.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.330
All I can tell you is the
probability of that value.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.790
You don't want to hear about
the ancient Greeks, do you?

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.530
We've thrown two.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.640
We've thrown three.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.250
Now, I've brought, frankly,
every die I own.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.710
And we're going to
throw many dice.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.600
And when we throw many, some of
them go on the floor, but

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.830
what we end up with is this
Gaussian distribution.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.610
The probability of the number
that we're going to get is the

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.710
Gaussian distribution.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.090
So what most people think of as
a random number is actually

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.850
a uniform deviate, which
basically means that every

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.520
number in the sequence has got
the same chance of coming up.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.550
But that doesn't
make it random.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.140
What makes it random is that you
can choose any number in

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.620
the sequence.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.340
It doesn't matter what the
probability of that choice is.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.970
So you may be very, very likely
to choose the number in

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.260
the middle.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.790
But that doesn't mean that it's
not randomly possible for

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.650
you to choose any
number at all.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.100
BRADY HARAN: So it's like if you
and I had a weightlifting

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.390
competition.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.760
The result will be random, but
you're probably going to win.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.570
JAMES CLEWITT: That's
not random.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.990
No, you misunderstand.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.130
I'm going to win that one.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.330
You've asked me to give
you a random number.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.740
And I really want to.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.670
So I've gone out of my way and
I've gone to the safe and I've

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.300
got something that's going to
create a random number,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.670
because here, I've got a small
radioactive source.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.380
It's strontium-90.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.930
And it is going to randomly
give out electrons.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.690
As a neutron turns into a
proton, then out comes a

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.600
high-energy electron
from the strontium.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.680
And so coming into the Geiger
counter here, I'm getting just

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.350
as a steady stream
of electrons.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.850
And I'm counting them.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.110
And the number that I count--

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.180
surprise, surprise--
is Gaussian.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.000
But it's random.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.170
It's completely random.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.010
And so--

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.900
let's turn it on.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.490
Let me just show you.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.370
Can I show you?

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.330
That's the happy sound
of radiation.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.270
So you can hear it, but
you can see it, too.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.320
Here it is.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.990
Here are the individual
pulses.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.070
Each one of these flashing
on here--

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.180
that's an electron going into
the Geiger counter, which is

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.570
pretty cool.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.335
So I've written you're a
small computer program.

00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:21.050
I hope it works.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.780
The number you're going to
get is the deviation

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.900
from the mean value.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.410
So I know what the mean value
for the count is going to be.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.190
And I'm giving you the
difference between that value

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.800
and the number we
actually count.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.050
Here we go.

00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:41.340
[LAUGHING]

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.730
Well, I was expecting it
to be a little more

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.450
dramatic than that.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.630
What that means is we've got
exactly the mean value.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.180
So that is the most
likely outcome.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.080
And yet somehow I didn't
expect that that

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.680
was going to be it.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.340
Shall we try again?

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.100
We're generating another
random number.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.910
And to be honest, I really
want it to be 7.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.205
So this is it counting.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.570
13--

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.790
it's prime.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.820
How much more random
do you want to be?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.595
That is a spectacularly
random number.

00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:13.580
It's 13.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.830
Brilliant.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.800
BRADY HARAN: So if you enjoyed
this video, I've got some good

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.620
news for you.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.690
We're actually starting a new
channel a bit like Numberphile

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.840
but all about computers.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.080
It's something a lot of
you have asked about.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.710
That channel's going to be
launching properly in May, but

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.410
we've started it now
and you can go and

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.820
have a look and subscribe.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.730
I'll put a link on the screen
underneath the video and in

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.900
the video description, all
that sort of thing.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.700
Have a look, and we hope
to see you there, too.
