00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.100
Martin Heidegger is one of the world's most
famous and important philosophers.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.500
Born in Germany in 1889, he grew to worldwide fame
with the publication of his great work

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.550
Being and Time in 1927.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.500
Central to Heidegger's thought is his desire
to wake us up to the idea that we are surrounded by death.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.560
He didn’t use that word though,
he preferred the grander term: The Nothing.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.859
In German - Das Nichts. This is inexistence:
the opposite of life.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.660
We live surrounded by it but deny its scary
presence through elaborate means, by hiding

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.350
from the truth that we are so close to death
all the time.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.910
Heidegger called life, Being - “Das Sein”

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.660
Existence or Being is finite, fragile and
very temporary...

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.860
But we rarely appreciate how temporary existence
is.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.460
Much of Heidegger’s philosophy is devoted
to trying to wake us up to the fragility of

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.910
our lives and the strangeness of existing
on this delicate, exhaustible planet spinning

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
in an otherwise seemingly silent, alien and
entirely uninhabited universe.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.289
At certain moments of insight, and Heidegger
wants us to have lots of these, we may think:

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:16.020
I am so small, so temporary, I am a nothing
in a cosmos of lifeless otherness.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.780
It's at moments like this that we feel what
Heidegger called The Mystery of Existence.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
It can be beautiful. It can be intense. Most
of all, it can be terrifying.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.889
We live wisely and philosophically by always
acknowledging our precariousness against

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:33.789
The Nothing.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.189
It isn't just us who are so temporary. It
is all living beings, all living things - the

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.189
animals, the trees, the clouds... They too
exist briefly against the background of Nothingness.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.899
Once we are aware that we and all other living
things share this fragile state, we might

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.270
learn to identify more with them: to recognise
our kinship with all living things and with

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.009
the earth itself. They are like us, briefly
alive against the backdrop of nothingness.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.599
The feeling of the unity of all things might
come to you when, for example, you see how

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.500
much connects us with:

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.800
the quail

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.400
the shrimp

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.420
the snail

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.800
the lamb

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.800
the pig

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.780
the dinosaur

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.710
Normally we separate ourselves from these
others but Heidegger urges us to see the interconnections.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.800
However, Heidegger is very aware of the way
in which we hide from a confrontation with Being

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.280
escaping into the warm folds of daily
life, of society and of what he termed its

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.330
endless 'chatter', “Das Gerede”.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.400
We can imagine Das Gerede as an enormous pancake
like dough layer that smothers connection with Being.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.560
Chatter is everywhere, it comes in via the
airwaves, the media, our social circle

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.810
and it seeks to reassure us that trivia actually
matters, that our jobs count, that what we

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.290
are doing and thinking has importance.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.590
It hides us from the nature of Being in a
world of death.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.430
So the task of philosophy is to remove us
from the doughy comfort of Chatter and introduce

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.410
us systematically to the bracing concept of
Nothingness.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.680
Heidegger wants to free us from the pull of
chatter - so as to focus on the intensity

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.790
of existence.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.210
Someone who lives with an awareness of death,
Heidegger calls 'authentic.'

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.190
This, for example, is an authentic shrimp.
“Eigentlichkeit”.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.500
This is an inauthentic one - “Uneigentlichkeit”

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500
This is an authentic jelly baby.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.430
This is an inauthentic jelly baby.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.990
We know in our hearts that the only way we
can truly appreciate 'das Sein' is to become

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.790
more conscious of 'das Nichts' day-to-day,
and that we owe it to ourselves to escape

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.140
the clutches of 'das Gerede' for the sake
of 'Eigentlichkeit'.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.620
When asked in a lecture in 1961 how we might
recover our authenticity, Heidegger replied

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.000
tersely that we should simply aim to spend
more time ‘in graveyards’.
