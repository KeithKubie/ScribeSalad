00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.610
Is Marijuana “healthier” than cocaine?

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.549
Hi everyone!

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.090
Crystal, your friendly molecular neuroscientist,
here for DNews.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.349
Whenever we read the news, we see new information
about the positive benefits of marijuana and

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.859
more reasons why cocaine is really, really,
bad for you.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.949
Recent studies report cocaine use leading
to everything from tissue damage in your eye,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
to an impaired ability to see the unfavorable
consequences of your actions.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.970
Why is that?

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.070
Is it just a case of one being more “organic”?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.070
No.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.970
No its not.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.430
Cocaine and marijuana come from plants so
I guess they can both be considered “natural

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.430
products”.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.170
But they activate completely different systems
in our brains.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.530
Cocaine is so popular because it is really
great at activating our brain’s “pleasure

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.530
center”.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.750
When our neurons are sent swimming in dopamine
it make us feel really, really good.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.790
For the half hour or hour that the drug is
active in our system, we feel happy, alert,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.910
euphoric, and invincible.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.210
Which is great! except when it causes us to
act irrationally, make self destructive choices,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.710
and the source of that high becomes dangerously
addictive.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.720
Cocaine use is dangerous not just because
the drug is highly addictive, but because,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.190
like methamphetamine, it is a powerful stimulant
that has an effect on our bodies as well as

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.470
our brains.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.390
Cocaine use can lead to an inability to regulate
body temperature and at the right doses, it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.740
interferes with cardiac function leading to
high-blood pressure, arrhythmia, and death.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.800
Cocaine has been used in a medical context
as well.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.110
It is used sparingly as a numbing agent in
nose and mouth surgeries, but that usage can

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.830
hardly be considered therapeutic and its potency
and addictive qualities, not to mention its

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.790
schedule II status as a controlled substance,
make it undesirable as an anaesthetic.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.980
On the other hand, a wealth of research has
been performed revealing the positive health

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.980
benefits of marijuana.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.620
But perhaps the most interesting characteristic
of this controversial plant are its anti-breast

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.630
cancer properties.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.942
There’s been a lot of discussion over “compassionate
use” of marijuana due to reports that it

00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:55.670
helps patients undergoing chemo battle pain
and nausea, and increases their appetite.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930
But quietly published studies are beginning
to reveal that compounds found in cannabis

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.000
may directly inhibit the growth of some breast
cancer cells which is an exciting result for

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
medicine.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.369
Despite its legalization in many states, marijuana
is still listed as a highly controlled substance

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.390
by the US government , a classification that
makes research on this drug challenging to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.630
perform in the US.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.720
Given the current academic literature, I’d
say marijuana wins by a mile in terms of health

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.450
benefits when compared to cocaine, but please
remember the use of the term “healthy”

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.640
is relative! and not only is the composition
of the drug important, how its used, and the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.530
environment it’s used in, is important too.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.010
Lastly, neither I nor DNews condones the illegal
use of drugs so be smart out there and stay

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.010
healthy.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.010
What do you think?

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.230
Could there be health benefits to cocaine?
