00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.363
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.323
&gt;&gt; Letters About Literature
is a special project

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.230
of the Center for the Book.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.090
It's about years old.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.293
I'm about to introduce Cathy
Gourley, who is the coordinator

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.696
of the project and she'll
tell you a little bit

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.690
about how today's project works
and then when we will meet three

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.876
of the winners from the states.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.810
It's a project that from the
beginning has asked young people

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.793
to write to authors about books
that have helped shape their lives

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.850
or helped change the way that
they think about themselves.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.036
And the project had a beginning

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.993
of around 18 years ago
with Cathy and myself.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.726
Cathy has been a consultation
for the Center

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.726
for the Book for many years.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.916
And we started with Read
Magazine where Cathy was an editor

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
and gradually as Cathy will
explain to you the nature of Letters

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.246
About Literature has changed and
it's actually broadened in scope

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.110
and Target has become our primary
sponsor, our major retail sponsor

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.460
and that support has
enabled us to tie Letters

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.076
About Literature to
the state centers.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.913
There are centers for the book
in every state and Letters

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.263
About Literature is a project
that we not only offer to them

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.776
with support from target but
also want them to encourage --

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.523
encourage them to use as a basis

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.826
for reading promotion
throughout the states.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.323
Many of you saw the state
centers who are really

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.556
with the state libraries, dominate
our pavilion of the states.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.196
So this is an example of a project
that is truly national and is one

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.313
of the projects that helps make
really the national testable

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.380
of the book, something
that is truly national.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.343
And so I think it's appropriate
that we conclude this,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.073
the 10th anniversary of the
National Book Festival with hearing

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800
from the young people and delving
right into the heart of one

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.013
of our most popular projects.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.466
I would Cathy Gourely
who is our coordinator

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.810
to say a few words
about the project.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.566
And she can explain to you how
it's changed its educational tone.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.910
Then we will meet the families,
hear from the kids and also hear

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.350
from the authors to whom two of
the letters were written this year.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.643
Cathy. [Applause]

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.043
&gt;&gt; Cathy Gourely: Okay
you've got mail.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.053
That's an understatement for me.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.556
Each year in December the
post office delivers mail bins

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.476
by the dozens filled with
letters and they come from all

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.243
across the country and they
come from children as young as 9

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.950
and 10 years old and seniors
in high school as well.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.410
And these letters are very personal.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.456
They're not writing to me,
but I get to read them.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.353
Letters About Literature started

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.486
out as a program called Books
Changing Lives, but it kind evolved

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.236
into a personal conversation
with an author.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.050
Here's what we do.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.783
We ask kids, we challenge kids,
write a letter to an author,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.376
living or dead, that's okay.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.676
Tell that author how his or her
work somehow changed your view

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.013
of yourself or your world.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.153
We say, "Don't summarize the book."

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.816
Why? The author wrote the book.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.220
So the author knows
what the book is about.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.143
What the author doesn't know
is how the book touched you.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.870
The author doesn't know
what emotions you felt

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.376
when you were reading the book or
what thoughts entered your head

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.570
after you finished reading the book.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.213
Write about that.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080
Read the book.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.946
Get inspired and write back.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.480
Well, our kids do not disappoint us.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.480
This year we received
70,000 letters.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.216
In fact, I learned
new post office lingo.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.576
The mail bins came in a device
called an erk, which is as kind

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.416
of big as a refrigerator
and it's filled up higher

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.776
than my head with bins of mail.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.560
My team and I begin
to open the letters.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.920
We count them.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.010
We log them and then
we begin to read them.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.163
And we eliminated in the first two
rounds of reading, 63,000 letters.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.026
So only 7,000 letters nationally
advance to state competition,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.633
just to advance to
state is a big deal.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.480
So what happens next?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.613
Okay, so the state judges
now read their state letters

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.040
and they choose their state winners.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.730
And we have three state
winners with you here today.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.483
So we've gone from 70,000
to about 7,000 to about 150.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.390
And then those letters go
on to national competition

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.623
and the national winners,
we pick 6, that's all.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.856
So 70,000 to 7,000 to 150 to 6, and
we also pick 12 national honors.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.910
But here's the big deal.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.700
The national honors and the national
winners, they earn in addition

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.786
to cash prizes, they earn a reading
promotion grant for the library.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.373
The 6 national winners each
earn 10,000 dollars for a school

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.606
or a library, but they get
to nominate the school.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.953
And I'm just about done, but
in Anchorage this year, Alaska,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.226
they had their very first
ever national winner.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.430
She was junior in high school.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.830
And what she did was, she did not
nominate her high school library.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.660
She said to us, "I want to give this
money, 10,000 dollars to a school

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.946
that needs it perhaps more
than my high school does."

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.123
And she gave it to
an elementary school

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.690
in Anchorage that was in need.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.293
And that principal didn't know her.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.430
The librarian didn't know her.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.563
So the kids know.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.430
They get it.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.296
And they're very altruistic.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.580
So with that aside, I'm going
to turn this back over to John.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200
He's going to introduce
each of our three winners

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760
that we've invited here today.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.066
They are guest authors and
they're going to read their letters

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.020
and they are going to have
a very unique opportunity

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.686
of meeting their author and having
the author answer their letter

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.870
in person.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.536
&gt;&gt; John: Thank you Cathy.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.403
[Applause] First however I would
like to know if anyone is still here

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.050
from Target, I want to
thank you personally

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.990
for the support that
you've given us.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.256
Let's give Target a hand.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.590


00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.763
[Applause] Target of course is the
major sponsor the Book Festival

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.523
and they have been here today
but when the person we work

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.330
with most closely did not make the
trip to Washington but she knows

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.063
about this and we were
hoping that some

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.330
of the other folks could be here.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.233
But I heard that they also are
packing up now and are on their way

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.960
out but they know that we are here
and they know that we are grateful.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.023
I would like to mention that
I'm going to introduce everyone

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.126
that is going to participate in
this and then it's on with the show.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.226
If you were here you already
know Katherine Paterson.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.400
Katherine is our of
course National Ambassador

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.540
for Young People's Literature.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.556
The award-winning Katherine
Paterson and you are here

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.923
to learn why Katherine is the
National Ambassador if you sat

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.086
through the marvelous session
she gave us earlier today.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.366
She also is the write and producer

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.566
of the Exquisite Corpse
Family Theater in which

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.143
in the first session

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.183
in the children's division we
brought the successful online serial

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.703
story to almost a conclusion.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.863
Only part of it -- the
story is concluded,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:12.356
but next year it's
going to be a book.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.583
So the Exquisite is
never going to end.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.506
And Katherine we're glad of that
and we're glad to have you here.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.913
The second author

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.483
that is participating was here
earlier this afternoon and is

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.076
with us again, Michael Buckley,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.096
who's a former television
producer who's now into the world

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.640
of children's literature
and children's books,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.433
particularly through The
Sisters Grimm and we're going

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.286
to guess what -- have
a letter to Michael

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.406
as the author of Sisters Grimm.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.350
Our three students are with us
today and the first one who is going

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.920
to read is Olivia Marcantonio.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.563
Olivia is actually -- maybe we're
not going to start quite yet.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.386
We're going to wait just a moment.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.253
I'm going to introduce
you and then you're going

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.853
to be up in just a moment.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.256
And Olivia is level one in
the Letters About Literature.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.116
She was 11 when she
wrote this letter.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.956
She's 12 years now and her letter
is written to Jerry Spinelli

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.720
and it describes the book Star Girl.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.273
And Olivia now is with her family
and I know her mother is here

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.880
from Great Falls is that correct.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.813
Our second student -- and
Olivia then is the one

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.716
that represents Virginia.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.116
Our Maryland representative
who since has moved

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.113
to Virginia I learned
today is Claire Wang

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.273
and Claire is level two,
which is grade 7 and 8.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.926
Claire wrote this letter.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.726
I think you're 14 now?

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.320
Tell me, correct me please.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880
You're 14 now.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880
Okay thank you.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.246
And she wrote to Katherine
Paterson and her letter is

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.046
about the Bridge to Terabithia.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.826
And we are very pleased
to have Claire here.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.223
The final winner is going to be
Katherine Ann VanKirk who is 13

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.413
and she is the on who wrote to
Michael Buckley and she is --

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:16.303
we're delighted to
have Katherine here.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.783
She is from Washington,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.383
D.C. So these are representatives
of our states.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.516
And now Olivia it's your turn to
come on up and read your letter.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.966
Let's give Olivia Marcantonio
a big hand.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.926
&gt;&gt; Olivia Marcantonio:
Dear Mr. Jerry Spinelli:

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.720
Star Girl was one of those books.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:45.920
I don't know how else
to describe it.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.206
It is a book that completely
turns you inside out.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.366
Many books deal with a
character who is different,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.610
but none of those characters
actually enjoys being different.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.286
Star Girl showed me not to change,
to be my definition of normal,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.963
to be myself, as long as that self
does not have a negative effect

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:03.756
on other people.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.223
This book surprised me.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.756
By reading it, I discovered
things about myself

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.556
that I never noticed before.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.423
I discovered my strengths in
the characters of Star Girl.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.050
Like her, I don't pay attention
to negative peer pressure.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.666
I discovered my weaknesses
in Hillary's character.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.993
I am often determined to
dislike certain people.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.103
You should care about what other
people think of you, but not as much

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:25.756
as you should care how you
make other people feel.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.053
We are the main character in our
own story, but it never occurs to us

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.366
that we might be the bad
guy in someone else's.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:34.886
By reading Star Girl I stopped
seeing everyone else as "Them",

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:38.803
with a capital "T" and started
seeing people as individuals.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.670
While everyone is made from
the same primary colors,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.496
it's how we mix those colors

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.496
to create ourselves
that makes us different.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.866
Now I fully recognize that you
can't treat everyone the same way.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.326
What resolves an argument

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.593
in one person may insight an
argument in a different person.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.326
I never knew that before.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.063
I have learned to accept other's
differences by reading Star Girl.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.280
Not necessarily big differences,
not even important differences.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.566
It could be something as
small and inconsequential

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.110
as liking a book series
that I happen to hate.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.206
Then again a person might
dislike me because of that.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.573
I've learned to accept that too.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.726
I have learned to tolerate
people when the opinion

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:18.883
of everyone else strongly
contradicts my own.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.203
Mr. Spinelli, before I read
Star Girl I was the same kind

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.470
of different that I am now.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.980
I always speak my opinion,
good or bad, hurtful or not.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.826
Now though, you and
Star Girl have taught me

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.770
that while being different is
good, I have to keep it in control

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.020
like a bush, in some places you let
it grow and in others you prune it

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:38.353
down so it doesn't stick out into
the neighbor's yard and annoy them.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.816
Mr. Spinelli, you taught me how
to be normal without changing,

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.656
to change my image while the
way I think stays the same,

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.870
to be myself without hurting others.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.470
Thank you.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.203
&gt;&gt; John: Thank you Olivia.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.736
[Applause] Now Olivia stay
here for just a second.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.710
Jerry Spinelli was invited to the
Book Festival but could not make it.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.363
And we were able however just a
couple of days ago to get in touch

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.483
with him and Cathy had
sent the letter to him

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:11.990
through is publicist
and he has read it.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.023
And the night before last I
got the following response

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.413
from Jerry Spinelli and for just
a second, you're going to have

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.820
to pretend like I'm
Jerry Spinelli okay.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.883
[Laughter] This is what he said.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.476
"No Olivia, thank you.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.350
Thank you for being the dream
reader we writers all wish for,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.513
someone who takes from the story
not only what we put in but even,

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.716
maybe even a little more.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.410
Thank you Olivia for making
a story a part of your life

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.020
and thereby affirming something
the poet, Murial Rukeyser wrote,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.193
"The world is not made
of atoms but of stories."

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.676
And thank you Olivia for confirming
my own belief as an author

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.553
that a book is only half done until
someone picks it up and reads it.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.890
So you'll understand if I
think of you as my co-author.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.763
Best wishes from Star Girl
and me, Jerry Spinelli."

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.716
And I'll send you a
copy of the email.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.733
&gt;&gt; Cathy Gourley: And I like
to present you with a tee shirt

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.076
that says, "I cannot
live without books."

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.923
And a writing journal that matches,
because we want you to keep writing;

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.350
at 11 years old what a great job.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.150


00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.316
[Applause] And I now would like
to invite Claire to come up

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.476
and read her letter
and I did not mention

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.290
that Claire is a home-schooler
and also to invite both Katherine

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.466
and Michael to come up
and take these stools

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:01.943
and we will have two consecutive
readings and then comments.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.643
[ Sound effects ]

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.750
&gt;&gt; Claire Wang: Dear
Katherine Paterson:

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.550
What brings two completely
different people together

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.750
and creates a lasting
bond between them.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.150
In what ways does it
change our lives forever?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.870
To me a friendship seems
useless and superficial.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.296
I believe that something or someone
will always break it or destroy it,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800
erase it with no trace at all.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.836
When my family moved back to
Beijing, I lost all my best friends.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.450
Year's worth of friendship was
broken in a matter of minutes.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.983
I became bitter and cautious
to any potential companions.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:04.323
In a Chinese public school
I was known as the tall,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.860
think Chinese-American girl
who had no feelings at all.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.106
However I was indifferent
to the gossip around me.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.400
The hurtful gossip
further proved my point.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:18.310
Thankfully my parents transferred
me to a bilingual private school.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.560
Slowly but surely I became attached
to some of the people there.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.766
In that group of people
was a girl named Vicki.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.503
Her attitude and characteristics
were similar

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.976
to your character Leslie
Burke, bright and lively,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.433
bold and somewhat rebellious.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.306
We helped with each
other's struggles.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.586
She was a leader and
I was a follower.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.250
Regardless of our completely
different personalities Vicki

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.843
and I were soon best friends.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.370
Although my parents
started to home-school me,

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.500
things remained the same between us.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.966
I thought I will always
see her again.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.500


00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.686
One cloudy day, someone
told me the shocking news.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640
"Vicki's dead."

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.506
I felt stunned and
helpless that entire day.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.120
A car accident took her bright life.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.096
Again, a perfect friendship was
destroyed in a matter of minutes.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.983
Again, I became bitter.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.263
Never again should I
ever rely on friendship.

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:20.130
Never again should I
ever have a close friend.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.610
I repeated these promises to
myself almost every night.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.053
As books are one of my
escapes from the real world,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.883
I picked up the book Bridge to
Terabithia from my dusty bookshelf.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.746
Although I read Bridge
to Terabithia before,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.660
I felt something different
this time.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.376
I understood Jess Aaron's feelings
before Leslie came into his life.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.303
I smiled at the adventures
that Jess and Leslie had

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.050
in their magical world
of Terabithia.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.453
I thought that their perfect
friendship would go on forever.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.086
I was shocked when Brenda
told Jess that Leslie is dead.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.140
That part is like a clear
reflection of my present situation.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.780
However, I was curious to see
how Jess reacted to this event.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:07.933
When I finished your book, I
knew immediately what to do.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:10.813
Just like Jess who passed down the
lessons that Leslie taught him,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.373
I will try to do the same.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.573
I will remember how Vicki impacted
others through her cheerful,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.306
creative spirit and
strong leadership.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.573
Instead of being timid and
shy, I will try to help others

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.766
with my leadership and smile to
pass down the gift Vicki left me.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.083
I used to think that death marked
an ending, however now I know

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.546
that it also marks a new
beginning for a new friendship.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.493
Thank you so much for teaching
me this valuable lesson

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.360
through your book.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.393
Thank you for making me understand
how God intended friendship to be.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.993

from both authors.

[ Sound effects ]

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.933
&gt;&gt; Katherine Ann VanKirk:
Dear Mr. Michael Buckley:

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.556
I would like to tell you about how
your series The Sisters Grimm helped

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.323
me, but first I think you should
know a little bit about me.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.963
I am 12 years old, now 13.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.073
[Laughter] My parents are divorced.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.756
When you think about a divorce
you picture two people fighting

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:04.083
and then them getting separated.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.883
Then everything becomes fine.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.283
This is not reality.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.150
I am part of a Lunch Bunch
group that is designed

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:12.283
to help kids with problems at home.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.453
I'm the only kid there with divorced
parents and I'm not the only kid

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.540
in the group that has
separated parents.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.326
This reality makes me feel even
worse about what happens at home.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.980
Amongst all this is my
little sister Caroline.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.880
I don't have a great
relationship with my sister.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.000
I mean its okay but
it's not the kind

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.200
of relationship I would
have wished for.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.600
Now that you know a bit about
me, I would like to tell you

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:35.936
about how I started reading books.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.950
The first time I read your
book was in the spring

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.376
of 5th grade, about two years ago.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.950
I finished a book and I was
looking for another one.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.740
I asked my librarian and she gave me
your fourth book, Once Upon a Curse.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.306
I had no idea that
it was in a series.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.036
Of course, I had a few
questions, but I dropped them.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:00.590
One early Wednesday morning, I was
in SSR, Sustained Silent Reading

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.770
and I found that I didn't
have a book to read.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.883
So I decided to look on the cart of
books that was there for us to read.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.790
And I found the first book in the
series, The Fairytale Detectives.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.750
I was surprised because
I had absolutely no idea.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.270
Anyway I checked it out and read it.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.873
It was just as good the
fourth book had been.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.000
I continued to read books
two, three and four again.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.383
Before school one morning
I went to see

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.633
if they had book number
five and they didn't.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.166
I continued to look for it,
but I just couldn't find it.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.940


00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.086
While I was trying to find the
fifth book, I began to think

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:35.863
about the characters in the series.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.383
I thought about how the
two sisters get along

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:40.463
and have a blast without
their parents.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:42.943
I realized that these sisters
had a strong enough bond

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.770
that it didn't make too
bad of an impact on them.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.000
I also began to think about this
could be similar in my life.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.806
If I had a better relationship
with my sister we could work

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.193
through what happens and I
wouldn't have to hold it in until

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.620
that once a month Lunch Bunch.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.770
I knew what I wanted to do.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:03.966
I wanted to make the relationship
I had with my sister better.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.573
The only problem was
how would I do it?

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:10.790
I began to brainstorm some ideas
of how I could accomplish this.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:14.910
I noted that Sabrina and Daphne
spend a lot of time together.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.070
Caroline and I spent time together,
but nearly as much as they did.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.136
I decided to spend
more time with her.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.243
After about two weeks had
past I began to notice

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:27.783
that we were treating
each other differently.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.926
As time went by we
got closer and closer.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.036
It was great, but problems
still came up.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.813
There was no way we could prevent
this but we talked everything

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.766
at SM's, secret meetings.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.083
During an SM we would talk
about what was bothering us

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.536
and what we would do to change it.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.323
These meetings were like
my Lunch Bunch meetings

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:48.346
but they were private
and overall better.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.943
Now I feel like I could get
through anything with my sister.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.906
I never dreamed of having
a relationship this strong.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.146
I want to thank you for
writing this series.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.490
One thing, which I think you'll
happy to hear is that last weekend,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.883
well not last weekend but you know,
I found book number five and six.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.660
Sincerely, Katherine Ann Vankirk.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
[Applause]

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.970
&gt;&gt; John: You want to go first.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.610
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I asked
John Ko to give me a minute

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.113
because I think all of us were
deeply moved by Claire's letter.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:30.666
And I didn't have Jerry
Spinelli's advantage

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.160
of seeing the letter first.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.293
I heard it when you heard it.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.960
I think the thing that struck
me in your letter Claire,

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.103
was how important friendship is.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:45.430
And I know in my life I've
had to move many times

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.316
and have left behind friends

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.933
that I thought I could
not bear to live without.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.700
And I've lost friends who
have died, and at my age more

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.390
and more of my friends are dying.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.693
And I think what I've
learned through that

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:05.546
and I think what you've learned

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:07.700
through that is how
precious friendship is.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.593
And that the fact that we've had
those wonderful friendships makes it

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:15.376
possible for us to reach
out to other people in a way

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.503
that we couldn't have
without those friendships.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.746
And I'm very grateful that
that's what you learned

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:25.746
from reading Bridge to Terabithia.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920
You know I always say that the
writer doesn't have a right

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:30.906
to tell the reader what
to take from a book.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.800
And your teacher doesn't
have a right

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:36.970
to tell you what to
take from a book.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.790
No one has a right to tell you
what the book should mean to you.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.276
But it makes me very happy
to know that what you learned

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.233
from that book is how
precious friendship was

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.233
and that you could never
turn your back on that.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.576
So thanks so much for your letter.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:10.390
[Applause]

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.856
&gt;&gt; Michael Buckley: Katherine I am
a little choked up by your letter

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.770
and that's not good
because I'm 6' 3"

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.580
and people laugh at
you when you cry.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.006
[Laughter] One of the
things I set out to do

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.286
with The Sisters Grimm was tell
a very simple message and that is

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.820
that the real magic in the
world doesn't come from wizards

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.406
and magic wands, it
comes from family.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.616
And of all the people who
have written me letters,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600
you seem to get that the best.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:51.483
I'm glad that the book has had a
positive impact on your relationship

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:56.576
with your sister and hopefully you
can carry that into your adult life.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.306
Because as you get older
you'll hear time and time again

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.143
that you can pick your friends
but you cannot pick your family.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.440
But the true magic of a family is

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.200
that everyone is a
little bit different,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.406
but they all come together
to form one amazing group.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.080
I'm very happy that you get that.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.600
The one thing I would like
to say is I get many letters

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.900
from kids who enjoy the books.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.693
I never thought that anybody would
even read my book when I wrote it,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.220
let alone write me
a letter about it.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.006
And it's truly a special treat.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.883
I think that when a writer sits
down, well at least some of us,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.203
when we sit down we
dream that we're going

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.126
to write the next Harry Potter, the
next Wimpy Kid and we're just going

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.146
to be swimming in money
like Scrooge McDuck.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.950


00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.320
[Laughter] But as you go on
in your career as a writer,

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:05.060
at least what I've come across
is that the real treasures to me,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.503
the real reward of what I
do is fans like you who seem

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.533
to understand me even better
than I understand myself.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.920
So thank you so much for putting
such time and effort into it

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.460
and I truly hope that your sister
has stopped being such a jerk.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.330
[Laughter] Thank you!

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.310


00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.310
&gt;&gt; John: And Cathy and I on behalf
of Letters About Literature wish

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.136
to thank both Katherine and
Michael, but especially Olivia,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.540
Claire and Katherine Ann for your
wonderful letters, for being part

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:56.376
of the sharing experience that
we've had about important books

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.063
that not only make a difference
but of course, are true letters

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.943
about literature that affect
people and their lives

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.216
and also have an effect on
the authors and we just --

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:08.996
I would like to call for a round of
applause for all five experiment --

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.443
all five people in this
wonderful experiment.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:21.436
[Applause] And now to close things

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.043
for this year's National
Book Festival,

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.076
I'm pleased to introduce
Dianna Marham

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.603
who is the associate
librarian for library services

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.220
and for our purposes Dianna
is actually the director

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:36.980
of the National Book
Festival Planning Team

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.010
and if anyone deserves a round of
applause, Dianna really deserves it.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.670
[Applause] Dianna.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.470


00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.366
&gt;&gt; Dianna Markham: Thank you John.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.196
Thank you Cathy, thank you
authors, thank you writes.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.070
This has been an absolutely
wonderful day for all of us

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.300
and I can't stop without
giving these wonderful Letters

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:10.536
About Literature one
more round of applause.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.330
[Applause] They were terrific.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:22.716
And even though it's hot
at least it's been sunny.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.370
We haven't had to endure rain.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.770
We're all very happy.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.303
And so we end this brilliant
day on a singularly happy note.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.620
We have come at last to the close
of the 10th annual Book Festival.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.573
A fitting conclusion to
this delightful celebration

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.633
of the good things
books do for all of us.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.426
I'd like you to look
around at the young people

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.860
who are in this room today.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.793
When I see them and I see the
festive characters who were

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.713
in our poster, and I see that
young people are connecting

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:10.090
to these characters and to authors
I think back upon my own young life

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.623
when I was growing up on
a farm I southern Indiana.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:23.060
And the best thing for me was going
to the public library on Saturday.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.870
We went to the grocery
store on Saturday

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.503
and while my parents bought
groceries we were dropped off

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.936
at the public library.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.986
There is nothing that
compares to the discovery

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.436
of books in the public library.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.610


00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.040
And everyone here has had
that same kind of delight,

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:52.373
the freedom to take an amazing
journey that costs you no more time

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:53.510
than it takes you to go
to your school library

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.063
or your public library or the
bookstore and pick out a book.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.023
And it's just a marvelous
testament to the power of books

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.386
to hear what those individual
books meant in your lives.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:10.833
And I think all of us
who love books have had

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.373
that same kind of experience.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.530
Now it's true that you don't always
have to go to the library anymore.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:20.276
You can download books
to your Kindle.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.663
You can download books
from your public library.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.736
But you know you can't have an
author sign the Kindle book.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.690
[Laughter] And there's
something magical

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.730
in having the author
sign that book too.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.746
I think we all want to give the
authors a special round of applause.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.250


00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:51.933
[Applause] So this is
the 10th anniversary

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:53.876
of the National Book Festival
and we chose the theme:

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.163
A Decade of Words and Wonder.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.183
And it is the words that
bring us the wonder.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.900
Good writers pave the
way for avid readers.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.013
Good readers often
become good writers.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.900
Books are the links of
a chain of knowledge

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.860
and enjoyment that never ends.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.500
So all of you in this room please
keep reading, keep writing.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.336
Thank you for joining us today
and let's go on to the next decade

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.430
of the National Book Festival.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.096
We'll see you again
right here next year.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.896
And until then, best wishes.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.483
Thank you very much.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:44.650
[Applause]

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.196
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
