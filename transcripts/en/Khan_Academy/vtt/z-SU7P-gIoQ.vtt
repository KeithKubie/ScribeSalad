00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.901
Voiceover:We know that the multiplication

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.233
of scalar quantities is commutative.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:11.566
For example, 5 times 7 is
the same thing as 7 times 5,

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.366
and that's obviously just
a particular example.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.900
I could give many, many more.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.233
3 times negative 11 is the same
thing as negative 11 times 3

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.434
and the whole point of commutativity ...

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:25.366
I could never say it ...

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.033
is that it doesn't matter what order

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.366
that I'm multiplying in.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.767
This is the same thing
as negative 11 times 3.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.766
Or if we wanted to speak in general terms,

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:39.233
if I have the scalar a and I
multiply it times the scalar b,

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.366
that's going to be the same thing

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:45.801
as multiplying the scalar
b times the scalar a.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.300
Now what I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.367
whether this property of commutativity,

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:52.767
whether the commutative property

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:54.500
of multiplication of scalars,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.233
whether there is a similar property

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.900
for the multiplication of matrices,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.567
whether it's the case that
if I had two matrices,

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:08.300
let's say matrix capital
A and matrix capital B,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.901
whether it's always the
case that that product,

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.500
the resulting matrix here is the same

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500
as the product of matrix B and matrix A,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.300
just swapping the order.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.367
I encourage you ... so
is this always true?

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:24.433
It might be sometimes true,

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.900
but in order for us to say
that matrix multiplication

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
is commutative, that it
doesn't matter what order

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.905
we are multiplying it,

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:36.700
we have to figure out is
this always going to be true?

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.367
I encourage you to pause this video

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.467
and think about that for a little bit.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:42.694
Let's just think through a few things.

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:45.034
First of all, let's just
think about matrices

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:47.100
of different dimensions.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.500
Let's say I have a matrix here.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.567
Let's say that matrix
A is a, I don't know,

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:58.734
let's say it is a 5 by 2 matrix,

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.867
5 by 2 matrix,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.666
and matrix B is a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.400
The product AB is going
to have what dimensions?

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:18.433
If I multiply these two, you're
going to get a third matrix.

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:21.392
Let's just call that C for now.

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:22.700
You're going to get a third matrix C.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.484
What are going to be the dimensions of C?

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:30.900
We know, first of all, that
this product is defined

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.114
under our convention of
matrix multiplication

00:02:33.114 --> 00:02:35.433
because the number of columns that A has

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.234
is the same as the number of rows B has,

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.633
and the resulting rows and column

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:43.833
are going to be the rows
of A and the columns of B.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:48.066
So C is going to be a 5 by 3 matrix,

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.400
a 5 by 3 matrix.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.500
Now what about the other way around?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.100
What would B times A be?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.366
Once again, I encourage
you to pause the video.

00:02:57.688 --> 00:02:59.884
If you were to take B,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.067
let me copy and paste that,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.767
and multiply that times A,

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.800
so I'm really just switching
the order of the multiplication

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.467
so copy and paste.

00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:15.767
If we take that product right over there,

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.734
what is that going to be equal to?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.667
What is this?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.269
What is this right over
here going to be equal to?

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:29.100
The first question is, is matrix
multiplication even defined

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.767
for these two matrices?

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:35.366
When you look at the number
of columns that B has

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:38.169
and the number of rows that A has,

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.168
you see that it actually is not defined,

00:03:40.168 --> 00:03:42.167
that we have a different
number of columns for B

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:44.434
and a different number of rows for A.

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:46.866
Here, the product is not defined,

00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:49.400
is not defined,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.366
so this immediately is a pretty big clue

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.102
that this isn't always going to be true.

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:57.701
Here, AB, the product AB is defined,

00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.166
and you'll end up with a 5 by 3 matrix.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:03.833
The product here, BA, isn't even defined.

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.766
This is already ...

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.633
We're already seeing that
this is not the case,

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:12.833
that order matters when
you are multiplying,

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.167
when you are multiplying matrices.

00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:16.700
To make things a little bit more concrete,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.500
let's actually look at a matrix.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.700
You might be saying, oh,
maybe this doesn't work

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.834
only when it's not defined,

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.168
but hey, maybe it works
if we're always to do

00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:26.102
square matrices or matrices
where both products

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:27.701
are always defined in some way,

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.500
or maybe some other case.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.900
Let's look at a case where we're dealing

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.666
with 2 by 2 matrices and
see whether order matters.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.734
Let's say I have the matrix.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:47.066
Let's say I have the matrix
1, 2, negative 3, negative 4,

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.766
and I want to multiply that by the matrix,

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:56.100
by the matrix negative
2, 0, 0, negative 3.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.767
What's that product going to be?

00:04:57.767 --> 00:04:59.500
Once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.938
and think about that.

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:06.370
Let's think it through, and
we've done this many times now.

00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:09.369
This first entry here is going to be,

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:12.567
we're essentially going to look
at this row and this column,

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:14.901
so it's 1 times negative
2, which is negative 2,

00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.033
plus 2 times 0.

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:18.233
This is going to be negative 2.

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.503
Now, for this entry,

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:21.366
for this entry over here,

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:24.700
we'll look at this row and this column,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.566
1 times 0, which is 0,
plus 2 times negative 3,

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:29.710
which is negative 6.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.167
Then for this entry, we
would look at this row

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.680
and this column.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.233
Negative 3 times negative 2 is positive 6

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:42.933
plus negative 4 times 0,
which is just positive 6.

00:05:43.202 --> 00:05:44.935
We're going to have positive 6.

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:47.101
Then finally, for this entry,

00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.247
it's going to be the second
row times the second column.

00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:51.440
Negative 3 times 0 is 0.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.868
Negative 4 times negative
3 is positive 12,

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:56.396
so fair enough.

00:05:56.396 --> 00:05:58.134
Now what if we did it
the other way around?

00:05:58.234 --> 00:06:06.368
What if we were to multiply
negative 2, 0, 0, negative 3

00:06:06.368 --> 00:06:13.666
times 1, 2, negative 3, negative 4?

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.501
What's this going to be equal to?

00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:18.100
As always, it's a good
idea to try to pause it

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.800
and work through it on your own.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.900
Let's think about this.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:29.505
Negative 2 times 1 is negative
2, plus 0 times negative 3,

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:31.835
so that's going to be negative 2.

00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:34.335
So far, it's looking pretty good.

00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:39.233
Then if you have negative
2 times 2 is negative 4,

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:42.766
plus 0 times negative 4 is negative 4.

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:44.833
We already see that these two things

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:46.833
aren't going to be equal,
but let's just finish it,

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:49.602
just so that we have a
feeling of completion.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.367
This entry right over here is going to be

00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:52.966
the second row, first column,

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:56.573
0 times 1 plus negative 3
times negative 3 is positive 9.

00:06:56.573 --> 00:06:58.233
Once again, it doesn't match up.

00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:01.500
Then finally, 0 times 2 is 0

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.301
plus negative 3 times
negative 4 is positive 12.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.566
That one actually did match up,

00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:10.833
but clearly, these two products
are not the same thing.

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.530
The order with which even those defined,

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:15.642
it doesn't matter whether you take

00:07:15.642 --> 00:07:17.366
the yellow one times the purple one

00:07:17.366 --> 00:07:18.770
or the purple one times the yellow one.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.433
Both of those result in a defined product,

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.700
but we see it's not the same product.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.043
Once again, another case showing

00:07:26.043 --> 00:07:30.918
that multiplication of
matrices is not commutative.
