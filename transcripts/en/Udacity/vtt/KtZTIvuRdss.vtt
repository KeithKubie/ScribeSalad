00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.980
All right, so it turns out there is going to

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.605
be an useful step here. Which is, we are

00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:07.450
going to take advantage of the fact that minus epsilon

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.130
is greater than or equal to the natural law of

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.500
one minus epsilon; which maybe it's not so obvious

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.010
but if you plot it you could see that it's

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.960
true. If this is the epsilon axis then minus

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.360
epsilon looks like a straight line going down like that.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.386
&gt;&gt; Sure it's got slope minus one.

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; Yep, and the log of one minus epsilon looks like this,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.530
it starts off, they'll they're totally lined up at zero, epsilon zero.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.350
&gt;&gt; Sure because one minus zero is one then absolute log of one is zero.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.060
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and then what happens is it starts to fall away from it, the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.160
slope is actually, I mean you could, you

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.640
can test this by taking the derivative of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.510
it but the slope is if it's you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.500
know it's monotonically I'm changing [LAUGH] so that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
it falls away from the line and always

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.510
stays below it,okay, so if we believe that,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.480
which, you know I'm going to just say calculus.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.730
&gt;&gt; Well, you can kind of see that, right? Because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.170
when epsilon is one, that would be the natural log of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.500
zero and the only way you can raise e to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.730
a power and get zero, is by having effectively, negative infinity.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so right, by then, it's definitely below and but, it

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.280
stay below all along, I mean, because, just that is not enough, because.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.500
&gt;&gt; Well, it has to stay below all along because

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.730
natural long is the natural log is a monotonic function.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.960
Alright, so it can't like, get bigger and then

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.480
get smaller again, so, yeah, okay I buy that.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.985
&gt;&gt; Good, alright, so if that's the

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.260
case,if we accept this line, then, it's also

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.990
going to be the case, that one minus epsilon to the m, is than or equal

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.810
e to the minus epsilon m, so why is that? So, if you multiply both

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.360
sides by m, and then take each of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.190
the both sides, you get exactly this expression.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.630
&gt;&gt; Sure. Alright?

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.970
So now that we've gotten that, we can use it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.310
here in our derivation and rewrite that as, the size

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.350
of the hypothesis space times e to the minus epsilon

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.810
m. Alright that gives us another upper bound on the quantities

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.860
that we had before and this is much more convienent

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.530
to work with. The epsilon which had been kind of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.490
trapped in the parentheses with the y minus now comes

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.449
up to the exponent where we can work with it better.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.740
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.370
&gt;&gt; Alright, so what this is is an upper bound

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.155
that the virgin space is not epsilon exhausted after m samples.

00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:17.421
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:19.810
&gt;&gt; And that is what we would like delta to,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.480
we would like delta to be a bound on that.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.021
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.530
&gt;&gt; Right, so if delta is the,is the failure probability, essentially. So the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.820
failure probability aught to be bigger than

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.360
or equal to this expression here, alright?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.285
&gt;&gt; So now, the last thing we need to do, is we can just

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:37.210
re-write this in terms of M.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.060
&gt;&gt; Mm. So if we do that, let's see what happens. All right, when

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.910
we're done rewriting that what we find is the sample size M needs to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.050
be at least as large as one over epsilon times the quantity the log

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.520
of the size of the hypothesis space plus the log of one over delta.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.280
&gt;&gt; Okay and that is polynomial in one over epsilon,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.020
one over delta, and the size of the hypothesis base.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.830
&gt;&gt; Indeed!

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.250
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.630
&gt;&gt; So that's pretty cool.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.340
&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.260
&gt;&gt; So, right, it tells us if you

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.100
know the size of your hypothesis base, and you

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.410
know what your epsilon and delta targets are, you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.760
know, sample a bunch, and then you'll be okay.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.350
&gt;&gt; That's pretty good!
