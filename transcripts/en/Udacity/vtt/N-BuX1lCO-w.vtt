00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.370
So far we have referred to machines on the internet

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.939
soley by their IP address and then its largely how the

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.480
machines address each other. But IP addresses are not very

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.200
convienant for users like you and me. We much to prefer

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.780
to use host names. The domain name system that makes

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.070
this possible amounts to another layer of indirection within the network

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.300
layer. The host name, like www.udacity.com, gets translated into an IP

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.490
address, which is then used in the ways we've talked about.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.230
This translation is accomplished with the help of domain

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.450
name services sprinkled throughout the internet. Suppose I try to

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.040
send a packet to www.udacity.com from my computer. To

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.260
get the most authoritative answer, my computer would then ask.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.310
The local DNS server, not too far away, probably

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.380
on the Comcast network. This in turn would ask the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.990
root name server where it might find a .com

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.630
name server which would help it with host names ending

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.310
with .com. Having received this response, our DNS

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.080
server would then ask this .com name server

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.500
for information about udacity.com. When this IP comes

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.978
back The server then asks where it might find

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:07.860
www.udacity.com, and when it receives this answer, it

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.200
then forwards it back to my computer. This should

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.240
be somewhat reminiscent of how a directory system

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.110
works. Importantly however, high levels in the tree are

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.380
to the right of the host name. Hence. www.udacity.com

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.250
is sort of like / com/udacity/www. Now, of course,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.560
we don't actually make all these requests every time

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.240
we need to find the IP for www.udacity.com, my computer

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.430
will cache the answer and so will the local

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.080
name server, not necessarily for my sake. But for

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.730
the sake of other clients on the same local

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.930
server who might also need an IP for www.udacity.com, and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.340
they would cache the IPs for the root server, and for

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.480
the dot com server as well. You can read more about how

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.210
domain names are acquired and registered, and how the severs are

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.910
kept up to date, in the links provided in the instructor notes.
