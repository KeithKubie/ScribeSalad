00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
5.7 billion dollars is a lot of money and while some propose it go towards a wall, or gate thing,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.380
we started wondering what else can you buy with

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.040
5.7 billion dollars? Well, if you're feeling hungry, you could buy 34.2 billion strawberries.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.020
Or maybe you're looking for something a little less healthy, like 1.14 billion Big Macs.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.599
Of course, the cost to fix Flint Michigan's water pipes is

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.299
estimated at 55 million dollars, so they could be fixed 103 times. Speaking of health,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.099
we could fully vaccinate 2.6 million children from birth to age 18

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.940
which could have prevented every death caused by Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, Whooping Cough, and Measles

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.020
combined in one year. The Avengers: Infinity War could be made

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.200
17.75 times, and around 73% of Americans could get a Fenty Stunna lip paint. Come fall,

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.889
1.2 billion around the world could get a free pumpkin spice

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.709
latte. 15 million Americans could have their dental insurance covered for a year, or 543

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.000
thousand wouldn't even have to pay tax. While 142.5 million Naloxone kits could be purchased to help prevent opioid

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.360
overdoses. Feel like going green? 200 thousand homes could be fitted with solar panels, which last up to 20 years. Or,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.800
84,000 people could get a Tesla Model S.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.680
Change that to one of the cheaper electric cars, and 228 thousand people could be sporting a gas free vehicle.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.680
What would other countries think?

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.759
5.7 billion is more than three times

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.300
belize's entire GDP, or you could buy more than 14 White Houses in America, which is valued at

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.360
389 million a pop. Speaking of houses,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.740
5.7 billion could pay for every homeless person in America's rent for nine months. We could pay off the student loans of over

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.700
150,000 US graduates, cover the cost of more than a quarter of NASA's yearly budget, keep Wikipedia running for

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.660
228 years, and make every science article published in the U.S. over the next four years

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.840
open access and available freely to all, that would be pretty cool.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.309
Of course, most economists predict that the wall will cost much more than 5.7 billion.
