00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:10.343 line:0%
My laboratory
gets in and explores

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.580 line:0%
and we really
explore a world

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.248 line:0%
that's invisible
to the naked eye.

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:17.616
And so, if we take a look at

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.687
<i> these scanning electron
 microscopy images</i>

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.588
<i>you'll get a closer view.</i>

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:26.425
<i>So, we are looking in now,
at over 3000-times zoomed</i>

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.728
<i> and you can see our
 inner intestines</i>

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.796
<i> there are all
 of these cells</i>

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.299
that are-- turns out
aren't our own cells

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.868
but are actually
microbial cells.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:40.740
Largely bacteria but also
viruses and fungi and protozoa

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.242
that inhabit our bodies.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.944
And the same can be said about

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.715
virtually every exposed
environmental site on our bodies

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.050
and so, here is a
picture of the mouth

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.919
<i> where you see not
 really our own cells</i>

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.987
<i>but other microbial cells.</i>

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.191
<i>And so, I think that you can
see from these pictures that</i>

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.294
<i> these are actually
really, really like habitats</i>

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.662
<i> that are within our
 own body world.</i>

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.399
<i>And it turns out that they are
not passive members either.</i>

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.002
<i> They form communities
 and they interact</i>

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.704
<i>and they divide and replicate</i>

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.674
<i> and they even wage wars
 against each other.</i>

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:19.078
<i>These microbes outnumber at
 our own human eukaryotic
 cells ten-to-one.</i>

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.648
<i>And this actually means not
ten-times amounts of genes</i>

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.885
<i>but it turns out that for
every human gene that we have</i>

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.121
<i> there are over 360
 bacterial genes.</i>

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:32.058
So, they outnumber our
own human genomes.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:35.194
And we are just starting to
learn about what they can do

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:38.297
and how we've co-evolved
with these microbes

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:41.801
to influence our own
biological function.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:44.604
<i> These microbes
 are very diverse.</i>

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.775
<i>So there are over 10,000 unique
 species that inhabit us.</i>

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.912
<i>And they outnumber greatly all
of the disease causing microbes</i>

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.282
<i>or pathogens that we are used
to studying in the laboratory.</i>

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.685
<i> And so, my lab in
particular is interested in</i>

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:03.522
<i> how these microbes aside
 from affecting digestion</i>

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.725
<i>and immunity and metabolism,</i>

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.661
<i> can influence the brain
 and behavior.</i>

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.164
So, in terms of
brain and behavior

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.766
one thing that's really
important to note is that

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.202
the brain itself is a
very complex organ.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.739
But adding on to that another
whole layer of complexity

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.775
is that the brain doesn't
act in isolation.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.644
It responds to the
needs and experiences

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:28.013
of all our other body sites.

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:32.451
And so, the microbiota, as you
know, as an important organ

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.188 line:0%
<i> turns out to feed into
brain and behavior as well.</i>

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:39.291
Many, many conditions now
are known to be linked

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.094
to changes in the
communities of microbes

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:44.029
that inhabit our bodies.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.398
And some of these,

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.334
also include
neurological disorders.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:52.838
The frontier of this is to see
whether we could use bacteria

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:55.040
to really hack into
brain function

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.743
a relatively inaccessible area.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:00.079
And so, we really need
to study in these--

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.516
in these diseases whether
we can use microbes

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:07.620
to cause or correct diseases.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.023
<i>The implications are huge,
 because microbes we know</i>

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.293
<i>are relatively accessible by us.</i>

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.795
<i> We know how to engineer
 them and modify them</i>

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.397
<i> and eradicate them
 if we need to.</i>

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.700
<i> And in our bodies they
 colonize persistently.</i>

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.837
And the idea is can
we use these microbes

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.373
to treat neurological disorders

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:32.878
in a relatively non-invasive way
to provide long lasting impacts

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.316
and with regulatory controls
that we build in and design in

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.286
on these microbes
when we modify them.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.620
Thank you very much.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.991
