00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.450
Welcome back.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.520
We'll now do another tension
problem and this one is just a

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.340
slight increment harder than the
previous one just because

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.390
we have to take out slightly
more sophisticated algebra

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.490
tools than we did
in the last one.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.000
But it's not really
any harder.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.990
But you should actually see this
type of problem because

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.810
you'll probably see
it on an exam.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.440
So let's figure out the
tension in the wire.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.950
So first of all, we know
that this point

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.380
right here isn't moving.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.700
So the tension in this little
small wire right here is easy.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.170
It's trivial.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.850
The force of gravity is pulling
down at this point

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.170
with 10 Newtons because you
have this weight here.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.200
And of course, since this
point is stationary, the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.750
tension in this wire has to
be 10 Newtons upward.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.300
That's an easy one.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600
So let's just figure out the
tension in these two slightly

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.550
more difficult wires to figure
out the tensions of.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.500
So once again, we know that this
point right here, this

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.760
point is not accelerating
in any direction.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.900
It's not accelerating in the
x direction, nor is it

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.340
accelerating in the vertical
direction or the y direction.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.970
So we know that the net forces
in the x direction need to be

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.800
0 on it and we know the
net forces in the y

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.970
direction need to be 0.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.410
So what are the net forces
in the x direction?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.120
Well they're going to be the x
components of these two-- of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.750
the tension vectors of
both of these wires.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.820
I guess let's draw the tension
vectors of the two wires.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.065
So this T1, it's pulling.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:21.870
The tension vector pulls in
the direction of the wire

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.240
along the same line.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.740
So let's say that this is the
tension vector of T1.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.620
If that's the tension vector,
its x component will be this.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.690
Let me see how good
I can draw this.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.440
It's intended to be a straight
line, but that

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.920
would be its x component.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.570
And its x component, let's
see, this is 30 degrees.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.440
This is 30 degrees right here.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.070
And hopefully this is a bit
second nature to you.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.320
If this value up here
is T1, what is the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590
value of the x component?

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.860
It's T1 cosine of 30 degrees.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.200
And you could do your
SOH-CAH-TOA.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.810
You know, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.430
So the cosine of 30 degrees is
equal to-- This over T1 one is

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.800
equal to the x component
over T1.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.010
And if you multiply both sides
by T1, you get this.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.690
This should be a little bit of
second nature right now.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.050
That the x component is going to
be the cosine of the angle

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.350
between the hypotenuse and
the x component times the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.440
hypotenuse.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.485
And similarly, the x component
here-- Let me

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:28.860
draw this force vector.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.675
So if this is T2, this would
be its x component.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.320
And very similarly, this is 60
degrees, so this would be T2

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.130
cosine of 60.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.920
Now what do we know about
these two vectors?

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.150
We know that their
net force is 0.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.500
Or that you also know that the
magnitude of these two vectors

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.340
should cancel each other out
or that they're equal.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.570
I mean, they're pulling in
opposite directions.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.030
That's pretty obvious.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.900
And so you know that their
magnitudes need to be equal.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.950
So we know that T1 cosine
of 30 is going to equal

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.810
T2 cosine of 60.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.990
So let's write that down.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:27.070
T1 cosine of 30 degrees is
equal to T2 cosine of 60.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.890
And then we could bring the
T2 on to this side.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.900
And actually, let's also-- I'm
trying to save as much space

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.950
as possible because I'm guessing
this is going to take

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.550
up a lot of room,
this problem.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.070
What's the cosine
of 30 degrees?

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.410
If you haven't memorized
it already, it's square

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.040
root of 3 over 2.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.640
So this becomes square root
of 3 over 2 times T1.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.510
That's the cosine
of 30 degrees.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.290
And then I'm going to bring
this on to this side.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.590
So the cosine of 60
is actually 1/2.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.520
You could use your calculator
if you forgot that.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320
So this is 1/2 T2.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.590
Bring it on this side so
it becomes minus 1/2.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.940
I'm skipping more steps than
normal just because I don't

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.020
want to waste too much space.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.160
And this equals 0.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.370
But if you seen the other
videos, hopefully I'm not

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.410
creating too many gaps.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.960
And this is relatively
easy to follow.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.269
So we have the square root of
3 times T1 minus 1/2 T2 is

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.800
equal to 0.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.700
So that gives us an equation.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.320
One equation with two unknowns,
so it doesn't help

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.050
us much so far.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.250
But let's square that away
because I have a feeling this

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.330
will be useful.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.330
Now what's going to be happening
on the y components?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.580
So let's say that this is the y
component of T1 and this is

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.230
the y component of T2.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.860
What do we know?

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.450
What what do we know about
the two y components?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.890
I could've drawn them here too
and then just shift them over

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.240
to the left and the right.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.210
We know that their combined
pull upwards, the combined

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.500
pull of the two vertical tension
components has to

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.770
offset the force of gravity
pulling down because this

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.130
point is stationary.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.310
So we know these two y
components, when you add them

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.210
together, the combined tension
in the vertical direction has

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.680
to be 10 Newtons.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.240
Because it's offsetting
this force of gravity.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.990
So what's this y component?

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.970
Well, this was T1
of cosine of 30.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.140
This should start to become a
little second nature to you

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.180
that this is T1 sine of 30, this
y component right here.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.570
So T1-- Let me write it here.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:34.875
T1 sine of 30 degrees plus this
vector, which is T2 sine

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.820
of 60 degrees.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.910
You could review your
trigonometry and your

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.650
SOH-CAH-TOA.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.830
Frankly, I think, just seeing
what people get confused on is

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.680
the trigonometry.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.340
But you can review the trig
modules and maybe some of the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.370
earlier force vector modules
that we did.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.100
And hopefully, these
will make sense.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.460
I'm skipping a few steps.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.870
And these will equal
10 Newtons.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.370
And let's rewrite this up here
where I substitute the values.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.650
So what's the sine of 30?

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.180
Actually, let me do
it right here.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.400
What's the sine of 30 degrees?

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:15.000
The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 so
we get 1/2 T1 plus the sine

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.420
of 60 degrees, which is square
root of 3 over 2.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.150
Square root of 3 over
2 T2 is equal to 10.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.850
And then I don't like
this, all these 2's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.780
and this 1/2 here.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.850
So let's multiply this
whole equation by 2.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.170
So 2 times 1/2, that's 1.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.940
So you get T1 plus the square
root of 3 T2 is equal to, 2

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.400
times 10 , is 20.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.330
Similarly, let's take this
equation up here and let's

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.520
multiply this equation by 2
and bring it down here.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.980
So this is the original
one that we got.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.630
So if we multiply this whole
thing by 2-- I'll do it in

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.130
this color so that
you know that

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.230
it's a different equation.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.410
So if you multiply square root
of 3 over 2 times 2-- I'm just

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.350
doing this to get rid of the
2's in the denominator.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:10.360
So you get square root of 3 T1
minus T2 is equal to 0 because

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.080
0 times 2 is 0.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.410
And let's see what
we could do.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.960
What if we take this top
equation because we want to

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.790
start canceling out some terms.
Let's take this top

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.880
equation and let's multiply
it by-- oh, I don't know.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.620
Let's multiply it by the
square root of 3.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:36.740
So you get the square
root of 3 T1.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.950
I'm taking this top equation
multiplied by the

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.320
square root of 3.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.680
This is just a system
of equations

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.100
that I'm solving for.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.990
And the square root of 3
times this right here.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.030
Square root of 3 times square
root of 3 is 3.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:54.200
So plus 3 T2 is equal to
20 square root of 3.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.600
And now what I want to do is
let's-- I know I'm doing a lot

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.160
of equation manipulation here.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.380
But this is just hopefully, a
review of algebra for you.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.590
Let's subtract this equation
from this equation.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.960
So you can also view it as
multiplying it by negative 1

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.300
and then adding the 2.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.930
So when you subtract this from
this, these two terms cancel

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.620
out because they're the same.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.010
And so then you're left with
minus T2 from here.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:31.170
Minus this, minus 3 T2 is equal
to 0 minus 20 square

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.490
roots of 3.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:40.460
And so this becomes minus 4 T2
is equal to minus 20 square

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.480
roots of 3.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.930
And then, divide both sides by
minus 4 and you get T2 is

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:52.320
equal to 5 square roots
of 3 Newtons.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.150
So that's the tension
in this wire.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.090
And now we can substitute
and figure out T1.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.460
Let's use this formula
right here because it

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.120
looks suitably simple.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.160
So we have the square root
of 3 times T1 minus T2.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.960
Well T2 is 5 square
roots of 3.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.950
5 square roots of
3 is equal to 0.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.860
So we have the square root of
3 T1 is equal to five square

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.060
roots of 3.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.370
Divide both sides by square
root of 3 and you get the

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.010
tension in the first wire
is equal to 5 Newtons.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.880
So this is pulling with a force
or tension of 5 Newtons.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.150
Or a force.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.460
And this is pulling-- the second
wire --with a tension

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.990
of 5 square roots
of 3 Newtons.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.430
So this wire right
here is actually

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.410
doing more of the pulling.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.670
It's actually more of the force
of gravity is ending up

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.650
on this wire.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.820
That makes sense because
it's steeper.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.800
So since it's steeper,
it's contributing

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.970
more to the y component.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.600
It's good whenever you do these
problems to kind of do a

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.520
reality check just to make sure
your numbers make sense.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.800
And if you think about it,
their combined tension is

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.490
something more than
10 Newtons.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.750
And that makes sense because
some of the force that they're

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.940
pulling with is wasted against
pulling each other in the

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.520
horizontal direction.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.150
Anyway, I'll see you all
in the next video.
