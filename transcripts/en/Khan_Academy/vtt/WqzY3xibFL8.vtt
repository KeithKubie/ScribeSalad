00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:02.502
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.920
is introduce ourselves

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.670
to the quotient rule.

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:08.854
And we're not going to
prove it in this video.

00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:10.837
In a future video we can prove
it using the product rule

00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:13.581
and we'll see it has some
similarities to the product rule.

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:15.681
But here, we'll learn about what it is

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.032
and how and where to actually apply it.

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:20.639
So for example

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.803
if I have some function F of X

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:25.019
and it can be expressed as the quotient

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.125
of two expressions.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.324
So let's say

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:28.157
U of X

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:30.074
over V of X.

00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:34.233
Then the quotient rule tells us

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.374
that F prime of X

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:38.101
is going to be equal to

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:39.753
and this is going to look
a little bit complicated

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:41.496
but once we apply it, you'll hopefully

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:43.320
get a little bit more comfortable with it.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.041
Its going to be equal to the derivative

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:46.635
of the numerator function.

00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:48.404
U prime of X.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:51.051
Times the denominator function.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.292
V of X.

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:53.125
Minus

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:56.482
the numerator function.

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.315
U of X.

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:00.654
Do that in that blue color.

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:01.487
U of X.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.870
Times the derivative of
the denominator function

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.168
times V prime of X.

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.913
And this already looks very
similar to the product rule.

00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:11.998
If this was U of X times V of X

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:14.040
then this is what we would
get if we took the derivative

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.258
this was a plus sign.

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:16.809
But this is here, a minus sign.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:17.900
But were not done yet.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.817
We would then divide by

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.723
the denominator function squared.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:24.556
V of X

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:27.880
squared.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.510
So let's actually apply this idea.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.659
So let's say that we have F of X

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.393
is equal to

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:37.646
X squared

00:01:37.646 --> 00:01:39.063
over cosine of X.

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.371
Well what could be our U of X

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:43.774
and what could be our V of X?

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:44.902
Well, our U of X

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:46.417
could be our X squared.

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:47.834
So that is U of X

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.407
and U prime of X would be equal to two X.

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:56.243
And then this could be our V of X.

00:01:56.243 --> 00:01:57.743
So this is V of X.

00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.961
And V prime of X.

00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.117
The derivative of cosine
of X with respect to X

00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:06.171
is equal to negative sine of X.

00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.844
And then we just apply this.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:09.154
So based on that

00:02:09.154 --> 00:02:10.154
F prime of X

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:12.726
is going to be equal to

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:15.156
the derivative of the numerator function

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:18.353
that's two X, right over
here, that's that there.

00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:19.639
So it's gonna be two X

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.591
times the denominator function.

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.972
V of X is just cosine of X

00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:25.472
times cosine of X.

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:27.306
Minus

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.676
the numerator function

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:32.014
which is just X squared.

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:33.605
X squared.

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.518
Times the derivative of
the denominator function.

00:02:36.518 --> 00:02:37.935
The derivative of cosine of X

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:39.561
is negative sine X.

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:40.918
So, negative

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:41.751
sine of X.

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:45.240
All of that over

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.573
all of that over

00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:49.902
the denominator function squared.

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.256
So that's cosine of X

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.070
and I'm going to square it.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.963
I could write it, of course, like this.

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:57.320
Actually, let me write it like that

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.678
just to make it a little bit clearer.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.362
And at this point, we
just have to simplify.

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:04.134
This is going to be equal to

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:05.785
let's see, we're gonna get

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.785
two X times cosine of X.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.377
Two X

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:11.377
cosine of X.

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:15.328
Negative times a negative is a positive.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.578
Plus, X squared

00:03:18.084 --> 00:03:19.639
X squared

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.972
times sine of X.

00:03:21.913 --> 00:03:23.297
Sine

00:03:23.297 --> 00:03:24.304
of X.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.637
All of that over

00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.310
cosine of X squared.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.280
Which I could write like this, as well.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.414
And we're done.

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:33.826
You could try to simplify it, in fact,

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:36.654
there's not an obvious way
to simplify this any further.

00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.257
Now what you'll see in the future

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:39.662
you might already know something called

00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:42.000
the chain rule, or you might
learn it in the future.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.749
But you could also do the quotient rule

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.529
using the product and the chain rule

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.167
that you might learn in the future.

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:48.558
But if you don't know the chain rule yet,

00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:50.475
this is fairly useful.
