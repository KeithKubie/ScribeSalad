1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,270
Now I'm already off fucking track. You
know what my fucking bank did to me?

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,060
I walked in, I had this account
in New York that I kind of, uh,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,570
it was a little checking account.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,250
I had a little bit of money and then
all of a sudden notice they were taking

5
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,150
some fees out. I'm like, well, that
shouldn't be. So I get to New York,

6
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,270
I walk in, I talked to the douchebag
who works there and he goes, yeah,

7
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,410
they're taking $27 a month out.
I don't know why that is. Here.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,260
Let me check to see what's up. Click
and click. I'll check on this thing.

9
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:28,950
And he goes, yeah, we shouldn't have
been doing that. And I go, okay,

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,220
well can you refund the money? And they
go, absolutely. Uh, and I go, well,

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,910
you know, I've had the
account for like six years.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,450
Can we see how long you've been doing
this? And he's like, I'm sorry, our,

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,980
our records only go back
for four months. Really?

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,210
It only goes back for four months.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,320
It's amazing because my bank records at
home go back the entire time I've had

16
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,550
the account and that's incredible.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,230
And I just have some pithily some in
there while you deal with hundreds of

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,910
millions of dollars, if not
billions, if not trillions.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,010
I don't know what the fuck you have.

20
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,640
I just know there's a fucking Bank
of yours in every God damn state now.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,820
But of course it only goes back like
four months. So I go, all right,

22
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:08,350
well what if I bring my records in?

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,650
I look them over and I find out
how long have you been doing it?

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,030
And they're like, no, he can only
refund it for four months. I'm like,

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,330
two, what are you talking
about? And he goes, yeah,

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,560
well the bank kind of looks at it
like that, that that was on you.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,680
What do you, and I was
like, it's on me to not to,

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,740
to not be like paying attention to make
sure that people are supposed to be

29
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,920
keeping my money safe, aren't
fucking stealing from me.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,840
And He sorta like laughed. I'm like, dude,
this isn't funny. This is ridiculous.

31
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:40,140
You guys just stole from me. And if
you've been doing it for six years,

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,860
what's that? 270 bucks stare
at another fucking Nav. 50,

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,050
like almost 300 bucks
a year for six years.

34
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,600
That's like 1500 to 1800
bucks somewhere in there.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,100
And the guy's just sitting there
fucking laughing and a, you know,

36
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,320
they say usual shit. Yeah. What
are you gonna Sue us? Go ahead.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,360
We'll take some of that bail out money,

38
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,520
which is part of your tax
money and we'll fucking, uh,

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,020
so I dunno what I'm going to do.

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,640
I'm going to close out the
account and uh, and I dunno,

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,301
what do I do then?

42
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:10,910
I go across the street to one of
the bet for banks that are left.

43
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,530
If anybody out there is in banking,

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,560
how do I get my money back
beyond the four months?

45
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:19,070
Cause I know that they've been
doing it longer than this. Um,

46
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,030
can anybody explain that?
You know, this is why people,

47
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,110
this is why you don't put 100% of
your paycheck into the fucking bank.

48
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:30,410
He got to look at it this way.
If somebody mugged you last week,

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,150
would you walk up to the same person
and take your paycheck and stick it in

50
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,160
their back pockets? You
wouldn't, would you?

51
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,880
But for some reason we have these
fucking bankers. Yeah, I dunno.

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
I think everybody should
turn like, I don't know.

53
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:49,900
Everybody should have a fucking
safe that you have buried somewhere

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,790
everyday, but he's got a gun in.
Anybody can blow anybody away. I know.

55
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,730
It's all fucked up. Fucking assholes.

56
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,940
The guys sit in there fucking
smiling. Nobody sitting there doing,

57
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,590
he's doing that little twirly thing.

58
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,730
You know that math people do with their
pens and people who are in to finances.

59
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,950
I think they do it to
hypnotize you. It says,

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,370
the guy's fucking sitting there telling
me that they've been stealing 30 bucks a

61
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:15,340
month from me and all I'm doing
is I'm trying to focus on him.

62
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:19,450
I keep looking down at his silver
shiny pen, some sort of mind trick.

63
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,370
Fortunately I was aware of it. I said,
can you stop toiling your fucking pen?

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,740
But I didn't want to do that cause
I was trying to keep my cool,

65
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,930
which obviously is a difficult
thing for me to do, you know?

66
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,410
I don't know right now bill,

67
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,700
it's just 27 bucks a month times how
many fucking people you remember superman

68
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,820
three. When Richard Pryor stole half
a cent from everybody in the next day.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,470
You had a fucking Ferrari.

70
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,410
These Fox are taking 27 bucks a month
from everybody. I'm convinced of it.

71
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,210
It's the fucking mob.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,810
I swear to God the mob went legit
or those there will be blood guys.

73
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,030
They the fucking assholes
and run the Goddamn bags.

74
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,800
He's fucking constant just stealing
from me and there's nobody getting,

75
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,710
nobody's gonna help me. What
am I going to go down there?

76
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,060
I'm going to get that guy used to be
on the fucking, uh, leave it to beaver.

77
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,470
What the fuck was the name of that show?
Uh, Mayberry. I always hated that show,

78
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,420
that old content walking around with
their false set of voice. [inaudible]

79
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:14,900
okay.

80
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,250
You know, you know what? That show
lacked somebody that I wanted to bang.

81
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,540
That's why I didn't watch it.
There was nobody fuckable on it.

82
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,170
That was the brilliance of the
monsters that they were like,

83
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,160
this is going to be hilarious.

84
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:34,730
We're going to turn fucking Frankenstein
into drag and Dracula into these Kooky

85
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:37,250
characters and it's all going to be funny.

86
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:42,251
But they knew at the end of the day
they had to be somebody that a male

87
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:44,660
demographic would want to fuck.

88
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,690
So they came up with that
girl who was allegedly ugly.

89
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:50,330
Why am I explaining this
classic show? You know the deal.

90
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,130
And she looked like Marilyn Monroe
and that's what kept me in there.

91
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,470
I Dunno. All right. Batman.
After a while it's like,

92
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,580
do what is going on with this
40 year old guy in his ward

93
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,750
and then all of a sudden they had cat
woman walking around that fucking Horry

94
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,850
outfit. Is she the one
who started that shit?

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,360
Did women not dress like whores on uh,

96
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,840
on Halloween before Batman
or a bad girl or cat woman?

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,170
Cat woman was a bad one.
Right? This such pathetic cons,

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,770
you know what I mean? It's, we take
off that fucking ridiculous outfit.

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,650
Go stand behind a wall and, and,

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,690
and start talking to people and listen
to how many people even fucking pay

101
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:41,360
attention to you. They don't
cause you got nothing to say.

102
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:46,361
All you can do is just dress up your
God damn Twat and start strutting around

103
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:50,410
the fucking place that had
nothing to do with cat.

104
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:51,950
Woman had nothing to do with her.

105
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,060
It had to do with me fucking get fucked
over by that Goddamn bag. Assholes,

106
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,470
fucking asshole son. I got to go down
there. I got to go down there like,

107
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:05,471
like some fucking guy whose button
store just failed after 75 years.

108
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,190
You know, Frankie fish face and
sons remember those fucking um,

109
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,040
those businesses when you were
a kid, it was always something,

110
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,100
something and sons, you know,

111
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:22,510
and like a lot of the times the kids
were forced into the business. You know,

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,270
some Italian guy, he opens a fucking
prosciutto shop and then that's it.

113
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,900
It's like an arranged marriage except
that your job then you've got to show up

114
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,920
and be good and well, I have been
working in that ass, Toronto,

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,820
they did y'all Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah. You know,

116
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,630
they don't know shit about anything else
is everybody wanted to strike out on

117
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,790
their own and now look,

118
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,060
everybody ends up in a fucking cubicle
working for these fucking cops who are

119
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,890
stealing my money. That's
uplifting, isn't it?
