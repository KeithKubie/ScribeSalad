00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.684
Narrator: I do want to
clarify that the whole point

00:00:02.684 --> 00:00:04.416
that I'm showing these
weaknesses in Fractional

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:06.744
Reserve lending isn't to argue that it

00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:09.250
necessarily has to go away or that it is

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.802
somehow unviable.

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.670
It's clearly viable,
it's the system that most

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.669
market economies, actually
all that I know of,

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.005
use today.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.666
The reason why I am
doing it is to show that

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.875
it's not the only type
of system that we really

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.493
should scrutinize any
systems that we have in place

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:27.162
to realize that they
aren't a law of physics,

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:29.742
that we have to have
Fractional Reserve lending.

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:31.999
That in order to have this system function

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.400
there has to be engineering in place

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.543
and there still are some drawbacks,

00:00:36.543 --> 00:00:38.936
the un-stability in order to combat that

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.004
you need to have central bank insurance

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.478
and you also have to have the central bank

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:45.231
as a lender of last resort of reserves.

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.333
The bad incentives ... and these are

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.673
well documented, these
aren't just coming from me.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:53.332
Bad incentives, if you
were looking to invest

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.091
in any other type of investment company,

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:56.584
someone who is taking your money

00:00:56.584 --> 00:00:58.396
and investing it on your behalf,

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:00.085
they would typically be talking about how

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:01.799
good they are at investing money.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.087
Most, when you're looking
at Commerical banks

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:05.471
that's not what they're talking about

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:06.935
because they know that
that's not what consumers

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:08.799
care about because of the insurance there.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.265
They will talk about
things like how easy it is

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.601
to access your money with their ATM's

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:15.064
and their online banking,

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:17.087
how low their fees are.

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:18.462
They won't even bring up the idea that

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:20.339
hey, we're lending your
money and we're lending it

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:23.136
in really, really, responsible ways.

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:24.739
It is also well documented by having a

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:26.277
Fractional Reserve lending system,

00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:28.825
it is putting a significant
amount of the money

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:31.824
creation system, essentially
the checkable deposits,

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.267
it's putting it in the
hands of private banks

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.109
as opposed to the central
banking authority.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.868
With that out of the way
you're probably saying

00:01:39.868 --> 00:01:41.731
are there any other alternatives.

00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.266
I'm not advocating one or the other,

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.801
but I'm just showing you that this is not

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:47.265
necessarily the only
way that we would have

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:49.062
to set up our banking system.

00:01:49.062 --> 00:01:51.346
In fact, the original
way is the alternative.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:54.536
The original way would
be Full Reserve banking.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:59.840
(writing) full, full
reserve, reserve banking.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.550
It is exactly what it sounds like,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.842
which is that a bank would have to ...

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:06.668
if someone puts reserve or cash dollar

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.602
or federal reserve notes in their demand

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:12.004
deposit account then the
bank would just have to

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:13.321
keep it there.

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.335
If I have a bank, right over here,

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.406
(drawing) If I have a bank

00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.811
and if I were to put $3.

00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:24.606
(drawing) $3, 3 federal reserve notes here

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:27.273
3 federal reserve notes here.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:29.901
If I were to say that this is in my ...

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:31.481
I want to have this on demand.

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:33.225
I want to be able to go to the bank at any

00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:35.269
moment in time and be able
to take these things out

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.397
then the bank would have to keep all

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:38.798
of these reserves there.

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:41.297
You might say, well then
how will lending happen

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:42.528
and all the rest?

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.133
In order for lending to
happen the bank would

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.880
have to say hey, look,
you're not going to need

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.466
them to have all of this on demand,

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:51.003
why don't you keep some
fraction of this on demand,

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:55.310
maybe it's this dollar
bill right over here

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.930
and the rest of these, we, the bank,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.678
will literally borrow that from you.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.421
This isn't an actual foreign concept.

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:02.260
When you go buy a certificate of deposit

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.600
at a bank, when you put your money in a CD

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.796
at the bank that's essentially
what the bank is doing.

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:08.533
They are borrowing that money from you,

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:09.863
they're making it explicit.

00:03:09.863 --> 00:03:10.966
They're not saying that that money will be

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:11.837
on demand.

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.397
They're saying this is a timed deposit

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:16.141
that this money, you
are giving it to us now

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:17.885
and then you can get it back in 6 months,

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.811
or a year, or 2 years or whatever.

00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:20.884
Usually the longer the duration,

00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:23.040
the longer you keep your
money ... you lock your

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.723
money in with them the higher the interest

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:25.719
they would pay.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.883
They'll say, look, this is on demand

00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:30.056
(writing) This is on demand, that's in a

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:31.386
demand deposit.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.452
Then this right over here,
you will loan it to us,

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:36.044
this is a time deposit.

00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:38.055
(writing) This is a time deposit.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.872
Then the bank could loan this money out.

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:43.789
It could loan these reserves out.

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.290
This loan process would not increase

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.323
the money supply, so that
money could be loaned

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:51.656
out maybe to someone
else and maybe that gets

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:53.723
deposited in another bank
and maybe in a demand

00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:58.322
deposit, it gets deposited right over here

00:03:58.322 --> 00:04:00.185
in a demand deposit.

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:01.627
You might say, well isn't this just like

00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:02.872
Fractional Reserve lending?

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:04.877
Now you have $5 in the system.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:08.461
The difference is, is
that no one can now use

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:12.462
this perceived money
right over here as money.

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:14.530
You wouldn't be able to write checks

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.701
against this money right over here.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.589
You could write it against this over here

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.451
and that's okay.

00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:20.320
You could write a $1 check and it's backed

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.990
by this $1 of reserves so you're not

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.518
creating any new money.

00:04:24.518 --> 00:04:25.922
The only reserves here that really can

00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:29.116
act as money or be used to back checks

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:31.977
are now the original $3.

00:04:31.977 --> 00:04:35.192
(writing) The original $3 here.

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.190
The value of this type of a system,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.562
and there are drawbacks to it,

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:40.516
the main drawback is, that the bank is not

00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:42.396
going to be able to make any money on its

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:45.592
demand deposits so it
will probably have to

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:47.557
charge higher fees to customers to

00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:49.148
keep their money.

00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:50.317
They'll say, hey I'm
safeguarding your money,

00:04:50.317 --> 00:04:51.780
I'm putting it in a vault for you,

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.920
I'm making it accessible
to you through checks,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.251
through ATM's so I'm going to charge you

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.984
more money for me to essentially

00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:00.134
safeguard your money.

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:01.463
Right now what banks are doing

00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:03.792
and Fractional Reserves system is like,

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.659
hey, we'll do all of
these services for you

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.296
for a lot less, sometimes even free if you

00:05:08.296 --> 00:05:10.053
keep a large enough deposit with them.

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:11.719
We're going to hold your money for you,

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.388
we're going to keep it accessible on ATM,

00:05:14.388 --> 00:05:16.793
we're going to give you a bank ATM card

00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:18.720
and all of these things.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.627
The reason why the bank is able to do that

00:05:20.627 --> 00:05:22.253
is because they're essentially doing ...

00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:24.127
they're lending out a
significant fraction of

00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:25.938
your money and getting interest on it

00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:27.389
and that's how they're making money.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.512
Here it just becomes much more explicit.

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:32.027
The bank is saying, look,
on this right over here

00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:34.176
we are doing a service
for you, we are holding

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:36.265
your money, we are keeping it on demand

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:38.068
from wherever you want to access it

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:39.859
and over here you are
doing a service for us,

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:41.300
you are lending us your money

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.959
and then we are going
to lend it out probably

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.653
for higher interest so
that way we can make

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:48.503
money off of it.

00:05:48.503 --> 00:05:50.056
Obviously if we were
to convert to some type

00:05:50.056 --> 00:05:52.995
of a system like this,
there wouldn't be as

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:56.398
much money being created
or actually no money

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.928
would be created by this lending process.

00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:01.483
So, the central bank
or whoever the monetary

00:06:01.483 --> 00:06:02.996
authority is in the country would have to

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:05.428
essentially print more
money to have the money

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:07.796
available to essentially be the grease

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:09.198
in the economy.

00:06:09.198 --> 00:06:11.696
Just to make it clear
that this isn't a fringe

00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:14.994
idea, that this is
essentially what banking was

00:06:14.994 --> 00:06:16.587
until the mid 14th Century.

00:06:16.587 --> 00:06:18.727
It was the Venetian bankers
who first brought up

00:06:18.727 --> 00:06:20.453
the idea of Fractional Reserve lending

00:06:20.453 --> 00:06:22.390
and there were some very mainstream banks

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.975
that did full reserve
lending into the 1800s.

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:29.411
As The Great Depression
got longer and longer,

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:32.742
in 1939 some very serious
economists proposed

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:37.056
a reversion back to Full Reserve banking.

00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:39.464
They even articulated
exactly how it would do

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:43.396
and how it would not introduce too many

00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:46.479
interruptions to the economy.

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.152
Although, anything like
this would be dangerous

00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:50.819
because you introducing
a whole new way of doing

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.479
things and you don't know exactly what

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.105
the repercussions will be on the economy.

00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:55.465
If you want to read their proposal

00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:56.733
it's actually quite fascinating.

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.666
In just reading their proposal you'll get

00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:00.666
more depth on how the
monetary system works.

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.750
It's written by mainstream economists.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.235
Do a Google search for

00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:07.735
A Program for Monetary Reform.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.803
(writing) ... for
Monetary, monetary Reform.

00:07:12.803 --> 00:07:16.256
It was written in 1939, so you can also do

00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:17.626
a Google for that.

00:07:17.626 --> 00:07:19.393
On Wikipedia there is
actually the full text

00:07:19.393 --> 00:07:21.658
of A Program for Monetary Reform.
