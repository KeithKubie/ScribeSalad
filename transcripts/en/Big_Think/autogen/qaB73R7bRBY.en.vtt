the requirement of individual guilt make
it impossible for us to use the

threats against suicide terrorists
that's why we need to move in

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
that's why we need to move in
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.810
that's why we need to move in
preemptively that's what we have to stop

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
preemptively that's what we have to stop
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.279

lion you don't reason with a lion you
don't try to deter a lion you stop the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
don't try to deter a lion you stop the
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.319
don't try to deter a lion you stop the
lion by either building a cage between

has been adapted to the use against
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.870
has been adapted to the use against
suicide terrorism so that's the problem

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
suicide terrorism so that's the problem
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789
suicide terrorism so that's the problem
we haven't figured out a solution to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
we haven't figured out a solution to
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.609
we haven't figured out a solution to
that because our usual approach the rule

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
that because our usual approach the rule
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.020
that because our usual approach the rule
of law doesn't work we need to create a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
of law doesn't work we need to create a
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.380
of law doesn't work we need to create a
new rule of law to govern the use of

new rule of law to govern the use of
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.429
new rule of law to govern the use of
suicide terrorism my optimism grows out

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
suicide terrorism my optimism grows out
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.370
suicide terrorism my optimism grows out
