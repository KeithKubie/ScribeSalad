00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.291
One of the aspects of Emory that as a community 

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:16.709
 we feel really good about, despite the fact that it sometimes makes us feel really bad,

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:18.875
 is that we have difficult conversations.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:24.041
 Difficult conversations are conversations about topics that don't necessarily come up

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.041
 or topics where people don't want to listen to each other 

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:34.000
or people want to demonstrate that their way of looking at it is really the best and only way to look at something.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.792
   As we have been having difficult conversations,

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:40.875
 we also realized, and I truly mean the we collectively, 

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:45.166
that once you have even a diverse community as Emory, 

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.208
talking about difficult topics,

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.291
 you still live within a bubble

00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:54.208
 and you don't get the full sense of what the rest of the world thinks. 

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:58.333
So with tremendous support we decided to launch 

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:02.000
C  onversations with America as difficult conversations

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.125
 to understand what does the rest of the world think and how do we align with that?

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:14.667
 These conversations have helped us not only to understand how we don't have as complete a perspective as we think we do. 

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.083
One of the features of universities is we’re all smart people, 

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.959
we know how to look at evidence, we know what questions to ask. 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.250
We can debate and at the end of the day we know what the answers are. 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.500
That’s not the case. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.792
We are very fortunate that Peter Hart who is with NBC and The Wall Street Journal

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:35.583
 has agreed to go into the country and have focus groups with random people

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:39.208
 to get an understanding of what people think. 

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:46.542
And that has been incredibly impactful because the topics that have come up have ranged from the presidential election 

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:51.709
and the outcome because that’s when we first started having these conversations. To issues around 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.542
migration and immigration, issues around health and health issues, 

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.542
the emerging opioid epidemic.

00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:02.333
  And closer to home, the value of higher education 

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.875
and the way in which people think about that today.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:09.542
There’s such a polarization that people don't even want to listen to each other anymore. 

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:14.083
And what that does is then you only listen to people who agree with you 

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:17.750
and the rest of the people are ignored. And before you know it, 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.000
we have thousands of choirs as opposed to one choir. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.583
And for us to be good, we need to have one choir 

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.917
where people at least listen to each other. 

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:31.917
So there is tremendous value short-term  by recognizing that that’s the case 

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:37.709
and sorting through what does this mean for our students, what does it mean when I say I know this for sure?

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.250
What evidence do you have,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.417
 is it emotional or is there something that is more grounded in what you would expect as a college student we are trying to teach you here? 

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:51.875
So there’s an impact not just about learning about the topic 

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:58.750
at that point in time, but also learning about so how do I interact with people that think differently than I do?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.250
What do I learn about myself in the process, 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250
how do I need to change?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.000
 Maybe I’m the narrow-minded one. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.750
Where is the common ground? Now that’s very important, but it also will help long-term 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.041
because it means that we will have students that will go out in the world who are trained to think that way. 

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.667
And that means that we together will start looking for solutions 

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.417
and that’s what we need so much in the world nowadays. 

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:29.667
We have problems, we talk about the problems. We’ve almost lost the desire or become hopeless about finding solutions 

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.667
and difficult conversations will get us there.
