00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.238
It's true that three plus one is than or equal to four. It's also true that

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.834
three plus one is greater than or equal to four, but it's not true that three

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:17.290
plus one is not equal to four. These values are right on the boundary. We would

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.844
call this an edge case for this condtion. Its right at the edge of the values

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:26.230
that make the condition true or false. When you're writing conditions its

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.874
really easy to make little slips. Especially for the values right on the edge

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:35.630
of the range we want. Its wise to always test a couple of values like this.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.382
That way if you miscategorize the case right on the edge you'll find out about

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:43.058
it soon. And be able to fix it.
