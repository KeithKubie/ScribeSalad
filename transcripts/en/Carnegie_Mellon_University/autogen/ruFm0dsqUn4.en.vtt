world well one of the things I was

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
world well one of the things I was
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420
world well one of the things I was
really fortunate to do coming out of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
really fortunate to do coming out of
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039
really fortunate to do coming out of
Carnegie Mellon was had the opportunity

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
Carnegie Mellon was had the opportunity
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.300
Carnegie Mellon was had the opportunity
to go to Wall Street for a number of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
to go to Wall Street for a number of
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340
to go to Wall Street for a number of
years and one of the things i found was

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
years and one of the things i found was
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.899
years and one of the things i found was
that being an engineer from Carnegie

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
that being an engineer from Carnegie
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.340
that being an engineer from Carnegie
Mellon it was such a well known and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
Mellon it was such a well known and
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289
Mellon it was such a well known and
recognized school that there was an

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
recognized school that there was an
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.200
recognized school that there was an
assumption that a Carnegie Mellon

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
assumption that a Carnegie Mellon
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179
assumption that a Carnegie Mellon
graduate represented someone who could

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
graduate represented someone who could
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740
graduate represented someone who could
think well on their feet and it would

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
think well on their feet and it would
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.030
think well on their feet and it would
work really hard and I found that to be

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
work really hard and I found that to be
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.069
work really hard and I found that to be
the case yeah I find that to be the case

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
the case yeah I find that to be the case
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.289
the case yeah I find that to be the case
too especially when you know I talked to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
too especially when you know I talked to
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420
too especially when you know I talked to
great people like you so tell me how do

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
great people like you so tell me how do
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.620
great people like you so tell me how do
you show your tart and pride when you're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
you show your tart and pride when you're
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.179
you show your tart and pride when you're
out there in the world well first and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
out there in the world well first and
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039
out there in the world well first and
foremost I think it's important having

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
foremost I think it's important having
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870
foremost I think it's important having
had the benefit of this experience of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
had the benefit of this experience of
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760
had the benefit of this experience of
this university that I get back there's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
this university that I get back there's
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350
this university that I get back there's
a lot of different ways to get back you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
a lot of different ways to get back you
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300
a lot of different ways to get back you
can give back through volunteer work you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
can give back through volunteer work you
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.190
can give back through volunteer work you
can get back obviously financially but

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
can get back obviously financially but
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810
can get back obviously financially but
also you can mentor and become part of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
also you can mentor and become part of
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.690
also you can mentor and become part of
the the Alumni Council as well and so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
the the Alumni Council as well and so
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789
the the Alumni Council as well and so
for me it was a matter of becoming part

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
for me it was a matter of becoming part
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.740
for me it was a matter of becoming part
of the Alumni Board and figuring out

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
of the Alumni Board and figuring out
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.220
of the Alumni Board and figuring out
ways to help enrich the institution
