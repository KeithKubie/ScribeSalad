CARRIE LAURENO:
Welcome to Google,

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.350
for those of us who
are visiting today.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.500
My name is Carrie Laurena.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.560
I am the founder of the
Google Veterans Network

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.940
and head up our veteran
outreach strategy here.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.139
Happy early Veterans Day
to everyone in the room.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.680
I feel like we're
among family today.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.950
I see so many familiar faces,
both people who work here

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.150
at Google, many of our
non-profit partners,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.460
distinguished guests
from the military.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.630
Thank you all for
being here today

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
in celebration of Veterans
Day and to help us here

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.630
at Google celebrate
the way we wanted to,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.170
which is working towards
our goal of bridging

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.500
the civil military divide.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.470
The reason that
we're here today is

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.000
to celebrate an exhibit
that opened on Friday

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.320
at the 9/11 Memorial Museum that
is called The Call to Serve,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.120
recognizing the extraordinary
service of our military

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.050
in the immediate wake
of the 9/11 attacks.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.240
After over a decade
of war and, everything

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.030
that happened in Iraq, the
immediate accomplishments

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.340
of our military, frankly,
were overshadowed,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.320
and there were so
many early successes

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.477
that are not brought
to the light of day.

00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:12.560
And we wanted to help bring
those stories to life,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.430
and to recognize
those individuals who

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.720
made really truly extraordinary
achievements and contributions

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.710
on behalf of all of us
who have not served.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.140
We were fortunate
enough to brainstorm

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.000
about this idea with Michael
Frazier, our friend and partner

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.820
at the 9/11 Museum,
the Executive Vice

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.372
President of Communications
and Marketing.

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:35.330
Where are you, Michael?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.450
In the back, of course.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.000
So Michael I had a conversation
a couple months ago.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.090
And we said, this is this
incredibly beautiful museum

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.730
that had just opened in May.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.310
What could we do in
advance of Veterans Day

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.580
to support the 9/11
Museum in their mission

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.050
to recognize the overwhelming
number of acts of compassion

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.720
in the wake of 9/11, which
is part of their mission?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.240
And we happen to have
some technology that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.919
helps people tell stories.

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:06.960
We launched it last year.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.610
It's called Google Tour
Builder, and it enables anyone

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.480
out there, any
aspiring storyteller,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.520
to drop a pin on a map,
add a little bit of copy

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.237
to that, up to 25 photos
and videos in one place,

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:20.570
pull it all together in a
beautiful storytelling format.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.950
And I like to joke that we built
this so that my mom could do it

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.910
without any assistance
for me whatsoever.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.690
It's really that easy
for any storyteller

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.250
to go in and talk
about their journey.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.695
And who has better stories
to tell than the military?

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:38.900
The most incredible
achievements in the most amazing

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.920
far off places that most of us
never have a chance to visit.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.410
And what if we
could work together,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.430
the 9/11 Museum and Google, to
bring those stories to life,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.740
to bring them to museum,
and to bring them

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.390
into the public
eye at a time when

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.030
the public is tiring of the war.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.330
And there are a lot
of other stories

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.630
that are out there
about service members.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.200
What if we can convince-- coerce
in the most positive way--

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.180
some of our most humble service
members, who truly have done

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.130
amazing things, to share their
stories in a way that might

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.600
inspire other service
members to do the same.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.781
I've learned an important
lesson from a friend and partner

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:20.280
of ours.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.180
Colonel Jim Eisenhower, who is
at the Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.050
and runs the reintegration
office for that team,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.480
has taught me a lesson
that service members

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.020
return to communities.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.980
And we want communities
to be a place that

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.250
are welcoming to our service
members and their families

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.710
so that as they face
those difficult chapters

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.850
of transition that
are ahead of them,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.850
that there's greater
awareness and understanding

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.700
about those issues, and
that service members feel

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.670
good about going
home and are embraced

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.830
by the people who
do care about them

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.970
the most in very
practical, tangible ways.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.639
So we're going to talk a little
bit about all that today.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.930
We're going to share with
you some of the exhibit here,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.810
encourage all of you
go down to the museum

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.025
this week during Veterans
Week to see it before Friday.

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.650
And if you haven't
been able to see it,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.370
you can check it out online at
911memorial.org/calltoserve.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.970
That will be there
in perpetuity,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.429
and a wonderful tribute
to the gentlemen

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:20.220
that you're going to
meet in a few minutes.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.140
So without further ado, I'd
like to invite all of our guests

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.460
onstage to join us.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.590
Ladies and gentlemen, please
meet your storytellers

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.867
and these incredible
service members.

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:57.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.200
So from the look of it, I
was asking Colonel Collins

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.832
if there were any women who
served in Afghanistan in 2001.

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:07.040
And the answer's probably no.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.070
But I'm here to represent
all the women that

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.750
followed in their footsteps.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.100
So I'd like to start
with introductions.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.880
We have a large
group of people here.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.804
Everybody has a unique story.

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:20.970
I know these gentlemen
extremely well at this point,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.470
having worked with
them, and my team

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.500
having worked with them
to develop these stories.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.840
But they didn't know each
other until last night.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.070
And to bring a [INAUDIBLE]
together with a West Point

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.590
professor together with a
Marine Recon professional

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.350
and several Special
Forces guys was

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.350
a really interesting
experience last night.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.580
And in the spirit
of diversity, this

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.480
is your United
States military here.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.710
So let's start with
Brandon Brewer.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.980
I'm going to quickly
do introductions.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.090
Brandon was a US Coast Guard
veteran in the Public Affairs

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.869
office.

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.160
He was on duty a few blocks
from the World Trade Center

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.950
and witnessed the attacks
and the Maritime evacuation

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.320
of the city.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.090
He shot aerial photographs of
Ground Zero and the Homeland

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.190
Security efforts underway
there for several weeks,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.690
retired from the
Coast Guard in 2012,

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.514
and was telling me last
night how much he missed it.

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:21.680
So we'll ask you why you
miss it a little bit later.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.550
Next I'd like to introduce you
to Joe Quinn, US Army veteran.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.500
Joe is the Northeast
Regional Director

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.160
for Team Red,
White &amp; Blue, which

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.550
we are proud to be a partner
of this wonderful veterans'

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.270
service organization here in
New York and around the country.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.010
Joe was finishing his last
year at West Point when

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.160
Flight 11 crashed
into the North Tower,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.400
killing his brother James, who
worked at Cantor Fitzgerald.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.080
And prior to working with
Team Red, White &amp; Blue,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.390
he was an associate at the
Combating Terrorism Center,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.240

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.580
Military Academy at West Point.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.770
He also worked in Afghanistan
in counterinsurgency work.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.540
He spent six years in the
Army, two deployments in Iraq,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.741
and received his Master's
degree in Public Policy

00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:14.740
from the Kennedy School.

00:07:18.348 --> 00:07:20.840
Lieutenant Colonel Eric
Dill, US Marine Corps.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.680
Happy birthday, sir.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.660
For those who don't know, today
is-- where are the Marines?

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.160
Excellent.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.120
Lieutenant Colonel
Dill was conducting

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.620
training in Australia on 9/11.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.390
His unit immediately
deployed to prepare

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.894
for the invasion of Afghanistan.

00:07:38.894 --> 00:07:40.810
They were part of the
first conventional force

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.720
to enter the country, seizing
Kandahar International Airport.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.480
He began his military career

attended Texas Tech,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.910

as a Second Lieutenant,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.447
and had multiple,
multiple assignments.

00:07:58.447 --> 00:08:00.030
His service included

Thanks for making
the trip here today.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.335
Mark is the former Commander

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.679
to wrest Mazar-i-Sharif from the
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.289
ODA 595 is also known
as the Horse Soldiers,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.320
for those of you who've
heard about that group

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.230
of extraordinary men.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.049
Mark retired from the
Army and continues

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.540

book about his experiences.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.510
He wants to write it himself
from his perspective,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.640
along with his teammates.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.223
And that's something
that we're really

00:08:54.223 --> 00:08:57.090
excited to read
when it comes out.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.482

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.620
exercise in Hungary
when the towers fell.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.790
Less than a month later,
he deployed to Afghanistan

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.850
to hunt Taliban and
Al Qaeda targets.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.610
For his second operation, he
parachuted in from 18,000 feet.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.230
He is a career
Special Forces officer

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.950
who has served in a variety of
special operations assignments,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.100
combat operations in
Afghanistan, Iraq,

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.160
multiple deployments to
Bosnia, Africa, South America.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.940
He holds a Bachelor of Science
degree in Aerospace Engineering

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.290
from West Point, a Master in
Public Affairs from Princeton

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.470
University, my alma mater,
Woodrow Wilson School

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.440
of Public International Affairs,
and a doctorate from Princeton

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.800
as well.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.000
His research centers on military
innovation during times of war.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.140
And last but not least,
last but not least,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.360
Master Sergeant Eric Stubner.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.850
US Army Ranger, First
Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.940
from El Paso, Texas,
originally from North Dakota.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.020
Master Sergeant Stubner
had a boyhood dream

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.300
of becoming a ranger,
and he pursued this.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.110
He deployed to
Afghanistan in support

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.860
of Operation Anaconda, which
you'll hear more about.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.320
In all he completed 10
post-9/11 combat tours,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.570
six in Iraq and
four in Afghanistan.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.530
And he will retire from the
Army in a couple of weeks,

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.050
November 26.

00:11:18.047 --> 00:11:19.660
Here comes the
embarrassing part.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.090
Sergeant Stubner was awarded
the Silver Star Medal

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.740
for conspicuous
gallantry and intrepidity

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.420
in action while serving
as a squad leader

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.077
during combat
operations in support

00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:32.650
of and in this operation that
I mentioned called Anaconda.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.220
And it's something that
I'm excited for you all

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.640
to hear about and to know
about what happened there

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.150
and the actions that he took.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:46.240
So quite an amazing group
of people on this panel.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.990
Brandon, I'd love to start
with you and your journey.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.550
Tell us more about
where you were on 9/11

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.945
and where that took you
in terms of your service.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.410
BRANDON BREWER: OK.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.770
Well, I wasn't with
Yogi Berra, but I

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.470
figured if I'm going to talk
to people in New York, what

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.954
better New Yorker
to have next to me.

00:12:13.954 --> 00:12:15.370
I had a picture
with Scooter, too,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.060
so I had to flip a coin to
see if it was Yogi or Scooter.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:28.650
Like you said, I was on duty
here in New York during 9/11.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.599
If you've seen the tiny
little three-story building

00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:33.640
on one side of Battery
Park up against the water,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.880
that's the Coast Guard
building here in the city.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.930
And that's where I
was that morning.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:48.260
And I guess I can
kind of run through

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.942
a little quick chronology.

00:12:49.942 --> 00:12:51.150
I'm a little bit of a talker.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.816
Where's my wife?

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:52.792
She knows this.

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:53.500
She's a listener.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.041
I'm a talker.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.970
Like a lot of people
that were here that day,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.620
we didn't really know what
was going on at first.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:12.440
And I was there at the
Battery, and a co-worker

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.760
let us know that something
happened, that a plane had hit

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.090
the North Tower the
World Trade Center.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:24.400
And I think a lot of people
thought this was just

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.960
some kind of an accident, maybe
somebody had a small plane

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.260
and they went off course,
and it was just a very tragic

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.840
accident.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.240
And we quickly knew that it
wasn't when the second plane

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.330
hit, and so many people
then knew what happened.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:47.880
So as the day went on-- that's
Battery Park right there

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.930
on the screen, on the
earth side of the screen.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.880
So being in the city
and staying in the city

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.160
throughout that
chaotic day, we still

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.830
didn't fully realize
the significance

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.930
of what we were witnessing.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.910
And if you look at the photos
that are scrolling through

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.660
right there, you can see
a lot of the folks that

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.540
were trying to
evacuate the city.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.450
And this was happening
all around us.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.010
And what we didn't know-- we
knew that the Coast Guard was

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.140
helping to coordinate
the maritime component

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.580
of the evacuation, but
what we didn't know

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.980
was that in the course
of about eight hours,

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.000
a half million people
would be evacuated

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.630
by water, which is a
very amazing story.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.300
It's the biggest
maritime evacuation

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.880
in the history of the world.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.119
So that was a part of what we
were seeing going on around us.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:46.952
CARRIE LAURENO: Joe?

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.822
JOE QUINN: So I
was a Senior, what

00:14:52.822 --> 00:14:55.280
they call a first [INAUDIBLE]
at the United States Military

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.010
Academy at West
point at the time.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.790
I feel bad.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.220
We did an earlier version
of this at the 9/11 museum,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.965
and you hear a lot of the
same bad jokes coming at you.

00:15:06.965 --> 00:15:09.340
CARRIE LAURENO: Everybody here
was working earlier today.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.890
Not the same crowd.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.970
They're still good jokes.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.320
JOE QUINN: OK.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:12.820
Good.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.520
Good.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.950
No, but I was an English
major at West Point,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.899
which is kind of odd.

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:19.940
It's kind of an oxymoron.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.330
Yeah, and I'm also
from Brooklyn,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.460
which kind of adds to it.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.600
And the joke is that Walt
Whitman is also from Brooklyn,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.840
so take that.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.100
So yeah, I was in a Native
American Literature class.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.310
And then, kind of the
thing at West Point,

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.540
if you've ever been there,
it's like mice in a maze,

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.540
like everything's on clockwork.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.180
There's no spare time.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.620
And I remember leaving
class that day,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.300
and there was something
off about kind

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.610
of the movements of the cadets.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.430
And then I found myself
back to my barracks room,

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.420
where I was going
to hit the rack.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.330
That's what cadets do on
their down time, they sleep.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.960
Colonel Collins knows
this pretty well.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.850
And getting there, my roommate
saying, turn on the television.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.140
And television was
actually something new

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.980
at West Point at the time.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.930
And we had these
huge giant computers

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.970
that looked-- they were
the size of microwaves.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.980
Maybe something new to
younger Googlers here,

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.900
these old laptops.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.050
I remember clicking
and then seeing

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.133
what everyone else was
kind of seeing at the time,

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:27.960
just seeing the
Twin Towers on fire.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.310
And it really
didn't look that bad

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.970
from the size of the towers.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.560
That was my initial reaction.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.000
And talking to my mother later,
she would say-- her first words

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
out of her mouth was, oh
my goodness, we're at war

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.859
and my son's at West Point,
never really imagining

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:49.650
the unfathomable, was
that my brother Jimmy

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.190
worked in the North Tower
of the World Trade Center.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.760
He worked for a company called
Cantor Fitzgerald, which

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.400
lost all 658 of their employees.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.380
So I remember trying to get
out of West Point-- I finally

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.940
got out of West
Point the next day--

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.599
and going down to the
scene and just seeing

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.859
absolute destruction.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.360
I was telling Eric before
that I'd never saw destruction

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.530
that you looked up at
and not kind of down at.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.180
And then eventually making my
way back to my childhood home

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.290
in Marine Park, Brooklyn,
which was a neighborhood that

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.942
was a lot of firemen.

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.150
I mean, that was your choice.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.608
You were either a cop, fireman,
or if you were good at math

00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:29.080
you went to Wall Street.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.760
Which my brother
was terrible at math

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.600
but he was good at
bullshit, and so that's

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.430
how he got to Cantor Fitzgerald.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.820
But no, and then my world was
obviously turned upside down.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.960
But you know, one of the
things-- obviously this

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.668
is kind of a personal
nature, but I think

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.400
everyone's world
changed, especially

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.910
everyone that I'm privileged
to be up here with.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:59.330
So afterwards, with help
from a lot of understanding

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.220
professors, I
graduated West Point.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.690
And then within a
year and a half later,

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.330
I was in Iraq in 2003.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.384
And it was just--
it was incredible.

00:18:10.384 --> 00:18:11.800
What I didn't tell
you, I was also

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.960
recruited to play basketball at
West Point, which you probably

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.475
can obviously tell
by my physique.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.530
And I remember there's
just so many moments.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.990
We were started in
Fallujah, then Ramadi,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.170
and then hit-- and
then just kind of went

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:31.020
through Western Anbar
with the 3rd ACR, and just

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.130
rebuilding and moving on.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.979
And then I remember
just one of my soldiers

00:18:35.979 --> 00:18:38.270
saying-- you know, it was
just an incredible experience

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.900
being a 21-year-old
kid at West Point,

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.220
and then all of a sudden a year
later, here you are in Iraq.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:50.690
So that was kind of my
initial foray into combat.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.240
CARRIE LAURENO: Thank you.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.027
Colonel Dill?

00:18:54.027 --> 00:18:54.610
ERIC DILL: OK.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.430
So I was in Darwin, Australia
when 9/11-- it was actually

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.690
September 12, being on the other
side of the International Date

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.480
Line.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.910
What I was doing there, I was
part of a 3,000-man Marine unit

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.310
that was actually
forward deployed,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.650
had been training for the past
year to respond to a crisis

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.610
contingency type situation.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.270
Generally, Marine
expeditionary units,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.740
when they're called up
to respond to a crisis

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.000
or contingency, it's usually
there's unrest in a country,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.620
so they're evacuating an embassy
or something small scale,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.306
or a humanitarian assistance,
disaster response situation

00:19:39.306 --> 00:19:40.930
like a natural disaster
type situation.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.264
But in this situation, we
went from being prepared

00:19:48.264 --> 00:19:50.930
for something like that to going
into Afghanistan, which we were

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.830
also prepared for
conventional operations.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.739
But we had just finished
a week of training.

00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:58.780
We had been deployed about
a month at that point.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.120
And so we were on
the town that night,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.310
getting ready-- we were
going to leave the next day,

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.460
so we had a night of liberty.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.970
And we tried to go
into this one place.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.231
I'd been on the
compound with the guys

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.980
that we'd been training
with for the week.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.580
And they didn't have-- they
only had Australian rules

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.520
football on the TV.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.850
So as the news was coming in
we were kind of unaware of it.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.620
And we went out on the town.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.680
And we tried to
get into one place,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.030
and they told us no, the World
Trade Center had been bombed

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.010
was the word they used.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.480
And it didn't sound plausible.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.830
So we tried going in next door.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.810
We had actually been in
the place next door before

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.160
and it was a pretty
hopping place.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.640
And it was completely different
when we went in this time.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.780
There's a picture
of it right there.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.380
But it was a totally
different vibe.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.905
Everyone was kind of crowded
around these TV screens,

00:20:54.905 --> 00:20:55.655
these big screens.

00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:57.490
And I couldn't see
what was on the screen

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.281
because there was a
crowd in front of them,

00:20:59.281 --> 00:21:03.750
but I think the word I used this
morning is a hollow feeling,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.540
just because the way everyone
was looking at the screen,

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.270
I got that as I walked
in and I saw that.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.620
And as I made my way closer--
you know, you get close enough,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.500
you start to be able
see through the people.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.270
And once I got close enough
where I could actually

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.230
see the screens, the first
image I saw were the towers,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.290
and they were still
smoking at that point.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.136
And I turned to my
friend and said,

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:26.760
I think we need to
go back to the ship.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.830
And everything
changed after that.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:35.610
And I was in Pakistan a month
later and Afghanistan a month

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.310
after that.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.620
CARRIE LAURENO: And what
were you doing in Pakistan?

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.130
Was the object of
going-- most people think

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.780
that you would go
directly to Afghanistan.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.740
Why Pakistan?

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.156
ERIC DILL: Well,
what we had to do

00:21:48.156 --> 00:21:52.500
is we had to establish some
forward bases in Pakistan.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.570
And one of them was
at Jacobabad Airfield.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.530
There were a couple others.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:02.310
And it was at that
time allowing--

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.130
they were what we called
lily pads to enable forces

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:11.750
to build up in a somewhat benign
environment like Pakistan,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.730
and then be able to move
into Afghanistan from there.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.320
Also what they were
doing was it was a place

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.050
for fighters to divert that
were having emergencies.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:28.350
It was also a place for
some of the soft forces that

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.160
went in initially,
like especially

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.880
early to launch from there.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.900
I think maybe Liam
will get into that.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.830
I watched in jealousy
one night as the Rangers

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.430
and some other forces
refueled at Jacobabad

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:50.617
to go in and hit
Mullah Omar's house,

00:22:50.617 --> 00:22:51.700
the leader of the Taliban.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.090
So anyway-- that
answer your question?

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.110
CARRIE LAURENO: Absolutely.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.610
Mark?

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.590
MARK NUTCH: On 9/11, just
a few days before that,

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.070
I had completed two years
of my typical assignment

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:15.810
as a Special Forces Captain in
a Detachment Commander role.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.400
And we had deployed a lot
throughout the Middle East

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.310
and Central Asia.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.450
Prior to 9/11 my team
had spent a great deal

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:30.190
of months in Uzbekistan
working with the Uzbek Special

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.820
Forces, which is a typical
mission that our Special Forces

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.710
conducts working with
coalition partners

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.800
and such around the world.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.340
But these guys were already
at war, and this is in 2000,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.450
and they were fighting against
Al Qaeda-based affiliates

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.500
in the Central Asian states,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.860
Kyrgyzstan, and that area.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.570
On 9/11, my wife was
seven months pregnant

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.620
and I happened to be home
that morning with her.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.744
We had an OB
appointment, and we were

00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:04.910
getting ready to go to that.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.290
And so we saw what was
happening on the television,

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:15.840
and had a couple young boys
at home, then three and four.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.970
And they're seeing
the television

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.620
before we realized
what was going on

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.340
and got turned in their room.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.750
But they were already
asking questions

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.620
over the next few days
of why did somebody

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.770
fly these planes
into these buildings?

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.924
And to explain to
your sons-- they

00:24:33.924 --> 00:24:35.840
knew we were in Special
Forces and what we do.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.230
And just said, hey, Dad has got
to go, go find some bad guys.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:46.690
It was an emotional day, an
emotional time to do that.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:51.780
And then over the next few
days, as I got into work, then

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.510
was notified a couple
days later that I

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.260
was going to be put
right back on my team,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.430
and that our team had been
picked out of the Fifth Special

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.387
Forces Group to be one
of the first deployed.

00:25:01.387 --> 00:25:03.970
And we didn't really know what
our mission was going to be yet

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.120
except that we were going to a
then-undisclosed location which

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.650
turned out to be in
Uzbekistan, another one

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.160
of these early staging
basis like Colonel Dillon

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.310
and his guys set up in Pakistan.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.970
But that would become our
Special Operations task force

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.650
staging base.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.720
And that's kind of how
9/11 unfolded for me.

00:25:28.742 --> 00:25:29.700
CARRIE LAURENO: Scotty?

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.640
SCOTTY NEAL: All right.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.350
I get the microphone now.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.260
No, actually 9/11-- and
Mark sort of knows it

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.940
because it was actually his
team that was escorting us.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.560
We were in a training
exercise getting

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.170
ready to go into the
Middle East 1 October,

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.170
and we were part of
an element called

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.620
the Commanders In Extremis Force
that the Regional Combatant

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.250
Commander could use to
deploy at any time in case

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.590
there was some
immediacy in there.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.370
So we thought that
it was actually

00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.850
part of the training exercise.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.910
I remember very
vividly sitting there.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.630
Because when you're in isolation
you're just fed information.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.510
Your partner team controls
anything coming in and out.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.760
That way you don't have
outside influences,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.050
and you're focused on this
simulated terrorist attack,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.030
which at the time
we thought was what

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.850
was going on, because he walked
in and he wrote on the board

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.000
that the World Trade
Center had been hit.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.140
And it wasn't really until
about four or five hours

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.510
later when everything
came together

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.800
and they said no, this
is really happening.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.450
So we were pretty much ready
to go anyways into the area.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.412
But initially we
deployed into Kuwait,

00:26:36.412 --> 00:26:38.370
where we already had an
initial presence there.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.940
And then I was sent immediately
to the Embassy of Yemen

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.500
to work with other
agency partners

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.820
to determine-- there was this
big initial outpour from all

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.210
the other countries,
and they obviously

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.474
started wondering what they
could do to support our efforts

00:26:53.474 --> 00:26:54.640
and really to get into this.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.030
So everybody was
lining up and wanting

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.770
to support the American effort.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.980
And then from there,
just like everybody else,

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.970
we went to another
location, a small island,

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.600
and we prepared to
go into Kandahar.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.330
So what you're seeing
now is another task force

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.700
called Task Force K-Bar, which
was led by a SEAL at the time.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.730
But it was all the
other countries' efforts

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.870
of special operators that
came together in one location.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.720
So you had the English,
Australians, New Zealanders,

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.310
the Dutch, just a whole
mixture, the SEALS.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.990
And all of us would
come together.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.340
And at that time the
unconventional forces

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.900
had really routed the
Taliban and their leadership,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.550
and they were so fractured,
which made them vulnerable.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.739
And we used that opportunity to
really take those battlefield

00:27:40.739 --> 00:27:41.905
leaders off the battlefield.

00:27:46.877 --> 00:27:48.210
CARRIE LAURENO: Colonel Collins.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.210
LIAM COLLINS: All right.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.030
So on 9/11 I was in
Budapest, Hungary

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.080
as part of an
interagency exercise

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.572
that we were working over there.

00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:56.280
I remember somebody
walking in the room--

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.920
and this is prior to having
satellite TV everywhere,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.180
so we didn't have TV
screens all over the wall--

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.430
and somebody said the tower
had been hit by an airplane.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.570
Just thought it was maybe one
of these small little commuter

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.476
aircraft or something
that hit it.

00:28:10.476 --> 00:28:11.850
And about 20 or
30 minutes later,

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.308
when everybody came back in
and told us the second one hit,

00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:15.956
we kind of knew
that at that point

00:28:15.956 --> 00:28:17.580
it was a terrorist
attack, because I've

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.265
been focused on counterterrorism
since probably about '98, '99.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.420
So that pretty much ended
the exercise for us.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.226
I was the only one from my
unit that was on this exercise.

00:28:30.226 --> 00:28:31.600
So I was wanting
to get back home

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.030
because I knew were going
to be deploying soon.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.650
When I went to sleep that night,
I thought on it a little bit,

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.797
and I kind of believed that
it would be a long war.

00:28:39.797 --> 00:28:41.380
I wasn't even married
or had kids yet,

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.421
but I figured it's going
to be a war that they're

00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:45.985
going to be fighting
as they grew up.

00:28:45.985 --> 00:28:48.110
So I figured it was going
to be a decades-long war.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:52.760
So quickly got
back to Fort Bragg,

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.830
and there was no intelligence,
so it took awhile

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.600
to kind of actually
get over there.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.430
We finally got over there and
into Afghanistan the first time

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.424
in September, mid-
to early September.

00:29:03.424 --> 00:29:05.340
Didn't know Eric, but I
probably ran into Eric

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.720
without knowing it at
an airfield somewhere.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.320
I guess his security guys
let him put more on here

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.510
than mine put on here.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.510
So good for him.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.370
I can actually pick
out points on a map.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.862
But that's what they let
me put out there sometimes.

00:29:17.862 --> 00:29:19.320
So they may not be
the right place,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.560
but they're the right country.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.640
And then we came out
of the first time

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.100
and then went back in
November the second time.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.210
And the second time we went
back in, earlier in the month

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.780
i remember talking to one of
our intelligence analysts,

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.400
asking him how long he
thought the Taliban would

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.339
fall in Kabul.

00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:42.380
And he's like, yeah,
probably take a year or two,

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.300
looking at how long it
took the Russians to do it.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.800
And then two days later, then
Kabul had kind of fallen.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.990
And so that night our
Commanding General

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.300
asked us if we could get
into Afghanistan the next day

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.610
to watch the highway
basically going between Kabul

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.822
and Kandahar, and told
him yeah, we can get in,

00:29:59.822 --> 00:30:01.280
but we're going to
have to jump in.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.420
That's the only way
we can get in safely.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.878
And so he said, go
ahead and do it.

00:30:03.878 --> 00:30:06.684
So then that's how we
went back into Afghanistan

00:30:06.684 --> 00:30:07.350
the second time.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.885
CARRIE LAURENO:
Sergeant Stubner.

00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:16.420
ERIC STUBNER: On 9/11,
the night before we

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.840
had a training exercise.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.630
We train pretty
late into the night,

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.890
so they usually give
us a little earlier

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.810
work call the next morning.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.570
So I woke up, was going
into work later than usual.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.450
Got in the shower, turned
the shower radio on.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.990
So yes, actually, when 9/11
came I was caught with my pants

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.056
down.

00:30:36.056 --> 00:30:37.590
But I heard it on the radio.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.830
I didn't really believe it.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.130
I thought it was some talk
show gimmick, something

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.710
on the radio.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.990
Got my roommate's
attention, came in,

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.780
told him to go turn the TV on.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.440
It was kind of an
impact to me because we

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.319
were in what we call
Ready Force One status.

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:55.860
It's from when the
first call's made,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.434
we had two hours to be
into work, ready to go,

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:01.350
wherever-- and they claim
we could be anywhere

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.290
in the world, boots on
the ground, in 18 hours.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:09.210
So that I was really my
chance that we were going.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.910
Headed into work,
traffic wasn't too bad

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.110
until I got closer to post.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.100
And it was endless to try
to even get onto post.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.170
Parked my car,
literally ran onto post,

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.480
ran to work because I wanted to
get there as fast as I could,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.390
and thought we were
going to deploy.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.960
We never did, which
seemed odd to me.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.447
Eventually they ended up
taking 3rd Ranger Battalion out

00:31:29.447 --> 00:31:32.520
of Fort Benning,
and they did a jump

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.790
into Objective Rhino,
Kandahar Airfield.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.330
And I thought I
was actually going

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.650
to miss out on my chance
to be able to go to war.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.920
And everyone up here,
you do something,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.120
you train, it be doing things
at Google and you never

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.200
get to actually do anything on
the website or apply into it.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.150
Thought I was going
to miss my chance.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.980
And then rumors
started coming around

00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:00.220
that we were going to
get to go to Afghanistan.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.220
Had a few failed
attempts trying to leave

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.290
due to aircraft problems.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.640
But I did eventually
end up making my way

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.710
to Bagram Airfield on
New Year's Eve of 2001.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.780
So I got to wake
up to the new year

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:17.087
in Bagram Airfield in 2002.

00:32:17.087 --> 00:32:19.170
CARRIE LAURENO: Let's talk
a little bit about what

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.650
happened there, and specifically
the Battle of Roberts Ridge.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.234
ERIC STUBNER: We spent
our time training,

00:32:30.234 --> 00:32:31.150
did a lot of training.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.350
Rangers, they
train, train, train.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.280
We're not DSF guys.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.140
We're not that cool.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.990
CARRIE LAURENO: SF
guys don't train?

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.310
You don't have to.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.360
ERIC STUBNER: They work out.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.653
LIAM COLLINS: They train.

00:32:44.653 --> 00:32:46.870
CARRIE LAURENO: They train.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.830
Liam-- sorry, Colonel
Collins, rumor

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.580
has it that you can
run a six-minute mile.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.230
Is that true?

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.039
LIAM COLLINS: For 26.2 miles.

00:32:59.039 --> 00:32:59.830
CARRIE LAURENO: OK.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.510
So we've established that
they work out and they train.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.009
But you were training that day.

00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:06.300
ERIC STUBNER: We trained a lot.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.420
We'd go here and there.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.900
We went to Kandahar to train.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.730
We were basically
staged in Bagram.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:16.390
250 soldiers started out
there, little small compound,

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.410
few tents.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:22.400
Our main mission was to be a
QRF, or a Quick Reaction Force,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.970
or 911 to whatever
kind would happen.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:32.100
In Afghanistan we'd been
called out on a few things.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.190
And one night--I think it was
our night we were allotted

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:39.460
for the showers-- we had a
blocked time to take showers.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.370
And--

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.405
CARRIE LAURENO:
Once a week, right?

00:33:41.405 --> 00:33:42.630
ERIC STUBNER: Yeah, once a week.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:43.940
In the middle of the night
we'd have to wake up.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.770
So everyone kind of woke up
to shower and went there.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.455
The pipes were frozen, couldn't
get our shower for the week.

00:33:48.455 --> 00:33:48.955
It was fun.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.010
Heard a rumor something
was going to-- there

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.950
was a mission coming.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.620
Our standard was
to, when we were

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.740
told, 10 minutes on the
vehicles, ready to go.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.460
That wasn't going that fast.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.350
Seemed like kind
of a slower night.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.659
Eventually made our way
down to the airfield.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:10.600
Heard there was a Navy
SEAL that fell off

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.460
a helicopter in the vicinity
of an airfield in Khost.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.780
So it seemed pretty easy.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.989
Hearing reports, they had
him on the ISR watching him.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.889
There were some
people around him.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:23.860
Was he already rescued?

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.500
Not.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.320
A lot of broken
miscommunication.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.559
And we were ready to
load two helicopters.

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:33.389
We were told only
one was going to go.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.739
Don't always get answers why.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.580
Got back on the
vehicles, ready to go,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.480
and they gave us the
second aircraft to go in.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.940
So we took off, flew
around for awhile.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.170
It's hard to hear.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:54.039
Back in the early part of
the deployments, I guess,

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:56.080
you didn't have the
communication pieces to hear.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.290
It was loud.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.360
And didn't really know what
was going on, to be honest.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:06.760
And we were flown back to
Gardez and we touched down.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.430
Didn't really know,
again, what was going on.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.070
And then we were told that
we were going to be going in.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.630
They located where the SEAL was.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.370
We were flying in,
and on our way in,

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.790
the news we got, or I got,
we got on the aircraft,

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.000
was our first helicopter
had gone down.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.650
There were three
killed in action right

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.190
from the start of it.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.970
And told us we were
going into a hot LZ.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.680
Flew in, helicopter
sort of touched down.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.730
Immediately got off the
helicopter in waist-deep snow.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.080
And the helicopter
flew away, and there

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.900
wasn't a single shot fired.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.366
It was like, felt kind of lost.

00:35:45.366 --> 00:35:47.240
You were expecting to
get shot at right away,

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.156
and there was nothing.

00:35:48.156 --> 00:35:50.260
But then as you looked
up the mountain,

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.906
you could see jets coming
in and doing gun runs

00:35:52.906 --> 00:35:54.030
on the top of the mountain.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.420
And we were told we were set
in an offset location, which

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:05.360
was about 2000 feet below
the peak of 10,500 feet

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.380
and a straight line
distance of 700 meters.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.310
So it was a fun 2
and 1/2 hour climb

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.030
to get to the top
of the mountain.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.260
CARRIE LAURENO: In
waist-deep snow.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.100
ERIC STUBNER: Some
waist-deep snow.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.880
And once we got up there,
there wasn't really

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.910
time for a break
because the perimeter,

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.120
the area wasn't secured yet.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.730
And we immediately
organized SALT teams

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.990
to take out some bunkers
and a little trench

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.700
line that was up there.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.380
And then it succeeded into
moving casualties from the day.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.940
There were seven killed
in action that day,

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.962
and I think six wounded.

00:36:44.962 --> 00:36:46.170
I'm having a brain cramp now.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.795
Don't quote me.

00:36:46.795 --> 00:36:49.760
Don't Google it.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.560
And we were up there
for a total of 18 hours.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.820
And eventually that
night, once they

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.080
deemed it was safe enough
to bring other aircraft in,

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.270
they brought the aircraft
in and let us [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:03.935
from the mountain from that day.

00:37:03.935 --> 00:37:05.810
CARRIE LAURENO: And
you're being quite humble

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.231
about your actions
taken that day.

00:37:09.231 --> 00:37:11.355
If I remember from reading
correctly from your tour

00:37:11.355 --> 00:37:15.230
that you carried 12 service
members up the mountain.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.700
Is that correct?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:23.350
And one of those was your best
friend, Sergeant [? Kroes ?].

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.990
Tell us about
Sergeant [? Kroes ?].

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:31.160
ERIC STUBNER: He was-- I treated
him pretty much like a brother.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.210
His mom blessed
me as her son now.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.070
I'm the closest thing she
has left to him from there.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.670
I kind of talked
about it earlier.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.600
Joe laughed at it.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.072
I did a lot with him.

00:37:44.072 --> 00:37:45.530
Went to his house
for Thanksgiving.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.750
Really a neat family.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:54.170
Brad was really a
super neat individual.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.860
First time I met his mom, I went
to his house for Thanksgiving.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.451
Three of us went.

00:37:58.451 --> 00:38:00.200
She called and spoke
to us before we went.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.700
She's like, OK,
when you come I want

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.410
you to feel like you're at home.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.932
Tell me three things you had
at Thanksgiving growing up.

00:38:06.932 --> 00:38:08.157
I told her three things.

00:38:08.157 --> 00:38:09.240
So did the other two guys.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.372
When we actually showed
up at Thanksgiving,

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:12.830
in addition to
everything she made,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.540
there were nine other
dishes, three for each of us.

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.310
Christmas, I didn't do anything
with him for Christmas.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.732
He came back from Jacksonville
and he walked in my room

00:38:23.732 --> 00:38:25.190
one night, and he's
like, hey, tell

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.387
my mom thanks for the stocking.

00:38:27.387 --> 00:38:29.220
OK, get on the phone,
I'm like, hey, Sheila,

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.120
thanks for the stocking.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.286
She's like, did you like it?

00:38:31.286 --> 00:38:32.840
I was like, yeah, I did.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.470
The next day Brad
gave me the stocking.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.450
That's the only grudge
I have against him.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:40.990
In it there were $50 gift cards
to Carrabba's, calling cards.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.700
It was probably a $400
stocking, and I was like, Brad,

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.470
I didn't know.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.136
And he goes, no, it
was just a stocking.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.060
Ended up taking him home to
North Dakota after Christmas

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.520
because we had our
block leave then.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.260
Drove into North Dakota,
had a mishap on the road.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.520
The car ended up
flipping end over end

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.499
upon entering North Dakota.

00:39:02.499 --> 00:39:04.790
And of course both of us were
driving with no shoes on.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:06.976
So from him being
from Florida, I

00:39:06.976 --> 00:39:08.530
was like, welcome
to North Dakota.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:09.910
Every window was
knocked out of the car.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.800
We both jumped out.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.280
Nothing but socks.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:17.330
And had a few moments with Brad,
as everyone in the military

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.920
does some sort of bond or blend
with a friend, a colleague,

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.420
whatever.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.495
CARRIE LAURENO: Mark, your team
is known as the Horse Soldiers.

00:39:28.495 --> 00:39:31.910
Can you tell us why?

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.090
And can you tell us about
the very special statue

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.870
that's down by
the 9/11 Memorial?

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.100
MARK NUTCH: Yeah, my
Special Forces team

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.420
was one of the first sent
in to Northern Afghanistan

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:55.620
about mid-October, the same
night that Liam and his element

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.400
had evidently passed through
Colonel Dill's position,

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.730
possibly, some of them.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.190
While that was happening with
their mission against Mullah

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:11.724
Omar's compound, my team was
helicoptered into the north,

00:40:11.724 --> 00:40:12.515
into the mountains.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.440
And the very first
morning we were there,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.250
if you click on that photo-- as
that's playing, if you would,

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.460
on that point.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:30.552
That first morning a guy named
General Abdul Rashid Dostum,

00:40:30.552 --> 00:40:32.010
one of the Uzbek
militia commanders

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.020
that was renowned in that
region, been actively fighting

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.220
against the Taliban
and Al Qaeda.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.080
And this was a guy that my
team was tasked to meet with.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.090
And he come riding
up on horseback,

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.460
and that was how their
force was moving.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:52.240
And so within hours six men
from my team, including myself,

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:56.960
mounted horses
and rode off to go

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.030
to General Dostum's
headquarters.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.950
And for the men on my
team, although they're

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:07.440
highly trained Special
Forces Sergeants,

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.200
horseback riding
in the 21st century

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.830
wasn't something, even in the
Special Forces at that time,

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.670
that you typically do.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:19.230
But fortunately I had
grown up on a cattle ranch

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.630
and had rodeoed
through high school.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.445
In Kansas we have high
school rodeo teams.

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:28.200
CARRIE LAURENO: Just like
on the Upper East Side.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.760
MARK NUTCH: Yeah.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.410
But I attended college,
and while doing ROTC,

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.380
competed on the collegiate rodeo
team, actually several years.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.710
So anyway, had this
incredible experience

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.790
to, literally at the
gallop, teach my guys

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.790
how to ride horseback
with our military gear on.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.780
And we're riding to keep
up with the Afghans,

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.400
and it's a macho thing.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.910
You don't want to
look like you're

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.820
an inexperienced horseback
rider with these guys.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.790
So anyway, this started our
incredible Wild West experience

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:12.290
over the next several weeks
of riding horseback every day.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:18.450
And the guys on my
team took to it.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:22.390
We tried to walk a couple days
because we were just frustrated

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:23.870
with these half-trained animals.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.250
Or if anybody rides
horses in here.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.130
I don't know, is that
allowed at Google?

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.280
I see you have scooters
up and down the hall.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.560
Anyway, so we rode horses
over the next several weeks

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.390
while we were doing
combat operations.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.330
And we're calling
in close air strikes

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:48.320
and we're organizing this
Army that we grew out

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.390
of these different Afghan ethnic
groups of Uzbeks and Tajiks

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:56.160
and Hazaras, and
this melting pot

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.660
of tribes that
rallied around us.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.800
But that American
presence gave them

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.410
hope to fight against
the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.680
And we learned about
their stories firsthand.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.320
I have a very unique
experience than what

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.300
even guys in Special Forces
have experienced over the years,

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.620
as we now have armored vehicles.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.030
And you see then that's
what everybody expects

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:25.770
of an American soldier right now
is body armor from head to toe.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.870
And you're riding around
in armored vehicles.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.360
And we didn't have armor.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.980
We didn't take body armor.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.347
We didn't wear it while
we were in the mountains.

00:43:35.347 --> 00:43:36.180
CARRIE LAURENO: Why?

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.260
MARK NUTCH: Moving around.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:43.640
One, it was a weight issue
of just what we were carrying

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.490
with moving everything
around by donkey

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.630
or on manned portable
loads by horseback.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.430
And the other
thing is, honestly,

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.460
how's that look when
I'm wearing body armor,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.730
but the guys I'm
working alongside

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.750
do not have body armor?

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.430
They have limited
ammunition, small arms.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.300
They're wearing tennis
shoes, literally,

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.530
and the winter's coming on.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:11.040
So we didn't have body armor
in there for that point.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.310
Now later, in other
missions, after we got out

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.200
of the mountains
and we liberated

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.040
the key city of Mazar-i-Sharif
a few weeks later

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.770
and our mission focus
kind of changed,

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.460
then we would wear
some body armor.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.717
But Special Forces does that
on some occasions for the teams

00:44:26.717 --> 00:44:28.175
that have particular
missions where

00:44:28.175 --> 00:44:31.220
we're trying to embed
and work with the locals.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.430
And it's kind of hard to
establish a relationship

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.920
with people on the
street if you look

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.110
like, to them, someone
from outer space.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:44.500
CARRIE LAURENO: How did Green
Berets-- how did your 12 Green

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.810
Berets, which is how Green
Berets work, in groups of 12--

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:53.610
build an army of 3,000 fighters
from multiple different tribes,

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.290
speaking a different
language, riding on horseback.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:02.890
How did you inspire the
creation of a literal cavalry?

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:06.290
MARK NUTCH: As I said, the
American presence there meant

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.750
so much to them,
and that we were

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.160
willing to share hardships.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.160
We were sharing meals with them.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.430
We slept at the
finest Afghan hotels,

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.340
which were caves or a bunker.

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.590
You're sleeping on the ground.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.420
You're sharing that
hardship with them.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:29.960
And you're living and working,
fighting alongside them.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:37.250
But we were able to meet with
these different ethnic leaders

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:42.990
one on one, and in some
cases, our language skills

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.720
were sufficient enough to
get across the basic points

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.220
of your conversation.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.690
At other points we had to rely
on some Afghan interpreters,

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:59.230
which their English was
as bad as my Dari or Uzbek

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.280
at the time.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.480
But the Central Intelligence
Agency had a team there,

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.960
and we worked closely with them.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.740
And so they were able to help
facilitate some of the deeper

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.080
conversations that
needed to occur.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.324
But as we met with
each of these four

00:46:16.324 --> 00:46:17.740
different factional
leaders, which

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.450
had been fighting against each
other, even literally weeks

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:24.220
before-- but we were able to
get them to sit down and come

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.760
together in what was called an
Area Commanders' Meeting, where

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.590
it was-- think of a
three-day planning conference

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:34.220
in a building in a small
village in the mountains.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.750
And we got these guys to
work together and come up

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.750
with a plan, and then how
we could support that plan.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:48.000
But really, by the
actions of my Sergeants

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.200
in building that relationship
with the different commanders,

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:57.650
we were able to help grow
that Army and give them hope.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.420
I don't how else
to explain that,

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.590
what a significant
thing that was

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:05.810
to have American servicemen
there on the ground

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:10.130
to help them, give them
hope that there could

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:11.705
be a better future
for Afghanistan.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.950
CARRIE LAURENO: And your wife
gave birth to your youngest

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.610
child while you were doing that.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:22.700
MARK NUTCH: Yes.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.760
As I said earlier, my
wife was seven months

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.740
pregnant when I deployed.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.825
And we were in a Babies R Us,
actually-- the wives are going

00:47:31.825 --> 00:47:34.750
to stone me as I
tell this part--

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.910
but we were in a Babies
R Us in Nashville

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:44.000
when I got the phone call
about the 15th of September

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.780
that I was being
put back on my team.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:52.170
And we deployed out
soon thereafter.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:56.390
But my wife Amy was a
high-risk pregnancy,

00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:00.580
and she gave birth
to our daughter Kaya.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.280
The team wives supported
her and all that.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.970
And by the time they
notified the chain of command

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:17.250
and they called me, I was
orchestrating a major offensive

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.150
that we were about to kick off
across the northern provinces.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:23.840
This is about the-- she
was born on the 30th,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.470
so this is the 31st or so.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:32.780
But I got this strange
message to use the SAT phone

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.940
and to call home.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:40.622
And I did, and I had a few
minutes with my wife, who

00:48:40.622 --> 00:48:42.080
was already home
with our daughter,

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.770
and our family had come in to
help her and be around her.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.100
I think Colonel Collins
said this earlier,

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:51.740
is you have to be
able to compartment.

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:59.619
And so had that phone call
and ended it, ended that line,

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:01.410
because you can't tell
them where you're at

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:02.284
or what you're doing.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.530
But had a few private
minutes, and then ran off

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.350
and told Bob, my
Chief Warrant Officer

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:16.194
and a couple of
the other guys that

00:49:16.194 --> 00:49:17.360
were there in that position.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.860
But then we went right back
to planning that attack.

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:30.770
And we launched a major Calvary
charge literally the next day.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:35.500
My daughter was four months
old before I got home,

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:41.450
and we just celebrated her--
I'm bad at math-- thirteenth.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.921
CARRIE LAURENO:
Thirteenth birthday.

00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:46.120
MARK NUTCH: In Ranger, N
is for knowledge, right?

00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.030
CARRIE LAURENO:
Colonel Collins, tell

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:54.050
us what happens when
you're at 18,000 feet

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:58.460
and you decide to jump
out of an airplane.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.960
LIAM COLLINS: Well,
people sometimes

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.960
ask, probably all of us
up here, why we jump out

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.320
of a perfectly good airplane.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.160
It's because we know the pilots.

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.390
It's a lot safer than landing.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.470
Yeah, so we jumped out.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:13.960
It was dark.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.760
It was really dark.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.930
Usually you got some
ambient light out there,

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:20.380
but there's no ambient light
in Afghanistan in 2001.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.570
So we jump when there
is 0% illumination.

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.640
So the moon was down.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.250
It was dark.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.650
And I was the youngest guy.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.300
I mean, I'd just taken command.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.980
I'd just finished
our HALO School,

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.370
they call it, or
Military Freefall School.

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:36.092
So I was--

00:50:36.092 --> 00:50:38.300
CARRIE LAURENO: This was
your first combat tour ever.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.133
LIAM COLLINS: Right.

00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:41.470
So over there, and so I'm
the young guy on the team,

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.370
but I'm also the
commander of the team,

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.530
so you don't want to be
the one that screws it up.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:50.220
Because then all officers
ever after you get-- wreck it

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.682
for all of them, so I
wasn't going to do that.

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:53.390
Luckily I didn't.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:54.973
I just about hit the
guy underneath me

00:50:54.973 --> 00:50:58.470
when-- I just about landed
on the guy underneath me.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:01.140
So that part worked
out pretty well.

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.665
We ended up getting
to our position.

00:51:02.665 --> 00:51:04.290
Two of the teams we
got to our position

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:07.230
where we could kind of see
the road and then call in CAS,

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.540
or Close Air Support dropped
bombs on Taliban vehicles.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.830
One team didn't get as far
as we wanted to that night.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.520
They put up camouflage netting.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.020
Great thing about
camouflage netting

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.830
is it works really
well for people.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.540
But the animals
really, apparently, we

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.137
found out early on
that they really

00:51:23.137 --> 00:51:24.720
like it because
there's no vegetation.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.002
So when they see movement
that means it's chow time.

00:51:27.002 --> 00:51:29.210
So some goats that were
probably like three miles off

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:33.240
saw the camouflage netting and
walked right toward these guys,

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.080
and the goat herders were about
five feet from them before they

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.640
finally saw them with the
goats chewing on their SATCOM

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.140
antenna.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.280
So despite everything,
we still felt

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.790
like we had a pretty
good position.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.040
Those guys had to
move, but I didn't

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.800
want to be the guy who
came back and wrote a book

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.030
and had a movie about
everything that went wrong.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.190
So we got those guys
where they had to go.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:54.720
We were confident
in our abilities

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.940
and moved to a good place.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.310
Luckily I do remember
our Fire Support officer,

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.210
who was in charge of the Close
Air Support, which was not

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.990
close at all because I don't
think it came down below 25,000

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.552
feet the whole
time we were there.

00:52:06.552 --> 00:52:08.760
I guess the Afghanis had
some really good air defense

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:13.010
weapons that I never saw.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.102
But they told us that
we'd have CAS stacked up

00:52:16.102 --> 00:52:18.060
for days, probably like
the rest of these guys.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.564
So once the team
got compromised,

00:52:19.564 --> 00:52:21.230
we wanted to call
them in and bring them

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:22.646
on station in case
we needed them.

00:52:22.646 --> 00:52:24.570
And sure enough, three
hours later, we finally

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:25.530
got somebody close.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.092
So luckily we didn't need
them for at least three hours,

00:52:28.092 --> 00:52:29.800
or it wouldn't have
been much good to us.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.310
And then maybe we would have
had a book and movies and stuff.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:35.250
But it worked out
pretty well for us.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:36.730
Eventually we got
to our positions.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.495
And then we were able to take
out some Taliban vehicles.

00:52:40.495 --> 00:52:43.120
CARRIE LAURENO: Let's talk about
books and movies for a second.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.250
There's a lot of news out
there right now about people

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:51.150
telling their stories, in
particular some Navy SEALs.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:55.010
And I just want to hear
the reactions of people

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:59.590
on this panel about
what it's like to share

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:02.180
information and share
the stories in the way

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.220
that you're sharing
them now versus the way

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.850
that, perhaps, others
are choosing to share.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:12.349
SCOTTY NEAL: So I think
we're all discussing that,

00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:13.890
and internally you
see everybody here

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.956
being very humble about what
their accomplishments were,

00:53:16.956 --> 00:53:18.580
because they never
think of themselves.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.610
There's a whole lot
of "we" in this panel

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.530
right here, not a lot of "I".

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.022
And a lot of
discussion internally,

00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:26.230
especially in the Special
Ops community and the Recon

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.840
community and everything
else, is these things

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.180
are best kept under
the radar, and it's

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.650
how we still
continue to operate.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.590
But then there's
also a certain aspect

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.010
of why we're here and starting
to share stories, because here

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:43.790
we are, have never met each
other until this tour happened.

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:45.485
And yet we start
to realize that we

00:53:45.485 --> 00:53:47.930
were all in the same
space at the same time

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.500
trying to achieve
the same thing.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.070
So there's that final
mix of storytelling,

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.950
and storytelling
has been happening

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:57.420
since cavemen were putting
palm prints on caves.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.580
And unless we capture
some of these aspects,

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.280
we have a whole other
generation behind us

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.540
that really don't know some of
the commitments and sacrifices

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.350
that we've made.

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:08.750
So it takes a leap of
faith to come in here

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:12.770
and just tell a bit of the story
that you're allowed to tell,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.650
and yet highlight what you
want to tell the story about.

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:19.070
And that's about how we
responded, as America,

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:23.500
to those days here in New
York and DC and Pennsylvania.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.200
CARRIE LAURENO: And along that
ethos of the we and not I,

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.190
there's a statue that I'd like
to show a picture of that's

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:35.760
down by the PATH train
near the 9/11 Memorial

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.570
that is known affectionately
as, or casually

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:40.840
as The Horse Soldier.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.362
And when Mark and I were working
together on his tour and trying

00:54:44.362 --> 00:54:46.570
to figure out what the
description should be for that

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:52.100
tour, we started the paragraph
with saying "Known as The Horse

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.660
Soldier..." and tell his story.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:59.990
And Mark was adamant
that we should--

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.220
that he did not want
to be called The Horse

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.330
Soldier, because he led
a team of horse soldiers.

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:08.810
And I just need
to point that out,

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.440
because it became very clear
to me that even talking

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.570
about himself as an individual
was an uncomfortable thing,

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.140
and it wasn't an
appropriate thing for him

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:22.202
because of that very reason,
because they operate in teams.

00:55:22.202 --> 00:55:24.160
Something that's been
really interesting to see

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.240
over the last 24
hours is that chapter

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.479
of history filling itself
in, and watching you all

00:55:29.479 --> 00:55:31.020
speak to each other
and realizing you

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.496
were in the same places
at the same time,

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:34.870
but you never had
met each other.

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:36.810
And some of you have
heard of each other

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:39.130
but not met each other.

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.580
It seems like there are whole
chapters of history to still

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.940
be written by individuals
like yourselves

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.690
who are the actual storytellers.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:50.530
What's the value in telling
your own story versus having

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:51.980
someone tell it for you?

00:55:57.585 --> 00:55:59.460
SCOTTY NEAL: What was
unique is because I now

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.230
work for a nonprofit where
I get to communicate this.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:05.780
So being part of an
organization [INAUDIBLE],

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:09.620
great storytelling usually
starts within a small group.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.990
And then how do we tell our
own stories to each other,

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:17.620
and then allow others to see
that story and capture from it?

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.310
Because we were
talking about earlier,

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:20.893
I have so many
questions I want to ask

00:56:20.893 --> 00:56:23.127
Mark and Liam and
everybody else.

00:56:23.127 --> 00:56:25.210
And they're questions from
people that were there,

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:27.660
and I want to spend
more time engaging

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:32.430
where, how do we capture these
stories about ourselves, told

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.910
to each other,
edited to each other?

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:37.820
And that's especially
with this tour here.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.920
And what I've found
also is that the family

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.170
becomes curious with you
in your tour as well.

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:46.450
And they actually learn
more than you've ever

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.420
been able to speak to them.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.050
CARRIE LAURENO: Several of
you-- say, almost all of you--

00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:55.300
didn't necessarily sign
up for this project

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.690
and say, yes, pick me,
I'd love to do this.

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:03.410
Colonel Dill, I'd love
you to share your reaction

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:04.910
when we first spoke.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.745
ERIC DILL: Well, prior to
us speaking, I said no.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:18.470
So it took coming around to it.

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.970
It's awkward to do
this, particularly--

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.250
so the Special Forces model
is quiet professionals.

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:31.090
For the Recon
community, we strive

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:38.260
to keep from
seeking recognition.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.890
So we have-- we do little
things like, if you end up

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.610
in the base paper or
any type of publication,

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.620
you owe the team a
beer, or a case of beer.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.890
And god forbid you get
your picture in there.

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.820
I won't even go there.

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.140
But so you do little
stuff like that

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.690
to teach people to not
be attention-seeking

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:01.650
and to be a team player.

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:08.190
So I was contacted by one of
the officers I respect most

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:12.340
in the Marine Corps,
and he mentioned this.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:16.960
So with a little
persuasion, and then

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.479
thinking about what
this might mean

00:58:21.479 --> 00:58:23.020
getting towards the
end of my career.

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:27.070
And I thought about
my grandfather.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.400
I had asked him about
World War II quite a bit,

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.735
and there was some sort of
diversion or some other reason

00:58:34.735 --> 00:58:35.610
not to talk about it.

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.560
But then when I
was in college, he

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.200
gave me a journal
that he had written.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.950
He was in a B-24
bomber crew, and he

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:47.440
kept a journal of every
mission he did over Europe when

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.990
things were still pretty rough.

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:53.460
And I thought, well, maybe
this-- with modern technology,

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:57.380
this is my way to give a
journal, something lasting,

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:01.660
something enduring that
my kids can appreciate.

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:06.330
So the Tour Builder
is kind of my version

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:11.790
of a small journal like
what my grandfather did.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:19.187
ERIC STUBNER: I'll add to
what Colonel Collins said.

00:59:19.187 --> 00:59:21.520
I didn't have any grandfathers
in the military, anything

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.020
like that.

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.330
But you hear stories
like that of veterans

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:28.690
who, you know, oh, my grandpa,
he served in World War II.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.040
He never really talked about it.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.360
Eventually he died.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.830
We found a box in the
garage, went through it,

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:36.960
stuff we don't even
know what it was.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.780
It was just put
away after the war.

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:43.110
I usually don't openly come
out and push and throw.

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:45.159
It'll take you a
long time to find out

00:59:45.159 --> 00:59:46.700
I'm in the military
when you meet me.

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:54.670
And a lot of people think
that you can ask questions.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:56.022
If you ask questions, I'll talk.

00:59:56.022 --> 00:59:56.980
I don't have a problem.

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.960
I'm just not a person
that throws it forward.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.269
So maybe why don't you
know about your grandpa?

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:02.810
I don't know.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.350
Try to talk to him,
try to ask him.

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.829
And then in addition to
it all, why you will talk

01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:11.120
or why you'll come forward
and tell stories like this--

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:17.310
there are people that are
killed in action that they die.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:20.470
If they die and the story's
never told, to me they die.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.060
But if you keep them
alive by telling a story,

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.320
or do things, setting up
organizations, funds, some way

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.350
to keep alive or those
alive to keep it going,

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.342
it does inform people.

01:00:32.342 --> 01:00:34.050
And then maybe people
will ask questions.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:38.350
But ask veterans questions.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.950
You see one, go say hi to them.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:42.830
They'll love to talk to you.

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:44.880
JOE QUINN: Yes, Carrie.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.100
Oops, gotta turn it on.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.920
Yeah, just to add to that, just
listening to these stories,

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.390
sitting here listening to them.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:01:01.407
To think why my family had
an empty place at the table

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.990
during the holidays, that these
gentlemen were out there doing

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.865
what they were doing.

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:06.657
So I just want to say
personally thank you,

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:08.531
and if everyone would
put your hands together

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.630
for everyone here.

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:17.520
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.770
So that's the reason why I
think that's the importance

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:21.570
of telling these stories.

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:24.920
And it is kind of a
Catch-22 of being humble.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.850
But one of the
things is, as less

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.270
of a percentage of our
society has served,

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.490
it's more about meeting
civilians halfway.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.500
And doing that halfway
is being able to try

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.330
to do the best you can to
tell about your experiences,

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:42.060
not only for yourself, but
for those that represent,

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.950
whether your team or your unit.

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:47.420
CARRIE LAURENO: Was it easy
for you to tell your story?

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.217
JOE QUINN: No.

01:01:48.217 --> 01:01:49.675
I mean, yes, it
was very difficult.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.930
And I've sort of been quiet
about it, especially early on,

01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.690
especially the 9/11
stuff for a long time.

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:03.690
But to go to what
Eric was saying,

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.280
it's a great way
to remember people.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.540
And it's fantastic that we
have technology nowadays

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.790
that helps us to keep
that memory alive

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:15.080
and keep my brother's
memory alive

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.740
and those that have
lost their lives.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.380
Because I know
everyone would agree

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.210
that those are the real
heroes are the ones

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.930
that they paid the
ultimate sacrifice.

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:26.250
So the least we can do is kind
of tell the stories of them,

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:30.279
good ones, bad ones, the truth.

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.570
CARRIE LAURENO: And after
going through that experience

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:35.090
over the last several weeks,
and working on your own

01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:37.770
to build these stories and
tell them in your own words,

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:40.120
what did it feel like to
go to the museum today

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.310
and to see perfect
strangers standing around

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:49.640
a bunch of kiosks reading about
your most personal professional

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.240
experiences?

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.505
Totally weird, right?

01:02:54.505 --> 01:02:55.130
JOE QUINN: Yes.

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:56.909
Well, it was really weird.

01:02:56.909 --> 01:02:59.450
Eric and I were down there, and
they were looking through it,

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:00.820
and they saw him in the flesh.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.530
That was really exciting for one
of the people that were there.

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:10.590
That's all I really got.

01:03:14.037 --> 01:03:15.620
CARRIE LAURENO: So
I'm sure that there

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.244
must be people here
who have questions.

01:03:17.244 --> 01:03:21.250
We have some microphones
and some runners with mics.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.680
Any question is a
good question here.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.180
That's why these guys are here,
to help us understand more

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:33.960
about their service
and why they did it.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.520
I hear Eric, Sergeant
Stubner next to me,

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.980
using the word chance, that
he was waiting for his chance

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.300
to deploy, and how-- you'll read
his tour and see how incredibly

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.180
disappointed he was that he
wasn't-- his team wasn't picked

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.170
to be the team to
go first, and how--

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:51.070
you sounded really upset
about it at the time.

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:56.039
And most people here don't
have those experiences.

01:03:56.039 --> 01:03:57.580
We all have passions,
and they're all

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.650
things that we get excited
about and we want to do,

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:00.580
like you were saying.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:05.820
But I personally want
to know, why did you

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.500
see that as an
opportunity and a chance

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.620
to go and put yourself in
such a dangerous situation?

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:15.110
Which is not something that
I've ever thought about doing.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:20.550
Most of us run from danger, and
you saw it as an opportunity.

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.380
ERIC STUBNER: I
guess the one thing--

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.932
I found out there are quite a
few guys around that did spend

01:04:25.932 --> 01:04:27.140
time in Ranger Regiment, too.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.014
I'm not the only guy.

01:04:28.014 --> 01:04:30.980
So I do have some hidden
brothers up here also.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:35.220
But Ranger history,
kind of in the past,

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.370
they've been at a
lot of conflicts.

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:41.670
And it's usually a
short period of time.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:48.540
And you do look up to those
that have gone before.

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.370
There might be-- how many
people jumped into Grenada

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.360
from Ranger Regiment?

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.580
Do you know, sir?

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.000
I don't know, you can Google it.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.920
But there's not a whole
big group of people.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.750
So getting to serve
in the organization

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:03.110
and be a part of it as a goal,
a dream, you're like, wow,

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:04.780
I'd love to be
one of those guys.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:07.772
Before, if you would see
a guy with a combat scroll

01:05:07.772 --> 01:05:10.030
on, you're like, wow,
he jumped into Grenada.

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:12.130
He jumped into Panama.

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:12.717
Wow.

01:05:12.717 --> 01:05:13.800
And they are looked up to.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.360
That was the motivation
that you had.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.930
You wanted to do what you did.

01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:20.620
So when it kicked off
and I was like, wow,

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.514
we're in Ready Force One,
I'm going to get to go,

01:05:23.514 --> 01:05:24.680
they took another battalion.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.200
It was kind of mind-blowing.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.940
And then when we did
deploy, they only

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.070
took one company
from our battalion.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:36.410
And after we went and came back,
kind of the mentality thought

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.490
was, wow, I do have my scroll.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:41.280
I'm going to be one
of those select few

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.730
that gets to wear it.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.720
Literally did I not know that
the deployments would not stop,

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.680
and eventually every Ranger
would have a combat scroll.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.010
But it was just something
you wanted to do,

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:53.846
you wanted to achieve.

01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:55.720
CARRIE LAURENO: And
despite that opportunity,

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.620
if I asked you
the question, what

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.410
do you gentlemen think about
war, how would you answer that?

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:10.185
SCOTTY NEAL: Basically war
is not an enduring endeavor.

01:06:10.185 --> 01:06:11.940
It's better when it's
over very quickly.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.050
And I think talking
to a lot of us

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:17.470
last night at a
dinner you hosted,

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:18.860
we thought the war was over.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.630
Less than about 230
Special Operators,

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:26.260
a contingent of Marines, Air
Force, which isn't up here,

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.322
actually thought
that this was done.

01:06:28.322 --> 01:06:30.030
LIAM COLLINS: I didn't
think it was over.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:31.738
SCOTTY NEAL: He didn't
think it was over.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.870
Well, there was a lot
of high-fiving going on

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:36.830
until a few months later, when
we found ourselves in Iraq.

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:41.310
And then now it's just been
a constant pace of life.

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.310
LIAM COLLINS: Yeah, I
mean, we live in-- I mean,

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:45.320
it's like a firefighter I
was equating to earlier.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.330
I mean, a firefighter
wants to go fight a fire,

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:49.490
but if they're going to fight a
fire, it's kind of a bad thing

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:51.190
that they're leaving the
firehouse to go fight a fire.

01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:53.315
It's the same thing, kind
of, in this line of work.

01:06:53.315 --> 01:06:54.997
Because we train so
long and hard at it,

01:06:54.997 --> 01:06:57.330
you kind of want to go, but
you don't really want to go,

01:06:57.330 --> 01:06:58.730
because if you've
got to go, it's

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:00.230
not a good reason
that you're going.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.950
So it'd be better if we
just kind of never went.

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:06.777
But if we got to go, we all come
from the mindset or whatever,

01:07:06.777 --> 01:07:08.360
we want to be the
ones that have to do

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.980
that if somebody's got to go.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.420
Maybe we're just all messed up
in the head, but I don't know.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.260
MARK NUTCH: There's a
particular Bible verse

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.190
that I know as a young
officer I saw on a wall

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:25.990
at Ranger Regiment, which kind
of epitomizes most of probably

01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:27.800
the guys up here--
and I can't speak

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.380
for all of them-- but the
Special Operations community.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.900
And that's Isaiah 6:8.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.320
"Whom shall go and
whom shall I send?

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.970
And a voice cried
out, 'Here I am.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:39.190
Send me.' "

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:42.380
And that "Send me"
ethos is prevalent

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.940
throughout the Special
Operations community.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:48.070
And I know for me
personally, although I

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:51.390
had a pregnant wife
and two young children,

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:57.330
going with my brothers and
being the first to get in there

01:07:57.330 --> 01:08:05.950
and get some payback, and
to represent our country,

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.960
and get in there and
try and sort things out,

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.050
that is what drove us.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:13.750
We recognized we were very
fortunate, and we were chosen.

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:17.069
It could've been
another team that

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:19.842
certainly could have
had that mission.

01:08:19.842 --> 01:08:21.800
CARRIE LAURENO: Colonel
Dill, your view on war.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.010
We talked about this last night.

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:25.529
I think we talked
about human beings

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:28.123
and was it chimpanzees,
or-- right?

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:35.760
ERIC DILL: Well, I'm not sure
where you wanted to go with it.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.689
But we were talking about--
cultural anthropologist

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:42.420
is kind of something
I study on the side.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:47.189
But the only other species
that commits murder--

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:52.898
I mean, animals fight, there's
dominance, things like that,

01:08:52.898 --> 01:08:55.439
trying to establish dominance
for mates and things like that.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:59.390
But the only other species that
commits murder is chimpanzees.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:02.050
But I'm not sure where
you wanted to take that.

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:03.410
CARRIE LAURENO: You know
what, I was remembering--

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.201
I was remembering the
story and remembering

01:09:05.201 --> 01:09:06.460
that war is a terrible thing.

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.543
And you were talking about
how you felt about war,

01:09:08.543 --> 01:09:11.689
and how people-- no
one wants to go to war,

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:15.180
and that human beings--
or maybe it was Scotty.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.649
You were talking about
that also with Scotty.

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:21.130
ERIC DILL: I mean,
I would say there

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:23.130
are human beings that
want to go to war.

01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:24.850
And I've been around them.

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:29.000
And sometimes we're fortunate
that they're on our side.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But yeah, I think
there's a lot of people

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.250
that do kind of seek that.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.662
But I think once you've
done it, you don't--

01:09:40.662 --> 01:09:42.370
SCOTTY NEAL: I think
my quote at the end,

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:43.720
though, is we were
all young and we

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.140
wanted to go to
war because that's

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.859
how we saw ourselves
as young soldiers.

01:09:47.859 --> 01:09:51.710
Now that we're old,
tired soldiers--

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:54.930
nobody prays for peace
more than an old soldier.

01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:58.330
So it's hard watching
the thirteenth year

01:09:58.330 --> 01:09:59.770
into this conflict.

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:03.030
And you certainly look at
some of my young pictures.

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.930
I mean, it really took
24 years off my life.

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:09.349
And so as this
conflict goes and goes,

01:10:09.349 --> 01:10:11.140
part of my job when I
was a Senior Enlisted

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.830
Advisor at that
very senior level

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:16.154
was to remind them of
the cause of conflict

01:10:16.154 --> 01:10:17.570
and how it's better
to get it over

01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:19.758
quickly than to
linger this thing on.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:25.020
CARRIE LAURENO: What questions
do we have from the audience?

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:25.853
We have microphones.

01:10:31.634 --> 01:10:32.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.420
My name's Matthew Lack.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.430
Army guy, joined before
September 11, and I'm still in.

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:40.630
And I'm curious to get your
perspectives because you're

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:42.100
sort of in the same
boat I am, just

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.440
seeing how the Army was
prepared before September 11,

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.600
the lessons we had to learn
over the last 13 years

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.140
fighting two different
wars, and now

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.800
how the Army appears to be
running away from every lesson

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.577
we learned as fast
as humanly possible.

01:10:57.577 --> 01:10:59.410
What's your general
opinion on the direction

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:01.500
that we're going now as an Army?

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.624
And this is my
experience in the Army--

01:11:03.624 --> 01:11:05.290
have to count the
Marines out-- but even

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:09.000
as the military as a whole,
do you think there's anything

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.870
that we can do to help preserve
lessons learned so we don't

01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:15.520
find ourselves in a
similar place 10, 20 years

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.240
from now going to war without
body armor that really was even

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:20.986
up to snuff?

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:22.360
I remember in
2003, I wasn't sure

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.776
if I was even going
to have plates

01:11:23.776 --> 01:11:25.460
to take with me to
my first deployment.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.418
And I'd just like to get
your thoughts on that.

01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:32.940
ERIC DILL: Well, just quickly
from the Marine perspective--

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:35.065
I know he wants to hear
from the Army-- but I mean,

01:11:35.065 --> 01:11:37.635
frankly, I'm at odds
with the institution

01:11:37.635 --> 01:11:40.800
on where we're going.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:44.960
If you look at the
potential for conflict

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.900
over the next 10 to 15
years, more than likely

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.430
it's going to be a
low-intensity conflict,

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:52.974
counterinsurgency-type
situation.

01:11:52.974 --> 01:11:54.890
It's not going to be a
major conventional war,

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:58.210
because who would
do that right now

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:03.180
against the US military and
our allies and our coalitions?

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:10.590
But my institution's going
back towards training

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:12.330
for a big conventional fight.

01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.690
And we call it getting back
to our roots, our amphibious

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:15.280
roots.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:24.080
But it's not-- like I said,
I'm kind of opposed to it.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.110
But that supports the big
military industrial complex,

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.257
big conventional wars.

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.840
And that's being a
little bit cynical,

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.440
but I feel I can be open here.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.550
So that's probably
the reason behind it.

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:41.240
But we're kind of getting away.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.870
We are, we're doing
exactly what you said.

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:46.800
Army?

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.370
LIAM COLLINS: Yeah,
I guess I'll go.

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:51.980
This is for non-attribution,
I'm assuming?

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.330
Let me give you my obligatory,
this is-- what's that?

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.520
CARRIE LAURENO: We
are being recorded.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520
LIAM COLLINS: All right.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.780
I don't really-- we're
doing a much better job

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.740
than we did after
Vietnam, for sure.

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:07.400
SCOTTY NEAL: So as a
former Green Beret,

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.490
you wrestle with this.

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:13.230
And old, tired soldiers
look back and reflect.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:17.830
But you know, young officers
and enlisted that come up,

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:20.650
there's so much information
that is stored somewhere

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:22.860
in some dusty building
in Kansas called

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.330
The Army Center of
Lessons Learned.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:27.870
And yet we haven't
collectively learned them.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:31.460
And some of those lessons-- they
don't come back to old soldiers

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.100
to relearn those lessons.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.020
They rely on new generations,
and it takes a while

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.171
to filter out where they were.

01:13:39.171 --> 01:13:41.420
And matter of fact, if you
look at the history of what

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.880
Ranger school was,
it was a capture

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.870
of a lesson back in
the Vietnam time.

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:48.850
And yet we still cling
on to that lesson.

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.940
I think that was the monkey
and the banana analogy is,

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.336
we don't know why we're
doing patrol bases--

01:13:54.336 --> 01:13:56.460
CARRIE LAURENO: Very, very
interesting conversation

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:56.910
last night.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:57.868
SCOTTY NEAL: But we do.

01:13:57.868 --> 01:14:01.280
CARRIE LAURENO: Monkeys
and bananas, chimpanzees.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.560
SCOTTY NEAL: We're
philosophical here.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.747
Comedy troupe,
but philosophical.

01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:09.330
ERIC STUBNER: One thing I'll say
just to add to your question.

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.650
The next conflict,
the biggest thing

01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:14.180
I would say, where's
it going to be?

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:18.030
We've adapted to
clearing buildings,

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:21.339
driving down roads,
urban terrain.

01:14:21.339 --> 01:14:22.880
You know, the enemies
in Spain close.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.088
At the end of the night they
go home to their family.

01:14:25.088 --> 01:14:27.900
You're going to their house to
knock on the door to figure out

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.390
who was the bad guy for the day.

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:32.500
Is it going to end up being
some jungle environment,

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.792
Vietnam again, where we're
not driving down roads?

01:14:36.792 --> 01:14:38.750
It's hard to say with
the direction they train,

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:40.500
because the direction
we're going to take,

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.190
and we kind of do,
is the last conflict.

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:43.890
How was it?

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:46.620
It's going to be urban,
I believe, for awhile,

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:50.390
until the next major conflict
somewhat changes its route.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.410
AUDIENCE: You guys,
I just wanted to say,

01:14:56.410 --> 01:15:01.560
I got to K2 November 24, 2011.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.510
So I was probably with you guys
as you were running in and out

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:06.400
of Afghanistan, of course.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.070
But I was with the AC130s
as an aircraft electrician.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.540
And it's not very often I get
to talk with the folks that

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.440
were actually running missions
in and out of Afghanistan

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.770
when we first got there.

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:18.252
So it's just kind of
cool to hear your stories

01:15:18.252 --> 01:15:19.960
and hear you guys
actually talk about it.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.830
People ask me what I did, and I
kind of joking with my friends

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:25.500
say, we kind of helped to throw
the spear into Afghanistan.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.041
But you guys were
like the tip of it,

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:28.920
so it was kind of
cool to meet you guys

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.128
and what you guys were doing.

01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:31.617
So thanks,

01:15:31.617 --> 01:15:33.700
SCOTTY NEAL: And I think
what we're talking about,

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.810
you can always have
a panel of 40 people

01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:38.370
because there were so
many different effects

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:42.570
between other government
agencies, other families

01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:46.960
back home, that it is a
multi-dimensional inspiration

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.540
when at the very hardest part
that this country was facing,

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.900
all of these groups and
efforts came together and was

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.060
united in one focus point.

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.740
And it had very
dramatic effects.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.720
And to the last
comment, you know,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.230
as we get a little bit looser
and looser from that time

01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:06.430
frame, we're not as unified as
we were back then supporting

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:07.460
each other for a focus.

01:16:10.829 --> 01:16:11.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.610
I'm not military, but I had a
quick comment and a question

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:15.110
for Mark.

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:17.640
First of all, I do have
two great grandfathers

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.770
that actually were the first and
last Chief of the US Cavalry,

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:22.850
and then another
ancestor that was largely

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:26.890
responsible for ushering out the
horse and ushering in the tank.

01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:30.510
So my mother was so excited
when the book "Horse Soldiers"

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:34.760
came out and all that, that her
grandfather would get his due,

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.270
because he was somewhat
lampooned for having said

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:40.650
that the horse would never,
ever be replaced by the tank.

01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:44.950
So she's thrilled with the
re-evolution, the reappearance

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:48.000
of the horse in
combat environments.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.890
My question, however,
relates to stigma.

01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:55.570
I happen to be involved with
therapy that uses storytelling

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:57.190
as a device for soldiers.

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:59.770
But we don't see very many
special forces people there.

01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:01.590
And it seems that
there-- you know,

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:05.290
the stigma for seeking mental
health support--and this is

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:08.465
for all of you-- is particularly
strong among Special Forces.

01:17:08.465 --> 01:17:10.340
And I just wonder if
there are any structures

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.270
within the Special
Forces units that

01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:16.150
often take care of their own
for those kinds of things, that

01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:18.160
particularly address
that notion of stigma.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.660
CARRIE LAURENO:
You're both laughing

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.910
about a very serious topic.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.570
MARK NUTCH: Yeah, we're--
apologize for laughing,

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:34.279
because it's a very serious
issue about the stigma.

01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:36.820
And I'm going to let Scotty talk
about that in just a second.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:47.030
For a-- I'm going to cover
your question in a couple ways.

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:52.820
First, the last US
Army Calvary charge

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.990
was during World War
II in the Philippines

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:59.280
during the Baton
Campaign, I think in 1942.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.280
I don't remember the
exact date, but you

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.634
can-- I almost said Bing it,
but you can Google it, right?

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.735
Sorry.

01:18:11.735 --> 01:18:13.220
CARRIE LAURENO: That's OK.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.120
MARK NUTCH: Anyway, to
get to your point---

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.960
CARRIE LAURENO:
Protected our freedoms.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.070
Freedom of choice.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:20.630
MARK NUTCH: No, I
want to talk just--

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:23.110
where am I going
to go with this?

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:29.469
My particular team of 12
guys has continued to serve.

01:18:29.469 --> 01:18:32.010
We've been through all this,
had senior sergeants from Desert

01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:34.260
Storm from this,
and the Gulf War.

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.594
They've spent their entire
career in Special Forces

01:18:36.594 --> 01:18:38.010
and deployed
throughout the Middle

01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:41.160
East and various
other hot spots.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.280
But every one of
those guys stayed in.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.060
Two of us left active
service, but then have

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.560
continued to deploy repeatedly.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.830
Those sergeants that
got out and retired

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.880
after they went back to Iraq,
five, six more deployments.

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.740
They, even after
retiring, have continued

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.830
to work as instructors to try
and help pass on that knowledge

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:11.430
within our community
in some way,

01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:15.350
were continuing to get on with
their life to try and continue

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:21.920
to contribute in different ways,
as are all the other veterans.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.430
But 9/11 defined our
lives in our community.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:34.490
And we are looking to
find ways to transition.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.110
I'm going to let Scott
handle the stigma, I guess.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:47.270
But what I want to say is,
we feel normal, I guess.

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:54.640
I don't feel like I have or
need to seek medical attention

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.830
and counseling
for me personally.

01:19:56.830 --> 01:20:02.560
And yes, we saw a lot of
traumatic things on my team,

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.180
specifically with our
personal experience.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:09.830
But there are veterans out
there that do need assistance,

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:12.740
and there was that stigma.

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.990
I know they've worked
hard to change that.

01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:20.740
A mutual friend of Sergeant
Stubner's and I, Nate Self,

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.980
was a Ranger captain
that was one of the first

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.590
to kind of start to speak
about this thing called

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:30.610
post traumatic stress as
a Ranger officer, infantry

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:34.130
officer, to then to
start to address that.

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.980
And his book's called "Two
Wars," where it talks about not

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.160
just about the battle you
had with your teammates,

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:44.470
but then that battle coming
back home to transition.

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.492
SCOTTY NEAL: Oh, thank you.

01:20:47.492 --> 01:20:49.600
MARK NUTCH: Yeah, thank you.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.940
SCOTTY NEAL: So now there seems
to be a lot of conversation

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.160
lately about why aren't
people opening up,

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.619
yet you heard about our
grandfathers and everything

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:58.660
else that packed it away.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:00.700
And I personally
use that analogy

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.870
in the movie "Ghostbusters" when
they would suck in the demon,

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.840
and they would go to
the big wall grid,

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.386
and they would pump it in there.

01:21:07.386 --> 01:21:08.760
And there's a very
dramatic scene

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.135
where they're
begging the person,

01:21:10.135 --> 01:21:12.410
don't open up that wall.

01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:14.710
But we have coping mechanisms
that are different.

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:16.975
And I remind a lot of people
that Special Operations

01:21:16.975 --> 01:21:20.530
and Special Forces are highly
trained and highly selected.

01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:22.470
And those one character
traits are actually

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.800
brought out during
our selection course.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:30.020
So the way to start engaging
and getting people to open up

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:34.900
is through leadership of exactly
what we're doing here, OK?

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.140
Starting on the edges,
telling the story.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.020
And remember, this
is a trusted network,

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.020
and to think a health
professional can

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.800
come in instantly and you
will trust them with something

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.460
that you were trying to put
a little bit further down

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.700
is difficult.

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:55.190
So what I tend to say to others
that, instead of spending

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:57.740
years upon years getting a
health professional to be

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.120
trusted, why don't
we just equip those

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.305
that are trusted
to be better peers?

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.860
CARRIE LAURENO: Other questions?

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.534
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:12.200
First I just want to
say that I couldn't

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.520
be more proud as an American
and as a New Yorker to know

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.980
that all of you were
there to defend us

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.420
after the events of 9/11.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:25.240
So thank you very much.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.360
This is kind of directed
to Scott and to Mark,

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.940
but they referred
to Special Forces

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:33.330
as the quiet professionals.

01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:38.110
And in a world where
everyone is quick

01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:44.240
to dramatize or romanticize
our war fighters as just that,

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.300
as fighters, can you
talk a little bit

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.090
about what it means to
be a quiet professional,

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:55.910
and maybe how you're
trained to avoid conflict

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:59.570
in many situations,
avoid fighting and harm

01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:05.790
to the locals whose
environment you come into?

01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:07.910
SCOTTY NEAL: So for anybody
who doesn't know John,

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:11.780
John works for UBS and has
very quietly and patiently

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.940
helped the Green Beret
Foundation, especially

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:18.080
Mark, led to that statue you
see in the background, which

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.930
led to the larger
one at Ground Zero.

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:22.290
And what he's getting
at is, we can hardly

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:24.230
tell our stories to ourselves.

01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:28.640
Yet through our engagement,
strategically a lot of people

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.290
have come around
to help us engage.

01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:36.600
If a Green Beret and
Special Forces particularly,

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.410
we are not the sharpest
tool in the toolbox.

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:42.060
We're very clever tools,
and at any one time

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:45.120
we're deployed between
50 to 55 countries

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.760
in small elements,
usually 12-man team.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.100
And we're on the very
edges of stability.

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.780
We're on the very
edges of diplomacy.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.910
In one of those pictures
in there I wore a suit.

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:59.310
So a good Special Forces
soldier are on the other edges

01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:01.780
before they boil
up into conflicts.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:05.700
And it's funny, at the
very end of my time

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:09.500
before I retired in 2010,
I helped start a program.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.620
And I had a very
minor part, but it

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.240
was called Village Stability
Operations, which actually

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.340
put Green Berets and SEALS
back into the villagers,

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:21.275
treating them dentistry,
local medicine, all

01:24:21.275 --> 01:24:23.250
of these other things
that would deliver

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:24.880
some of these social services.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.441
And they weren't the tools of
black helicopters and night

01:24:27.441 --> 01:24:27.940
vision.

01:24:31.294 --> 01:24:32.960
LIAM COLLINS: Yeah,
I'll answer the part

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.168
about the quiet professional.

01:24:34.168 --> 01:24:36.800
I think every organization
has a culture.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.240
I mean, Google's got a culture.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.640
So I think, why is
it so important to be

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.900
a quiet professional for
something like-- especially

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.140
in Special Forces, which
has 12-person detachment.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.050
Ranger Regiment's a
little larger platoons,

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:52.719
their companies that
they're operating under.

01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:55.010
But fundamentally you've got
to trust the person that's

01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:56.450
next to you, because
your life is on the line

01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:57.408
with them all the time.

01:24:57.408 --> 01:25:01.910
And if it's something
that-- someone's out

01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:04.606
for their own personal gain,
then you can't trust them.

01:25:04.606 --> 01:25:05.980
And then if you
can't trust them,

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.547
that's-- instead of
being down to 11 people,

01:25:08.547 --> 01:25:10.880
you're really down to 10,
because now you've got to have

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.838
somebody watch the person
that you can't trust.

01:25:12.838 --> 01:25:15.160
So I think it really
comes down to that.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.660
And yeah, there's always going
to be some that go out there,

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.210
and I guess write and
do stuff after that.

01:25:20.210 --> 01:25:24.710
But there's been no real
book or movie written

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:26.470
about getting Saddam
Hussein, and that's

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:29.410
the way it should be for
these kind of things.

01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:30.819
That's all I'll say.

01:25:30.819 --> 01:25:32.319
CARRIE LAURENO: Any
other questions?

01:25:37.315 --> 01:25:38.690
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:40.065
for-- I don't know
if this is on.

01:25:40.065 --> 01:25:41.275
It's on, OK.

01:25:41.275 --> 01:25:42.150
Thank you for coming.

01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:45.225
We're just honored
to have you here.

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:45.725
I'm curious.

01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:50.630
What's the most useful
thing that any of you

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:55.420
have ever seen a civilian do
in terms of helping people,

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.150
service members when they come
back, whether they're still

01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:01.650
active in the military
or when they're exiting?

01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:04.060
Is there anything in particular
that you would say about

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.930
that you could tell us?

01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:07.710
JOE QUINN: Yeah.

01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:09.704
I would say just show up.

01:26:09.704 --> 01:26:11.620
You know, tomorrow's
going to be Veterans Day,

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.970
and we're going to be--
the Google Analytics,

01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:16.940
the word veteran's
going to spike high,

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.670
and then it's going to come
right down the next day.

01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:24.196
So to me, it's just show up.

01:26:24.196 --> 01:26:26.320
I'm part of a veteran
organization called Team Red,

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:26.900
White &amp; Blue.

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.704
And to go back what Colonel
Einsenhower's saying,

01:26:29.704 --> 01:26:31.120
veterans returning
to communities,

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.637
not returning to the Pentagon.

01:26:33.637 --> 01:26:35.470
And they're going to
be in your communities,

01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:37.400
and they're not going
to be wearing this.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.108
They might not be
wearing a suit, either.

01:26:39.108 --> 01:26:42.200
But they're in your communities.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.730
And for me, the
most important thing

01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:47.670
is just showing up and
introducing yourself,

01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:50.880
and getting to
actually know a veteran

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.844
beyond just the thank you.

01:26:53.844 --> 01:26:55.510
SCOTTY NEAL: I want
to add to that, too,

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:59.350
and I hate to dominate the
microphone, but-- anyways.

01:26:59.350 --> 01:27:02.440
Just like Special
Forces and Recon,

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.180
we are the military scouts.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:07.370
We go into these very ambiguous
areas and we map it out.

01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:09.876
We get an understanding of
the language and the culture

01:27:09.876 --> 01:27:11.500
and the sensitivities,
all these things

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:15.590
that intelligence from
afar can't tell you.

01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:17.460
And it's the same
thing in communities.

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.259
So beyond that, how
do you take a veteran

01:27:19.259 --> 01:27:20.800
and you show that
amount of patience,

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.500
and you show them business
cultures, work cultures,

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.310
how to start a business, all of
these simple mentoring things.

01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:31.660
Because once they're upright
in a community, they excel.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:35.990
And I tell everybody, every
mission's a business plan.

01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:39.740
The truth of why we're selected
and we had successful careers

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.560
are the same characters that
a lot of these companies

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:45.080
seem to be starving
for, everyone I engage.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.590
So if you just take that
patience and that little bit

01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:52.310
of remolding, and understand
the transition phases

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:55.372
that a person goes through,
then what you get out

01:27:55.372 --> 01:27:57.830
of that is you get somebody
that's re-centered and oriented

01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:00.020
and just loyal 'til
the day is long.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.420
And they become good
citizens and employees back

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.450
in the community.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.240
CARRIE LAURENO: Any
final questions?

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:08.781
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:09.910
I have one quick question.

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:11.890
Thank you so much
for being here.

01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:15.686
I lost my cousin after
2001 in Afghanistan,

01:28:15.686 --> 01:28:19.050
and just hearing these stories
is so amazing and touching.

01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:22.010
My question is, in
2007 and leading

01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:24.710
into 2008 when the
sentiment at home

01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:26.450
really started to
turn against the war,

01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:30.710
when Rumsfeld was
replaced and-- how

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:34.450
did that feel internally for
you guys in the military?

01:28:34.450 --> 01:28:38.080
Was it something that the
waves of political sentiment

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.806
come and go, and
this is your job

01:28:39.806 --> 01:28:41.180
and you just go
and do your duty?

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.080
Or did you really
start to feel it?

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.560
Did it feel like how we hear
about Vietnam vets coming home

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.040
and they don't get the parades?

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.270
Did it feel like
that, or did it not?

01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:55.530
LIAM COLLINS: I mean, for me
it didn't really impact it.

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.519
I was actually surprised
that the wave probably

01:28:57.519 --> 01:28:58.560
stayed as long as it did.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.761
I expected it to kind
of go down a lot sooner.

01:29:00.761 --> 01:29:02.260
Because we just--
I mean, in America

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.060
we don't have the
patience for a long war.

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.500
It's just, we're worried
about quarterly earnings, not

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.360
long-term growth.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:13.010
So I expected it to die down
a lot sooner than it did.

01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:15.349
So it didn't really
impact me, but I'm

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:17.140
sure others might have
a different opinion.

01:29:21.859 --> 01:29:23.400
SCOTTY NEAL: So once
again, you know,

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.750
it's interesting that I went
from the tactical aspects

01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:29.970
of being on the ground, deployed
five to six times continuously,

01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:31.730
usually two months at a time.

01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:33.814
And you're not aware
of the politics side.

01:29:33.814 --> 01:29:36.230
That's what's unique about
soldiers is we really don't get

01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:39.940
into policy, politics,
and public perception,

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:41.750
the three bad P's.

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:44.210
But then when I went to the
strategic headquarters and I

01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:46.850
started realizing
that they really

01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:50.060
are what shapes
America's military

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.880
and how it looks at
fighting this war,

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.440
restricting resources.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.600
And I saw the fight
at a different level,

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.890
from the distance of
Washington to manage

01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:02.050
the public perception.

01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:04.430
Yet the soldiers,
once again, were still

01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:08.130
motivated about that day, 9/11,
and what they're going for.

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:10.030
And if you still
look at it, you know,

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:11.610
the recruitment was still high.

01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:14.250
There were still youth
joining the military.

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.170
They still believed in
the cause of their fight.

01:30:17.170 --> 01:30:22.360
What had shifted was how we
were going to maintain that.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.740
And now we had a
different magnet,

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.526
and that magnet was the
politics and the public pressure

01:30:28.526 --> 01:30:30.026
that kind of started
to bend things.

01:30:32.745 --> 01:30:34.245
CARRIE LAURENO: Any
final questions?

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:43.570
SCOTTY NEAL: First I want
to thank Carrie, by the way.

01:30:43.570 --> 01:30:47.740
We first met-- we had a little
event at the National 9/11

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:50.650
Museum as a way for us to put
closure to the effects of war

01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.525
and started talking
about our own transition.

01:30:52.525 --> 01:30:55.610
And Carrie came there a
little bit patient at first.

01:30:55.610 --> 01:31:00.390
But she has really been a
tiger in the veterans' space

01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:03.900
and wants to know how Google can
help, because they have tools

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.790
and they have a brand that
everybody admires and loves.

01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:10.910
And we began working
very closely after that.

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:13.360
And really every
day she has worked

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.590
very hard, along with everybody
else that you probably

01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:20.490
don't see behind the scenes, in
understanding the National 9/11

01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:22.260
Museum, and
understanding New York

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:25.610
City and its feelings
for that very day,

01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.820
that this really is
truly monumental.

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:30.660
And if I were in
this organization,

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.180
I would learn how
initiatives begin

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:35.100
and how they come
together at the end.

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:37.880
And that needs to be studied
as well, because it really

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.030
was a drive and a vision
that finally became reality

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:44.390
by this panel today.

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:45.872
CARRIE LAURENO:
Thank you, Scotty.

01:31:45.872 --> 01:31:52.760
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.710
I say this a lot,
and I really mean it,

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:57.230
that the inspiration
is so strong

01:31:57.230 --> 01:32:00.350
that it makes it easy
for me to do my job.

01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:04.840
I know so many service members
and count them as friends,

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.630
you among them at this point.

01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:10.390
And it's easy to
see why I love what

01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:14.570
I do when there are incredible
stories like those on the stage

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:17.070
that you all have been sharing.

01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:18.780
I want to make one
final comment, which

01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:23.740
is many of these gentlemen have
their family members here today

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.030
in this audience.

01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:29.590
And while we talk a lot
about the heroism that

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:33.930
happens in the military, and
the type of personality that

01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:39.500
is able to sustain all
kinds of serious danger,

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.230
there are people
who are at home who

01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:43.330
are taking care
of these families

01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:48.360
and making sure that these men
have a life to come home to.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.920
The burden on the family
is absolutely enormous.

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.510
Mark shared among
the most difficult,

01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:58.450
and so did several
other people here.

01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:01.290
There are tremendous sacrifices
on a personal basis that

01:33:01.290 --> 01:33:04.247
are made so that
when there is a need,

01:33:04.247 --> 01:33:06.830
there are people in this country
who are willing to go and put

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:09.670
themselves in harm's way so that
the rest of us don't have to.

01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:11.540
And I just-- I really
want to take a moment

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:15.130
to recognize those women
who are here who held down

01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:18.180
those families and took
care of those children

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:22.502
and made sure that the family
unit survived and sustained

01:33:22.502 --> 01:33:24.710
these individuals to go in
and do the types of things

01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:25.293
that they did.

01:33:25.293 --> 01:33:28.110
So if we could-- I'm going
to ask you all to stand up.

01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:31.468
Please do, because
it's your day, too.

01:33:31.468 --> 01:33:42.407
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:42.407 --> 01:33:43.490
CARRIE LAURENO: Thank you.

01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:46.470
And with that, I'd like to
call up Colonel Eisenhower,

01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:49.180
and we can stay up here.

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.750
Colonel James Eisenhower
is a special assistant

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:54.480
to the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.280
He commands the Office
of Reintegration,

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.540
and Colonel Eisenhower is a
tremendous partner and friend

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.210
of ours here at Google.

01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:06.480
His office is tasked
with facilitating

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.070
inter-service communication,
fostering community solutions

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:14.240
to the challenges facing
veterans and military families,

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.780
and to further civilian
military understanding, which

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.620
is what this panel
was all about today.

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.412
Colonel Eisenhower.

01:34:21.412 --> 01:34:22.453
JAMES EISENHOWER: Thanks.

01:34:22.453 --> 01:34:24.210
Thanks for the
opportunity to talk.

01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:27.240
Happy birthday to the
Marines, 239 years.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:33.960
And 69 years ago today
also was very important,

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.760
because Army beat Notre
Dame 48 to nothing

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.070
and were the national champions.

01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:41.410
So that's where I live.

01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:43.730
I wanted to stand back
here and thank Carrie,

01:34:43.730 --> 01:34:46.290
because this is what I
know of Liam Collins.

01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:47.210
It's the back view.

01:34:47.210 --> 01:34:50.110
She said Liam can run
a mile in six minutes.

01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:53.932
No, Liam can run two
miles in about 9:20.

01:34:53.932 --> 01:34:55.390
LIAM COLLINS: Slower.

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.510
JAMES EISENHOWER: Slower.

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:56.176
A little slower?

01:34:56.176 --> 01:34:57.500
9:40?

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.647
And we were classmates
at West Point,

01:34:59.647 --> 01:35:01.230
and I only knew the
back view of Liam,

01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:03.430
because when you run
the APFT at West Point,

01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:05.519
you do it in groups
of, like, 20.

01:35:05.519 --> 01:35:06.810
And there's 4,000 cadets there.

01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:08.393
And you do it over
the course of days.

01:35:08.393 --> 01:35:10.840
And I kept getting
put in Liam's group,

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.380
and he would run in, like, 9:20.

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.950
And by the time I finished--
I was passing, but by the time

01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:21.540
I finished he was showered and
had a pizza out and was dining.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.630
And so this guy's
six minutes is what

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.600
he runs when I'm on his back.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.591
Carrie, thanks very much for
asking us to come up here

01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:30.590
and for putting this on.

01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:31.920
And thanks to Google.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.720
Thanks to all of you
for your contribution

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.190
to the common defense.

01:35:35.190 --> 01:35:37.800
You probably want to know
why I'm saying that now,

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.400
and I'll be really
quick with you.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.510
The chairman, General
Dempsey, for whom I work,

01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:45.840
has no statutory obligation
when it comes to service members

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.510
after they leave the service.

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:50.370
Neither does DOD.

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:52.390
But he says we've got
a moral obligation

01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:54.740
to take care of these men
and women who've served.

01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.990
So he's put our office together.

01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:59.490
We've got several lieutenant
colonels and a colonel.

01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:02.740
And we in the Chairman's
Office of Reintegration

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.330
try to go out and
understand where

01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:07.840
there are fantastic examples
of effective reintegration

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.480
mechanisms.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.919
And we take that
and we share it.

01:36:09.919 --> 01:36:11.460
We're really just
a knowledge broker.

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.010
We're not bringing
anybody money,

01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:16.209
and we're not bringing
anybody manpower.

01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:18.250
But let me tell you why
I think that's important.

01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.367
Reintegration's hard.

01:36:19.367 --> 01:36:20.950
And we had a great
question over here,

01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:23.599
what's the most important
or significant thing

01:36:23.599 --> 01:36:24.640
that civilians have done?

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.300
And I would submit to you,
answering the question,

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.561
is that it's more
than just a handshake.

01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:33.060
You'll hear the chairman say
often, we don't need a handout,

01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:34.150
we need a handshake.

01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:37.100
I'd ask you to follow it up
with just a brief conversation.

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.400
It's a dialogue.

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.150
Why?

01:36:39.150 --> 01:36:42.260
Because all we know for
the duration of our service

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.377
is the military culture.

01:36:43.377 --> 01:36:45.710
Most of us entered right out
of high school or right out

01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:46.570
of college.

01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:49.380
We know nothing else when
it comes to our adult life.

01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.110
And military culture
is necessarily

01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:54.400
very different than
the civilian community,

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.970
because at the end of the day we
must be effective war fighters.

01:36:57.970 --> 01:37:00.460
That culture will
always be different.

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.060
You are masters of
the civilian community

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:05.750
because you live
and thrive there.

01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:08.960
Believe it or not, it's
intimidating to us.

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.360
We are far more comfortable
going in from 18,000 feet

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:17.600
into Afghanistan, or getting
on the back of a striker

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.264
and riding into downtown Baghdad
in the middle of the surge,

01:37:20.264 --> 01:37:22.680
than we would be to try to
navigate the civilian landscape

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.780
here in New York
City and find a job.

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:26.500
We're not good at it.

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.930
You know it, and you can
help us manage that process

01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:32.860
by simply giving us advice.

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:34.870
Ask us how we're doing.

01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:37.121
If we need any advice based
off of your own expertise,

01:37:37.121 --> 01:37:39.453
say, look, I've been here at
Google for this many years.

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:41.690
I've been here in New
York City for five years.

01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:42.850
Do you have a dentist?

01:37:42.850 --> 01:37:44.120
Do you have a church?

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.070
Where do you think
you want to work?

01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:47.930
What are you
thinking about doing?

01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:52.380
If you can help us
navigate the landscape,

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:54.160
you help us become
much more successful,

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.000
and we will become
the civic assets

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.500
that you've already
heard veterans typically

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.210
tend to become.

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.220
The chairman published
an Op Ed a year

01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:06.500
and a half ago, and it
was a shot across the bow

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.940
to everyone in uniform.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:09.830
When we talk about the
civil military divide,

01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:11.760
most people say,
well, the civilians

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.140
need to understand more
about the military.

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.460
And you all have done a
wonderful job of allowing us

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.407
a platform where we
can share with you some

01:38:18.407 --> 01:38:19.990
of the characteristics
and things that

01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:23.100
make military culture different,
and that professional ethos

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.080
unique and distinct.

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.360
But the chairman said to
those who are in uniform,

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.915
we need to understand more
about the civilian community.

01:38:29.915 --> 01:38:31.540
So that's where I'd
ask you to come in.

01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:33.160
Help us.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.500
Extend the hand, but
follow that handshake

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.950
with a short discussion
or a short dialogue that

01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:42.220
helps us navigate this
difficult terrain.

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.600
That will make all the
difference in the world.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:45.390
And here's why.

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.250
The target for us is the
dinnertime conversation

01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:52.950
that's going to
happen in 10 years

01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:55.590
when a young lady asks
her mom or dad which

01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:57.757
service she should join.

01:38:57.757 --> 01:38:59.840
We don't want it to be,
should I join the service,

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.834
but which service should I join?

01:39:01.834 --> 01:39:04.000
And the counsel she's going
to get from her parents,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.970
and from her priest, and from
her soccer coach and counselor,

01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:10.850
is going to be shaped by the
success with which we embrace

01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:14.390
veterans today here in New York
City and across the country.

01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:17.125
And if they see our society
embrace veterans and recognize

01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:20.530
them for the civic assets
we know they can become,

01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:22.780
then you're going to preserve
the all-volunteer force.

01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:25.454
And you're going to encourage
those kids, the youth of today,

01:39:25.454 --> 01:39:27.870
to raise their hand and take
an oath to support and defend

01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:30.630
the Constitution of
the United States.

01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.554
That's your contribution
to the common defense.

01:39:33.554 --> 01:39:35.970
So on behalf of General Dempsey,
the Chairman of the Joint

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.840
Chiefs of Staff, thanks
for your contribution

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.780
to the common defense today.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.910
And I'd hope you take
this example that Google

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.320
has set for the rest
of us and propagate it

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.640
across our country, and try to
embrace veterans and understand

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.480
more about them.

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.680
But help us understand more
about the civilian community

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.006
to which we will return.

01:39:55.006 --> 01:39:56.500
Thanks very much.

01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:05.670
CARRIE LAURENO: With that, I'd
love to wish a happy Veterans

01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:07.700
Day to all of our service
members who are here

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:11.040
today to thank you
for your service.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.770
And thank you to you gentlemen
for sharing your most

01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:16.310
personal stories
with us in an effort

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:20.510
to make this community here at
Google-- and everyone watching

01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:24.570
this video online,
eventually-- aware of the fact

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:27.219
that in their community there
are veterans there as well.

01:40:27.219 --> 01:40:29.010
I love the idea of
following up a handshake

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:29.950
with a conversation.

01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:31.380
We try to do that here.

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:34.464
We care deeply about supporting
the transition of our veterans

01:40:34.464 --> 01:40:35.880
and our military
families and will

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.050
continue to do so for
a long time to come.

01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.950
Thank you, everyone.

01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:41.500
[APPLAUSE]
