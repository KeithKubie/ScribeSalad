Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          I want to shift to the book or you want to keep going? No, no, no. Please, please. I would much rather talk about this book. All right. So it's called blueprint, the evolutionary origins of a good society. So let's start with the tag there. So we actually live in a good society. I can't believe it. I thought we live in the worst society ever and I thought capitalism is evil and the patriarchy and so many terrible things and we've done horrible things. But you say this is good. Yeah, I'm appalled. Can you please explain this matter statement? Yes. Okay. So I think there has been a long tradition in the sciences and in the public domain as well of um, focusing on the bad side of human nature, on our propensity for tribalism or selfishness or violence or hatred. But equally we are natural selection of our evolution has equipped us and shaped us for love and friendship and cooperation and teaching and all these other wonderful qualities.

Speaker 2:          00:59          And in fact, I would argue that these good qualities and their benefits must necessarily have outweighed the bad qualities and their costs. Because if I came near you, I'm now speaking of over evolutionary time, over tens or hundreds of thousands of years. If I came near you and you killed me or filled me with lies or otherwise injured me, I would be better off living separately. So, so the, so the fact that we live socially suggest that on balance, the benefits of a connected life must outweigh the costs. So the books, the book, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to push back at these claims that we are, that humans are inexorably evil. And these arguments I should make, I should say, are supplementary to the, uh, the body of ideas that Steven pinker and others had been advancing about the sweep of history. So where Stephen is interested in historical forces, I'm interested in the books over there.

Speaker 2:          01:52          So yeah. And Amy's, I see in a bunch of other younger Steven and give me all my friends Neil Neil crew by data. So you want to be a man? Yes, please. Put me over there with those guys. Yes, exactly. You're like some of those guys. Yes. And Schirmer's book. I can see. Yeah. These are great. Um, okay. So, uh, uh, yeah, the moral arc that you know. Okay, great. So I'll make sure you have a copy. Okay. But anyway, um, so, so, um, so, uh, uh, so Steven is arguing that, uh, you know, basically since the enlightenment philosophical principles in the scientific discoveries, discoveries of the enlightenment, the world has been getting better and he's unquestionably bright. We are safer, less violent, healthier, live, longer, wealthier, better off in every, every possible dimension. And that is largely a product of historical forces. But what I'm arguing and technological forces, but when I'm arguing is that we don't just have to look to our history to find this goodness.

Speaker 2:          02:47          We can look to our pre history. And actually over tens of thousands of years we've been shaped to be good. We have been shaped to be able to live together in productive ways, in, in, in, in good ways, actually in morally good ways. I even argue so, so the both work synergistically, these two forces and in, and in fact I would even argue that these historical and technological forces are actually just a thin veneer on top of much more powerful forces. So is there a bizarre evolutionary force that that inclines us to focus on the negative on? No, that's a good question. I suspect if I had to, I get one per show. No, no, no, no, no. Um, I would say right, cause if you ask if you a person are things good or bad, people generally tend to bed. We watch local news. That is all terrible news.

Speaker 2:          03:33          We're conditioned sort of. So there must be something that's leading to that. Yes. I think that, I think, I know this has been studied, I'm trying to quickly call the literature to my mind. Um, if I had to speculate on what the conclusions of that literature would be, it would be that there's more advantage to paying attention to bad news and good news that the fitness advantage of survival advantage, the advantage to your wellbeing from, um, noting a fire in your vicinity or a Predator or a killer, uh, is more advantageous to you than, than, uh, than noted the noting that on average the presence of water or a food or a kindly person. So I think, I think that that's probably why we're hardwired to be pessimistic, but actually we're not, let me be clear. So, so we have both pessimistic and optimistic, uh, inclinations people, and of course there's Inter individual variation.

Speaker 2:          04:28          People vary in this, these personality traits. But I think overall we are definitely inclined to the good. So when you described yourself as an optimist before, if you had to try to parse that out between what you think human nature is versus upbringing and everything else, could you give it some percentages? I mean where your parents, optimists so that then push a well as ideas to you or I think it's important not to conflate personality traits, uh, which I am a optimist I think in person by personality with um, sort of, um, how to put this exactly the kind of characteristics of our species. So I think we, for example, we are cooperative species. We cooperate with strangers, which is very unusual. Other animals will cooperate with kin, but we also cooperate with non-kin rare in the animal kingdom. So I don't know how you would describe that.

Speaker 2:          05:19          I wouldn't call that optimism exactly. I would call that something good cooperativity. That's a characteristic of our species. And then above and beyond that we also have personalities. Some of us are optimistic, some of us are not. But all of us, for example, love our mates. So here's an interesting idea why, why do we do that? Other animals to have sex with each other. We're not the only animals that do this, but we also love each other. We formed sentimental attachments to the people we are having sex with. We are also tend to be monogamous. And that we can be by monogamous, I don't mean social monogamy or even heterosexual monogamy. I mean we form a longterm attachment to the person we're having sex with. Whether it's polygynous, polyandrous, straight or gay, doesn't matter. We love the person we're with. Why? Why do we evolve this capacity?

Speaker 2:          06:07          Well, I talk a little bit about that. Why would do that? And it's universal. Everywhere in the world you go, no matter what the marital system, people love their partners instantly. Plus we get too proud of ourselves. Birds. 90% of bird species are also monogamous. But anyway, so the point is is that there are all these qualities we have or we befriend each other. Why do we do that? We, we don't just reproduce with each other. We form longterm non reproductive unions with other members of our species. Namely, we have friends. This is very rare in the animal kingdom. We do it. Certain primates do it, whales, orcas and dolphins do it. And elephants do it. Why? Well, there's a reason we do it and it's a wonderful quality of our species. So do you think societies should be organized to help these institutions? I mean, this is where I could throw out Jordan Peterson's enforced monogamy and you know, people had a field day with that and all he really was saying was that societies should kind of look at marriages, it Justin thing because it's a foundational thing that will help you build a family, has helped you build it for full of life.

Speaker 2:          07:06          Do you agree that that's part of what would lead to a good society or which should be instilled? Well, I say I talk about that in the book. Uh, when I talk about is that we should be very wary of efforts to engineer society in opposition to our evolved proclivities. So societies that try for example, to prevent loving attachments. I talk about communes, for example, communes have a problem because in a commune they want you to feel loyalty to the group, to the commune. So therefore feeling of love for your partner is a threat. So many communes have gone two opposite extremes, both of which are attempting to solve the same problem. So on the one hand you have the shakers who say no sex, no loving attachment. On the other hand, you have comments that say polyamory, everyone loves everybody or can have sex with everyone.

Speaker 2:          07:54          Both of those are attempting to sever an individualistic connection between two people, which therefore you, and the same thing happens in eastern Germany where they tried to several connections with friends, right? You don't, you who my friends could be spying on me or ratting out to the Stazi. It's, it's sitting there for a second cause it's a fascinating idea. The same force at work. Whether you say to people don't have any release. Yes, he's actually the same course as have relations with everybody. I mean that's, that's not something that the average person is thinking about. But if you're just having relations with everybody, yes, you're actually, I don't think there's want special nobody. That's right. So they're both, both of those extreme strategies are tackling the same problem, which is the threat to the collectivity of individual relationships, whether it's with your partner, your sexual partner, or as I was about to say with your friends or others.

Speaker 2:          08:39          So collectivist societies will often, every week everyone call you comrade. So everyone is your friend. Same as having polyamory, right? It's like the polyamorous equivalent to everyone dresses the same. We all call each other friend. No individual identity. It's a kind of, it's a kind of science fiction, dystopia. So the argument I make is that we should be very wary of efforts to engineer society in opposition to our interests. There are bound to fail is my argument. Now there are brief moments of time and certain cultures where you can apply a tremendous cultural force and suppress some of these innate tendencies. So for example, I talk about the not, so if you look at societies around the world that the, the, the, the expression of love for your is seen universally except perhaps with one exception, which is the not people in the Himalayas who've organized society around a brief sexual encounters.

Speaker 2:          09:31          You're not supposed to love your partner. And so this is a matrilineal society. The women stay at home. The men will go out at night basically cruising for dates. So there'll be like, and it's not uncommon for every woman to have had sex with every man in the village. And, uh, the, the men will be knocking on the door, take me tonight, take me, and she'll pick this guy tonight and they'll have a brief fling. Maybe he can come back. And at any moment, either of them can break off the relationship, but even in it. And so there's a whole complex cultural edifice. Marco Polo describes this. When he gets to China, the Chinese government thought it was sapping productivity, that everyone was having sex all the time. They were, they were saying, and we need to stop this. They tried to stamp it out, but it still has existed.

Speaker 2:          10:12          This, this culture, this, this cultural set of rules. But even in this society, there are people who want the forbidden fruit of having a, a committed relationship and who flee for because they want to be with each other, forsaking all others. So even the society cannot fully suppressed this desire for love. And I look also at friendship and show that there are some societies, very few which seem to have no, um, experience of this notion of friendship. But those societies are extremely rare and also have certain idiosyncrasies. So the simple way of saying that there's basically an evolutionary force that no matter how far you go to one extreme, it has to sort of push you. Yes. Or that it's extremely difficult to entirely suppressed. You can through force of arms, you know, you can slaughter populations, you can, you can, you know, you can, uh, you can um, have very elaborate, uh, sort of autocratic governments.

Speaker 2:          11:06          You can have procedures or other highly evolved stylized cultures that have cotton to this. For example, there's a play is universal and children and there's one society that banning people who really think play is awful and really try to suppress the innate tendency of children to play. So there's very little play among children in that society, but it's, these societies are rare and they require very large cultural forces to suppress these innate tendencies. You know, I was thinking as we've been talking about this, that there's something also sort of related to our political situation right now about this, that it seems like we're sort of going off the deep end. I would say the argue more on the left at the moment. Um, but I guess if I'm an optimist here and I described myself as a world weary opt that you're saying at some point and whether Jonathan Haidt says it's two years down the road or whenever it is, but at some point that will eventually have to rebound.

Speaker 2:          11:58          Right? Cause sure. What is it? If it doesn't rebound then, then that's just, no, I don't think Jordan Peterson would say is just chaos. Right? Yeah. I think, I think, I mean, I, I can't, I think we're in for another, I think there'll be about five or 10 years our society is going to go through a long period of, of, of acrimony. No, I have to say I'm not, you know, um, sort of don't have a wig ish view of history. Like, oh, in the olden days, you know, uh, everything was great. I mean, let's not forget we had, we had colonialism, we had slavery, we had a, we had die anti immigrant sentiment forever and are because even vote, I mean women couldn't vote. Exactly. Do you have gay rights? You know. Uh, so, so there's always been this, uh, this incredible disconnect between our wonderful principles in our society.

Speaker 2:          12:45          All men are created equal. You know, the bill of rights can bring tears to your eyes if you read it, but a, and the fact that we didn't always, but we are, I think getting better. This is the progressive in me, you know, the society, we're getting better and better. We are expanding the franchise to more and more people. We are opening up our democracy. We are, we are extending rights, we are extending liberties. Um, now of course the libertarian, we'll say the government doesn't grant liberty. We are protecting liberties are, you know, we are trying to stay out, but it took me right out of my head. Exactly. And I agree with that actually. I don't think the liberties for the governments to grant, but anyway, so, uh, but I think our society's is getting better in these regards. Um, I don't think you can, you could say otherwise.

Speaker 2:          13:28          So I think that we, we will get there. It just is gonna take some time. So how do you navigate through a messy time like this? If you're someone that's just kind of awake to these ideas and you want to be able to express your individuality, but there is a mob or a morphous machine that is silencing things, or as you just said before, that you don't want a society that's going to push down things that were sort of always accepted for a long time. I'm slightly paraphrasing, but, so right now it's like if you call a man a man, they'll tell you you're a transfer. These, these basic things that seem, now we hear about them constantly as if, as if this is just the most important thing happening. And No, I think there are other, this is the other thing. I think that, I think there are certain segments of Twitter and certain segments of our society that have made these particular topics and others a very central, and everyone, you know, the people who want to, who are concerned about climate change or people who come as I am, there are people who are concerned about the private practice prison industry as I am.

Speaker 2:          14:25          These are two hot topics at Harvard right now. So there was a heckler situation where the president of Harvard was, was not allowed to speak about, he was at an educational conference and these groups that were opposed to private ownership of prisons, which I am and, uh, concern about climate change, which I also am, they shut the president down, which is ridiculous, you know? And why did they shut him down? Cause he thought he wasn't taking, paying enough attention to their concerns. So you have this kind of rule by minorities, right? Where am I in a vocal minority can hijack the conversation about whatever particular topic they have. So everyone's entitled to have their topics of interest. But that doesn't mean you have to go along with it right? You can have your own ideas about the topic or you can switch conversation. Like I'm not interested in talking about trans rights today.

Speaker 2:          15:06          Today I'd like to talk about, uh, how motor vehicle accidents are the one of the leading killers or the opioid crisis is another important dilemma. Or the guns. You know, we, we, we have, we have more people are killed by guns in our society per capita than any society in the world almost. It's craziness. So, um, so all of these are different people have different, anyway, the point I'm making is that if you wish to engage in a conversation with someone about a topic they feel strongly about, I think it's incumbent on you to listen to their arguments, think, and then respond.

Speaker 3:          15:35          So do you think there's an evolutionary reason that people either basically become sort of government people or freedom people? So the way you were laying out that argument, it's not going to go, it's like you were telling me your progressive, uh, sort of prayed, which I have to do all the time. But then you basically said, yeah, but all these things can be accomplished by libertarianism if you don't believe that it's the government's job to give these things. So that basically it sort of shows why the progressive's are the ones screaming on campus all the time and in and in larger society because they think the system can be perfected to get it however they want it. Where the Libertarians, I think just say I'm very wearable. Yeah, I don't think the system can be perfect. So let's just keep it out of our lives. I mean, I think, you know, which, which idea I'm more sympathetic to, but do you think there's a reason that,

Speaker 2:          16:20          well, I heard that, yes. Okay. So there are, there are a set of ideas about where do, where do so, so the content of political beliefs, like whether, for example, you believe in, um, whatever it is, pick, I know any, the, the, the belief you have about a particular topic because of course not evolutionarily shaped, but there is a kind of evolutionary shaping to whether or not you are more conservative or liberal. Let's it, that's what I'm trying to get. Yeah. So some people are more rule abiding and there's an, there's a good, for example, children that learn children that listen to their parents might be more likely to survive. So listening to your parents is actually a good survival strategy. On the other hand, too much obedience is also bad. You can be led like a lemming off a cliff. So occasionally you need to not listen to what everyone else is doing.

Speaker 2:          17:11          So both are advantageous and we're, we're equipped with both abilities and there's variation across people and it's a complicated topic. So nobody thinks there's like a genetic background to being a Democrat or a Republican. But there is evidence that there is a kind of genetic predisposition to certain political polls. But what I would say though is that we live in a plural democracy. So you're going to have to compromise, you know, uh, if you're libertarian who thinks x, Y, and Z and you're, you're going to be in a society with other people who think different things. We have decided to come together as a people and vote to resolve our disputes. And t by the way, not to vote, but to educate ourselves and to teach each other stuff. Right. To communicate. Right. The founders recognize that in order for us to get to the wisest decision, we have to have free and open conversation.

Speaker 2:          18:00          Right. Well, I think that's why, which I support. I do hear of. Cool. Of course you do. But that's why so many people are so concerned about this at the college layer. You know, I'll hear some of our critics will say, oh, they're just obsessed with what's happening on colleges and they're handing over all this power to the, to the mob oncologists. But then, but then every day we see it then leak out. And also these people will be the leaders of tomorrow. That's why I don't think it's, I don't think it's overestimating. And even if it is a small minority, which we agree, the amount of power they can extend, they definitely used to be way disproportionate to the numbers for sure. I would agree with that. Uh, I would agree that the vast majority of students on any college campus just want to get a good education.

Speaker 2:          18:38          And, um, and many of them have other political concerns other than some of the ones that are getting a lot of attention. So, um, you know, even for example, even with the, you know, so you know, people are concerned about the opiod crisis. They're concerned about gun violence, are concerned about police brutality. They're concerned about the climate change, are concerned about all of these issues, which I think warrant concerned. We can perfect our society, we can be better than we are. And I generally, we can perfect it. I, I do better than we are. We think we can perfect it. No, I don't think we can have a perfect society, but I think we can make it better than it is. So by perfect, I mean improve. Okay. Um, so I think we can make our society better and better. I don't think we're done yet.

Speaker 2:          19:17          I think there's still deficits in our, for example, our spending is crazy. I'm going to think we do better fiscal fiscally. Um, you know, I think we have, we have a carceral state. We have, I think, I think this number's right, that upper on a per capita basis. We have as many people in prisons as Stalinist Russia. I mean it's insane. You know, we have millions of Americans are in prison and it's way out of proportion to other countries. Um, you know, there are lots of things about our society. We have very high, we have century long heights of income inequality in our society. There's a big debate about whether that is an unavoidable side effect of growth. You know, everyone is better off. So what do we care if the income is unequally distributed? But I think I tend to be agree with the critics that are concerned that this level of inequalities not sustainable to have a common wheel to like have a sense that everyone is a part of the society.

Speaker 2:          20:04          We've had no income growth in the middle. Uh, like the meeting American has seen in a generation and see no growth in wages. Right? So the bottom actually has raised and we've watched the top go bananas, but the middle of it, no, the bottom hasn't even gone up that much either. Well, let me, let me put it this way, they have absolutely not been living standards, right? So like a poor American today is vastly better off than a poor American a generation ago. But in terms of wage growth, there's been very little growth. My understanding of statistics and most of the accumulation of wealth in the last generation has gone to the top, top 1% top 0.1% anyway, there's a debate about why that happened. The technological advance. Do we have the same thing during the industrial revolution? These are important deep ideas, which as a society, we should be debating and discussing what's the best for our society anyway. Third, these are all bunch more important topics in my view, and have much more bearing on the wellbeing of our society than a lot of the other crap that gets so much attention.

Speaker 2:          20:58          So what's the evolutionary reason for that? I mean, your previous book was about social media, right? And so there's gotta be some link there. I mean, and that's where he gets back to what I was saying about depressing local news. I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to talk about things that I think are important. Um, you know, I, I, um, I'm doing my part as best I can, who's done a society in a more quote unquote good way than we have right now. So, uh, so the book, so I don't, I don't, I'm not, it's not a work of history, so I'm not, I'm not, I don't primarily talk about, um, like the last 200 or even 2000 years of human evolution or experience. I'm much more interested in the long arc of our history. And if you look at, um, forge your societies around the world as I do, and you, and you look at their qualities, you will see that again and again.

Speaker 2:          21:50          These societies have these desirable properties. They, there's variation of course, and how cooperative they are. And there's variation in marital systems and there's variation in sustenance systems. There's a lot of variation. But also there's a lot of commonality. And those common features I argue are universal. See, here's the other argument. So the argument is that there are these universal qualities that are shared across all societies. They are shaped by our evolution. They're not just a product of historical forces. Can you just list out a couple of them again just so, so love. So love a friendship. Uh, cooperation. We're cooperative species. You will be kind to a stranger on the first, you know, uh, teaching the fact that we teach each other stuff, which actually is the ultimate source of all our wealth and wellbeing. The fact that we can accumulate knowledge and distributed across time and place.

Speaker 2:          22:39          So I can tell people far away something and when I'm born I benefit from all the other knowledge that has been produced for the men. Did hundreds of thousands of years before me. Is this punishing and I would again argue this is why, what's happening on college. Yes. I would argue, I would agree with that. There's a connection there. Like our capacity to teach and to create environments in which we foster teaching and learning are crucial anyway. Also mild hierarchy. We are a species that we cannot survive with no hierarchy. We need some leaders and I discussed that but we also don't like too much hierarchy. So when you get too autocratic of power, the little guys down below band together and basically kill. So Richard Wrangham has been making this argument that we self domesticated as a species that over millennia bands of weaker members would say, you know, that guy's too powerful and he's getting all the dates and this we're going to kill him.

Speaker 2:          23:28          And basically they did. So we got more peaceful as time went by. Is One of the ideas mild hierarchy in group bias. So some tribalism is unavoidable in human beings. Um, this capacity for identity that we discussed at the beginning. These are all qualities. So identity, love, friendship, social networks, mild hierarchy, Ingroup bias, teaching and social learning. These are seen everywhere and they lie. And I believe that the core of a good society and, and institutions, uh, uh, try to suppress those at their own peril. Yeah. How can you be sort of, have a healthy dose of in group preference without starting to fall into the trap of identity politics. So for example, you're a Greek guys who grew up in a, in a Greek family. Did I love Greek? My best child friends growing up is great. We're still great friends. Um, I love Greek culture and the way it opened the Greek and the interest in intellectual wisdom and I love fed cheese and all of those things.

Speaker 2:          24:25          SPANAKOPITA dialogue. Yes. Great. So, and you can open a Greek restaurant as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't object to that. That'd be [inaudible] that port, that poor girl. It's insane. Yeah. It's total Chinese restaurants without being Chinese. And then they're coming in, not just that there was the, there's the person in, in, in Oregon that had a Mexican restaurant. Yes. There's so many examples of this is unbelievable. So how can you say love uncle? I just told you all the reasons. I love your history, but let's pretend, let's say it's roughly the same feelings about your own culture. How can you embrace all of those things without falling into the trap of identity politics? Because I think that's where a lot of people are at these days. Okay. So I have a couple of ideas and responses that the first thing I would say is, is that that this is one of the both the most, it's still not totally clear how we evolve to have this capacity.

Speaker 2:          25:13          It's felt that this ingroup bias, this I, this tribalism that we have was crucial to our ability to cooperate. That the ability to draw a distinction between us and them, the challenge, the problem that, that this ability that we evolved. So, so there's, whether we cooperate with each other and whether we are xenophobic or tribalistic or draw distinctions between us and them. And this property, this tribalism property is a property that reduces the scale of interaction. So instead of you having to cooperate with everybody, you only cooperate with your guys. And this is innate in human beings. And it is felt that this ability to draw distinction between us and then was crucial in the emergence of the variability to cooperate with other people. Okay. So they're tied, they're connected to each other. What's depressing is, is it necessary to hate the other group? Why can't you just love your own group?

Speaker 2:          26:05          Right? So why could you be indifferent to the other group or even admire it and they've got to them, they're not us. We like them or we are in different to them, right? Why do we have to kill them, right? Like why, you know, where does the killing part come from? Right? And this is complicated. We don't exactly know like where the hostility comes in weather, but we tend to see this hostility. So for example, there are famous experiments that have been done with little toddlers. You can randomly assign toddlers to different tee shirts. You can test at the toddlers understand that this was random, that there was no merit to whether they got the yellow t shirt or the green t shirt. And yet as soon as you give them the t shirts, the yellow t shirt, kids say those green t shirt children, they shouldn't have toys.

Speaker 2:          26:45          They're bad children. They don't deserve anything. It's insane. Like you can see this is called the minimal group experiments. So the most trivial of interventions you can elicit in us this, this, this, dislike of the other. However, this is not the only tool that evolution has given us to live together, this disability to draw the boundary between us and them. Uh, there are a couple of other tools, and before I tell you what those two other tools are, let me just say one other thing. So if you think of our society is, here's our whole society and here's our groups in the middle, and here are individuals at the bottom. If you're struggling with the problem of tribalism, there are basically two ways you can go. You can go up a level and broaden the boundary. And you can say, for example, we are all Americans, right?

Speaker 2:          27:33          You can say, because we all have the capacity to draw the boundary, we are evolved to have that capacity. Now you're just say, actually these little group boundaries that we were paying attention to, they're not, they're not relevant and basically take all the ethnic divisions or other than the religious or immigrant or whatever it is, and we're all American. We're all Americans. Other group at yes. At a higher level. Exactly. So you move up a level and [inaudible] face tribalism by appeal to larger groups. This has been part of our history since the beginning to talk. They'll talks about this where nature of joiners, you know, anyone can be an American, that that itself is part of the American project. It's astonishing. The belief which I share that anyone can be an American is a statement that the groups don't matter. Anyone can be an American and you just have to buy our liberal principles and then you could be an American.

Speaker 2:          28:17          Okay. Even though there's a debate about that. Yes, yes. But there's also an interesting parable to Trump here because at some level it's like he's talking about a miracle all the time. So that is the higher group for all of this. And yet I suspect your feelings on what he's doing. Some other things, probably not. No, but I would be like, anyone can be an American. If you come to our country and you work and are productive and and obey our laws and our constitution, you're an American as far as I'm concerned. It didn't matter whether you came from Mexico or you know, one of the four Mexican countries as he's, you know, anyway, okay, so a whole other video, whole other show. Okay. So, so, okay, so, so, but another solution, okay to the group is of the tribalism is trickle down a level.

Speaker 2:          29:00          Remember we talked earlier about individuals. So now you can say instead of looking at people as which groups are they a member of, you look at them as individual people. And this too has been a part of our history. So Martin Luther King's famous sentiment, I, you know, I look forward to a society in which people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin isn't appeal to our individuality. Seeing groups don't matter. Individuals matter. So, so if we're struggling with tribalism and go up or we can go down both help, however lateral to that point, there's another set of ideas, which is tribalism is not even the only tool we have in order to reduce the sense of scale and to cooperate. So natural selection is also equipped us with friendship. Friendship. The real, one of the reasons it is felt we evolved the capacity for friendship is again, to reduce the sense of scale. So instead of now being in a big group, everyone has to cooperate with everyone. Each of us has a subset of people who are our friends that we cooperate with. So it's similar to tribalism but different because now instead of defining it by group, membership is defined by each person has their particular friends. So this is another tool that we innately have that we can use to sustain our cooperative instincts and push aside the tribalism.

Speaker 3:          30:15          So how much do you think on a day, day, day, and a day to day basis? Are We, uh, normally I get the water for people. You have to be so wrapped up there that I forgot, uh, on a day to day basis, how much movement do we as individuals have to sort of either go around, let's say go around are a evolutionary

Speaker 2:          30:36          behavior? Well, I don't think, okay. So I think I do believe in free will. I mean, I think you have, um, some capacity to self mastery and make your own decisions in life and your own, you know, um, but you're also born with certain innate qualities and you're also born a human being, which is you're part of a particular species that has a particular set of characteristics. Um, so I, I think that as individuals, you know, we, we have some control over how we act. I don't think our individual actions will individually change the whole society. But I think if each of us is attempting to do the right thing, I think ultimately that makes things better. Look, there's a lot of famous ideas. Uh, so a Viktor Frankl who was in the concentration camps, his, his wife was killed. He survives the Nazi concentration camps and he goes, and he writes a famous book called Man's search for meaning after he's liberated it right to 10 days after his liberation.

Speaker 2:          31:38          And he talks about how he came to the recognition that even in this camp, in the most vile possible circumstance where his life was threatened every day, where people were dying all the time, he was starving to death. He had no shoes. It was in the winter. I mean, it was a slave. Even there, he recognized that he was the master of his own internal state. You know, that how he saw the world was something that was in his own control. So he was able to find a sense of self discipline and mastery even in an environment in which the structures around him were engineered to crush him, um, to kill him. So, so I think that there are, and there are many examples of this, I mean, another one of my favorite examples is Buddhist monks that were studied at MIT years ago. I think I'm going to get the facts of this work correct.

Speaker 2:          32:23          So, so, so they were very interested in how meditation changes the structure of your brain and how are these monks so able to be so peaceful in these very stressful circumstances. And they scan them, they put them in the MRI scanner and they looked at different parts of their brain in which parts were enhanced or diminished compared to other more ordinary mortals. And uh, and then, and they saw the different parts of the brain and Buddhist monks were different than the rest of us. But what interested me was not even the neuroanatomical discoveries that were in that paper, but it was the interviews with the monks. And so at the monks would say was that for example, let's say you and I are in traffic and someone cuts us off a normal response. And certainly one that I often have is who is that Jerky?

Speaker 2:          33:05          You know, you'd be really pissed off and your blood pressure would rise and maybe you would race that guy and uh, you know, you would, you would think ill of them. That would be our natural goto thing. That's a thoughtless, maybe they're idiotic or they're inattentive or you would have all these bad thoughts about this person who you know in a road rage kind of way amongst don't do that with amongst do is is they train themselves to re narrate. So when that happens to them, they say, maybe that's a man who's taking his wife to the hospital because she's delivering the baby. The baby's being born in the car in front of me. Isn't that amazing? There's a new life. I should help that man to get to the Ha. I mean, and they're doing it not for the sake of that person, but for their own wellbeing.

Speaker 2:          33:46          You see, so, so I think it's possible to, to, to, to read, even though it's difficult, is very difficult to exercise some internal self control. I think you're mostly saying that there are no monks on Twitter. Yes, very few. The Dalai Lama, my things on Twitter, I think I follow on. I think I have to check. Yeah, he's on Facebook, I'm pretty sure. What else do you think sort of the average person that's watching this can do to help order a good society? Because I think people, you know, everything's become so political. Yes. I think people think that's the only solution to sort of help make a better, I think granting charity to your enemies I think is important. I think listening to them, cultivating, listening, you know, um, that's pretty big of you to say after everything. Well, I was listening in the clip you showed I was listening.

Speaker 2:          34:34          I thought that was so ridiculous. Like the young woman who said, I'm not listening to her. I was really listening. I mean, I was listening then and before and after. Um, I don't agree with what she was saying, but I heard what she was saying. I could summarize what she was saying. Anybody, but, but what do you do in that case then? It just sort of, yeah, we don't have to bring it back to that specific instance, but in general, because I think a lot of people are going through this. You're being berated by somebody. They're saying all the worst things about you and your motives. They're attacking you as a person. All of those things now you can listen, you can absorb, you can ignore, you can ignore, which is also good. Ruth Bader Ginsburg says survival in life is ignoring a lot of the stupidities, which I also think is good.

Speaker 2:          35:12          I think that's the answer. And what was it we ignore? And also who was that famous actress that found this guy in Texas that had said horrible things to her. And then, or him I can't remember, was an actor or an actress and it was an actress and made it her business to find out about this guy's life. And he had lost his health insurance and he, and then she intervened and raised money for his healthcare and, and, and he felt seen and heard and don't know which one. It's an incredible story. And um, and I think that a lot of times people, and I think anonymity is a real, it can contributes to bad behavior online. So I think sort of as Jordan Peterson says, you know, man up as it were a woman up and have the strength of your convictions. This is what I think, this is what I'm going to say.

Speaker 2:          35:55          But is there a problem there? I mean Jordan, I've done this many times where then depending on how that hierarchal structure is operated, you are saying something that's an politically correct. Well, I mean you have to have the strength or revise your opinions or stick to them or make good arguments. But listen, let's don't engage. Let's say you were a Trump supporter. You just don't want to lose your job because you think if you say that [inaudible] simple as that I'm against people losing their jobs for their opinions. Yeah. So, uh, so you know, so I think that, I think there is a thing where I think a little bit of bravery, a little bit of civil discourse, a little bit of commitment to granting charity to our opponents. Um, a little bit of like for example, when I would have an argument with people who are opposed to vaccination, I think there is no merit to their ideas.

Speaker 2:          36:40          I understand their fears. I understand that there have been either some actual cases of vaccine induced neurological conditions, one in a hundred thousand one and 500,000 cases, which is awful. And I understand that there are a lot of coincidences where people think that there's a relationship, but no, it's just that you have, you know, you have lot of vaccines are being administered, there are a lot of illnesses occurring. There's going to be an overlap in those two sets. But, and I also know the data on how that's very been a, how vaccination is like a 20 20th in 2020. It's actually more than like even a 19th century triumph. I mean, you know, we've, we've mastered these diseases. We humans, it's astonishing what we've done through our capacity to teach and learn and engage in science and so forth. But I would engage that person.

Speaker 2:          37:20          I would try, I would talk to them. I would say, you know, let me talk to you about your beliefs and because I think that that's the only way to get them to revise their beliefs. I think telling them they're fools doesn't, doesn't help. Um, a true liberal. I am a liberal. Yes I am. I am. I am a liberal. Yeah. But do you think one side is a little, it's a little bit easier to do that right now. And does that flip over time? So for example, right now I find it much easier to go to consider. I get invited by conservative glyphs. Libertarians is no problem, but let's say conservatives that I disagreements on abortion and gay marriage and legalizing marijuana and the death penalty. And so wait, hold on. So I'm for legalization of marijuana. Yes. What is your position on death penalty?

Speaker 2:          37:59          I'm against the death. Me Too. What were the other that gay marriage? Yes. Yeah. Uh, legalizing weed. Yes. Um, so I, but yes. So I hate to tell you, I'm guessing that you only would get invited by conservative groups to basically to college as well. I don't know. Um, I don't know. I don't get that many. I mean usually my invitations are scientific. Like I am a scientist. Like I give talks about my science. So I have not historically been very politically right. So, but what I'm getting, I really is that at the moment it seems very obvious to me. Like I don't know that I could be clear or anything that's on the center right there. There is a, an ability and a d actually a desire to discuss ideas would agree to disagree and that just isn't happening right now. And I would suspect or argue and I'm sure he can give me examples where that during McCarthyism for example, I think, you know, it was very difficult to be a communist for sure.

Speaker 2:          38:50          And even, you know, left where they were so they weren't inviting Communist. That's right. Talk to them. And, uh, so I think, um, I honestly don't know the answer to that question. I think there are subgroups on campus which are still committed to debate the get the political unions. These guys love to argue these young people. Um, I think there are other vocal minorities on campus that don't want to hear opinions that they don't agree with and they think that even the hearing of it, there's this, there's this very sloppy conflation of speech with violence, which I think is ridiculous, um, which seems to really be ramping up. Yes, I would agree with that. And you also see it, for instance, in Pakistan, they will, they will kill apostates that's answering speech with violence. If you actually think that someone believing in a different God and expressing that belief is violence, then then the country justifies killing that person.

Speaker 2:          39:38          Or in Brunei. Recently they had the same kind of situation. I think this, this is, I, I strongly reject that belief. There's, there's, uh, we have different words and there's a totally different meeting between speech and violence. So, uh, so I don't know how we got onto that topic, but, oh, so, so I think that, I think there are groups of people on campus who do conflate speech and violence. I think that's a problem. Um, but there are also many groups that are very, very vigorous political debates. I think one thing that is different, so I'm in my fifties when I was in college in my, in the eighties, we would stay up late and argue about politics with our friends, with our friend's notice. I said, yeah, my friends and I would argue with my friends about politics and uh, and they were my friends.

Speaker 2:          40:23          I don't think that happens very much anymore. It does in the political unions and the debates societies. But in the broader college, I think if you have a different opinion about abortion, for example, um, you really can't express that. But the weird thing is that it is happening with conservatives. Well pleased because they do believe, I mean I go to these things and I have these debates with, he has kids overall and they're better debaters cause they have more experience. Yes. Arguing with people they disagree with. Yes. They get a better education in some ways because they have to constantly defend their opinions. It's a weird thing like this will happen to say that. Yes, yes, yes. I think, well, it'd be if you, this is the thing why in the martial arts, for example, why do we bow to our opponent? You'll learn more from the people you disagree with and from the people you agree with.

Speaker 2:          41:07          Right. And Jay is mill's famous saying, you know, he who knows only his side of the case knows little of it. Um, so, you know, I think, I think that's where your ideas get better when they are tested. Um, when you argue with someone you disagree with, um, and, and, and I think, and I think cultivating those kinds of conversations, disciplining yourself to be able to have arguments with people you disagree with, uh, improves your ideas and actually you should be grateful to that person. There's more interesting person in some ways. Um, now you don't have to be best friends with that person necessarily, although you can be. Um, but I think it makes you smarter that my friend is a nice closing statement and you've lived through it. I mean, that's the way you lived through the forces that so many of us see now as, as such dangerous forces in designing. And now that you live through it, you flourish and you've got another book out and all of those things. Well, I would say, I mean, yeah, well, I would close with saying, you know, I really believe that, um, that the arc of our evolution as long, but it bends towards goodness. Sounds good to me. You guys can follow nick on Twitter at Naa Christakis and we'll have a link to his book. Write down below.
