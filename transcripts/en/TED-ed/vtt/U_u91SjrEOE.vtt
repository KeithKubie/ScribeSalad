00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:08.745
Before the creation of humanity,

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:13.827
the Greek gods won a great battle against 
a race of giants called the Titans.

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:18.606
Most Titans were destroyed or
driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus.

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:21.646
But the Titan Prometheus,
whose name means foresight,

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:27.836
persuaded his brother Epimetheus
to fight with him on the side of the gods.

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:30.408
As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers

00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:34.437
with the task of creating 
all living things.

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:38.737
Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts
of the gods among the creatures.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.168
To some, he gave flight;

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:42.776
to others, the ability 
to move through water

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.088
or race through grass.

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.209
He gave the beasts glittering scales,

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:48.219
soft fur,

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.768
and sharp claws.

00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:55.388
Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped
the first humans out of mud.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.831
He formed them in the image of the gods,

00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.368
but Zeus decreed 
they were too remain mortal

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:05.382
and worship the inhabitants 
of Mount Olympus from below.

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:09.822
Zeus deemed humans subservient
creatures vulnerable to the elements

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:12.920
and dependent on the gods for protection.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.610
However, Prometheus envisioned his crude
creations with a greater purpose.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.453
So when Zeus asked him to decide
how sacrifices would be made,

00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:28.764
the wily Prometheus planned a trick
that would give humans some advantage.

00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:33.924
He killed a bull and divided it
into two parts to present to Zeus.

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.240
On one side, he concealed 
the succulent flesh and skin

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.825
under the unappealing belly of the animal.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:44.580
On the other, he hid the bones
under a thick layer of fat.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.255
When Zeus chose the seemingly
best portion for himself,

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:52.146
he was outraged 
at Prometheus's deception.

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:55.605
Fuming, Zeus forbade the use
of fire on Earth,

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:59.736
whether to cook meat 
or for any other purpose.

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:04.487
But Prometheus refused to see
his creations denied this resource.

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:07.565
And so, he scaled Mount Olympus
to steal fire

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:11.474
from the workshop 
of Hephaestus and Athena.

00:02:11.474 --> 00:02:16.985
He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk
and brought it safely down to the people.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:20.476
This gave them the power to harness
nature for their own benefit

00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:24.558
and ultimately dominate the natural order.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:29.056
With fire, humans could care 
for themselves with food and warmth.

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:32.978
But they could also forge weapons
and wage war.

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:39.316
Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst
for the rapid progression of civilization.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:43.617
When Zeus looked down at this scene,
he realized what had happened.

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:46.467
Prometheus had once again
wounded his pride

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.867
and subverted his authority.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.048
Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment.

00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:56.209
Prometheus was to be chained
to a cliff for eternity.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.387
Each day, he would be visited by a vulture
who would tear out his liver

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:06.639
and each night his liver would grow back
to be attacked again in the morning.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.669
Although Prometheus remained 
in perpetual agony,

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.529
he never expressed regret 
at his act of rebellion.

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:18.719
His resilience in the face of oppression
made him a beloved figure in mythology.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.499
He was also celebrated for his mischievous
and inquisitive spirit,

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:28.100
and for the knowledge, progress,
and power he brought to human hands.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.960
He's also a recurring figure
in art and literature.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.381
In Percy Bysshe Shelley's
lyrical drama "Prometheus Unbound,"

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.721
the author imagines Prometheus
as a romantic hero

00:03:38.721 --> 00:03:43.455
who escapes and continues to spread
empathy and knowledge.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:45.233
Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote,

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:47.944
"Prometheus is the type 
of the highest perfection

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:50.517
of moral and intellectual nature,

00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:53.145
impelled by the purest 
and the truest motives

00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:56.533
to the best and noblest ends."

00:03:56.533 --> 00:04:00.866
His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus
as a more cautionary figure

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:06.067
and subtitled her novel
"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus."

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:09.446
This suggests the damage of corrupting
the natural order

00:04:09.446 --> 00:04:11.695
and remains relevant 
to the ethical questions

00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:15.936
surrounding science and technology today.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.086
As hero, rebel, or trickster,

00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:22.767
Prometheus remains a symbol of our
capacity to capture the powers of nature,

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:24.317
and ultimately,

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:29.078
he reminds us of the potential 
of individual acts to ignite the world.
