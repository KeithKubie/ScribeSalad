- Alright so we pan across a
park, beautiful park, peaceful.

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.872 line:0%
We see a old man sitting
at a bench feeding ducks.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.573
He look like Grady
from Sanford and Son.

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.175
Is he still alive?

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.611
Nevermind, we'll let casting
worry about that, anyway

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.246
he's feeding the
ducks, all of a sudden,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.881
the ducks start exploding.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.217
(duck noise) Pop! (duck noise)
Pop, pop! (duck noise) Pop!

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.819
The old man look at the camera,

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.121
he's been feeding them seltzer
tablets the whole time.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.991
He said, "I told these
goddamn ducks a million times

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.559
"to stop shittin' on my car.

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.628
"I set a trap in my house,
they come to my job.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.630
"I call the police,
they say I'm crazy.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.966
"It's called animal control,
they don't control shit.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.669
"I got they ass
now doh, ha ha ha."

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:38.271
Let out a evil ass laugh, right,

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.606
then the old man die of
natural causes right there,

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:44.143
bam, on the ground, a bunch of
blew up ducks and a old man.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:46.479
Kai-rom, turtle wash car wax.

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:47.881
'Cause you ain't got
time that for that shit.
