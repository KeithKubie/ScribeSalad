00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.310
Vsauce!

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.310
Kevin here.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.069
Go to a restaurant - look at the menu - and
then eat it.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.360
Molecular Gastronomy is an innovative way
of cooking that combines culinary arts with

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.670
science.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.190
As food is prepared and combined -- in what's
called a "colloidal system" -- ingredients

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.140
go through physical and chemical changes.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
Chefs utilizing Molecular Gastronomy use their
artistic and technical abilities to influence

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.550
the food's transformations.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.989
These techniques turn boring, traditional
cuisine into a modern sensory experience.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.310
By looking at food simply as states of matter
- in different types of colloidal systems

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.390
- foam, solid foam, gel, emulsion and solid
emulsion - molecular gastronomists prepare

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.370
unique dishes like this deconstructed baby
corn or this creative take on lemon chicken.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.620
And they bring unique tools into the kitchen
such as hypodermic syringes for spherification

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.980
- which involves liquid-filled beads that
create gel equivalents of foods ranging from

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.670
caviar to ravioli, the vacuum machine is used
to suck out air from a bag in order to use

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.789
a technique called sous vide - which slowly
cooks the food in heated water to retain moisture

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.850
or another important tool that they use liquid
nitrogen.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.749
Robyn Sue Fisher, founder of Smitten Ice Cream
in San Francisco wanted to make ice cream

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.509
as fresh as possible that didn't require a
bunch of chemicals to preserve -- and her

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.810
solution was liquid nitrogen.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.369
It's Nitrogen at an extremely low temperature
in a liquid state, first liquefied at the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.270
Jagiellonian University in 1883 by Polish
Physicists Zygmunt Wroblewski (ro-bleh-ski)

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.030
and Karol Olszewski.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.479
By using Liquid Nitrogen, Fisher found that
she could rapidly freeze ice cream, allowing

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.689
her to make each serving fresh right when
a customer orders.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.999
Chef Homaro Cantu at Moto Restaurant in Chicago
makes edible menus.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.560
This "bread and butter" menu was one of their
first.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.619
Cantu's masticable menus include one printed
on a salad roll - which after reading the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.649
menu, the customer just rolls it up and eats
it.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.310
For the printing they use a modified inkjet
printer with cartridges filled with food-based

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.970
ink like juiced carrots, tomatoes and purple
potatoes.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.390
One of Moto's most innovative courses is a
play on fried chicken in which noodles and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.370
biscuits are made with dehydrated freeze--dried
chicken ground into a powder.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.049
If you want to experiment with Molecular Gastronomy
yourself - the youtube channel Molecule-r

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.260
Flavors has tutorials anyone can follow with
the right ingredients -- like this frozen

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.750
chocolate wind that uses soy lecithin, which
is a natural emulsifier that changes watery

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.450
solutions into an air-like substance.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.129
Or these surprise bubbles that uses calcium
lactate and sodium alginate, derived from

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.850
brown algae, to create spheres.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.349
You can also check out their website that
offers kits with everything you need to try

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.209
Molecular Gastronomy techniques at home.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.610
Enthusio chefs is another great channel featuring
videos like this reverse spherified poached

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.330
egg that uses xantham gum, a mixture of two
calcium salts called gluco, and egg white

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.830
powder to recreate just the whites of a poached
egg.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.860
They also make powdered ice cream inside candy
strawberries and Milk Milk Milk, where they

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.939
use milk to make cheese and foam and create
this...

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:27.440
While to some Molecular Gastronomy could be
considered a novelty it does combine science,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.680
technology, creativity and sustenance in exciting
ways.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.709
And really I just kinda want to try strawberry
spaghetti - what about cheeseburger spaghetti...?

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.450
Pizza spaghetti?!

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.879
And as always thanks for watching.
