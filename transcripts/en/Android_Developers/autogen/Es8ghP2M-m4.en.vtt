lastly john and stanley are going to get
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399
lastly john and stanley are going to get
up and talk about hearing aid support

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
up and talk about hearing aid support
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170
up and talk about hearing aid support
and how to create the best experience

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
and how to create the best experience
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749
and how to create the best experience
possible whether you're a device maker

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
possible whether you're a device maker
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.810
possible whether you're a device maker
or an OEM now let's get started

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
or an OEM now let's get started
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.870
or an OEM now let's get started
so first let's walk through and talk

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
so first let's walk through and talk
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.139
so first let's walk through and talk
about what hearing loss is how it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
about what hearing loss is how it
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.920
about what hearing loss is how it
affects people and what we can do about

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
affects people and what we can do about
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.510
affects people and what we can do about
it so the scope of the problem is

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520
it so the scope of the problem is
 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.089
it so the scope of the problem is
massive 466

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099
massive 466
 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.209
massive 466
million people worldwide have hearing

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219
million people worldwide have hearing
 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.959
million people worldwide have hearing
loss if that were a country that would

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969
loss if that were a country that would
 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.390
loss if that were a country that would
be a bigger country than every country

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
be a bigger country than every country
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800
be a bigger country than every country
except for India and China

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
except for India and China
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.959
except for India and China
so that's bigger than the u.s. so this

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969
so that's bigger than the u.s. so this
 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.209
so that's bigger than the u.s. so this
is a massive problem and again according

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219
is a massive problem and again according
 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.940
is a massive problem and again according
to the World Health Organization this is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950
to the World Health Organization this is
 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.089
to the World Health Organization this is
actually supposed to grow to nearly a

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
actually supposed to grow to nearly a
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.000
actually supposed to grow to nearly a
billion people in the year 2050 five so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
billion people in the year 2050 five so
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.979
billion people in the year 2050 five so
can have a dramatic effect not only in

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
can have a dramatic effect not only in
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.440
can have a dramatic effect not only in
the people who have it but also their

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
the people who have it but also their
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.809
the people who have it but also their
friends families colleagues and loved

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
friends families colleagues and loved
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.920
friends families colleagues and loved
ones these effects can include fatigue

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930
ones these effects can include fatigue
 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.899
ones these effects can include fatigue
social isolation or reduced job or

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909
social isolation or reduced job or
 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.979
social isolation or reduced job or
academic performance now in my own life

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
academic performance now in my own life
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.429

friend from university had hearing loss

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810
friend from university had hearing loss
 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.379
friend from university had hearing loss
and its really made communicating with

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389
and its really made communicating with
 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.110
and its really made communicating with
them on difficult and challenging and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
them on difficult and challenging and
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.089
them on difficult and challenging and
not only for them but also and also for

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099
not only for them but also and also for
 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.270
not only for them but also and also for
me so what is hearing loss how do we

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
me so what is hearing loss how do we
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.360
me so what is hearing loss how do we
quantify or measure it so this is an

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
quantify or measure it so this is an
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.240
quantify or measure it so this is an
empty audiogram and we're gonna walk you

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
empty audiogram and we're gonna walk you
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.670
empty audiogram and we're gonna walk you
through this on the top we have the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
through this on the top we have the
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.890
through this on the top we have the
normal range of hearing at the very

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900
normal range of hearing at the very
 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.679
normal range of hearing at the very
bottom we have profound loss and then we

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689
bottom we have profound loss and then we
 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.809
bottom we have profound loss and then we
have different gradations in between on

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819
have different gradations in between on
 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.349
have different gradations in between on
the Left we have loud sounds at the

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359
the Left we have loud sounds at the
 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.339
the Left we have loud sounds at the
bottom and at the bottom we have

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349
bottom and at the bottom we have
 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.469
bottom and at the bottom we have

to right this line is called the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989
to right this line is called the
 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.890
to right this line is called the
threshold of hearing anything above it

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900
threshold of hearing anything above it
 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.490
threshold of hearing anything above it
you cannot hear unless you're a dog or a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
you cannot hear unless you're a dog or a
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.309
you cannot hear unless you're a dog or a
dolphin in which case dogs actually hear

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319
dolphin in which case dogs actually hear
 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.899
dolphin in which case dogs actually hear
three times better than humans and

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909
three times better than humans and
 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.780
three times better than humans and
dolphins hear way better something like

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790
dolphins hear way better something like
 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.030
dolphins hear way better something like
seven times better than humans which is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
seven times better than humans which is
 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.939
seven times better than humans which is
absolutely amazing

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949
absolutely amazing
 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:09.219
absolutely amazing
now I'm overlaying the regions in which

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229
now I'm overlaying the regions in which
 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.009
now I'm overlaying the regions in which
music and speech occur so we have a

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
music and speech occur so we have a
 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.899
music and speech occur so we have a
music region a speech region and

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909
music region a speech region and
 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.089
music region a speech region and
anything outside of these two regions is

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099
anything outside of these two regions is
 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.099
anything outside of these two regions is
in that is in that threshold what we

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109
in that is in that threshold what we
 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.830
in that is in that threshold what we
can't what we can't hear people with

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840
can't what we can't hear people with
 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.719
can't what we can't hear people with
loss in the speech region may have

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
loss in the speech region may have
 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.540
loss in the speech region may have
difficulty interpreting speech and

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550
difficulty interpreting speech and
 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.560
difficulty interpreting speech and
similarly if you have law

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570
similarly if you have law
 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.060
similarly if you have law
in the music region you'll have

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070
in the music region you'll have
 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.150
in the music region you'll have
difficulty interpreting music so now

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160
difficulty interpreting music so now
 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.220
difficulty interpreting music so now
let's focus a little bit on speech on

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230
let's focus a little bit on speech on
 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.760
let's focus a little bit on speech on
the left hand side we have low frequency

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770
the left hand side we have low frequency
 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.820
the left hand side we have low frequency
sounds so these would typically be women

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830
sounds so these would typically be women
 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.420
sounds so these would typically be women
or I'm sorry men's voices so think think

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430
or I'm sorry men's voices so think think
 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.460
or I'm sorry men's voices so think think
baritones on the right hand side we have

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470
baritones on the right hand side we have
 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.980
baritones on the right hand side we have
high frequency loss so this would

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
high frequency loss so this would
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.440
high frequency loss so this would
typically be women's voices children's

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450
typically be women's voices children's
 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.380

voices think Sopranos this is called the

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390
voices think Sopranos this is called the
 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.120
voices think Sopranos this is called the
speech banana and I didn't make this up

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130
speech banana and I didn't make this up
 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.370
speech banana and I didn't make this up
this is like actually a thing so this is

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380
this is like actually a thing so this is
 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.140
this is like actually a thing so this is
where we hear consonants and vowels and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150
where we hear consonants and vowels and
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.450
where we hear consonants and vowels and
so you can see this little overlay where

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460
so you can see this little overlay where
 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.520

8 what does that mean nothing so that's
 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.870
8 what does that mean nothing so that's
how you can experience hearing loss and

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.460
 
let's shift from speech over to sound so

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470
let's shift from speech over to sound so

in this overlay I'm overlaying typical
sounds and where they where they take

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840
sounds and where they where they take
 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.320

place so you can see we have very loud

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
place so you can see we have very loud
 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.990

sounds like the lawnmower the phone the

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000
sounds like the lawnmower the phone the
 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.330

like the wind and the seagull at the top

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860
like the wind and the seagull at the top
 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.650
like the wind and the seagull at the top
this is an all the audiogram for a

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660
this is an all the audiogram for a
 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.890
this is an all the audiogram for a
fictitious patient and so we stripped

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900
fictitious patient and so we stripped
 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.930
fictitious patient and so we stripped
away the sounds of consonants the vowels

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940
away the sounds of consonants the vowels
 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.320
away the sounds of consonants the vowels
and so forth and we can measure the

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330
and so forth and we can measure the
 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.600
and so forth and we can measure the
ability to hear for each ear left and

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610
ability to hear for each ear left and
 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.060
ability to hear for each ear left and
right and so the right ear is read and

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070
right and so the right ear is read and
 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.200
right and so the right ear is read and
the left ear is blue

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210
the left ear is blue
 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.980
the left ear is blue
loss will vary by person and indeed it's

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990
loss will vary by person and indeed it's
 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.770
loss will vary by person and indeed it's
going to vary ear to ear and over time

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780
going to vary ear to ear and over time
 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.750
going to vary ear to ear and over time
this will this will change so you can

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760
this will this will change so you can
 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.610
this will this will change so you can
see the pattern of gloss in this example

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620
see the pattern of gloss in this example
 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.070
see the pattern of gloss in this example
is high frequency loss and that is one

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080
is high frequency loss and that is one
 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.860
is high frequency loss and that is one
of the most typical forms of hearing

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870
of the most typical forms of hearing
 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.860
of the most typical forms of hearing
loss now we're laying everything on top

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870
loss now we're laying everything on top
 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.239
loss now we're laying everything on top
so we have the sounds we

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249
so we have the sounds we
 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.079
so we have the sounds we
the audiogram and basically everything

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089
the audiogram and basically everything
 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.419
the audiogram and basically everything
down into the left is going to be

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:47.429
down into the left is going to be
 

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:49.249
down into the left is going to be
audible for this person everything up

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259
audible for this person everything up
 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.109
audible for this person everything up
and to the right is going to be

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:51.119
and to the right is going to be
 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.709
and to the right is going to be
inaudible so they can hear the bus the

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:54.719
inaudible so they can hear the bus the
 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.719
inaudible so they can hear the bus the
baby on the phone but they cannot hear

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729
baby on the phone but they cannot hear
 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.089
baby on the phone but they cannot hear
the the seagull or the clock and the

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099
the the seagull or the clock and the
 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.599
the the seagull or the clock and the
wind so a hearing aid this is a very

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:02.609
wind so a hearing aid this is a very
 

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:05.269
wind so a hearing aid this is a very
simplified example but a hearing aid is

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:05.279
simplified example but a hearing aid is
 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.819
simplified example but a hearing aid is
going to work by injecting the right

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:07.829
going to work by injecting the right
 

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:10.939
going to work by injecting the right
amount of game so turning up turning up

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949
amount of game so turning up turning up
 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.469
amount of game so turning up turning up
the volume and the right amount of

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479
the volume and the right amount of
 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.209
the volume and the right amount of
signal processing at the appropriate

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219
signal processing at the appropriate
 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.649
signal processing at the appropriate
freaking at the appropriate frequency

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:15.659
freaking at the appropriate frequency
 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:18.199
freaking at the appropriate frequency
levels it also works by lowering the

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:18.209
levels it also works by lowering the
 

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.509
levels it also works by lowering the
gain so that you're not overloading the

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:20.519
gain so that you're not overloading the
 

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:24.019
gain so that you're not overloading the
ears insert in certain cases so this can

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:24.029
ears insert in certain cases so this can
 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.379
ears insert in certain cases so this can
make up for loss and this is called

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389
make up for loss and this is called
 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.219
make up for loss and this is called
compensation and the amount of

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:28.229
compensation and the amount of
 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.249
compensation and the amount of
compensation again it's going to vary

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259
compensation again it's going to vary
 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:33.589
compensation again it's going to vary
from individual to individual to

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599
from individual to individual to
 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.959
from individual to individual to
individual and I'm sort of showing this

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:35.969
individual and I'm sort of showing this
 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:38.299
individual and I'm sort of showing this
fictitiously by raising up this raising

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:38.309
fictitiously by raising up this raising
 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:40.999
fictitiously by raising up this raising
up this line so hearing these are really

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009
up this line so hearing these are really
 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.789
up this line so hearing these are really
really really effective they work they

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:43.799
really really effective they work they
 

00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:45.769
really really effective they work they
work well but they're not perfect

00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:45.779
work well but they're not perfect
 

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:48.829
work well but they're not perfect
solutions according to a recent survey

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:48.839
solutions according to a recent survey
 

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:52.039
solutions according to a recent survey
the majority of respondents said that

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:52.049
the majority of respondents said that
 

00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:54.799
the majority of respondents said that
their quality of life was improved with

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:54.809
their quality of life was improved with
 

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:56.629
their quality of life was improved with
the hearing aid compared to no

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639
the hearing aid compared to no
 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.819
the hearing aid compared to no
amplification at all so that's really

00:07:58.819 --> 00:07:58.829
amplification at all so that's really
 

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.559
amplification at all so that's really
really good but there are a lot of

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:00.569
really good but there are a lot of
 

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:03.039
really good but there are a lot of
challenges with hearing aids too so for

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:03.049
challenges with hearing aids too so for
 

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.779
challenges with hearing aids too so for
people who self-identified as having

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:05.789
people who self-identified as having
 

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:09.139
people who self-identified as having
difficulty hearing that was about 10% of

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:09.149
difficulty hearing that was about 10% of
 

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:12.799
difficulty hearing that was about 10% of
population however only a corresponding

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:12.809
population however only a corresponding
 

00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:15.850
population however only a corresponding
3% of the population

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:15.860
3% of the population
 

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.109
3% of the population
reported having one or more hearing aid

00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:18.119
reported having one or more hearing aid
 

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:21.589
reported having one or more hearing aid
devices so there are a lot of reasons

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599
devices so there are a lot of reasons
 

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:25.219
devices so there are a lot of reasons
why hearing aids are not widely adopted

00:08:25.219 --> 00:08:25.229
why hearing aids are not widely adopted
 

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:27.350
why hearing aids are not widely adopted
one is expensed typically they're not

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360
one is expensed typically they're not
 

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.639
one is expensed typically they're not
covered by insurance too sadly there

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:31.649
covered by insurance too sadly there
 

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:33.049
covered by insurance too sadly there
could be a stigma associated with

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:33.059
could be a stigma associated with
 

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.209
could be a stigma associated with
wearing a hearing aid or people just

00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219
wearing a hearing aid or people just
 

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:37.549
wearing a hearing aid or people just
don't want to admit that they have that

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:37.559
don't want to admit that they have that
 

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.379
don't want to admit that they have that
they have that have this loss so we're

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:39.389
they have that have this loss so we're
 

00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:41.569
they have that have this loss so we're
doing a bunch of things about this but

00:08:41.569 --> 00:08:41.579
doing a bunch of things about this but
 

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:44.360
doing a bunch of things about this but
what I want to do right now is a hearing

what we want the dynamics processing
 

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.330
what we want the dynamics processing
effect to do and then we actually create

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:58.340
effect to do and then we actually create
 

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.280
effect to do and then we actually create
the dynamics processing effect in this

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.290
the dynamics processing effect in this
 

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.710
the dynamics processing effect in this
case we are saying that we want to

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720
case we are saying that we want to
 

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.930
case we are saying that we want to
favour frequency resolution instead of

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:04.940
favour frequency resolution instead of
 

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.329
favour frequency resolution instead of
time domain we have different flavors of

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:07.339
time domain we have different flavors of
 

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.819
time domain we have different flavors of
processing with frequency domain you can

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:09.829
processing with frequency domain you can
 

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.500
processing with frequency domain you can
have more control of how your

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:11.510
have more control of how your
 

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.569
have more control of how your
frequencies are distributed in the

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:13.579
frequencies are distributed in the
 

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.699
frequencies are distributed in the
frequency domain with time resolution

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:15.709
frequency domain with time resolution
 

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:17.740
frequency domain with time resolution
with time favoring time resolution you

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:17.750
with time favoring time resolution you
 

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.689
with time favoring time resolution you
will have more control of how big your

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:19.699
will have more control of how big your
 

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:21.910
will have more control of how big your
blocks in time will be so if you want

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:21.920
blocks in time will be so if you want
 

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.920
blocks in time will be so if you want
fast response probably you would like to

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:23.930
fast response probably you would like to
 

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.860
fast response probably you would like to
have the time domain implementation we

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:26.870
have the time domain implementation we
 

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:28.570
have the time domain implementation we
can also say how many channels we want

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:28.580
can also say how many channels we want
 

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.460
can also say how many channels we want
and in then we

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:30.470
and in then we
 

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.680
and in then we
we can say in this stages if we want to

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:32.690
we can say in this stages if we want to
 

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.200
we can say in this stages if we want to
use pre q and how many bands in this

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.210
use pre q and how many bands in this
 

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.870
use pre q and how many bands in this
case we want to use pre q and 12 bands

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880
case we want to use pre q and 12 bands
 

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.690
case we want to use pre q and 12 bands
we want to use pausing a multiband

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:40.700
we want to use pausing a multiband
 

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.820
we want to use pausing a multiband
compressor and eight bands and we want

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:42.830
compressor and eight bands and we want
 

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.149
compressor and eight bands and we want
to use pasta q 16 bands and also the

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:46.159
to use pasta q 16 bands and also the
 

00:17:46.159 --> 00:17:47.440
to use pasta q 16 bands and also the
limiter so pretty much we are using

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.450
limiter so pretty much we are using
 

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.430
limiter so pretty much we are using
everything that we have a access to then

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440
everything that we have a access to then
 

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.860
everything that we have a access to then
we can set some a parameters that are

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:53.870
we can set some a parameters that are
 

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.110
we can set some a parameters that are
preferred we are kind of hinting the

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120
preferred we are kind of hinting the
 

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.360

it depends what your algorithm needs

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360
it depends what your algorithm needs
 

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.649
it depends what your algorithm needs
then we create the config object and we

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:14.659
then we create the config object and we
 

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:16.750
then we create the config object and we
are ready to go to the next stage in the

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760
are ready to go to the next stage in the
 

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.029
are ready to go to the next stage in the
next stage we haven't created the

00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039
next stage we haven't created the
 

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:20.890
next stage we haven't created the
dynamics processing effect yet we would

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:20.900
dynamics processing effect yet we would
 

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.830
dynamics processing effect yet we would
like to go and a get whole of the

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840
like to go and a get whole of the
 

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.990
like to go and a get whole of the
multiband compressor and change some of

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000
multiband compressor and change some of
 

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.810
multiband compressor and change some of
the default parameters so we get a hold

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:28.820
the default parameters so we get a hold
 

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.789
the default parameters so we get a hold
of that and we are going to iterate in

00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799
of that and we are going to iterate in
 

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:33.100
of that and we are going to iterate in
this moment in the 8 bands in this toy

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:33.110
this moment in the 8 bands in this toy
 

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.529
this moment in the 8 bands in this toy
example that I have here we get a hold

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:35.539
example that I have here we get a hold
 

00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:38.049
example that I have here we get a hold
of the band we get in this moment we set

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:38.059
of the band we get in this moment we set
 

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:40.000
of the band we get in this moment we set
some of the parameters like the attack

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.010
some of the parameters like the attack
 

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.820
some of the parameters like the attack
time to be 50 milliseconds we set the

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:42.830
time to be 50 milliseconds we set the
 

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.140
time to be 50 milliseconds we set the
release time to be a hundred

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.150
release time to be a hundred
 

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.240
release time to be a hundred
milliseconds we can set all the other

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.250
milliseconds we can set all the other
 

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.250
milliseconds we can set all the other
parameters whatever that we want there

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.260
parameters whatever that we want there
 

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.070
parameters whatever that we want there
and this can really mimic the algorithm

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080
and this can really mimic the algorithm
 

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.110
and this can really mimic the algorithm
is that we already have in place or they

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120
is that we already have in place or they
 

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.330
is that we already have in place or they
are the specs that your sound designers

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:55.340
are the specs that your sound designers
 

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.580
are the specs that your sound designers
or your son engineers require for your

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:57.590
or your son engineers require for your
 

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.279
or your son engineers require for your
application and finally we are going to

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:00.289
application and finally we are going to
 

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:02.200
application and finally we are going to
create the dynamics processing effect

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.210
create the dynamics processing effect
 

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.990
create the dynamics processing effect
the one that I call my DP that one is my

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000
the one that I call my DP that one is my
 

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.090
the one that I call my DP that one is my
actual a dynamics processing that is

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:07.100
actual a dynamics processing that is
 

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.039
actual a dynamics processing that is
going to do all the signal processing a

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:09.049
going to do all the signal processing a
 

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:11.740
going to do all the signal processing a
very important part is that we have the

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:11.750
very important part is that we have the
 

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.110
very important part is that we have the
session ID and this is something that as

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120
session ID and this is something that as
 

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.000
session ID and this is something that as
a developers is going to give you the

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.010
a developers is going to give you the
 

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.960
a developers is going to give you the
flexibility to create a media player or

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:19.970
flexibility to create a media player or
 

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.450
flexibility to create a media player or
to start playing a sound and then create

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:22.460
to start playing a sound and then create
 

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.700
to start playing a sound and then create
an effect and put them together because

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:24.710
an effect and put them together because
 

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.039
an effect and put them together because
you are using the same session ID and we

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:27.049
you are using the same session ID and we
 

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:28.299
you are using the same session ID and we
are going to see that in the next

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:28.309
are going to see that in the next
 

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:28.870
are going to see that in the next
example

example
 

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.409
example
so to recap we are creating the dynamic

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:32.419
so to recap we are creating the dynamic
 

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:34.840
so to recap we are creating the dynamic
processing effect and we have access to

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:34.850
processing effect and we have access to
 

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.909

a lot of parameters that we can control
 

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:39.820
a lot of parameters that we can control
either at the need time or at runtime at

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:39.830
either at the need time or at runtime at
 

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.340
either at the need time or at runtime at
runtime we can go and change what is the

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:42.350
runtime we can go and change what is the
 

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.150
runtime we can go and change what is the
frequency that we want to do

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160
frequency that we want to do
 

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.520

to play here and I'm going to start
 

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.490
to play here and I'm going to start
modifying the bands in there so

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500
modifying the bands in there so
 

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:44.690
modifying the bands in there so
[Music]

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700
 
 

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.520
 
okay that was the demo so I just wanted

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:47.530
okay that was the demo so I just wanted
 

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.990
okay that was the demo so I just wanted
to show that he's running and I'm going

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000
to show that he's running and I'm going
 

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.080
to show that he's running and I'm going
to show you how is working so back to

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.090
to show you how is working so back to
 

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.940
to show you how is working so back to
the slide please

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:55.950
 
 

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.070
 
so we start with we create a media

00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080
so we start with we create a media
 

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.830
so we start with we create a media
player we go to the code and we just use

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840
player we go to the code and we just use
 

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.660
player we go to the code and we just use
the same code that we have used for many

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:03.670
the same code that we have used for many
 

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.970
the same code that we have used for many
years to create a media object in this

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:05.980
years to create a media object in this
 

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.220
years to create a media object in this
case is the media player and I'm playing

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.230
case is the media player and I'm playing
 

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.860
case is the media player and I'm playing
a classical music it's an example in

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:10.870
a classical music it's an example in
 

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.990
a classical music it's an example in
there but the most important thing is

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000
there but the most important thing is
 

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.850
there but the most important thing is
that when I create that we have this

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:14.860
that when I create that we have this
 

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.160
that when I create that we have this
session i did as i mentioned before we

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.170
session i did as i mentioned before we
 

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.990
session i did as i mentioned before we
create a media player and we are you

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000
create a media player and we are you
 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.270
create a media player and we are you
going to use this session ID in a second

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280
going to use this session ID in a second
 

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.890
going to use this session ID in a second
when we create the dynamics processing

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:22.900
when we create the dynamics processing
 

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.230
when we create the dynamics processing
effect so I'm going to go inside my

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240
effect so I'm going to go inside my
 

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.120
effect so I'm going to go inside my
function that is there the last one

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.130
function that is there the last one
 

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.580
function that is there the last one
called create VP that is my own custom

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:29.590
called create VP that is my own custom
 

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.520

pattern that I'm going to say how many

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:34.570
pattern that I'm going to say how many
 

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.960
pattern that I'm going to say how many
channels I want how how many bands I

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:36.970
channels I want how how many bands I
 

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.030
channels I want how how many bands I
want I'm just going to use the first one

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:39.040
want I'm just going to use the first one
 

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.530

that is the EQ and a I'm going to create

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:43.540
that is the EQ and a I'm going to create
 

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.470
that is the EQ and a I'm going to create
a in the each one of the EQ bands what

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480
a in the each one of the EQ bands what
 

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.720
a in the each one of the EQ bands what
is the level the initial level so I know

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:48.730
is the level the initial level so I know
 

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.820
is the level the initial level so I know
that is a lot of code there but the most

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:50.830
that is a lot of code there but the most
 

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.910
that is a lot of code there but the most
important part is that when we have

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:53.920
important part is that when we have
 

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.669
important part is that when we have
created this and at runtime when I'm

00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679
created this and at runtime when I'm
 

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:59.310
created this and at runtime when I'm
moving the sliders what I'm doing when I

00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320
moving the sliders what I'm doing when I
 

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.169
moving the sliders what I'm doing when I
move in sliders if you're looking here

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:01.179
move in sliders if you're looking here
 

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:02.549
move in sliders if you're looking here
the section that I just highlighted

00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559
the section that I just highlighted
 

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:04.799
the section that I just highlighted
there every time that I move one of the

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:04.809
there every time that I move one of the
 

00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:07.049
there every time that I move one of the
sliders I go and find the band of

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:07.059
sliders I go and find the band of
 

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:10.320
sliders I go and find the band of
interest for that EQ and just assign a

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.330
interest for that EQ and just assign a
 

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.600
interest for that EQ and just assign a
different value there I say I want to

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:12.610
different value there I say I want to
 

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.730
different value there I say I want to
attenuate or I want to enhance that band

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:14.740
attenuate or I want to enhance that band
 

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.070
attenuate or I want to enhance that band
this is all this is all the code that

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080
this is all this is all the code that
 

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.290
this is all this is all the code that
you need to run a very powerful very

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:19.300
you need to run a very powerful very
 

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.530
you need to run a very powerful very
configurable EQ in your application and

we are going to do what Brian show us to

00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:53.769
we are going to do what Brian show us to
 

00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:55.740
we are going to do what Brian show us to
do that hearing aids do that they just

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:55.750
do that hearing aids do that they just
 

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.930
do that hearing aids do that they just
changed some of the parameters how they

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:57.940
changed some of the parameters how they
 

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.090
changed some of the parameters how they
affect the frequency response and how

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.100
affect the frequency response and how
 

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.100
affect the frequency response and how
they affect the frequency in different

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.110
they affect the frequency in different
 

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.350
they affect the frequency in different
frequencies in different ways we can go

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360
frequencies in different ways we can go
 

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.720
frequencies in different ways we can go
and in this case the top curve is

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:06.730
and in this case the top curve is
 

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.430
and in this case the top curve is
telling me to boost some of the low

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440
telling me to boost some of the low
 

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.249
telling me to boost some of the low
frequencies and they the bottom curve is

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:11.259
frequencies and they the bottom curve is
 

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:13.649
frequencies and they the bottom curve is
telling me to apply some compression

00:24:13.649 --> 00:24:13.659
telling me to apply some compression
 

00:24:13.659 --> 00:24:17.070
telling me to apply some compression
also to the low frequencies but still

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080
also to the low frequencies but still
 

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.169
also to the low frequencies but still
that's a lot of parameters for a user to

00:24:19.169 --> 00:24:19.179
that's a lot of parameters for a user to
 

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:22.740
that's a lot of parameters for a user to
control directly we could simplify these

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:22.750
control directly we could simplify these
 

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.169
control directly we could simplify these
curves by just saying well you know

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:25.179
curves by just saying well you know
 

00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:27.210
curves by just saying well you know
let's say let's take this lobe of the

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:27.220
let's say let's take this lobe of the
 

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.220
let's say let's take this lobe of the
curve I'm just to represent the whole

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.230
curve I'm just to represent the whole
 

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.720
curve I'm just to represent the whole
curve with all these parameters with a

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:30.730
curve with all these parameters with a
 

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.940
curve with all these parameters with a
single number and if I do that for both

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:32.950
single number and if I do that for both
 

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.850
single number and if I do that for both
curves I could plot that in a

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:35.860
curves I could plot that in a
 

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.889
curves I could plot that in a
two-dimensional space I could say the

00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:37.899
two-dimensional space I could say the
 

00:24:37.899 --> 00:24:40.169
two-dimensional space I could say the
first curve is one number the second

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:40.179
first curve is one number the second
 

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.539
first curve is one number the second
curve is another number I have an XY

00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:42.549
curve is another number I have an XY
 

00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:45.029
curve is another number I have an XY
coordinate and I just represent that in

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039
coordinate and I just represent that in
 

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.919
coordinate and I just represent that in
that space as the circle that you see

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:46.929
that space as the circle that you see
 

00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:48.720
that space as the circle that you see
there I could do the same for another

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:48.730
there I could do the same for another
 

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.060
there I could do the same for another
curve and it's a different point that I

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.070
curve and it's a different point that I
 

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.159
curve and it's a different point that I
get in XY coordinate the same for

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:53.169
get in XY coordinate the same for
 

00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:55.590
get in XY coordinate the same for
another curve another curve so we can

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600
another curve another curve so we can
 

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.259
another curve another curve so we can
get a lot of curves that get represented

00:24:58.259 --> 00:24:58.269
get a lot of curves that get represented
 

00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:59.399
get a lot of curves that get represented
even though that they have a lot of

00:24:59.399 --> 00:24:59.409
even though that they have a lot of
 

00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:01.470
even though that they have a lot of
parameters that get represented in the

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480
parameters that get represented in the
 

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.540
parameters that get represented in the
XY coordinate very simple

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:03.550
XY coordinate very simple
 

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.160
XY coordinate very simple
the magic at the beauty of this is that

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.170
the magic at the beauty of this is that
 

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.490
the magic at the beauty of this is that
now with an XY coordinate to a map we

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:08.500
now with an XY coordinate to a map we
 

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.230
now with an XY coordinate to a map we
can just take our boost and our

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240
can just take our boost and our
 

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.180
can just take our boost and our
fine-tuning and we could pretty much

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:12.190
fine-tuning and we could pretty much
 

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.880
fine-tuning and we could pretty much
navigate that XY coordinate space very

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:14.890
navigate that XY coordinate space very
 

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.640
navigate that XY coordinate space very
easy go and find what is the point that

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:17.650
easy go and find what is the point that
 

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.160
easy go and find what is the point that
is closest to what the user wants and

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.170
is closest to what the user wants and
 

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.590
is closest to what the user wants and
that gets translated to a lot of

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600
that gets translated to a lot of
 

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.240
that gets translated to a lot of
parameters that gets sent to the

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.250
parameters that gets sent to the
 

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.310
parameters that gets sent to the
dynamics processing effect so we're

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320
dynamics processing effect so we're
 

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.470
dynamics processing effect so we're
actually doing multi-dimensional mapping

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480
actually doing multi-dimensional mapping
 

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.450
actually doing multi-dimensional mapping
we are taking something that has many

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:30.460
we are taking something that has many
 

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.520
we are taking something that has many
dimensions and reducing that to two

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:32.530
dimensions and reducing that to two
 

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.770
dimensions and reducing that to two
dimensions okay of course this is a toy

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:34.780
dimensions okay of course this is a toy
 

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.720
dimensions okay of course this is a toy
example there is a lot of math involved

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:36.730
example there is a lot of math involved
 

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.520
example there is a lot of math involved
in there but the idea that you get the

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:38.530
in there but the idea that you get the
 

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.650
in there but the idea that you get the
idea but one of the other important

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:40.660
idea but one of the other important
 

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.660
idea but one of the other important
things that we did here is that we took

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:42.670
things that we did here is that we took
 

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.360
things that we did here is that we took
many curves from many people from many

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.370
many curves from many people from many
 

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.210
many curves from many people from many
audiograms and with those audiograms we

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:48.220
audiograms and with those audiograms we
 

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.570
audiograms and with those audiograms we
managed to a count with all these curves

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:51.580
managed to a count with all these curves
 

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.550
managed to a count with all these curves
that represent the kind of hearing

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:53.560
that represent the kind of hearing
 

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.500
that represent the kind of hearing
enhancement that a lot of people will

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:55.510
enhancement that a lot of people will
 

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.960
enhancement that a lot of people will
benefit from in the real world in the

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:57.970
benefit from in the real world in the
 

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.370
benefit from in the real world in the
when they're in a coffee shop and a

00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.380
when they're in a coffee shop and a
 

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.800
when they're in a coffee shop and a
restaurant on different places okay and

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:01.810
restaurant on different places okay and
 

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.780
restaurant on different places okay and
to finish I want to talk a little bit

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.790
to finish I want to talk a little bit
 

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.400
to finish I want to talk a little bit
about noise reduction with noise

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:05.410
about noise reduction with noise
 

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.530
about noise reduction with noise
reduction what we do is in the bottom

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:07.540
reduction what we do is in the bottom
 

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.380
reduction what we do is in the bottom
part we are get hold of the audio we are

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:10.390
part we are get hold of the audio we are
 

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.850
part we are get hold of the audio we are
looking at the audio that is coming

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:11.860
looking at the audio that is coming
 

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.530
looking at the audio that is coming
through the microphone but we would like

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:13.540
through the microphone but we would like
 

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.780
through the microphone but we would like
to get rid of sounds that especially

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:15.790
to get rid of sounds that especially
 

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.330
to get rid of sounds that especially
they are all there like there for the

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:18.340
they are all there like there for the
 

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.010
they are all there like there for the
for a long time for example that AC

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:20.020
for a long time for example that AC
 

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.500
for a long time for example that AC
sound that is reading and annoying so if

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:22.510
sound that is reading and annoying so if
 

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.330
sound that is reading and annoying so if
we start looking at the spectrum of the

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:24.340
we start looking at the spectrum of the
 

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.670
we start looking at the spectrum of the
sound and we take and one spectrum

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:26.680
sound and we take and one spectrum
 

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.560
sound and we take and one spectrum
within another a spectrum that another

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:28.570
within another a spectrum that another
 

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.200
within another a spectrum that another
spectrum we can see what is pretty much

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.210
spectrum we can see what is pretty much
 

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.240
spectrum we can see what is pretty much
there for a long period of time versus

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:33.250
there for a long period of time versus
 

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.830
there for a long period of time versus
something that changes a lot like my

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840
something that changes a lot like my
 

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.510
something that changes a lot like my

put them down and an attenuator now just

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:48.970
put them down and an attenuator now just
 

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.910
put them down and an attenuator now just
to recap we look inside the dynamics

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:50.920
to recap we look inside the dynamics
 

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.070
to recap we look inside the dynamics
process in FA we build our own equalizer

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080
process in FA we build our own equalizer
 

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.140
process in FA we build our own equalizer
and we talk about the sound amplifier

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:55.150
and we talk about the sound amplifier

aid support thank you

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.210
 
 

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.759
 
thanks Ricardo let's talk about hearing

00:27:11.759 --> 00:27:11.769
thanks Ricardo let's talk about hearing
 

00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:14.970
thanks Ricardo let's talk about hearing
aids so first I'm gonna go over what the

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:14.980
aids so first I'm gonna go over what the
 

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.830
aids so first I'm gonna go over what the
existing landscape looks like and where

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840
existing landscape looks like and where
 

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.899
existing landscape looks like and where
what we've built in fits in and then I'm

00:27:18.899 --> 00:27:18.909
what we've built in fits in and then I'm
 

00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:20.310
what we've built in fits in and then I'm
gonna hand it off to Stanley who's gonna

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320
gonna hand it off to Stanley who's gonna
 

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.720
gonna hand it off to Stanley who's gonna
talk through exactly how to build this

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:21.730
talk through exactly how to build this
 

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.580
talk through exactly how to build this
into your devices if you're an OEM or a

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:23.590
into your devices if you're an OEM or a
 

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.330
into your devices if you're an OEM or a
hearing aid maker so today if you want

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:27.340
hearing aid maker so today if you want
 

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.860
hearing aid maker so today if you want
to get audio from your Android phone to

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:28.870
to get audio from your Android phone to
 

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.749
to get audio from your Android phone to
your hearing aids it's not so easy

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:30.759
your hearing aids it's not so easy
 

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:32.610
your hearing aids it's not so easy
typically you'll need what's called a

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:32.620
typically you'll need what's called a
 

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.350
typically you'll need what's called a
streamer and this is a small piece of

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.360
streamer and this is a small piece of
 

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.570
streamer and this is a small piece of
hardware that you wear on your body that

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:36.580
hardware that you wear on your body that
 

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.359
hardware that you wear on your body that
allows the phone to relay an audio

00:27:39.359 --> 00:27:39.369
allows the phone to relay an audio
 

00:27:39.369 --> 00:27:41.039
allows the phone to relay an audio
signal to the hearing aids and the

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:41.049
signal to the hearing aids and the
 

00:27:41.049 --> 00:27:42.509
signal to the hearing aids and the
reason why this exists is because of

00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519
reason why this exists is because of
 

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:44.789
reason why this exists is because of
battery life so Bluetooth classic

00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799
battery life so Bluetooth classic
 

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:46.680
battery life so Bluetooth classic
is just not good enough for the power

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:46.690
is just not good enough for the power
 

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.450
is just not good enough for the power
constraints of a hearing aid device and

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:48.460
constraints of a hearing aid device and
 

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.609
constraints of a hearing aid device and
we can't ask hearing aid users to

00:27:50.609 --> 00:27:50.619
we can't ask hearing aid users to
 

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:51.989
we can't ask hearing aid users to
replace the battery on the order of

hours or days and so what the streamer

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:53.980
hours or days and so what the streamer
 

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.859
hours or days and so what the streamer
does is it will take a classic Bluetooth

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:55.869
does is it will take a classic Bluetooth
 

00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:57.600
does is it will take a classic Bluetooth
