NARRATOR: What really
grabs me about this

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.984
isn't the cheerful man
given two thumbs up,

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.150
although he is pretty great.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.590
It's the backdrop.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.815
The brightly colored paintings,
the transcriptions, the way

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:18.085
it's all carved right into--
well, what is that carved into?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.420
JOE BIELAWA: My
name is Joe Bielawa,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.080
and I'm a photographer based
in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.960
In September of 2009, an
old friend of mine and I

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.650
decided to take a day trip
around the Salton Sea.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.190
The Salton Sea is
a peculiar place.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.020
It's technically the
largest lake in California.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.990
It's located in the hottest
desert in North America,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.152
and it was created by accident.

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:48.860
NARRATOR: But that's
a whole other story.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.510
This story is about an
even more unusual place

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
a few miles from the
sea-- Salvation Mountain.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.630
Salvation Mountain is
an art installation

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.210
built into a sloping hill about
three stories high overlooking

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.650
the desert.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.060
The mound is made up mostly
of adobe clay and straw,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.532
and it's covered in colorful
murals and Bible verses.

00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:12.990
JOE BIELAWA: We arrived at the
site and got out of the car.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.150
And it felt as if
no one was around,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.140
but yet I could feel
a strong presence.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.040
I was struck by the mania of
it all-- the bright colors,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.580
the patterns, the empty paint
cans that were scattered over

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.550
to the right.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.080
There was an old
truck and an old car,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.500
and every available
inch of these vehicles

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.570
were painted with bright
colors, and God is love,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.910
and Jesus saves.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.860
I began taking
pictures of everything,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.160
as this visual
stimulation seemed

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.050
to trigger a mania in me.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.650
NARRATOR: The artwork's
creator, Leonard Knight,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.830
built the mountain from
scratch back in the '80s

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.390
and spent three decades
painting it while living out

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.430
of the back of his truck.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.430
Leonard was motivated
to mold the mountain

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.370
to share his love
for God with others.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.640
30 years later,
the place continues

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.310
to attract road tripper
and vagabonds passing

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.530
through the bleak desert
town-- travelers like Joe

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.167
and his friend.

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:08.750
JOE BIELAWA: We
climbed down and begin

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.208
to wonder through
some of the rooms

00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:12.470
to the south side
of the structure.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.290
I felt a stronger presence than
I had when I first arrived.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.950
Walking out into the open
space in front of the mountain,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.840
we were greeted with
a friendly hello,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.710
and there was Leonard
Knight waving at us

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.860
from across the yard.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.540
NARRATOR: At the time, Joe
didn't realize just how lucky

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330
he was to have met Leonard.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.320
It's an experience that
travelers today can't have,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.500
because the beloved 82-year-old
artist passed away last year.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.460
But the mountain
still stands, thanks

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.740
to visitors who have volunteered
to maintain the site.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.714
And there really is nothing
else like it in the world.

00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:48.130
JOE BIELAWA: Although we made
many other stops that days--

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.980
we traveled around the
Salton Sea-- none of them

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.750
seemed to match the energy of
Salvation Mountain and meeting

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.262
Leonard Knight.

00:02:57.262 --> 00:02:58.470
NARRATOR: This happened here.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.060
We're always
looking for new ways

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.230
to tell stories through photos.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.284

featured on our show,

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.700
