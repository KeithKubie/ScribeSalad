00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.790
Guys, today we're taking
a look at how to build

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.800
a very simple tennis ball cannon

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.600
made almost entirely out of soup cans.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.460
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
[Music]

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.880
We'll show you how
to construct the CANnon...

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.440
Get it?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.020
Can-- It's not that funny.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.560
And then, we'll try out
a few different types of fuel

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.000
to see what works best.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240
All we need to get started
is eight or nine cans,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.500
a little bit of electrical tape,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.340
and of course, a can opener.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.600
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.780
Several of these cans lined up
together will create a chamber,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.560
where pressure can be
built up when our fuel explodes.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.120
A tennis ball suspended
about halfway down the barrel

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.620
will be launched out the front,
flying up to 100 feet.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.400
Of course, you need to get
cans that are the right size.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.060
The tennis ball should be
able to fit down in,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.700
but not have a lot
of extra space on the sides.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.200
More importantly though,
is that a lot of cans nowadays

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.609
have a modified bottom that's designed
to make stacking the cans easier.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.170
While the modified shape of the bottom
does make it a lot easier to stack the cans,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.430
it makes it harder to open
the bottom with a can opener.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.260
So, what you're looking for
is a can that's the same

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.580
on the top and the bottom.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.500
If you go through cans regularly,
you can just save them up as you use them.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.260
[Music]

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Our last two cans,
let's cut off the tops,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.420
but not the bottoms.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.660
With one of these two cans,
we'll leave the bottom fully attached.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.380
With the other one,
we want to do a special cutting job

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.240
where we leave two connection points,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.140
one sort of at the top,
and one at the bottom.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.280
Then we're going to try
and fold that bottom in on itself,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.560
so it can act as a support
that still lets a lot of air through.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.600
With the last can,
we'll leave the bottom attached,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.680
but let's drill a small hole into it.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.720
[Music]

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.460
After rinsing and
drying all of our cans,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.329
it's now time to attach them together.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.210
The one with the hole in the bottom
is the bottom of our cannon,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.160
and the support should go
a little over halfway up the cannon.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.560
Now, using some electrical tape,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.679
we're tightly going
to wrap a couple of layers

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.860
around the seam where two cans meet.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.700
[Music]

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.880
I like to make the folded support
at the top of the fifth can.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.990
That way there are four cans
above the tennis ball,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.980
and five below.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.900
Nine soup cans taped together
is giving us a pretty good barrel,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.020
and our tennis ball rests right
at the bottom of the fourth can.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.960
Let's give this bad boy
a little bit of decoration

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.800
so it doesn't just look like
a bunch of cans taped together.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:31.880
[Music]

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.120
Our soup can cannon
is now all constructed.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.160
Hello.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.580
Let's see if we can't fire
tennis ball out of this bad boy.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.440
When I first started
researching this project,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.390
I was told that the best fuel
to use is Zippo lighter fluid,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.840
although I've had some problems
getting it to work consistently.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500
So, let's give it a few tries,
and then if that doesn't work,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000
well, we might move on to something else.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.500
Now, the fuel itself is just
going to burn if we light it on fire.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.920
So, the goal is to get it
to spread out inside the cans,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.360
and then just start evaporating

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.420
so, we have fuel fumes
filling the chamber

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.650
at hopefully just the right ratios
that a flame near the hole at the back

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.830
will ignite all of it,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.320
and will create a lot of pressure
launching our tennis ball out of front.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.560
[Music]

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.340
I'm gonna use my little torch.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.440
Any barbecue lighter
or regular lighter,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.340
even a match should
work just as well.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.720
I'm not going to be pushing
the flame inside the cannon,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.660
I'm just going to try
and ignite out the back.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:34.060
[Music]

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.200
So, the Zippo lighter fluid
maybe can work really well,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.900
and I just don't know the right secret.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.790
There's probably just
the right amount of fuel,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.430
just the right way
to spread it around,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.040
and just the right amount of time
to wait as it turns into fumes.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.340
I think I have an idea for something
that will work a little bit simpler.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.780
This is methanol,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.700
and I've done some
experiments with it before,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.200
and discovered that it 
is pretty good at igniting

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.000
almost no matter what the mix ratio is.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.500
So, I'm just going to try
putting about a capful of this

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.300
down into our cannon,
we'll see how that works.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.720
[Music]

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.140
Well, we got better distance.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.560
The ball actually
left the cannon that time,

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.180
although not very quickly.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.940
[Music]

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.120
That sounded pretty good.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.220
[Music]

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.919
Using the methanol,
we're getting pretty decent distance.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.220
The balls are launching 40 or 50 feet,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.580
but I think we can do better.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.979
You can see that the balls in
these cans are not a perfect fit.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.409
This is the closest size
of cans that I was able to find.

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.530
If somewhere near you sells a can
that holds the tennis ball

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.980
even better than that,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.340
you're almost certain
to get a lot more distance.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.139
Since we don't have cans that size,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.800
I have two different stop-gap
measures we're going to take

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.940
to sort of improvised
shrinking these cans down.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.889
First, let's try just
using a wad of paper towels,

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.620
and pushing that down into the barrel.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.790
That should completely
closed off all of the air supply,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.240
and we should get a lot
more pressure in the chamber,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.200
throwing the tennis ball out a lot harder.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.760
[Music]

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.640
Ah, yeah.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.479
Using paper towels as wadding
clearly works pretty well.

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.020
The other thing we want to try
is restricting the barrel down

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.840
to a slightly smaller size.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.840
This sheet of craft foam is about a dollar,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.969
and when cut to the right size,

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.360
should provide several
successful high-powered launches.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.979
The inside of the cans that I'm using
have an 8 and 1/2 inch radius.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.090
So, I've cut my sheet
to 8 and 1/2 inches,

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.220
and now will fit this down
as a tube inside the cannon.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.060
You can see that the foam nicely fills
the gaps around the tennis ball,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.139
and now it just barely fits in.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.539
Let's add a little bit of fuel,

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.720
and see how much of
a difference the foam makes.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.120
[Music]

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.380
It makes a difference.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.680
It makes a huge difference.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.540
Oh my gosh.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.220
&gt;&gt; Where did it go?

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.560
&gt;&gt; It hit the tree about
40 feet up and bounced.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.720
Oh my gosh.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.540
[Music]

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.120
Boom!

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.360
[Music]

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.940
That is a cannon.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.900
The heat seems to have warped
the foam by just a little bit,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.340
but I'm pretty sure we can
still get some more shots out of it.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:47.270
[Music]

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.270
Remember to check your
local laws and ordinances

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.120
before building and
using something like this.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.660
Depending on where you live,
it may not be legal to fire one.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.540
And of course, always be sure
you're doing it in a safe environment,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.900
and make sure you're
not pointing the barrel

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.130
at anything that could ever break or be injured.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.360
Guys, that's not all.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.560
There's more for you to see.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.639
That little box up at the top
will transport you directly

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.729
to our last video and
you should go check it out.

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.680
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.020
you should be watching next.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.129
And this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:13.729
so, you never miss a video.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.680
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.229
Talk to you then.
