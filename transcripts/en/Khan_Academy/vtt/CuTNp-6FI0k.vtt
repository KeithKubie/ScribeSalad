00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Instructor] We are now
going to continue our study

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.940
of labor markets, and in this video,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.580
we're going to focus on
the demand curve for labor.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.510
So let's imagine that we're
talking about a market

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.650
for people who work in
the pant making industry,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.030
so each of these firms right over here,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.374
they produce pants, let's say
they produce bell bottoms.

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:25.090
This is my quick drawing of bell bottoms,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.550
these are someone's pants right over here,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.220
they flare out at the bottom,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.800
and let's say for some strange reason,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.140
bell bottoms all of a
sudden go back in style.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.890
So bell bottoms are going back in style.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.960
The first is, at least in the short run,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.340
is able to get more per
unit for its bell bottoms,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.190
so its marginal revenue goes up,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.820
and if its marginal revenue goes up,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.520
its marginal revenue
product is going to go up,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.710
and so we would have a shift to the right

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.560
of the marginal revenue product curve,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.520
or you could even do that as a shift up.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.270
For a given quantity of
labor, you're going to have

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.620
a higher marginal revenue product,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.620
so we could call this marginal
revenue product curve 2.

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:13.130
Now what was likely to
happen in the market?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.950
Well if it's a general fashion trend,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.022
it's not just for this
firm's goods or product,

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:21.660
but it's for everyone,
all of the pant producers.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.130
Well then they're all going
to want a lot more people

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.660
who can work in the
pant producing industry,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.180
or another way to think about it

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.465
is the market labor
demand curve is just a sum

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.640
of the marginal revenue product curves

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.050
for all of the various firms,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.346
and if all of them have shifted
to the right or shifted up,

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:40.140
well the same thing is going to happen

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.580
to the market labor demand curve.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.830
And so the market labor demand curve

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.700
might now look like this.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.560
So market,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.970
labor,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.400
demand,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.900
curve,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.210
sub 2.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.150
Now what does that do

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.340
to the equilibrium wages and quantities?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.140
Well our equilibrium wage has gone up,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.890
which seems reasonable 'cause
the demand curve has shifted

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.890
to the right, and our equilibrium
quantity has also gone up.

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:12.310
I'll put a little Q sub 2.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.350
Now what does that do
the marginal factor cost?

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.040
For the firms operating in this market,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.110
the ones that are hiring this labor.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.700
Well, the wages have gone up so

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.770
so has the marginal factor cost.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.100
So in this situation,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.680
we now have a marginal factor cost sub 2,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.943
and now we have a new
quantity that is rational

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:40.943
for this firm to actually go out and hire.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.760
And you can imagine things
going the other way,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.020
so here, we saw things shift to the right,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.330
both the marginal revenue product curves

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.260
and the market labor demand curve,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.170
but maybe things aren't going well,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.074
and the marginal revenue
goes down for these firms.

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.610
Well then you can imagine a situation

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.100
where on the firm level, your
marginal revenue product curve

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.030
shifts down and to the left,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.080
maybe it does something like that,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.785
marginal revenue product
3, and in aggregate,

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:15.360
that would cause the
market labor demand curve

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.250
to shift to the left, and you
would see the opposite happen.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.760
You would see a lower equilibrium wage,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.480
let me just label this market,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.820
labor,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.200
demand,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.450
curve,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.490
3.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.593
You would have a lower
equilibrium wage now,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.503
and you would have a
lower quantity of labor,

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:43.230
equilibrium quantity of
labor in that market, sub 3,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.010
and then you would have a lower,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.580
a lower marginal factor cost

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.280
assuming a perfectly
competitive labor market.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.140
And so this might be
the equilibrium quantity

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.140
right over there, Q for the
firm, sub 3 with a star.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.090
Once again, not counterintuitive.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.380
This is what we've seen in other markets

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.210
when we talked about what
would cause shifts in demand.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.970
The firms for whatever
reason are not able to get

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.330
as much incremental benefit per unit,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.250
per extra unit of labor,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.300
well that's going to
shift things to the left,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.850
both at the firm level
and at the market level,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.710
and if for some reason the
firms are able to get a lot more

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.840
incremental benefit per
extra unit of labor,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.468
well that's going to shift both
the marginal revenue product

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:35.450
at the firm level to the right,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.980
and the market labor demand
curve at the market level

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.813
to the right.
