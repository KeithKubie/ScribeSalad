00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.120
If you're a smoker trying to quit, boy do
you have options.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.300
Patches, chewing gum, lollipops -- and even
lasers!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.690
But if you're overwhelmed with choice, maybe
try nothing at all.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.919
Hi aware citizens, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.750
Now smoking is bad for you -- it causes cancer
and a gazillion other diseases.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.750
You know that.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.750
We know that.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.960
This is your life and we’re not going to
tell you what to do.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.730
But we are going to tell you the science behind
quitting if you or someone you know is trying

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
to give up the habit.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.050
Now before we breakdown the options, we have
to first understand why it’s so difficult

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.240
to quit in the first place.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.240
One word: nicotine.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.781
It’s what’s naturally found in tobacco
and as addictive as heroin and cocaine.

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.110
When inhaled, nicotine travels quickly to
the brain.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.500
There, it releases dopamine and other feel
good chemicals into brain cell receptors.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.370
This creates more and more nicotine receptors
in the brain.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.239
When these receptors are starved of nicotine
you go through intense withdrawal, which can

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.719
lead to depression and tension, until you
get your next fix.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.590
So the trick may be to gradually giving your
brain less and less nicotine, which is where

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.210
the highly advertized treatment of nicotine
replacement therapy comes into play.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.410
We’re talking about patches, chewing gum,
lozenges, inhalers and even nasal spray and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.410
lollipops.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.460
But do these methods actually work?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.500
Let’s take one of the most popular methods,
the patch.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.090
This is typically a reservoir of nicotine
sandwiched between an occlusive and permeable

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.390
adhesive layers.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.970
Stick it on your skin and the nicotine slowly
leaches through the layers of your dermis,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.550
to the hypodermis, which contains blood vessels
needed to bring the drug into the bloodstream.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.230
This happens at a much slower rate and at
a lower concentration than smoke inhalation.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.340
Different patches contain different amounts
of nicotine, slowly ridding your body’s

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.810
dependence of the drug.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.979
But is it effective?

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.640
Well, one study conducted by the Harvard School
of Public Health looked at 787 adults who

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.930
had recently quit smoking.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.420
They were surveyed three different times over
the course of six years and asked questions

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.070
about what type of nicotine replacement therapy
they had used, the duration of the therapy,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.399
if they had consulted a professional, and
their current smoking habits.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.290
During each one of those check-ins around
a third of the participants had relapsed.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.500
This led researchers to conclude that “using
nicotine replacement therapy is no more effective

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.600
in helping people stop smoking cigarettes
in the long-term than trying to quit on one’s

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600
own.”

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.310
What about alternative ways to quit smoking?

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.500
Some people have tried acupuncture and hypnosis,
but based on some of our last videos, it’s

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
a little up for debate on whether that works
or not.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.350
And others have even tried lasers.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640
Yes, lasers… well, low-level lasers therapy.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.740
The company Innovative Laser Therapy claims
that an hour of therapy is all you’d need

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.800
to quit your addiction.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.650
The lasers target specific points in the body
that the company alleges are related to addiction,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.800
claiming it relieves withdrawal symptoms and
prevents cravings.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.600
Owner Frank Pinto explains, “The laser basically
stimulates the nerve endings to tell the brain

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.190
to release a flood of endorphins.”

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.460
But “basically” isn’t science.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.140
And though there have been a few studies to
determine its validity, they are few and far

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.370
between with inconclusive results.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.260
But perhaps the best thing to do is nothing
at all.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.030
In a 2016 study published in the journal Annals
of Internal Medicine, 697 adult smokers who

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.760
smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day were divided
into two groups: those who quit cold turkey

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.390
and those who gradually reduced their smoking
over the course of two weeks.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.870
Researchers recorded their results both four
weeks then six months later.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.370
Nearly half of the cold turkey group successfully
quit smoking after a month, compared to 39%

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.000
of those who gave it up gradually.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.910
At the half-year mark, the rates of success
reduced to 22% and 15% respectively, but this

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.630
still means the cold turkey technique is still
more effective than gradual reduction.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.380
Of course there are other factors that take
place when finding the right way to quit like

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.380
genetics and age.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.130
So like many of our health related episodes,
it’s probably best to consult your doctor

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.420
on what’s right for you.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.550

a more healthy lifestyle, and if that’s

Smoking does a lot of crazy stuff to your
body, but when you do find that effective

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.940
way to quit, is that alone enough to reverse
all the damage done from smoking?

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.530
Tara talks about it more in this video.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.870
Have you, or anyone you know, tried to quit
smoking?

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.980
What did you use?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.080
Did it work?
