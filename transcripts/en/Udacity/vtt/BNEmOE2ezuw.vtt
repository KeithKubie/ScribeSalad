00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.959
Up to this point our lines have been
all slanty and I've got nothing against

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.717
slanty lines, don't say I do, but
let's talk a bit about horizontal and

00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:11.474
vertical lines, lines that go straight
across or straight up and down and

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.986
let's start with a question
to get us thinking.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:17.199
So the question is which
of the following lines only

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.900
contains points with
x values equal to 2?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.830
And I've given you three options, and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.740
I want you to just select the one
that you think is correct.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.144
And actually to solve this one,

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:28.697
I'm going to just plot a few
points with x values equal to 2.

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:35.324
going to plot the point 2,0,
2,3, and I dunno, 2,-3.
