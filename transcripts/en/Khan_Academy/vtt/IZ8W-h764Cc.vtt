00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.220
Let's do a couple more
rotational volume problems, and

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.710
I'm going to make these a
little bit more difficult.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.290
And hopefully after these if
you've understood everything

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.370
we've done up to now and the
ones I'm about to do, I think

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.300
you're pretty set for most
of what you should face

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.220
in most math classes.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460
And definitely I think you'll
be set for the AP exam,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.690
and either ab or bc
on this concept.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.050
So let's do another example.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.990
OK.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.510
So let's say that I want
to-- actually, let me

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.005
do something different.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.780
Let me draw here.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.480
So that's my y-axis.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.260
This is my x-axis.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.100
Now let me draw the function
y is equal to x squared.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.370
And we know that that could be
written as y is equal to x

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.570
squared, or we could write that
as x is equal to square root of

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.540
y, depending on what we want
to be a function of what.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.530
This is the y-axis.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.570
This is the x-axis.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.950
Let's say I also have
the line y equals 2.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.270
Goes over what I just wrote.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.640
y equals 2.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.170
Now this problem is going to
be slightly different then

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.310
what we've done so far.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.570
I'm going to take a rotation,
but instead of taking a

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.370
rotation around the y or the
x-axis, I'm going to take a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.610
rotation around another line.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.330
So let's say I want to
take a rotation between

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.510
x is equal to 0.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.130
Actually let me do
something arbitrary.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.370
Let me say between x is equal
to 1, so that's that point,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.590
and x is equal to 2.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.230
That's where they intersect.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.710
This is the point right
here, this is 2,2.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.990
I'm sorry, no, 2,4.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.230
Because y is equal
to x squared.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.610
So this is 2,4.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.190
This is the point 4.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.100
So what point is this.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.670
This is the point 1, right?

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.980
So our y values go from 4 to 1,
our x values go from 1 to 2.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.170
And that makes sense,
because y is x squared.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.560
And so if we were to kind of
take the area that we're going

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.230
to rotate, and I haven't told
you what we're going to rotate

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.230
it around yet, and this might
prove to be shocking to you.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.005
So this is the area
we're going to rotate.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.580
Instead of rotating it around
the y-axis, I want to rotate

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.010
it around the line y
is equal to minus 2.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.340
So if that's 2, y equals minus
2 should be roughly here.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.440
So I'm going to rotate this
area around this line.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.450
So what's it going
to look like?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.780
It's going to be a
fairly big ring.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.300
Like if I were to try to draw
it-- let me see if I can

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.870
even make an attempt.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.370
Once again this is always the
hardest part, just drawing

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.180
what I'm trying to rotate.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.450
I'll try to do it from
an upward perspective.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.040
So that's kind of the inner
loop, and then there

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
will be an outer loop.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.150
The top is flat right, because
it's defined by y is equal

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.320
to 4, so that's the top.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.010
And the inside is also
going to be a hard edge.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.180
But then the outside is
going to curve inward.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.300
I don't know if you see what
I'm saying, because this is the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.150
outside, it's curving inward.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.490
So it's going to be a big ring.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.180
So if I were to draw the axis,
this would be the y-axis access

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.570
coming in-- no, no, sorry.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.400
Whoops.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.320
The y-axis is actually going to
be closer to this hand side.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.160
The y-axis is going to be in
the middle of kind of-- so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.860
this is going to be the
y-axis coming up here.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.140
And then the x-axis is
going to come below that.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.780
I'm drawing everything at
an angle as best as I can.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.290
The x-axis is going to
come a below that.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.960
And then this line we're
rotating it around,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.690
that's going to be
someplace over here.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.880
That's going to be
something like that.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.440
It's going to go behind there
and come back over there.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.310
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.010
We're just getting a big ring.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.780
So how are we going to do this?

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.810
Well actually there's a
couple of things we can do.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.700
First we could just
use the shell method,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.650
using the x value.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.362
So how do we do that?

00:04:54.362 --> 00:04:56.650
The important thing is
to always visualize

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.710
the shell or the disk.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.450
So the shell method we're going
to take slivers like this,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.220
where the width of
that sliver is dx.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.650
I could draw it really big.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.510
So that's our direct
angle, is going to be dx.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.530
What's the height going
to be of the sliver?

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.590
Well it's going to be
the top function minus

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.360
the bottom function.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.760
It's going to be y equals
4 minus x squared.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.650
So this is going to be 4 minus
x squared, the height at

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.510
any point right here.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.880
And then if I were to do
the shell just like we did

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.300
before-- let me see if I
can draw a decent shell.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.390
I think I'm getting
better at this.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.560
This is one edge of the shell,
that's the other shell.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.020
We already figured out that
the width of the shell is dx.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.410
The height is 4 minus x
squared, the top function minus

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.070
the bottom function because of
the distance between the two.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.200
And then what's the
radius going to be?

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.040
What's the radius of
that shell going to be?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.570
Well, is it going to be just x?

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.220
Is it just going to be x value?

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.580
No, the x value will tell you
the distance from the y-axis to

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.750
that shell, and it's going to
be from minus 2 to the e value.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.630
So it's going to be
essentially 2 plus x.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.220
That's going to be the
radius at any point.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.030
And this is where we diverge
from what we've done before.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.630
Before the radius was just
x, but now it's 2 plus x.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.280
So what's the circumference
of each shell going to be?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.460
Well circumference is
equal to 2 pi r, and

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.890
our radius is 2 plus x.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:48.690
So it's 2 pi times 2 plus
x, which equals 4 pi

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.310
plus 4 pi plus 2 pi x.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.840
That's the circumference.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.940
And then what's the
surface area of this?

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.960
Well it's going to be the
circumference times the height.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.630
So surface area is
equal to that.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:12.180
The circumference 4 pi plus 2
pi x, all of that times the

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.220
height-- times 4
minus x squared.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.540
And let's see if we
can foil this out or

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.870
distribute this out.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.810
So 4 pi times 4 is 16 pi.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.580
4 pi minus x squared
minus 4 pi x squared.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:38.040
2 pi x times 4 plus 8 pi x, and
then 2 pi x times minus x

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.030
squared, so that's minus
2 pi x to the third.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.980
So that's the surface
area of each ring.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.820
And then if we want the volume
of each shell, essentially

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.890
we multiply it times
the width, the dx.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.220
So that's the volume of
each shell, and if we want

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.180
the volume of all the
shells, we sum them up.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.800
So we take the integral, that's
an integral sign, and I'm

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.720
running out of space
like I always do.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.015
And where did I take
the integral from?

00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:11.550
I take the integral from x is
equal to 1 to x is equal to 2.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.340
From 1 to 2.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.980
That's probably too
small for you to read.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.710
So let's see if we can take
the antiderivative of this.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.610
Let me make some space
free just so I don't

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.220
have to write so small.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.360
So I'll keep this down here,
because that's the set

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.965
up of the problem.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.360
I think I can get rid
of a lot of this.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.995
I think that is pretty good.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.360
OK.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.876
And let me switch
to another color.

00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:45.280
And we're going to take
the antiderivative.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.550
So what's the
antiderivative of this?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.405
So the antiderivative
of 16 pi is 16 pi x.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.570
And then what's the
antiderivative of

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.530
4 pi x squared?

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.370
It's going to be x to the third
over 3, so it'll be minus 4

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:14.370
pi over 3-- sorry-- 4 pi
over 3 x to the third.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.100
Well this will be x squared
over 2, so it'll be

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.400
plus 4 pi x squared.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.200
And then minus, this will
be x to the fourth over

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.390
4, so minus pi over 2.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.550
Just divided by 4.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.170
x to the fourth.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.320
I'm going to evaluate that.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.840
This is a much hairrier problem
then what we've been doing.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.940
2 and at 1.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.770
So what is it evaluated at 2?

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:50.720
It is 32 pi minus 4 pi over 3
times 8 plus 4 pi times 4 plus

00:09:50.720 --> 00:10:00.640
16 pi minus 2 to the fourth is
16 divided by 2 minus 8 pi.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.920
And then I just realized I'm
running out time, so I will

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.130
continue this in
the next video.
