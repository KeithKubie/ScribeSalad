00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:05.420
We typically aim for a particular career because
we have been deeply impressed by the exploits

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.280
of the most accomplished practitioners in
the field. We formulate our ambitions by admiring

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.350
the beautiful structures of the architect
tasked with designing the city’s new airport,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.200
or by following the intrepid trades of the
wealthiest Wall Street fund manager, by reading

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.980
the analyses of the acclaimed literary novelist
or sampling the piquant meals in the restaurant

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.940
of a prize-winning chef. We form our career
plans on the basis of perfection. Then, inspired

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.670
by the masters, we take our own first steps
and trouble begins. What we have managed to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.690
design, or make in our first month of trading,
or write in an early short story, or cook

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.620
for the family is markedly and absurdly, beneath
the standard that first sparked our ambitions.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.719
We who are so aware of excellence end up the
least able to tolerate mediocrity – which

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.330
in this case, happens to be our own. We become
stuck in an uncomfortable paradox: our ambitions

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.980
have been ignited by greatness, but everything
we know of ourselves points to congenital

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.220
ineptitude. We have fallen into what we can
term the Perfectionist Trap, defined as a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.230
powerful attraction to perfection shorn of
any mature or sufficient understanding of

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.330
what is required to attain it. It isn’t
primarily our fault. Without in any way revealing

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.760
this, or even perhaps being aware of it, our
media edits out billions of unremarkable lives

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.880
and years of failure, rejection and frustration
even in those who do achieve – in order

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.080
to serve up a daily curated selection of peak
career moments, which thereby end up seeming

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.630
not like the violent exceptions that they
are, but a norm and baseline of achievement.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.470
It starts to appear as though ‘everyone’
is successful because all those who we happen

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.780
to hear about really are successes – and
we have forgotten to imagine the oceans of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.959
tears and despair that necessarily surround
them. Our perspective is imbalanced because

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.409
we know our own struggles so well from the
inside, and yet are exposed to apparently

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:24.480
pain-free narratives of achievement on the
outside. We cannot forgive ourselves the horrors

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.480
of our early drafts – largely because we
have not seen the early drafts of those we

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.659
admire. We need a saner picture of how many
difficulties lie behind everything we would

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.830
wish to emulate. We should not look, for example,
at the masterpieces of art in a museum. We

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.269
should go to the studio and there see the
anguish, wrecked early versions and watermarks

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.879
on the paper where the artist broke down and
wept. We should focus on how long it took

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.499
the architect before they received their first
proper commission (they were over 50), we need to dig

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:03.310
out the early stories of the writer who now
wins prizes and examine more closely how many

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.279
failures the entrepreneur had to endure. We
need to recognise the legitimate and necessary

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:15.950
role of failure, allow ourselves to do things
quite imperfectly for a very long time – as

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.329
a price we cannot avoid paying for an opportunity
one day, perhaps in many decades, to do something

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.449
that others will consider a spontaneous success.
