00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.440
Our planet is amazing.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.420
Orbiting around the sun at a whopping speed
of 107,218 km/h, that’s pretty fast for

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.360
such a big body - and though Earth can’t
step on a scale - NASA calculates its mass

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.369
at 5,972,190,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg (five
septillion, nine hundred seventy two sextillion,

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.460
one hundred ninety quintillion kilograms).

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.109
However, our planet is continually gaining
and losing mass.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.949
We take on an estimated 40,000 tonnes of space
dust that the earth’s gravity pulls in like

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.320
a giant vacuum - this dust is vestiges of
our solar system, broken up asteroids and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.410
the matter that never turned into planets.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.190
But we lose mass largely due to gases (farting
earth drawing).

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.580
Gases like hydrogen are so light that they
are escaping through the atmosphere at a rate

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.530
of 3 kg per second - that’s 95,000 tonnes
a year.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.989
But what about us?

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.670
The human population in 1987 was 5 billion
and it is now estimated at 7.6 billion!

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.859
Do our bodies and all the structures we put
on the surface of the earth affect the mass

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.219
of the planet?

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.070
No, because we are actually made up of existing
matter on the planet.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.260
That matter is atoms - and we’ve been able
to identify 118 different kinds (elements)

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.820
but what makes up 90% of us is just 3 elements:
oxygen (65%), carbon (18.5%) and hydrogen

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.820
(9.5%).

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.640
Two of those elements make up the liquid vital
for life: water.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.830
Our oceans cover 70% of the planet.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.320
At its deepest depth the Mariana Trench is
measured at 10,994m - for context if you put

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.000
the base of Mount Everest at the bottom of
the Trench, the peak would still be 1.6km

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.510
underwater.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.820
Our oceans are still largely a mystery - with
only 5% of it explored.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.530
With more knowledge we could better understand
how the Deep-Sea Octopus (Graneledone boreopacifica)

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.830
had the longest egg-brooding period ever recorded
(pregnancy).

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.720
This committed mama located in Monterey Bay
wrapped her arms around her 160 plus eggs,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.220
protecting them for 53 months without eating
the entire time, how she survived so long

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.220
is still a mystery.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.230
Similarly inspiring - the bowhead whale can
live to be 150-200 years old!

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.980
In 2007, a Bowhead whale was found swimming
with an arrow-shaped harpoon fragment embedded

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.950
in its blubber from hunters from over a century
ago.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.079
But the oldest animal is the antarctic glass
sponge and is estimated to be 15,000 years

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.079
old - that’s older than the pyramids, older
than the wheel.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.290
Meanwhile on land, the Bristlecone pine is
the oldest living individual tree at 5067

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.290
years.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.290
But ‘The Pando’, a clonal colony of 40,000
genetically identical quaking aspens in Utah

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
is estimated at 80,000 years old and is considered
all one tree!

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.290
Plants, have a myriad of strategies to defend
themselves.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.290
A recent study revealed that some cope with
being eaten by setting off a molecular chain

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.290
of events that causes them to grow back bigger,
produce more seeds, and increase chemical

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.290
defenses.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.290
Meanwhile, the pebble toad defends itself
from predators by tightening all of its muscles

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.290
turning it essentially into a rubber ball
that can bounce down mountains out of harm's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.290
way.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.290
When the pistol shrimp wants a snack they
simply snap its claw to shoot out ‘cavitation

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.290
bubbles’ to stun/kill their prey.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.290
These bubbles are the formation of vapour
cavities in water that happen due to the rapid

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
pressure change.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.290
When these bubbles collapse, they generate
temperatures of 8000 degrees fahrenheit - roughly

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.290
the same temperature as the sun's surface.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.290
Speaking of heat - the bacteria Thermophilus
aquaticus can live in scalding hot environments

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.290
and can survive temps of 80 °C (176 °F).

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.500
For most organisms, the bonds holding together
the proteins we are made of begin to denature

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.489
around 45°C, causing the proteins to lose
their shape and functionality.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.700
The Thermophilus aquaticus gets around this
by producing heat tolerant enzymes that increase

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.700
the number of bonds that hold the protein
together.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.430
At the other extreme, our planet can be frigid,
−89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) being the lowest

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.430
recorded temperature.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.430
Animals cope with winter in different ways.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.430
Where bears choose to sleep slowing their
heart rate to 10 beats per minute.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.430
While the tiny red-toothed shrew will shrink
their own heads, reducing their skull and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.430
brain mass by as much as 20 percent as a means
to conserve energy.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.780
How we survive is one thing - but what we
contribute to the planet is also significant.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.180
Though it may seem obvious to you that animals
like your cats and dogs have unique personalities,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.180
several scientists had long rejected the idea.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.180
Now there are confirmed surveys to measure
the unique personalities of chimps which are

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.180
a product of natural selection.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.180
All of this action occurs on the earth’s
crust which by volume only makes up 1% of

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.180
the earth.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.191
There’s a lot of life on our amazing pale
blue dot.
