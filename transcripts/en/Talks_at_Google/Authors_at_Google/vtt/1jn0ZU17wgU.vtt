JON ORWANT: Well, welcome,
everyone, to yet another

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.760
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.790
My name is Jon Orwant.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.150
I'm with Google Research.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.570
And I have the pleasure and the
honor today of introducing

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.300
someone who, in my opinion, is
one of the foremost writers of

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.200
our generation.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.270
I say foremost writer and not
foremost science fiction

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.700
writer or foremost hard science
fiction writer in part

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.890
because of a class I took about
15 or 20 years ago from

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.070
AI pioneer Marvin Minsky.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.130
The discussion kind of strayed
to modern literature, and he

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.250
talked about what it was
that he liked to read.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.500
And he said that when it came
to fiction, he only read

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.230
science fiction.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.650
He never read anything else.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.930
That was the only genre
that he read.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.330
And people would occasionally
call him on this and say,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.970
don't you feel like that
makes you narrow, only

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.600
reading this one genre?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.910
And his reply I remember to this
day, which was, no, I'm

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.320
not the one being narrow.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.690
You're the one being narrow.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.819
Because of all what you call
regular literature, that's

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.730
just about the seven
deadly sins.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.750
Science fiction is about
everything else.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.020
And I can't think of another
living writer who better

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.990
encompasses that notion of
science fiction being about

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.940
everything else than our guest
today, who has an unparalleled

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.650
ability to envision the
intersection of culture and

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.090
environment in a way that paints
a world in very high

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.370
resolution.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.820
Now, that said, his latest book,
"Shaman," is not really

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.690
science fiction.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.920
In fact, it's about the
seven deadly sins.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.490
It's a coming of age story
of a young man.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.000
And if I just stopped my
description there, I think

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.250
most science fiction aficionados
wouldn't want to

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.760
read the book.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.730
But then, you hear it's by a
science fiction author, and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.770
you think, OK, well, maybe it's
a coming of age story of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.040
someone on a distant
planet that's very

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.210
different from our planet.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.160
That would kind of be in
our author's style.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.330
Or maybe it's 300 years in the
future, like his latest book,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.490
the book before this one,
"2312." Or maybe it's about a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.800
coming of age story
of a robot.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.150
It's not any of those things.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.830
I think to some extent, it's
easy to write the typical

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.250
science fiction novel, because
if you're talking about a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030
distant planet or someplace
that's in the future, you can

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.530
make stuff up, right?

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.080
No one's going to be able
to call you on it.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.530
Instead, this book is about our
planet in the past, and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.490
it's not a Civil War romance.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.940
The past is 32,000 years ago
in the upper Paleolithic.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.670
It's the story of a Cro-Magnon,
and this is at a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.640
time when the Cro-Magnons were
living with Neanderthals.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.110
And the author really had to
do a whole lot of research,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.090
and I'm looking forward to
learning about the research

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.170
that he did to get this book,
because this book is going to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.820
be a hit, and it's going to be
pored over by archaeologists,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.720
by sociologists, by
anthropologists, by

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.600
historians, by linguists, to
figure out if he really got

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.360
everything right.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.540
Because I guarantee you after
you read this book, when you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.500
think about Cro-Magnons, the
images that are going to pop

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.370
into your head are going
to be the images

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.820
that are painted here.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.570
So our guest today has won a
Hugo Award, he's won a Nebula

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.450
award, he's won the John
Campbell Memorial Award, he's

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.740
won the Locus Award, he's won
the World Fantasy Award.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.200
Some of those awards
more than once.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.500
So please join me in giving
a very warm welcome to Kim

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.310
Stanley Robinson.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.206
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:39.628
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON:
Thank you.

00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:40.576
Thank you.

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:41.826
I'm going to use this.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.430
So thank you very much, Jon,
for that kind introduction.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.460
And I will say that this book,
Shaman, is one that I consider

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.610
to be science fiction, because
without the science of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.650
archaeology, we wouldn't know
what I'm writing about here.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.940
So I'm going to read two brief
passages, and these are

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.240
specifically chosen
for Google.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.970
This is my fifth time at Google,
and the first time

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.780
that I've come to read
you all a book.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.490
Before that, it's been
different kinds of

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.180
conferences.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.839
And so this, actually, for me,
is kind of fun to finally get

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.380
to read to this crowd.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.660
And these are the two Google
Earth passages from this book.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.900
The first one should only last
about five minutes, and the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.340
second one also about
five minutes.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.400
And then I want to hear
questions, and I'll talk more

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.410
about the process of
doing this book.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.120
So OK, here's the
first passage.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.790
And this is, you have to
imagine, essentially, kind of

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.170
a Burning Man Festival
30,000 years ago.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.650
Central Europe.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.320
Summer day.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.040
In fact, the 8/8 Festival, which
would be August 8th.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.760
On the morning of the last day,
he and Elga and Lucky

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.260
went to the broad, sandy bank
of the meadow's river, where

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.930
there was a group of men in the
sun busy at work on their

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.670
bird's eye views.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.320
As always, it was mostly an old
man's game, and the more

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.280
they had wandered in their
lives, the better they were at

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.720
it, and the more interested.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.670
It was a traveler's game.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.420
Now, a lot of old men and a
few old women-- maybe two

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.620
score in all-- were strolling
about watching those who were

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.570
actively making views.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.220
The makers crouched and tiptoed
about on the edges of

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.120
their patches, stretching far
out to smooth and shape the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.380
sand to what they thought some
part of the world would look

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.780
like from the sky if shrunk to
the size of their patch.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.450
The areas they portrayed were
sometimes big, extending from

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.420
the festival grounds and the
caribou steppe to the

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.550
mountains to the south and the
great salt sea to the west.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.720
Others portrayed
smaller areas.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.000
There were distinct styles,
which Loon thought were

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.080
something like the way wall
paintings were either three

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.740
liners or fully detailed.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.160
Some views were made simply of
wet sand molded into the

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.270
shapes of the land by hand and
stick, so that one saw them

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.580
stripped flesh of the
land, so to speak.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.840
Others used moss for meadows,
twigs for trees, pebbles

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.580
shoved into the sand to look
like the gleam of water seen

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.110
from on high, even some little
toy animals in shelters and

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.010
people taken from kids'
camp games.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.920
Someone had even packed down
snow to represent the ice caps

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.280
on the central highlands.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.390
And in one old woman's view,
even the great ice wall of the

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.730
north, here ankle high.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.195
It was funny to see these little
worlds as if one were

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:21.670
an eagle at the highest point
of its gyre, and some of the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.510
decorative views were
quite beautiful.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.440
But what the makers mostly
discussed was how

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.900
accurate they were.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.450
Long sticks were used to
point out features.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.180
Traveling stories were related
with lots of argument about

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.850
what a day's walk meant in terms
of a stretch of land.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.500
This last argument was
impossible to resolve, both in

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.080
principle and in relation to the
shrinking they had done to

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.870
reduce a big part of the earth
to three strides on a side.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.600
But it obviously gave many of
them immense pleasure to

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.230
discuss it at length with sand
hills and canyons to point to.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.150
"I was in this valley you
mark as shallow, but

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.080
it's deeper than that.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.020
I passed through its 12 month,
and the sun never came out

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.570
over the southern ridge,
so you need to have it

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.260
deeper." "Maybe so.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.060
Here, I'll scoop it down
a bit." And so on.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.040
At the end of the session, they
would all declare their

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.740
favorites, and a Best of Day
would be declared, and the

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.295
winner given a bucket of mash
and a chance to brag for a

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:09.240
fist or two.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.020
And then they would all stand
around the edges of the view,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.700
observers and maker both, and
leap out onto the little

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.490
worlds and trample them to a
chaos of torn sand worse than

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.660
the mud at a caribou ford.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.910
Gods destroying worlds, and
while it lasted, it was the

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.220
best dance of all.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.480
They shouted and laughed as
they leaped and kicked.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.775
It felt glorious.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.670
So we can discuss this later,
but I want to point out to you

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.930
that the Ohlone Native
Americans--

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.390
the Ohlone that lived in
this very Bay Area--

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.150
did this very thing for European
visitors who first

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.090
came to the Bay Area.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.540
So although it's speculation on
my part, I'm sure that this

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.120
actually was happening
back in that time.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.290
Now, here, again, the last piece
that I'll read for you

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.260
today is about the
same like that.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.350
It's another--

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.380
well, it's a traveler's tale.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.070
You have to imagine a
night by the fire.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.700
Just an ordinary night
by the fire, but a

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.950
traveler has come by.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.450
I am a traveller, as you know.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.210
I walk the surface of Mother
Earth, and so do my fellow

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.550
travelers, each of us
on his own path.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.120
And some of us repeat our paths
as long as we can find

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.210
them, and nothing makes us
take a different way.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.860
I'm one of those myself, having
a wife with my brother,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.590
and he goes out when I'm at
home, and he doesn't like it

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.289
when I'm overly late, although
both of us have been delayed

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.340
once or twice through
the years.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.159
What this means for me is I go
out east to the gate between

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.130
worlds, and then turn north
and walk for a fortnight,

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.170
right up to the edge of the
great ice cap, and come back

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.370
just under that great white
wall, or sometimes up on the

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.790
ice itself, if the summer melt
has made the land next to the

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.560
ice impassable.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.400
West I return, and south across
the steppes to home,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.640
using paths of my own
that no one knows--

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.320
the best ways of all.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.720
That's the way it is for me,
but in my travels, I meet

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.090
other men out walking in the
world, and some of them have

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.760
neither circuit nor home, but
wander always a new way.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.890
These men are curious people,
odd in their ways and speech,

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.720
but interesting for
that, and we talk.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.010
Always when travelers get
together over a fire, we talk.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.030
You can see that right
now, I know.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.880
And travelers together
talk about traveling.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.170
Where have you been?

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.560
What have you seen?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.830
What are the people like?

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.340
What's out there on this
world we live on?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.330
These are the questions we ask
and the stories we tell, and

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.400
some travelers travel to find
the answers and tell new

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.260
stories to those they meet.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.960
One such I met this summer at
the farthest east of all the

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.980
places I go.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.510
This man looked like the
Northers, and I could barely

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.270
understand him, but I could.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.650
And it got easier as we talked,
because he had only

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.430
one thing to talk about, which
was this world we live on--

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.520
its shape and size.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.510
All travelers agree, for we've
seen it ourselves.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.000
There is ice to the north
wherever you go, and to the

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.850
West is the great salt sea.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.320
And to the south, again, the
salt sea, although warmer and

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.530
more calm--

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.940
more in and out, and dotted
with islands.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.410
We all agree on this, we
travelers, as between us,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.300
we've seen it all, and some
travelers claim to have seen

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.810
it all themselves alone.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.430
Good.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.200
Maybe they are even
telling the truth.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.120
I can't say.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.435
But here's the thing.

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:22.180
What about east?

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.000
This northern man was
like a lot of us.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.090
He had that question.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.700
And more than that, he wanted
to know the answer,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.980
and no one had it.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.450
So he took off walking
east, he said.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.370
He walked for days, he
walked for months,

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.380
he walked for years.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.680
He walked east from the time
this question had come to him

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.860
in his youth, and kept on
walking until he was a man in

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.440
the middle of life.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.940
17 years, he said,
he walked east.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.650
I asked him what he had seen
on this life walk.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.110
He told me of steppes that
went on forever.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.710
There were mountains like those
to the west of here, and

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.760
some lakes bigger than
any I've seen.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.110
Little salt seas, even.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.970
Their water was salt, he said.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.590
But mostly, it was steppes.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.160
You know what that's like.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.660
The walking is good if it isn't
too wet, and there are

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.500
always animals to eat.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.930
So there really was no
impediment to him.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.140
Yet there he sat, across a fire
from me, as far to the

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.010
east as I had ever been.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.420
But it was only the gate of
worlds, a nice, broad pass

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.750
between low mountains
to north and south.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.310
It had taken him 12 years to
walk back to where we were.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.960
This he told me.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.600
Finally, I had to ask him.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.280
Why did you come back?

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.030
Having gone so far,
why turn around?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.460
Why not keep going for the
rest of your life?

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.390
He stared into the fire for a
long, long time before he met

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.890
my eye and answered me.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.530
"When I was as far east as I
got," he said, "I came to a

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.510
hill and went up it to look.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.040
I was feeling poorly, and my
feet hurt, and no person I had

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.486
met for several years spoke
any word I understood.

00:11:53.486 --> 00:11:56.264
All my dealings were
done by sign.

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:59.460
You can do that and still get
by, but after a while, you

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.690
want a word with the people you
see." I Pippi could only

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.030
agree to that.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.690
And so, he said, he stood on
that hill, and all to the east

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.040
was just the same.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.670
There was no sign at all
it would ever change.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.710
"I realized," he said, "that
this world is just too big.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.150
You can't have it all, no matter
how much you want it.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.930
It's bigger than any man
can walk in one life.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.930
Possibly it just keeps
going on forever.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.650
Possibly our Mother Earth is
round," he said then, "like a

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.730
pregnant woman or the moon, and
if you walk long enough,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.150
you would come around to where
you started, assuming the

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.860
great salt sea did
not stop you.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.940
But really, there is no
way to know for sure.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.400
And so I turned back," he said,
"because the world is

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.410
too big, and most of all, I
wanted to talk to somebody

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.650
again before I died."

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.060
Having said that, having told
his tale, we stood and hugged,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.480
and he cried so hard I thought
he would choke.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.340
I had to hold him up.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.930
Whether he had succeeded or
failed in his life walk, he

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.060
did not know, and
I didn't either.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.080
After that, he calmed down,
and we looked at the fire

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.740
until long in the night, telling
other stories we knew.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.840
And before bed, I asked him,
"So what's for you now?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.380
What will you do, now
that you're back?"

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.230
"Well," he said, "to tell the
truth, I'm thinking I may take

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.750
off east

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.370
again." Thank you.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:27.110
Google Earth, 30,000 BC,
or before present.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:34.260
And those are only the most
momentarily relevant of the

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.270
speculative passages in this
book as to trying to think out

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.080
how the people of that time knew
their worlds, given the

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.230
limited ability that they had
to comprehend what they were

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.220
up to, and the limited ability
they had to pass on what they

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.260
learned, because there
was no writing.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.630
This was the crucial thing.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:14:00.480
This is human beings, the same
DNA as us, very accomplished.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.630
The only DNA differences that
a lot of us have lactose

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.440
tolerance, and none
of them did.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.870
Otherwise, they're us.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.880
But they didn't have writing,
and writing is very much of a

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.310
consciousness changing
technology.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.460
Very much so.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.460
Maybe even more than the
internet, which is another

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.990
possibly major consciousness
changing activity.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.620
We don't know yet.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.770
So I had to get into the world
of the pre-literate, the oral

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.420
mind, where there must
be, I don't know, 30

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.510
poems in the book.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.360
But they're not poetry in the
modern sense, but rather just

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.320
information.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.910
There's also probably 100
proverbs in the book--

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.710
another way that people could
hold on to what had been

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.070
learned and pass it along.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.715
It was an ear culture, and
it was about remembering.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.500
And it's about the cave
paintings, especially the

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.460
Chauvet cave.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.620
Those of you who have had the
joy of seeing Werner Herzog's

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.440
most recent film, "The Cave of
Forgotten Dreams," you have

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.520
already seen the visual
illustration of this book of

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.760
mine, because I wrote
about the people who

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.890
painted that cave.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.650
And that's why it's 32,000 years
ago, because that's when

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.900
that cave was painted.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:22.700
And I think that's all I want to
tell you right here at the

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.860
start, before I get some
questions to direct me into

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.530
talking about other
parts of it.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.430
And I can go on without them,
but I would love to have

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.540
questions to direct me
to areas of interest.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:42.260
AUDIENCE: So you found the
setting from the caves.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.490
How did you settle on--

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.690
you can tell this is a question

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.690
from an author wannabe--

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.290
on the arc?

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.860
What was going to happen?

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.670
Did you sort of just start off
and let it happen, decide when

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.310
it was done, or did you know
where you were going?

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.190
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON:
Well, that's a good

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.580
question for everybody.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.790
The other stimulus for me in the
writing of this book was

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:07.190
the discovery of the Iceman
between Austria and Italy in

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.590
1991, who had been frozen
in the glacier

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.970
with all of his gear.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.230
And his gear was remarkably
similar to the backpacking

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:18.600
gear that I take when I go up in
the Sierras, and it proved

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.140
that they were a high
tech culture.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.970
His gear was magnificent, and
came from about 60 different

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.250
sources in a wide region.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.650
It took a full culture to make
the gear that this guy had.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.270
And so I'd thought, well,
let's look into the

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.660
archaeology and find out a
storyline that would not be

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.710
just a wanderer like the Iceman
or like the traveler

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.520
that tells his tale, but would
allow me to get to the heart

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.210
of their culture.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.610
And the things I was interested
in was how did

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.530
science begin in its
true beginnings,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.190
and how did art begin?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.310
And it turns out that at that
time, really, these were not

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.490
identical efforts.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.940
They never have been.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:06.740
But the herb women, who were
essentially doing medicine,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.859
they were really the
first scientists.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.760
Trial and error, take something,
see what effect it

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.480
has on you.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.180
It was very rough and ready,
because they didn't have much

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.569
in the way of ability to
differentiate the effects from

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.060
the causes.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.700
But nevertheless, that was the
first science, really.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.810
And then the first art seems
to be associated with these

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.440
caves and with the shamanistic
religion.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.670
That's one of two competing
theories as to what those cave

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.420
paintings are about, and they
sort of supersede the first

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.510
guess that it was
hunting magic.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.870
The hunting magic theory
has gone away.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.670
And what it's been replaced by
is that it was a shamanistic

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.000
religion, or it was
teenagers--

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.240
probably teenage boys-- screwing
around and doing

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.580
graffiti on a dare, scaring
themselves and doing

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.350
pornography and graffiti.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.110
And the paintings--

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.240
there's a lot of incompetence
and beginner cave art that

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.110
doesn't get reproduced in the
art books and the Herzog film.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.690
So I think both theories are
possibly true, and are not in

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.220
competition with each other.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:18.940
But the absolute expertise of
the big, good paintings that

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.180
you see, and the fact that in

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.660
Lascaux, they're the ceilings--

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.390
and as Gary Schneider put it,
there needed to be an arts

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.970
administration in the
Paleolithic to get the

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.460
scaffolding together to get the
artists that high on the

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.190
ceiling suggests that we're
really in something quite

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.040
professional here.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.340
So by telling the story of a
shaman, I could tell the story

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.830
of the whole culture.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.730
And if he was associated with
an herb woman, and they did

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.800
medicine together, so that you
had the mind-body effect, and

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.930
that you could talk
about both.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.720
And since all these
relationships were being

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.700
passed along master to
apprentice, then if I had an

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.580
apprentice, then I would have
essentially a portrait of the

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.390
artist as a young man.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.640
I would have the bildungsroman,
a classic form,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.670
a young man.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.230
And maybe he's good at some
parts of it, but not good at

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.700
other parts of it so that maybe
he likes the painting,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.980
but has a poor memory,
especially for poetry, which I

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.970
myself have a terrible
memory for poetry.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.760
I could relate to that.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.710
So slowly but surely, by the
desire to show the whole

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.310
culture, a character
begins to develop.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.420
Some relationships
begin to develop.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.020
And then you do need a plot.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.050
I mean, I think novels
are about daily life.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.080
They're about how did people
live back then?

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.670
But if it only was that, it
would become anthropology.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.010
And you need to a plot where
essentially, daily life gets

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.190
broken, and something
else happens.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.060
Well, I didn't want to impose
anything particularly modern.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.720
I didn't want to say--

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.070
although this is not
a bad idea--

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.430
have a murder mystery that
the shaman had to solve.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.940
I mean, this would be the
typical imposition.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.100
We have medieval monk
detectives, we have Roman

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.370
detectives, I could have had
a Paleolithic detective.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.610
I'm glad I didn't go that way.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:14.360
But if you have different kinds
of culture, many of the

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.840
oldest stories that we have
out of the prehistoric

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.840
literature have to do with
intratribal conflicts,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.900
including people kidnapped
and stolen from

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.160
one tribe by another.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.700
And at that point,
you've got an

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.620
extremely intense situation.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.000
More intense, even, than the
murder mystery, which is kind

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.580
of NCI forensic, and I can't
tell you how sick

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.530
I am of that scenario.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.660
So that was how I went about
the building of it.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:47.010
It sounds fairly Tinker
Toy or Erector Set.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.340
It sounds fairly rational,
and it is.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.120
But at a certain point, what
one would hope is that it

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.990
begins to take over, and it
begins to come to life.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.240
And it's essentially kind
of Calvin and Hobbes.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.170
At some point, Hobbes had better
wake up and start doing

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.510
his part of things.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.584
And at that point, you've got
a book on your hands.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.740
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
Ohlone as a culture that

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.880
inspired the book.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.080
What other cultures did you look
at for inspiration on how

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.220
people would relate to each
other and what their beliefs

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.760
may be and stuff like that?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.130
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: Well, I
looked at almost all of what

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.370
we used to call Stone Age
cultures that were still

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.610
functioning when we got there,
but especially the Australian

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.920
Aborigines, the Inuit, and the
Athapaskans, because I was in

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.050
an ice scenario, and I wanted
to go north into the polar

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.280
regions and see how people
lived there.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.330
So the Athapaskans of Alaska
were really important, partly

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.270
because they had such a
good anthropologist

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.940
visit them early on.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.560
And so the information
was really rich.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.010
Then also, everybody has to look
at the Bush people or the

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:01.300
Kung, because they were such
a high functioning and so

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.360
suggestive.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.430
They were so well studied,
and still out there.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.480
And those were the main.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.940
And then all North
American tribes--

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.990
like, I would just get
anthologies of Native American

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.630
poetry and proverbs.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:20.380
But I would say, really, the
Athapaskans, the Inuit, and

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.840
the Aborigines were probably
the three main.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.490
And so you understand that I'm
doing all this by analogy

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.890
backwards, and I'm saying that
these are cultures that were

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.050
basically studied in the 19th
century, and it isn't clear

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.800
that they weren't disturbed by
modernity before they were

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.590
studied, or that the

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.420
anthropologists got things wrong.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.010
What I'm assuming is that if
it looks like people were

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.470
doing it 10,000 years ago, that
they were doing it 30,000

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.520
years ago-- that there was
that kind of continuity.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:54.930
So this is something that no
self respecting archaeologists

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.700
can make these kind of
speculative leaps.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.750
And in fact, it's really against
the rules now in the

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.730
hardcore archaeology, to the
point where they don't like

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.100
this shaman interpretation
of the cave paintings.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.060
They're saying, this
is such a guess.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.550
We can't possibly know.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.610
Let's just concentrate
on what we can know.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.290
And of course, that really
cuts a lot of stuff out.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.660
But when you're doing a
novel, you don't have

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.690
to worry about that.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:21.580
AUDIENCE: So how did you decide,
in my world, 30,000

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.970
years ago, they were
not doing that yet?

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.620
How did you decide?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.990
Was it driven by the story, or
driven by your belief in

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.590
what's likely to
have happened?

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.070
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: It was
driven first by what did I

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.000
think was happening, and guided
by archaeologists.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.350
They don't have bow and
arrows in this book.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.320
I mean, that's part of what the
archaeologists say, that

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.170
bow and arrows are relatively
recent-- maybe

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.200
6,000 or 7,000 years.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.230
Happily, as Jon pointed out,
the Neanderthal were there

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.370
32,000 years ago.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.220
That's pretty solid.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.230
And they were domesticating
wolves into dogs around that

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.990
time, which we used to say was
15,000 years ago, and now the

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.910
genetic evidence pushed
it back to more

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.170
like 40,000, or 30,000.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.780
It was, in other words,
right in my time.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.980
And so they had spear throwers,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.360
but not bow and arrow.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.650
And what I was saying is they
for sure had snowshoes,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.330
although everything that they
made out of leather or straw

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.630
or even wood has rotted
away in 30,000 years.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:31.070
We got nothing but stone, bone,
ivory, tooth, and shell,

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.420
and the cave paintings.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.640
So our evidence for 30,000
years ago is so slight.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.060
In other words, I tried to be
only as conservative as would

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.870
keep an archaeologist from
being completely

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.150
tossed out of the book.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.260
But other than that, saying,
like, did suspect that the

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.000
Earth was round?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.820
Did they know about the
Mediterranean, the Atlantic,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.560
and the ice cap?

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.160
How geographically centered
where they were--

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.230
nobody can say no to me, but
it's a matter of speculation,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.150
because we have no evidence
whatsoever.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.160
We do know that there are
cultures that have some

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.870
objects they come from over
1,000 miles away.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.600
But whether they got traded
five miles at a time, or

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.110
whether there were people
doing it the whole

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.320
way, nobody can say.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.080
It's a nice open slate
in that regard.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.210
AUDIENCE: When doing your
research, what were some

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.490
things that were kind of
concrete that surprised you

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.150
that you learned?

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:36.520
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: Well, we
see evidence that although

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.270
they were preliterate, they were
beginning to keep records

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.920
and mark things.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.570
So that did surprise me.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.850
A journalist who got interested
named Marshack sort

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.380
of made himself into an
archaeologist just by writing

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.700
was supposed to be a popular
science book, but he found all

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.450
the evidence in the literature
and in the record that people

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.820
were marking bones, and every
28 or 29 days, there was an

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.700
extra loop.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.850
So it looked like they were
mark in the months.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.890
And the months, of course,
are marked by the moon.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.490
So there's no need to know
where you are in a month,

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.280
because the moon is telling you
in the sky every night.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.160
It's like a giant clock.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.330
But the discrepancy between the
solar year and the lunar

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:26.480
year is irreconcilable by
direct observation.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.930
You can get pretty good,
but not very good.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.150
And so it looks like people
were trying to figure out,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.440
here we got these
lunar months.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.350
So convenient.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.710
Big clock in the sky.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.640
But then the sun going
to the solstices--

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.465
the equinox and the solstices
again-- are offset.

00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:42.950
Well, what's with that?

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.890
And it looks like people at
least 40,000 years ago were

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.640
trying to keep track so that
they might be able to

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.210
reconcile it.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.400
I thought that was beautiful.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.850
It's kind of a Stonehenge
thing.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.220
It's kind of a computer thing.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.390
And the evidence is there
to make that case.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.700
Also, the Iceman had tattoos.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.920
That cracked me up.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.990
JON ORWANT: So I had the good
fortune to have an advance

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.100
copy of your book.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.740
And in that book, there
was no preface.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.740
There was no forward.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.600
I don't know if that's the
case in the actual book

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:18.720
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.726
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: No,
no, none of that.

00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:21.570
Terrible idea.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.320
JON ORWANT: And so, I mean,
one of the things that I

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.530
enjoyed as a result of that kind
of lack of context, just

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:31.390
being kind of thrust into the
story, is I was, in a sense,

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:32.670
reading two stories, right?

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.280
There was the arc of the story
that you told, but there was

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.470
also this meta mystery to me of
trying to figure out when

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.280
this was taking place and where
this was taking place.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.770
And there was a particular point
at which you have the

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.590
main character refer to a
particular river, right?

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:56.060
And I then Googled that, and
Google spell corrected it into

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.440
the actual name of
the river today.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.970
And so then I basically from
1/3 of the book on, I was

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.600
reading the book with Wikipedia
on the side, slowly

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:12.690
piecing things together, and
eventually ending up feeling

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.040
like I had this euphoric moment
where I had cracked the

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.830
mystery of where this
was taking place

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.140
and what was happening.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.450
Was that intentional?

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.230
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON:
I like that.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.150
That's what I think should
happen in the reading process.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.955
And I put in clues.

00:28:28.955 --> 00:28:34.040
There's a stone arch across the
river in my local people.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.630
It's very prominent right
next to their camp.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.800
They live in loop meadow,
which is an oxbow

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.130
that's dried out.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.910
And the oxbow dried out because
the river cut through

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.540
a bit of that limestone cliff
and left an arch.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.230
Well, for early peoples, that
arch-- they call it the Stone

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.625
Bison in my book, because it
kind of looks like a bison

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:54.360
straddling the river.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.230
A very extraordinary feature
that is at Vallon-Pont-D'Arc,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.520
a famous little tourist spot
in the Ardeche in France.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.720
And also, these words
are so ancient.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.300
Basque is an ancient language.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.510
Proto Indo-European is
an ancient language.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.940
Because of the translation stuff
you can find online now,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:21.020
I was able to use those things
and leave clues like that.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.920
And I would have hated a preface
or the jacket copy or

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.210
the notorious trolls, which is
really the nicest thing I can

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.860
say about them at
Kirkus Reviews.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:35.060
There's a book review service
called Kirkus, which prides

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.376
itself on its malevolence.

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:41.080
And I won't say anything
nastier, but the review of

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.720
"Shaman" was suggesting that
there be maps and a glossary

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.790
and a bibliography
and all this.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:51.410
But this was clearly someone
passive aggressively or flat

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:56.040
out aggressively trying to
attack its reality as a novel.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.730
And so luckily, I'm being
published by a wonderful

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.250
editor at a wonderful publisher,
and they're

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.010
completely on board with
doing it my way.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:12.000
And I love it that you can
find out where this all

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.240
without having the outside
information.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.280
AUDIENCE: For this book and for
the Mars books, you needed

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.910
to do a lot of research
and fill in details.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.300
And then in one case, you're
working forward and other one

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.450
working backwards.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.450
How was that different?

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.830
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: They're
remarkably similar.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:39.990
And the interesting thing is
that the Mars literature in

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:44.140
English, if gathered and put on
a bookshelf, I can tell you

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.660
for a fact-- when I was writing
the book, anyway,

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.860
which is really the late
'80s, early '90s--

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.550
is about two bookshelves'
worth of material.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:56.040
Now, the literature about the
Paleolithic is somewhat

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.280
bigger, but not stupendously
bigger.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.670
It's about four bookshelves
worth of books.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.260
And so I also had that
library on hand.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.890
And I would contrast this.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.090
Antarctica, maybe just one
bookshelf worth of material

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.480
for my Antarctic novel.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.470
And then "The Years of Rice and
Salt," where I did this

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.990
alternative history where all
the Europeans died in the

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:20.030
Black Death and then the world
went on for 700 years

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:26.900
differently with the Europeans
gone, that was 25 years of

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.790
gathering books.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:31.320
And that, essentially,
was infinite.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.720
There was no end to the amount
of books I could read to try

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.500
to figure out what world history
would have been like

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.920
without the Europeans.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.085
And it was kind of carte blanche
when I went into a

00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:41.300
used bookstore.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.440
Oh, you mean the Chinese went
to Africa on these gigantic

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.580
sailing ships in the
14th century?

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.170
Great, I'll buy that.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.490
And that, indeed, turned
out to be crucial.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.250
Other things turned out to
be completely irrelevant.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.580
But I had two or three bookcases
of books assembled

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.070
for "The Years of Rice and
Salt," and I essentially

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.210
crashed my system.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.690
My brain broke.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.650
It was like a drop in
the ocean to do

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:08.800
research for that one.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.330
So the other ones have felt
much more manageable--

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.850
much more like you have a secure
topic, you can give

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.570
yourself a little graduate
degree type education very

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.500
quickly, and the more you do it,
the better you get at it,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.660
because you have the context,
the tools, the

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.990
ability to rip a book.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.460
And sometimes I felt like I
could touch the spine of a

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:35.310
book and immediately know its
entire contents by telepathy,

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.010
when I was hungry enough.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.650
So prehistory and Mars--

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:46.580
the cool thing about it is that
we do have a lot of the

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.110
culture of the Paleolithic
because of those paintings,

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.670
and because of the decoration,
and because archaeology has

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.890
given us more.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.900
Mars was more speculative,
and I had to make

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.140
up more things myself.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.560
And no one person should have
to make up a culture.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.110
That's why science fiction
cultures always look so thin.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.460
It's a group effort-- a
civilizational effort to make

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.060
up a culture.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.980
And so when one person tries to
imitate it, you have to try

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.070
to suggest that there's much
more than the things that

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.110
you're telling by a kind
of stage magic trick.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.290
And I perfected that,
but it's hard.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:24.480
And it's not as fun as having a
whole culture giving you all

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.090
of its good stuff, which I knew
that for sure when I went

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.810
to Antarctica.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.340
I went to Antarctica, and
there's this hilarious culture

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.780
down there that I didn't have to
invent that was just giving

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.465
itself to me.

00:33:34.465 --> 00:33:36.590
It was wonderful.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.850
AUDIENCE: I want to go
back to the Minsky

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.440
topic and science fiction.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.170
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: Sure.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.490
AUDIENCE: And the reason I'm
going to do this is because I

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.040
have a very good friend of mine,
she just published her

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.310
first novel.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.460
She's very young.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.770
She's for flirting already with
science, with Rosalind

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.120
Franklin and DNA.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.330
But I feel that she may feel
like science fiction, like a

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.070
lot of people feel--

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.930
I mean, she wouldn't
be the only one--

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:08.870
that science fiction sort of
boxes you in and you're a

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.980
science fiction writer, and then
you have an audience like

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.360
here, where there's maybe one
woman in the audience.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.850
And what do you have to say to
budding writers who may be

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:26.330
afraid of going into science
fiction because of these

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.550
reasons, and maybe expand
on that Minsky story?

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.266
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: Well,
thank you for that question.

00:34:33.266 --> 00:34:37.010
I think that science fiction
is the realism of our time,

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:41.320
and yet there are many dedicated
readers who will

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.820
never read it, because they
don't think they like or

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.110
understand science fiction.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.860
If I had a blackboard here--
and thank God I don't--

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.750
I would say that all the genres
have the potential for

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:55.949
great literature and great
stories, but a timeline will

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.710
describe what's going on.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:02.030
Say that you've got the
beginning of writing.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.840
So that's, say, 3,000
BC 2,000 BC.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.150
And a line goes right
up to the present.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:13.980
So everything on that line is a
genre that can be divided up

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.380
between what we would call
mainstream, or the literature

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.660
of now, which is within,
say, 30, 40 years

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.320
of the present moment.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.460
And then before that, it's
historical fiction, which has

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.510
a big spread, but not
an infinite spread.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.620
It's only just the 3,000 years
of literate history, and

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.760
that's historical fiction.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.870
Great genre.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.960
Now, science fiction is always
about the history that we

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.110
cannot know.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.730
So it's the future, which
we never can know.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.330
So it's like, at that point, it
gets to be a spread, like a

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.140
weather scenario spread, where
the future can go in many

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.220
different directions.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.050
Then alternative history, if you
postulate that something

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.680
different happened in the past
and goes off to the side, we

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.320
can never know what that would
be, and so that's another

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.490
unknown history.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.340
And then before history began,
human beings were doing their

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.100
thing for these 30,
40,000 years.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.620
Prehistorical literature.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.360
But we can't really know it,
because it's not written down,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.710
and we're working by inference
as I did here.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.700
So science fiction is the
history that we can't now, and

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.950
that's why alternative histories
and even prehistoric

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.100
fiction are very often
filed in the

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.180
science fiction section.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.870
That's the logical underpinning
of the genre.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.740
And then fantasy isn't on the
timeline at all, especially

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.720
Tolkien fantasy.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.780
It has a different history
of its own.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.210
It's in a bubble of its own.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.920
And as soon as you have my
schema, then you can say,

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.160
well, dang, I'm going to put a
fantasy novel right into the

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.890
historical timeline, and
Coleridge going to run into a

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.610
bunch of magicians with real
magic, and that's historical

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.500
fantasy, Tim Powers.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.630
Then someone says, well, I'm
going to say that in the

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.530
sewers of New York right
now, there's

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.490
magicians running around.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.730
That's urban fantasy.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.750
A lot of that.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.280
And so you can see
that this schema

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.550
begins to swap the genres.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.590
But this gets to the next
part of your question.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:01.620
As a young writer, or as a
reader, what do you do?

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.010
You're going to get pigeonholed

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.140
by your first success.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.330
The marketers and the publisher
and the bookstores

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.280
are going to want to
put you somewhere.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.300
So it's an open question where
you want to be put.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.220
Where you're going to get the
most readers, or the most

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.330
leaders that are going to
appreciate what you're doing,

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.040
which is not the same thing.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.600
And also kept the most
latitude to do

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.190
everything that you want.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.540
These are complicated
questions.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.580
It's really more than
I can go into here.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.370
But I'm reading now the novels
about Henry VIII by Hilary

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.990
Mantel, so that's historical
fiction.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.180
And a decade ago, I was reading
Patrick O'Brian's

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.150
novels about the Napoleonic
naval war--

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.900
the Aubrey Maturin novels,
they're called.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.630
That's also historical
fiction.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.480
These are beautiful novels.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.080
What's happened is that in
modernism, domestic realism

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.930
was the only real thing.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.700
Everything else was a despised
paraliterature.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.420
So if you did even historical
fiction, you were doing this

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.150
second rate crap, and science
fiction, even worse.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.980
Might as well have
been comic books.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.800
Well, in postmodernism, there's
no condescension.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.010
There's no position of
superiority left.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.350
Anything can be great if you
do it, including graphic

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:19.260
novels, comic books, movies,
superhero novels, I mean,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.490
anything could possibly
be great.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:25.500
And in fact, we often see great
work in all the genres,

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.390
now that this bad moment of
cultural snobbery is over.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.500
But there's a residual.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.670
There's still residual
snobbery.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.300
And snobbery comes out
of insecurity.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.030
It's people thinking, I need
to feel I'm superior to

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.310
others, because secretly
I feel like

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.750
maybe I've got a problem.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.160
Got to get over it.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.580
The New York Times, they've
got to get over it.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.730
The whole New York literary
establishment, they

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:49.740
got to get over it.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.920
This feeling that, oh my god,
unless I'm a snob, I can't

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.140
prove that I'm good
is a terrible,

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.560
crippling, stupid response.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.520
AUDIENCE: So you talk a little
bit about your creative

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.250
process in terms of research.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.740
I was curious about the actual
act of sitting down and

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.960
writing in your day to day.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.450
So if you could elaborate a
little bit about how that

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.800
works for you, how you get
your books written.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.140
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: Well,
I must tell you, I've been

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.000
writing, and I've been writing
full time, not counting--

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.730
well, it really means always
part time, because of being

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.490
Mr. Mom and bringing
up my kids.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.910
But I've been writing
a lot, let's put it

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.740
that way, for 40 years.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.780
And about 10 years ago,
I was burning out.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.190
I was thinking, you know,
I'm tired of.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:37.200
This I can't stand to sit
down and write anymore.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.140
But what I discovered by some
experimentation that what I

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.780
was tired was sitting
indoors on my butt

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.640
in front of a screen.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.150
And I moved my operation
outdoors into my front

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.490
courtyard under a tree so
I can see the laptop

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.860
screen in the shade.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.410
And now, being up in Davis,
it's somewhat like here.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.390
We're really in the northern
end or the back end of a

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:00.670
Mediterranean climate.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.100
I do it every day of the year.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.540
I write outside.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.640
If it rains, I put a tarp
overhead, and the rain

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.390
falls around me.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.710
It's like a bead curtain.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.330
It's kind of great, because
I'm still writing.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.830
If it's hot, I have a fan,
I have a mister.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.485
The heat is by far the worst.

00:40:15.485 --> 00:40:18.420
If it's cold, I gear up in my
snow camping gear and feel

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.720
like I'm on a little
adventure.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.770
I've got a down hood on and
gloves, and I'm thinking, man,

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.280
I'm not just writing anymore.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.700
I'm having a little adventure.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.670
And it has rejuvenated me, and
I will point to "Galileo's

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:35.370
Dream, "2312," and "Shaman" as
the three books that have been

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:39.156
done entirely outdoors
using this method.

00:40:39.156 --> 00:40:41.000
And I think I'm on
a hot streak.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.980
And it's not coincidental.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.580
It has to do with feeling like
it's fun again, the actual

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.920
physical act of writing.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.340
Because as you know, everybody
who does the kind of work we

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.740
do, it's labor intensive.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.800
It's time intensive.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.510
You end up spending I would
reckon maybe five hours per

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.020
page, 500 pages.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.830
I don't even want to do
the math on that.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:03.730
So that's what I do.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:07.720
And when I write first drafts,
I can only go a half a day.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.570
When I'm revising, I can
go all day and more.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.110
And the last thing is, I decided
recently that I would

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.440
write every day of the week.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.360
I used to do it like
I call it, it

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.680
would be like carpentry.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.100
There's nothing mystical
about it.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.210
I'd work Monday through Friday,
take the weekend off

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.230
with my family, and get back
to it Monday morning.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.180
A few years ago, I decided to
work on Saturdays and Sundays,

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.660
and you have 7/5 more time, and
you never lose your train

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.620
of thought.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.070
And you can get on streaks--

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.720
sort of a Cal Ripken streak,
where it'll be a Sunday, and I

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.860
won't have written, and it's
like Sunday bedtime, and I

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.660
think, oh my god.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.360
I can't break my streak.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.190
So I have what I call the
Cal Ripken moment,

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.890
and I write 20 minutes.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.350
And so I've written that day.

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:49.240
And sometimes it's a very
good 20 minutes of work.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.740
And then I just put
it aside and then

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.100
I'm still on my streak.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.510
I've had streaks of
260 days in a row.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.300
And right through Christmas day,
right thought anything

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.740
that might possibly disturb
it, I've written though.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.090
So that's my method now.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.280
And it hasn't always been that
way, but it is now, and it's

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.540
making me happy.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.750
My wife thinks I've
gone crazy.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.270
She takes pictures of me
out in the rain and

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.810
laughs her head off.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:17.450
But she can see that
I'm happier, that

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.570
I'm on a streak here.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:22.460
And I thought I was near the
end of my run, but I think

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.220
I'll do a few to several more
novels, and then I'll write my

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.840
Sierra Nevada book, and that
will be my retirement project.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.450
And I'll change again.

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:34.110
AUDIENCE: So you say, basically,
a lot of research

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:42.070
went into "Rice and Salt," and
the Middle Eastern part of

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.480
that culture kind of rather--

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.880
not exactly, but in a rather
deep way, I can confirm that

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.230
you really did a
good job there.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.510
I cannot say much about the
Chinese or the Native American

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.650
parts, but that was
really something.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:59.590
But you said that got you kind
of exhausted, and then your

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:00.910
new pattern of working
outdoors.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:09.890
So are you saying you're not
going to take on such large

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.850
projects anymore?

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.320
Because that's probably
my favorite.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.190
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON: Well,
thank you for that.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.650
And I mean, that one, there is
a big Persian moment in that

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.820
one, or Iranian.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.270
Whatever you want to say.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.490
Once you have the Europeans out
of the picture, everybody

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.710
else has a better chance to
express their culture.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.580
And Persia is an ancient and
powerful and beautiful

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.290
culture, so that was one
opportunity that I had.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:38.290
And one of my teachers
was Iranian, living

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.080
in the United States.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.880
That part of the novel,
that strand.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.360
So that was a great
opportunity.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.650
And that is a single novel.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.280
It's just that at 900 pages
long or whatever, it was--

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.540
I'm not going to
avoid anything.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.130
If I have an idea for another
long novel, I will curse and

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.330
gnash my teeth.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:02.890
It will be a disaster.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.950
But I won't run away from it.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.500
But I'm sort of thinking
it won't happen.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.680
And if it turns out to be a long
novel, the one thing I

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.140
will avoid is trilogies.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.140
What I want to do is crush
things into one volume.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.250
And I'm going to claim that I've
only done two trilogies.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.060
That the one that they call the
California trilogy is more

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.520
of a triptych, or a kind of a
peculiar trio of books that

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.580
isn't a story that begins and
takes three volumes to take

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.630
place, because those are
three different novels.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.310
So I've done it twice.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:40.100
And the Washington, DC trilogy
was possibly a bad idea.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:44.240
And now I'm working at about
this length, and I'm thinking

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.940
I don't see any ideas on the
horizon that should take more

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.210
than this length
to do the job.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.700
So I'll still do the research.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.650
I still have some kind of
horrifying problems to solve

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:57.600
in the novels that I
have coming next.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.550
Formal problems.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:59.920
Research problems.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.770
But I'm going to keep them
all to one volume if I

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.730
can, that's for sure.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.930
JON ORWANT: And I want to thank
Kim Stanley Robinson for

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.010
joining us.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.910
KIM STANLEY ROBINSON:
Thank you guys.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.510
