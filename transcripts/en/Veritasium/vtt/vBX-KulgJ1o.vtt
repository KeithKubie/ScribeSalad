00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.460
I want you to consider this bet. Here’s
ten dollars. This could be yours if I flip

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.759
this coin in the air, you guys call it in
the air. If you’re right I give you the

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:16.759
ten dollars. If you’re wrong you give me
ten dollars. I saw that coming. That’s not

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.580
a good bet for me. I guess in principle I don’t
agree with the idea of betting. Okay, okay.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.150
But what if we just use this as like an allegory
for life. You know, it’s not really about

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.899
money and betting on a coin, it’s more about
our approach to risk. Okay, and my approach

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.019
to risk is obviously a lot less than yours.
You wouldn’t do this bet? No, no. No, I

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.579
don’t have ten bucks. My gut says don’t
bet. Why is that? Because at the moment I

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.629
have ten dollars and later I might not. So
people are passing up the opportunity to win

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.390
ten dollars of my money. But it kind of makes
sense because they have to risk ten dollars

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.850
of their money and it’s a 50/50 chance,
so really the bet has zero value. What if

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.840
I sweeten the deal? What if I put up twelve
dollars to your ten? You only stand to lose

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.479
ten. You stand to gain twelve. How’s that
sound? I wouldn’t. I still wouldn’t bet.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.750
I feel like I’m better off just leaving
it as it is. I’ll offer you 15 dollars.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.170
You only have to put up 10. I’m putting
up 15. No. I’m offering you an extra five

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.350
dollars. Why not? I’m not giving my 10 dollars
away. What about 20? That’s as high as I’m

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.750
going today. Twenty dollars that is the top.
It’s two to one. I just don’t like taking

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.350
that much risk. You don’t like risking ten
bucks? Sure. I’m valuing my 10 dollars,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.310
I am. But why don’t you value my 20 dollars
which you’ve got a 50 percent chance of right

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.229
here if you accept the bet. I don’t know.
I can’t tell you. It’s not like a, I don’t

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.509
know what the logical reason is for why I
want that. I don’t know. I can’t be, I

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.939
just feel it’s not right. Now this does’t
make sense. I’ve offered people up to 20

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.469
dollars and they’re still refusing to take
the bet. Well the bet is objectively in their

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.819
favor. I mean a 50% of winning 20 plus a 50%
chance of losing 10 still gives the bet an

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.060
overall value of 5 dollars. Why is it that
you won’t go for this bet? I don’t know.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.450
Because I don’t want to lose 10 dollars
just because of that easily. I know but you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.709
could win twenty dollars. Think about the
gain. Well, I don’t know. I’m thinking

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.269
more about what I lose than what I win. I
think. I think that’s exactly the point.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.209
Because we feel losses more than we feel gains.
There’s an asymmetry in the way people perceive

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.440
gains and losses. Losses are felt much more
intensely. In fact psychology most people

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.940
weight a loss around twice as heavily as a
gain. But this varies from person to person.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.670
What if I go to 30 dollars? I said, even if
you had 50 I would still feel the same way.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.780
Fifty dollars to 10 dollars that would be
a reasonable. That’s when you would say

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.650
yes? Possibly, yes. You’re gonna have to
give me like a hundred. But I lose ten. This

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.959
is known as loss aversion. To avoid risking
a loss, people will pass up even very favorable

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.790
bets. But is there a way to overcome our oversensitivity
to losses? Let me ask you this. What if I

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.340
offered to do this ten times in a row? Same
deal, 20 dollars for your ten, flipping this

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.390
coin? But then I would be losing 10 dollars
each time wouldn’t I? You might be, you’d

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.519
be risking 10 dollars each time, but you know
that this is 50/50 and you know that I’m

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.360
giving you ten chances. Is that a better deal,
to do it repeatedly? I don’t think so. What

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.879
about a hundred times? I don’t think so.
It doesn’t get better? No. If we played

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.000
enough and I had enough of you know of a stake
of 10 dollars then eventually yes I would

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.989
make more money yes. So why does repeating
the same bet change it? I don’t think there’s

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.409
a rational thought behind it, it’s just
a feeling that one gets when presented with

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.439
the opportunity. I don’t know. I think there
is a rational reason behind it. Is it? Yeah.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.640
Because the coin is going to be 50/50. You
don’t know on one toss, you’re only going

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.689
to get one outcome. But in a hundred tosses,
you know that it’s going to be somewhere

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.090
between like 45 and 55 times it’s going
to go your way, 45 to 55 times it’s going

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.000
to go my way. Right? The point is, every time
it goes your way, you win twice as much as

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.970
you lose when it goes my way. So the point
is, doing it a hundred times you’re basically

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.870
guaranteed to win money. More chances. No
no, it’s not more chances of winning, it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.090
is you are guaranteed to win money. In fact,
the expected value of a hundred of these bets

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.560
is a win of 500 dollars. And there’s only
a one in 2300 chance of losing any money at

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.360
all. So even if you weight losses twice as
much as gains, a hundred bets is indisputably

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.190
favorable. So here’s the thing, how do you
accept a hundred of these bets if you won’t

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.100
first accept one of those bets? This experiment
is not about gambling. It’s not to encourage

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.650
you to go to the casino where the odds are
definitely stacked against you. Instead, it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.949
is a metaphor for all the little risks and
opportunities that come our way in our lives.

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.380
I mean if you view each one as an independent
event, you will often say no to even very

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.380
good bets because you’re afraid of the loss.
So if instead you can see each little bet

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.270
as one of a series of bets, then you realize
that if you take that bet every time you may

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.840
win and you may lose, but overall on the aggregate,
you will come out ahead. Heads. Heads it is.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.350
He’s just won himself 12 bucks. Tails. The
ten bucks is your sir. Heads. Thank you very

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:50.699
much. The man has won 20 bucks. See, it pays
to take the risk. Yay! Yes! This is unbelievable.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.400
My stroke of luck today has been terrible.
Every has won off me so far. Who’s funding

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.660
you? I’m funding myself. That’s honestly
my money. Really? Yeah. This video is in fact

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.979
a bit of a risk for me. Because I’m giving
out all this money and it’s only going to

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.910
make money on YouTube if like half a million
people see it. So if you like this video,

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.349
then you should share it with your friends
so that this actually turns out to be a positive

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:20.349
bet for me. Okay I’ll do that. Yeah. Share
it with your friends. It’s Veritasium. That’s

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.680
the name of the website. Veritasium. So would
you take this one-off bet? Let me know in

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.530
the comments below and tell me know how much
money I would have to put up for you to risk

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.030
your ten dollars. Now this video was inspired
by the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.849
Kahneman which I’ve recommended before because
it’s awesome and it also inspired me to

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.660
make these cool videos so check them out if
you haven’t already. But since I’ve recommended

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.990
this book before I’m going to recommend
something different today. My friend Phil

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.729
Plait’s book Bad Astronomy which is all
about misconceptions and misuses of astronomy

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.009
from astrology through to the moon landing
hoaxes. It is an awesome book so you should

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:02.310
definitely check it out and in fact you can
download it for free by going to audible.com/Veritasium.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.520
Or you can pick any other book of your choosing

audiobook website with over 150,000 titles
