Speaker 1:          00:00:03       What does that thing you say when you clink glasses instead of sure. It's like the Irish, you know, salute or, or you know, now stroll Vi's just the Irish version of Sloucher. [inaudible] yeah, like slash l. H. I. N. T. E I believe his house about Nate [inaudible]. Ooh, I never knew that you said it before and always just let it slide cause I didn't want to seem like a Dork. Yeah, I know. That's one of the things you probably seen it real book. I mean like, you know, Gaelic is some real harsh. Yeah. Like uh, vowels and Haley, it's a crazy, like I've seen Gaelic names that like were spelled insane and it was, oh, that's pronounced Shawn. Like some crazy shit. Like that wild ancient language, right? Yeah. For real though. I love Irish people, men, I just, I'm fucking fascinated by the wildness of that culture. That's what God made whiskey, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       So the Irish would put, so the Irish would never rule the world. When you see it got like a guy like Conor McGregor, that part of what is him is Irish. He's like a pure like brilliant Irish. You know what I'm talking for sure. Bowls fall the way motherfucker knows how to take a loss, knows how to take a loss. Takes a loss like a man and still talk shit. You know, come right back to him. It's like that, you know that that guy that you, your fight, but he loses but you know you're going to have to fight him tomorrow. Yes. Or as soon as his shit is healed up into busted up, this is gone. It's kind of like a hundred million dollars in the bank and he still wants to fight people still smacking people at bars. Yeah, that's, that's, it's hard. It's hard to be like, don't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Nah, not that. Oh, who knows what the fuck the guy said to him, but it looked like the guy was old as fuck. Someone said he was only 50 that the guy was only 50 do didn't fold up though. He just kind of sat at the bar counter. Didn't really, yeah, he smacked him. He gave him this smack in the back and then like a couple of fingers he touched you do what we call mushed him. He pushed him. He like, yes, you can kind of be interpreted as hitting, but it really ain't quite a hit. You know when you're a guy like that, you're basically walking around agreeing not to fuck people up because you have to kind of agree to not fuck people up. The money's got, there should be like five guys around him that makes sure that never happens, but they can't listen to him.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Like if you have a guy like him, he's going to do whatever he wants. Even if there's a bunch of people around him stopping him, you're not going to stop him from doing checks. When he threw that guy's phone down the ground, stomped it in Miami, there was all the body guards there. He just did it. He just did it. He's Kinda McGregor. He's fucking, look you. He's living like you're supposed to live. If you Conor McGregor the dances, dog, go to jail. Dude. Don't get locked down. The whole structure of the way things are now as far as like entertainment, it's like, yeah, it's all about eyeballs. While he fucking figured it out, man, pulling out figs, you

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       know what I mean? He figured it out, man, like in the most crazy way possible. He figured out how to just blow up the whole system. When you're in, you're a guy who has been fighting. I mean, I contacted him on Twitter in like 2013 right? By 2018 he's worth $100 million quick and he calls it all the way and he calls it all the way. It's, that's the craziest part is he called it all the way like, I'm going to be a billionaire or a multimillionaire. You know what Dana White said to me once about him that's dead on. He said he eats pressure. He said, that guy eats pressure. He just eats it. He goes, he just, he just goes in there and the more pressure experiences, the better he can perform. It's true. It's like you look at the Aldo fight picture, perfect left-hand knockout.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       I mean it doesn't get any prettier. The timing, the setup, the patients, the movement that the setting it up, looking for them to leap in and buying, catching the money's coming in. Pretty sure he said exactly those. That's exactly what he said he was gonna do right before the fight too. Oh, that's me tweeting him. January of 2013 I saw his fight in, I think it was cage warriors. I think that's the promotion. Cage wars or cage warriors. I think it's, why am I fucking that up? Cage wars. Is there two different ones? There probably is. It's probably a bunch of cage stuff, but either way, he was a fucking people up overseas and I was like, this kid is for real. He just sees something. Sometimes he sees like, I'll watch a video, I'll see how a guy moves. I'm like, Jesus, some guys just have something. And he had just ridiculous timing. So relaxed in there. Those were fun. Frakes man, his early days of MMA is like, you can go back and watch him and you go, oh, this guy's gonna be special. He's gotta like a weird sense of timing. You know? He's like, he's just very good at understanding where you're at and knowing how to put it into his head. Me winning, you know the Irish, the whole Irish thing. That's it. Oh for sure. Man. Persian.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Love it. I love it. Yeah. When he was like, we all fight together, like do when he's in the room, like if he wins a fight and there's, you know the crowds filled with like 7,000 Irish people. Do you feel it? Like you feel like goosebumps. It's crazy. Like you do everything you can to stop it just to keep yourself from crying at the beauty of it. This guy standing there in front of thousands of people that have flown overseas to see us. Finally people fly over for, Ooh, it's crazy. They take over the fucking Vegas hotels take off her like where you have seas. Then they shut down like seventh avenue in front of, in front of the Madison Square. There's not a fucking fan on earth like Irish fans. They're different. I used to think Brazilian fans were crazy until I saw the Irish fans. They take over the whole Mandalay bay was taken over by people singing. It was all, I was fair amount

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       of drinking. Oh, fair. More than fair. But just the fact that they could do that, that they can gang get together and sing the same song, like thousands of them together singing the same song. I remember the first time, uh, when we went to Ireland as house of pain and, uh, in between songs, they broke into the whole, you know, the soccer chance stuff. And we were just like, whoa, this is crazy. You know, we never experienced anything like that. They don't, they had, you didn't do that at the sports events at home back then? Not back then at all. So that was amazing. Culturally, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's that soccer. They have to have real Conor fight in Ireland once he's got a fight in Dublin, in a soccer stadium. Fuck yet. Right. Why not? Why not? If he's ever gonna fight again, that's what it's trying to do it, I don't, you know, the, I think the, I, the idea was that it's like more money in paper view.

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       If you fight in Vegas, you know Vegas is worth a lot of money. Doesn't the time have a lot to do with it too? When the European thing, they gotta do the whole weird time thing over there so they can accommodate the pay per view here. Yeah, it'd be real weird. They'd be fighting like four in the morning. It's always real weird to me when I wake up and there's like a a a South American fight that happened at noon and I'm like, Oh God, missed or Japan like rise in if you trying to watch rise and they have it in Japanese time. That's how pride used to be. We would get up at like we would have guys come over my house and we would watch pride at like three o'clock in the morning. Like sometimes they would have them live for some reason, if I'm remembering it correctly.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       Sometimes they would have them live and sometimes they'd have the fights and you knew what happened but you didn't get to see it for like a couple of weeks. They would delay it in North America for some strange reason. They didn't, didn't, didn't totally do it live. I was hip to that MMA share thing a long time ago. They always had the bootleg videos and I tell anybody that's like Voldemort. Don't say that. I don't did I did. I just mess up. I don't know. You can get mad. It was gone. Anyways. That was 10 years ago. Dude. Illegal street dude, UFC is gangsters with that. Like it used to be you could watch those and then I over time you was like, cause like in Europe before, like there was things like fight pass and thing like that. You couldn't find a paper view if you were stuck over there four in the morning, in the middle of somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       So you would lean on whatever you could as a fan and, but the, they start, you started seeing them shutting them down. Like it doesn't, they're gangsters. The UFC or gangsters. Yeah. So it's a big money business. People fucking be oppressive is what it is. It's impressive. It's like there's like a, there's a army of motherfucker somewhere going and go. Yeah. Some of it must get through, right. Just every at the internet just has stuff that gets, I don't know. I got the fight pass now so I everywhere I go. So I got the fight pass and the little you have that little um, static IP address though. Like when you are out the country you can, it's perfect. That's perfectly normal. You know what's weird? Why aren't they showing why? Like I need to ask the UFC this. Why don't they show like the height, like the knockouts on their Instagram page.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       They show when the knockouts over and you notice that? Yeah, I do not understand. I don't understand it because once everybody knows, they know, everybody knows. They know it's not hurting anybody to watch it. I get it. It'll just hype up the replay business. A lot of business. I wonder what the replay buys are like the cats who just missed it and bought the replay. Maybe that factors, I'm sure they cry. Make a nice second round of money on that replay. Right? Like so how long do you think they should hold off for like a week or two maybe? Yeah, a week. A week. And then put the highlights on. Sure. Do they do that? Did they ever show, I get this weird impression that they only show like right after the finish on the Instagram now know they have, they'll show entire fights on Instagram now, but old fights like all the fights.

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       Yeah, so like pretty sure they showed steep bay just pulling off of DC. Was that the case? That was a crazy, I got my whole phone got blown up cause apparently I'm right in the background when that happens. Like going, I don't know, I haven't seen it but my phone blew up right there. That fight was chaos. That would fight was Kay. I was fun. I had an amazing time. That car, I should say the car fight card was chaos. That was a wild one man and a Anaheim. It was hard watching TC get hit with those fucking body shots. That was dude. As soon as he started pigging in it was like, oh wow, something's happening dude. Steve Bay's nasty. He wanted that belt by shots. He took incredible know. We were talking about Yo the shots Steve Bay took and just walked through him like wow.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       It was crazy because DC managed to put him away with one punch the first time and say you didn't see coming, you didn't see it coming. Everything you got hit with was hard as hell. But he saw it all coming. Yup. And he let them get in that little right in his chest area wet cause that's what he got that short one on him that last time. And that's exactly what happens if you're not prepared. If you don't think you're going to get punched and you relax for a minute and then you get punched by something you don't see coming, you can get fucked up. And um, when you're in a fight with a Greco Roman wrestler of the caliber of DC knows how to manipulate you. And he just had been manipulated in perfectly into that right hand. And it was a beautiful work of art, but he was never able to hit him like that in the second fight, like as cleanly and have that kind of an effect.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       The shots he hit him with were pretty good shots. But Steve, I ate them and then you realize, oh, Steve Bay could take a fucking shot. He just got clipped. He just got caught. He could take a fucking shot. And he was there in the fourth round, which is really impressive. Like in the fourth round, he was looking good. He recognizes him. As soon as he touched that in that liver shot that it was wow. Something happened there and it hit him. He dug in like four or five straight times. Man cannot let a guy like that punch you in the lever that many times. I'm sure DC obviously didn't want him to do that, but that's how good Steve is. It was like the DC though. Yeah. Respect to DC. I love that guy. Agrees. He's one of my favorite people to do commentary with.

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       Man for sure. He's, he's the best. He's so fun. He's hilarious. Like when thought when Rose Naama, Eunice, uh, knocked out a Yani and j check and he's like [inaudible] that like, that is what I love. Like he's, those are forever moments where, you know, he's so free that in the middle of like this car, we're calling a world title fight. He's just DC. He could be himself and it's a, he's got a great personality man, and he's in a hell of a fighter and he was dominating in the first round. She think he's gone. He go, he gone go fight again. Probably he's going to want to fight steep again if I guess, if I really guess. I mean if he wants to do it again, he's going to want to fight. [inaudible] cause he's gonna want to what? I think the way he described it as, right that wrong that he did.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       He just didn't fight well, he didn't listen to his corner. Um, I think that's what he thinks. Um, it's like he fought really well in the first round and then Bob Cook was yelling at him in the second round, keep your damn hands up, you know? And he was like walking him down, like almost like disdainfully like walking him down. And I don't know if that was part of strategy to psychologically put up a lot of pressure on Steve Bay, you know, to try to establish that's DBAs done that. He's the champ now, but it was almost like disdainful. But Steve Bay survived so and he just was there and he was in there and really good shape and rounds three in rounds, four. That was what was really impressive about it. I was amazed, especially after getting fucked up quite a bit in that first round. I mean I, there was a couple of times where I thought he was going to be fit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       Like, like dude, what's going to get him? DC was all over him in that first round and when he, when he picked him up and dumped him, you're like, Jesus Christ [inaudible] Jesus Christ. He's good. He just didn't maintain it. That's exactly what it was. And then Steve Bay made the adjustment and um, you know, who the fuck knows? He might decide, you know what, my body doesn't want to do this anymore. I'm done. I know he made a ton of money and I know he's really good as a commentator and he'll, he'll do that forever for sure. Or he might don't want to do it one more time, but then there's always John Jones, Roy lurking, man, John, John, you haven't felt like everybody knows like that's the biggest rivalry in MMA, isn't it? Isn't it? Yeah. I mean the only thing you got, like if you're going to talk about accolades of of Cormey A's, he has everything, all those champions, but there's the little asterisk on the, on the light heavyweight belt that he never really got it from Ryan John, but that's the weird part about it, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       It's like when you're a champion, but to champion who's the real champion didn't lose it and then they have an interim champ. Like what are we doing here? What has happened is he got an accurate, John never come back and shown that he's still him like, and hopefully God willing for him keeping all this stuff together and there's, yeah, it would have been different if he just kind of fade into the distance then. Then it changes that narrative. But he came back and he, his original thing was like, you that guy. I'm that guy still. Yeah. It was crazy. I mean, dude, that's how crazy good John is. Really? That's how crazy good John is. I'd love to see that though. And the way DC was able to beat rumble twice rumbled to me, it was always that smart too, Scott. That's my dude. That's my dude.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       He's so ferocious. His punching. It's so fucking explosive, man. He's just got so much power. When he knocked out Glover to share it with one punch, I was like, God. Like who though? When I first met him, he was, he was a much smaller dude when he's 2170 yeah. Yeah. He used to work out with some friends of mine that we used to work out in this little MMHG and it was off Melrose and, and Labrea, I think it was called l a m m a at the time or something like that. And He, before he wound up in Colorado, I think, you know. But you know, I've known him through the wild man. He's a good dude, meticulously powerful and he's a really nice guy. Yeah, it's good to his fucking powers. Preposterous though. Like, but it was him and then when I seen him come back in to two oh five that's what I was, yeah, just mine.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       I was like, what the people at two oh five but it was interesting man. It's his, his retirement was like one of the most honest and like a f. It was like, he was like happy with it cause he was like, man, I'm not a fighter. I'm my athlete. I just, I'm just good at this. I was like, wow, that's really, that's, that's interesting. Interesting. Waitrose weed now and raises dogs and like spreads fringe bulldogs. She just had it grappling competition against this Guy Craig Jones, who's this? A Brazilian Jujitsu guy from Australia that's a murderer, is a leg lock specialist to an economy in a leg lock. It's crazy to see how big he is. Rumbles like fucking, I don't know, he's gotta be like 260 pounds. Like No. Bullshit was huge. I seen him. We sat next to a fight. If life not the last fight I went to whatever the one last week before that in Vegas probably.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       He looks like a fucking super heavyweight. He's so big. It's ridiculous. Yeah. He just not even thinking about losing weight for fighting anymore. I would wonder what would happen if you decided to come back as a heavyweight, like no bullshit as a heavyweight. If that guy, I mean, you know crazy would be if that guy wound up winning the heavyweight title, like you're thinking of the rumble career. He wins the ultimate fighter as a one 70 gets all the way up to one 85 can't make one 85 misses weight. Right. Misses it for the veto of Belfort fight, I believe. A big fight. Then he goes up the light heavyweight even goes up to heavyweight foot beat Andre or Lawsky in, I think it was the PFL and I think it really beat him badly. If I remember correctly, it got broke. He broke his jaw so, and then that was at heavyweight. That was at heavyweight in the PFL. It wasn't in the UFC and then it comes back to the UFC. It comes back to the UFC as a light heavyweight and just line and people see him hit people. They just go, Whoa, that guy. Scary. Tiny too. Excellent timing. You know he, it was just power rumble Johnson UFC return could be on cards if the price is right. Yeah. That was when [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       This is from recently? Yeah, after his grappling matching thing. Yeah, July two months ago. Two months ago. It's so big right now. I would think you'd fight heavyweight heavyweight. Him and I mean I really think he's Harriman's tpa. He was torturing his body for so long to make one 70 I never saw anybody lose. When you got two 78 that's a hundred pounds over where he fought. It is a 100 pound gain that is so crazy. A hundred pounds more than what he weighed in when he won the ultimate fighter. That's insane. That's insane. God bless. Oh God. Two 78

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       oh my God. 170 on my God. He was 170 170 pound champion becomes a 278 pound heavyweight. And it tells us like, where did he, how did you do that? Where is it? It's crazy. That guy's power is fucking undeniably preposterous. What do you make of Brock? Uh, try to pick a fight with John Ball. Oh, that's so silly. That's not, let's just talk. What else can I say about a rumble? Is that even though rumble was that, that good and that scary DC handled that man DCAD a hard shot. Got Him to the ground. That was rumbold he's one seventies very thin now he's, he know her most, but d c was the guy who managed to handle that and that d c is seemingly easily say pawn. He was the only one that can handle him. I didn't think that was going to go that way.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Like I said, that was my dude. So I was rooting heavy for him. Wow. D's. He's a special guy when it comes to wrestling. He's especially talented and um, I think wrestlers, they know where they stand in the wrestling food chain. And when you get gripped by a dude like DC, like, oh Jesus, this is a Olympic caliber wrestling, that's beast mode. He just started smashing and he was able to run his way through the heavyweight division. You've got to realize before he lost his steep a fight, he'd only lost one round ever at heavyweight. Really? Arguably. And that was to Josh Barnett. I think that was like one round that he lost on the cards. And Josh Barnett is a, you know, a legend, a fucking the youngest ever [inaudible] the youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion. Josh Barnett, brilliant guy to do. You know Josh got personally no fucking brilliant guy, brilliant guy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       So that's the last round the DC had ever lied, lost like one round as a heavyweight. He was just dominating people with his wrestling and his hand speed. He was just fucking people up. But it just, that's how good Steve Bay is, man. People slept on steep bay. You know, people thought the DC was going to run him over again. Like you've ran him over the first time. And, uh, you know, I think DC prepared for a long and arduous fight, but Steve pays a big, big man, big giant heavyweight man. He's a long, tall dude along frame and DC weighed more than him during the fight. I think he weighed like six pounds more than them, something like that. But it's just built, it's a just, just very different way. Come in like 20 or 30 pounds. Last and last time he came in less.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Yeah. I don't know if it was 20 pounds, but I think it was, he was like two 30 in this fight. I think DC was two 36. So DC came in, light two came in lighter than their first fight. But I think uh, you know, Steve, Pete came in after like a whole year of waiting for this rematch. Like trying to figure it out if it's ever going to happen. Is DC gonna Fight Brock Lesnar and Jesus, you know, it's like he was always waiting and then finally they gave him the chance to see him. I hate to see DC lose. I hate it. It's hard to watch, man. He's such a nice guy. It's, it's hard. As much as I liked that guy to see him get hit, it's hard. But you take all that stuff out and just look at it as two athletes. And what Steve Bay did was just brilliant that the whipping of that left hook to the body was just textbook man tax book.

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       Do you see, was fighting an amazing fight up until that, until that he gassed a little bit. It looked like to me and the liver shots started happening. You know, it's also, you got to appreciate the technique the way Steve Bay through that left Hook was perfect. I mean it was just, these are brilliant shots. There's no wasted movement. The technique was pinpoint. I mean he just wack. He just ripped some in there and he caught DC standing there and he just hit him with a hard left to the body. And then once he realized he could do that more, he just continued what they were doing and then he would go do it again and he got in again and then now dcs in a little bit of trouble and now he's got to, he was going to try to do, take him down. Like he's in this spot where it's kind of still standing with him and he's not down but he's hurting and so it's how much is he hurt?

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       He mean he got hit with hard body shots by the way. Definitely letting it be known. Those are brutal and then boom, he starts hitting him up to the head and drops them. Wow. That was super impressive. Like when you're calling a fight, how often are you looking here and how often do you like depends on what I can see. I mean what you're saying is a monitor. Yeah, it depends on how often. Like I want to see it. If I could just see. Absolutely. That's why I'm just curious like you're in PR. I'm not even, I'm just saying a percentage wise. If you were to guess what is, what about a third of the time here looking at this and the rest of time you probably up here? Yeah, maybe less than a third on the monitors. I try to stay off the monitors, the monitors, all I want to see, you know, I want to see what's happening, but they're like, if they're off to the side, like pressed up against the cage, then I kind of have to go to the monitors because I need to see like I'm comparing it to like an experiences like ringside experience where I'm like, how often I'm like about a third of the time I feel like I'm looking at watching the screen and the screens, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Just because I want to, there are there on the ground and I want to see what's going on with her, with the arm that I can't see. You know what I mean? That kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's a wild fucking sport, man. So while I was trying to figure it out the other day, I think I've been the like maybe 60

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       UFC. He's, man, Jeez,

Speaker 4:          00:23:48       surprise. I think so dude. If I think back to the years and when I met Dana and chuck and like ever since that day, it's like anyone, I called up and you know, I'm, I'm blessed and that, you know, I get to go. And when I was single dude, I, you know, when I was, when it was those days, it was a whole different game. I'd be at almost every one cause a lot, most of them were in Vegas. So it would be, uh, it would be easy to get there. Yeah. Those are fun experiences, man. Trying to figure out how to pull up on Abu Dhabi, man. Are you really, I'm trying and I'm trying to figure out do I just buy a ticket and go or do I figure out how so yo, any promoter out there that wants to Mudd jump around action, Holler at me. You know what I mean? I'm just trying to pull up on the Abu Dhabi fight and have that,

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       I'm going to be watching that one from here. We're going to probably do a fight companion for that and one day I want to be invited to one of those. You got to come to one of those. Those are ridiculous. Yeah. No that's their foreign trust. Try not to get into conspiracies. No, no, I'm, I'm well aware. Try to keep anywhere from the Illuminati. Right. This is the only way it goes south. But even that it's fun. It's always fun. It's like the best thing in the world is like watching fights with friends and, and laughing. No, I've watched it. Good combination of things. Yeah. It's a fun thing. My most favorite way to watch fights, turn the fan down at the house. Y'all up. You man, you could say things you just can't say. You know, you could talk about things you absolutely never otherwise talk about it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:18       And you could describe things with language, like the whole, all the language. You could use all the language. You know like when I'm doing the UFC for shit, like little kids are listening to this, which is kind of weird, right? Like if you say fuck, that's bad. But if they watch someone get beat, the fighter can say it though. I mean, you know what I mean? The fighter could say it. Yeah. I think our think appropriately and intelligently placed. It wouldn't be out of line, but you couldn't overdo it or overuse it. It would have to be like, you'd have to like pick that. Perfect. The problem is it, it gets in the way of uh, doing the commentary, right. You're just, any decision that you would make to use that kind of language would get in the way. The commentary because it, it would be like, it would be less effective.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       Like they would go, ah, this guy. Like why do you have to use it? They're true. And they'd be like judgment of like, when do you use it, why you use it? It's, and then they would like think less of what you have to say or be upset by what you have to say. And that would be the number one thing. If you're trying to do commentary, the number one thing you're trying to do is take yourself out of it. Like I'm trying to do that. I'm just trying to like use the best language possible to express my excitement for what we're about to see. Like this is what's important to me. Like I just wanna I'm fucked. This is how fucking pumped I am. These guys are murderers. This is going to be fascinating to see. Yo Romero. Paulo Kosta,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       what the fuck? That's exactly what we were talking in the car on the way down. I was watching that fight like this, like this. This is me. Like Jason's like it's like one of those fights we just waiting for some Creighton did, did the beatings. They were giving each other. It was crazy man. Fucking too chiseled. Granted looking motherfucker in a Gucci model. Going to be in a Gucci model ad next week for sure. And she doesn't put pick him up there. Crazy. The guy's beautiful. They're both giant beautiful men with the incredible bodies. It was a man. The fight was fucking fantastic and it was so highly skilled that Paula Kosta guy is for real man. He's for real. If he can do that too. Yo l if he could stay on top of Yo l like that Yo else explodes on. Everyone explodes on everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       But that dude weathered the storm. He weathered the storm and he landed some great shots. It was a very close fight though, cause EOL hit him with some big shit too and EOL took him down twice. You know, we were, we were, you know, it was my 50th sat Sunday so we were out Saturdays and Sundays already again. Oh, slideshow. [inaudible] yes sir. It's lunch. Yeah. So like, you know, we were going Yo old guy rep, you know what I mean? You know, for the rep, for the old guys, you know. And so we were going hard for yo out bro. He wins best body at 42 all over the world. The guy's a monster. I mean who, who has more like athletic length of their elite career than UL? Because at 42 he still moves like he moved 10 years ago. Is he 42 two is it, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       Cuban birth certificate fee like 48 you know what, that's what they say about that. Louis or t's guy, you know that elite heavyweight boxer from Cuba. [inaudible] trouble from all my friends, Cuban friends for that. [inaudible] my ball Cypress guy. I had him on the podcast with Joey Diaz translating. It was amazing man to hear him tell his stories in Cuban. I just wish I spoke Spanish. I could understand it like coming from his mouth, but having Joey translate it and talk about all the shit that he had to deal with coming up through the Cuban amateur sisters in your pocket. Look at that dude. I gotta Watch it cause I don't, I don't want that one got bought and built. That is preposterous. That is one of them sculpted things you buys at toys r us, right? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       that's an action figure for sure. Look like a real live human. He's so bad, man. That is so freakishly athletic and so powerful. And you know, it's that Cuban wrestler system and he, he just, the way he described it as like [inaudible] new and doing my chain, you just become a fucking machine. And that's what he is with competition. He's just a machine man. Yeah, he was clowning too in the second two rounds. Like that's why I was like, Kinda felt like, you know, we was trying to get that guy to be emotional and make a mistake. You don't for sure. But it was like he again, he finished, he got here. I mean he got the best of him in those two rounds in my book.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       I thought he wanted close, close. Not Bad enough to be like bitching about it, but like I would've flipped the 29, 28 personally. Well, the audience agreed with you when they, uh, they were crazy. Yeah. Which is unfortunate because Paula Kosta just fought and amazing fight and he has to feel like shit during the, the post [inaudible] it sucks. I don't, I don't condone bullying any of that stuff that doesn't, that most of the people that would be, would never get in that ring. I would never get in that ring. You ain't got no money. I got and I've made a lot of money and I'd kind of, McGregor hasn't gotten enough money from your kid. Okay. You got the a hundred billion. Yeah, man. I'm like my consciousness, you know, I'm not getting in with Mike Tyson for any money, you know, cause the problem is there's a lot of recipients on the wrong side of things.

Speaker 4:          00:30:25       For sure. The problem is they're blowing the decision. It wasn't his decision. It was thought as hard out and it wasn't that ridiculous as my point too. Like it was like I would have flipped it, but hey, okay. No, it's, I can see how that could be seen 100%. And you're a guy who has been live to 60 fucking you. Fcs. Yeah. Let's just, um, I don't know what the woo thing is that's happened in the last couple of years. Woo. Like it's just like the whole crowd starts, it's just like, I just get excited. That's new. That's like, I wasn't around a long time ago. Anyway, some soccer thing, they probably stole it from soccer spoon. It's like, it's like animals answering each other and communicating by with the wounds. Dude, I never even thought of that. That's so true. The Woo. That's a new thing. Yeah. I mean, no, that's five or six.

Speaker 4:          00:31:16       Yeah. Right. What was that like? It started when it, you know what? When's the first time it popped up down south like a Kentucky or a North Carolina? That's when I feel like I heard it first like, you know that might be Rick flair. That might be a wreck. It might be a ric flair. Is that what that is? Oh yeah man. Dude, that would make a lot now you fucking solved the mystery for me that I'd make. That would make sense if we can get some confirmation on that. Somehow. Someone asked this question on Reddit. Someone says, you've been talking about Rick Flair so much that they might've picked it up from you.

Speaker 4:          00:31:46       I don't know if this is some bizarro moment where it all connected like, oh shit. I started that. Listen, guys like that are important to America. That guy's such, he's such a character in his prime with his suits. Jet Flying Alligator, wherein I was a WCW guy, man, and Rick flare was the man dude. He was a like, he's a character that made his way into what a thousand rap songs. How many rap songs have Rick do? There's a whole like, like, um, hip hop subculture involved with wrestling. Like, I mean, I, I was like these cats that I'm, we're actually fans of Westside, Gunn and Conway and this kid penny, they got this record label called Grizelda, but the, the west side gun kid is like a fucking wrestling fanatic. Like is more like, he's like involved. I think he's involved with like the

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       WWE like doing merge and stuff like that. Cause I see him putting shit together that's like definitely gotta be licensed. So Yo, it's, there's this whole subculture of like this of wrestling and, and, and hip hop going on right now. So it's definitely made its way into standup to now, you know, they have this, uh, podcast, the store horseman where they all just talk about pro wrestling, a bunch of comics, Tony Hinchcliffe and these comments. Who, who's on that store? Horsemen. Jeremiah walk-ins, right? Who else? No, he's not. I'm giving out false fake news. Fake News. That's fake news. Um, but it's not fake news and this delicious, by the way. It's very good. It's delicious. Buffalo Trace. I ain't mad at companies from 1773 son. They started in 1773 did you really tell sold whiskey during prohibition for additional medicinal purposes? I didn't know that. Well, I didn't, but I would, I'm not shocked at this company.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       Kept making whiskey all through the prohibition. Legally or illegally. Yeah. From medicine. So people that, you know, I'm gonna need a little medicine. I just got a slew of new whiskeys. Here it is birthday. It's a Tony Hinchcliffe, Johnny [inaudible], Curtis, Matt Edgar, Josh Martin. That's right. I hope I said it's Curtis's last name. Ryan does that. Right? So I say that sounds like it. Yeah. Anyway. Um, so comics are really into pro wrestling too. They even go live. These dorks, they fly out to like Wrestlemania and they go in the audience name live. Same, same, same, same. Yeah. It's become like a, not like a, it's become a thing that people like to do, like to go to these big wrestling events and groups of people, whether it's musicians or rappers, hip hop or stand ups. They're going like for sure. Experiencing it. Yeah, exactly. It's like the concert experience.

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       Why are rappers rappers so obsessed with Rick Flair? Because he's got like 40 rolodexes that one famous rant that he went on limousine riding. Jet Flying. Exactly. You know that kind of sure. All eight when that happened and they saw, yes, that's everything I want and in the universe it's insane. Yeah. You see him now. I mean the guy still gets love everywhere. He goes, you know, like I did in my special where I said, you know Rick Flair and then I put the microphone out to the audience. The audience goes, Woo, Julie's, you started that shit then dude, you started the wounds. I don't think I did. I think it was already going on. I think everybody appreciates this guy. It's like as you get up, we can't play this right. We get in trouble, but this is the, as you, you know, you get older, you, you see things like this, you appreciate them for what they are like you could think they're cheesy when you're young, but then as you get older you go, damn, that's fucking awesome. The fact that that guy is this task as earth. Amazing, beautiful golden

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       mullet when those crazy sunglasses saying this all saying all this nutty show, pinky ring dude man, that's an artist. That guy's an artist. Look at us. That's the male soap opera forever. Since back when children, man, you know what I mean? When I was a kid it was Bob Backlund and Jimmy superfly snuck a and iron chic. I don't know if you could have really grown up in America as a little boy and not had a phase at some point where you interacted with one of these rounds where your organization's WCW or WWF when I was growing up and if you were like one of those kids is really into like all music and indie groups, you know you, you would go for some like fucking killer Kowalski Shit. You talk to taker, you would go, you would try to find some people that were off the beaten path.

Speaker 4:          00:36:26       Like do you know about this wrestling organization? Cause there's a bunch of like weird little tiny dude when I was, when the house of pain like was like early on. Like, you know, but you know, we were already experiencing pretty good success. Like ECW had formed a crazy extreme championship wrestling. I think that's what it stood for out of Philadelphia and they invited us to a bunch and it was the first time I ever really, and I know it had happened before, but their whole show was about cats cutting their faces open and bleeding during matches and shit. It was insanity man. And they had packed houses. I mean, I think dude bought it up like Vince McMahon bought it up and the guy who owned it or ran it became one of the like characters within it that I believe I've, it's been a long time.

Speaker 4:          00:37:08       I'm old now. I'm 50 do you see what Ronda Rousey did to her finger? I saw that yesterday. How about that man? They glue that thing together and she went back to work. How about if I read it right? She finished the tape. She finished the take and ignored it until it was over and they overshadows how bad it was. Guys. She goes to the hospital, they put it back together again and then she goes back and finishes gangster. Dude. That's dedication. Not a lot of humans. It's also like, I don't want to fight anymore. I'm going to go finish this movie. You know, nobody wants to cut the weight once they're done, went on. I don't want to come back to that shit. That's just the mindset of an elite combat sports for short. She just had that mindset. There's not a whole lot of humans that would dealt with that that way.

Speaker 4:          00:37:54       That's crazy. The ladies made out of bullets. I'm going on my workman's comp from my sad gaff co-insurance and yeah, you're shutting down production son. We ain't finishing no scenes. What? Chopped off a superstars finger. Yeah, Jesus Christ. What if she lost her finger? What if it was like, I mean, how far? I mean, it wasn't fall. I mean, yeah, that's a fuck without the, the super expert surgeons that's gone. Speaking of which do last last, I think it happened. I don't know if we talked about it and it might've been after the last time it was on. Dude. So I'm on a trip and I'm coming home literally about to get on the plane and I get this text from my wife. Like I'm, I'm at the, I got a, I chopped off my finger and I'm like, in my head I'm like, she didn't chop off her finger meds.

Speaker 4:          00:38:43       I cut her, probably got pretty rowdy but stitches. I was like, okay, it's pretty bad. I was, I right. I'm about it. It was like about a three hour flight home. Sorry. I know I'll be there as soon as I can. So I get there and I pick her up from the hospital and she's got the big thing on and I get the story of, she was getting in the shower and we have, you know, big glass swinging shower door and she fucking like, she was like getting in and like, you know, holding onto like edge real quick as the door slam shut on it and just locked off the fucking whole like to the knuckle

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       basically. They put that shit back on, fixed it up a little bit. It looks pretty fucking good now. But that was crazy. Now you just reminded me of it with the whole Ron arousing years or so. It's amazing that they don't break more often. They're so gentle much it would be over like if that part of my, this finger like this is the guitar on the fret hand like that. If I lost that part of that finger, um, I got, it's going to take me four or five years to learn how to play with just these, at least my friend Paul was closing a window and it shattered and cut his finger and cut through the tendons and his fingers, like permanently curled and he had a bunch of operations to try to straighten it out, but then eventually just gave up. They could never straighten it out.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       It never gained like full range of motion from a window. Like it's so delicate. All this stuff is so delicate and you know, that's why it's great. That's got flight on mine, so ridiculous us a glass door, not sharp really. I went home and looked at it and like it was pretty beveled on the edges, but the weight of it just lopped off the fucking thing or like crazy. She was pretty gangster though. I have to say she was pretty gangster. What do you think of that scene or putting his hand in that fucking pulling thing actually posted. I don't, I don't, I think she, I don't think it's on her Instagram. She posted the tip of her finger in the plastic bag as she took it to the, Oh my God. Oh, you're in God's little dude. Chip ice in the bag. Oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       They couldn't reattach, but they, it was like they, uh, were able to like extend it somehow and like, and that luckily the dude out right there, there's a dude who was an expert at hand plastic surgery and wow. Hooked her shit up. Like it looks like relative, this looks pretty normal. Something happens to your skin. Like if your finger gets chopped off at the end, there's a way to make it grow back, right. Isn't there, am I making this up? It seems like, I remember there was, there's a way where if something happens to your tip of your finger, oh yeah. If you don't get the bulk and it, yeah, I've heard that. I think they said something like that, but I get got hurt pink hot piece of her bone just wow. That's why I'm saying it's so shocking at how it just locked it up clean like a, it's like a angle like whip and wow. You like that sound effect. Yeah. Whip.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       I keep thinking that one day they're going to come up with a artificial Luke Skywalker type hands and that people are gonna want them instead of regular hands. That's what I'm worried about.

Speaker 5:          00:41:43       Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:41:45       If they came up with an arm, it would sound like metal or metal. Unless you, if you had the skin like simulation. I can play guitar with that. Maybe I'm talking about self. I do some wild shit. I'm talking about self healing. Bulletproof spider silk, hybrid skin like that. The government's working on [inaudible]. They're working on that right now. They're working on some sort of odd, don't doubt it, man. I, I, I wanna you want to hear a wild one? Alright, I went on, you know, one night fucking smoking. I went on a little youtube,

Speaker 5:          00:42:17       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:42:17       warm whole situation and somehow, I don't even know if it's a youtube video or someone else, but I wound up on this video that was like, world's smartest kid thinks that cern blew the world up in 2008. All right. And I'm like, what the fuck? So I go on this video and I'm watching this video dude, and it's this young kid, he's like 12 in a month, fuck is talking, you know, half the, your, you got to invest like 20 minutes into this kid's talking about things that are super smart and it's Kinda like to show you he's super smart. You know what I mean? This kid and his dad is doing the recording I believe, or a relative, somebody very close to them and he goes into this whole theory of how he thinks when they collided the electrons I believe at in the, in the, in the supercollider sorry, that they cause some crazy chain reaction that blew up the universe.

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       But they also weighed, they created an Adam that weighed too much and he has, oh the first 20 minutes is also explaining infinite parallel universes. So what the kid winds up with this, this theory of like one Adam weighing too much and way and is that being just enough to shift our universe into a parallel universe yet this is it right here. So this guy had, this kid had me fucked up because after I watched this, everything I saw for months was talking about like it would be news guy on the, on the news like I don't know what universe I'm in anymore or ah, Spiderman into the spider verse. Like all these, everything I saw for like four or five months after watching this video was like multi-verse shit like shit about multi versus, and it's got me fucked up. Joel, I hear you.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       I'm fucked up man. Read this kid, look into it. Says there, he claims it. Cern destroyed the universe doing recent experiments which has resulted in us living in a nearby parallel universe instead. Your welcome ETI. There's a lot of people online. This is an explanation for all the Mandela effect finding goes into stuff about the Mandela effect. How that, you know, there's apparently a bunch of people who think Mel, Odette Mandela died in prison. And like there's, you know, and as far as I know, he was released, became president in South America, you know, and that's the universe. I

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       just personally, you know, but it's crazy dude. What? Cause it's not just this video, it's like you watch it and that Youtube Algorithm starts sending you down a whole bunch of other, you know what I mean? You start here and it's like, it's, and then again, everything that came out there was all these shows I would see or movies or news, things about Multa multi-verse all of a sudden was everywhere around me. It was fucking Nettie Dude. So I'm fucked up about that shit right now. If there was something, everything do, if there was something that they could do that might open up a door to a parallel universe, you don't think they would do stranger things you mean? Yeah, I'd say that's because stranger things, I mean, things are strange, right? Stranger things. Bizarro world. You know, what's the weirdest one is the, the like the people that dismiss climate change.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       That is the weirdest one to me because I'm like, what is, I'm trying to figure out what's the benefit of dismissing climate change other than if you work for like the oil industry or something just lost the glacier. Yeah, like they just posted a whole thing of 10 years or 80 like something in the 80s a glacier picture of it and just now, and it's gone. But I'm not even saying like blaming anybody for it. I'm saying dismissing it as an issue. I'm like, let's pretend that people have nothing to do with it. Let's just, I wish people had nothing to do with it because then we can go, holy fuck, it's getting hot. Like how hot is it? Gonna get like we could just figure it out. Like if it was just occurred at this point where it's two degrees, the oceans are hotter than they've been and she never had people do that where they try to say like, this is a natural cycle.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       This is something some people still say. Right. Okay. Even if it was just a natural cycle, I wish humans weren't in the equation at all. So there was no argument. I wish it would just be like, hey guys, it's getting really hot. What the fuck do we do? As if we had no control over whatsoever. Not saying that we shouldn't take steps to fix it and we definitely should, but I'm saying that if it was impossible for people to have created it and it was happening around us, maybe we would be forced to do something. Maybe we'd be forced to like go to higher ground, get the fuck out of that. The really hot spots, you know, make your way towards Canada. Like, I mean maybe that would w what we would do if there was no other way, but we know that at least part of what the problem is is people, at least part of the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       But so many people would start th th they want to start arguments about that and fight that. And to me it's so strange. It's like what's the benefit of arguing against that? It's happening. I don't understand like it's happening. You see it getting warmer. You see the statistics. You see everybody freaked out though. The Amazon's on fire. If you seen this. No, it's fucking horrifying. Those photos from self harm, they're just, and I believe it's purposeful. I have heard that that is the, that some people are being burned away on purposes. What I'm, if I, some of the things I've read or understood, I won't swear their truth. Cause again, that's one of the things what you're saying is,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       is you've got to question everything. Now truth has been compromised man. You know what I mean? No matter what side of whatever you are on truth has been, has been seriously compromised because there's a counter opinion to everything and if you're not adept enough to really get involved and find factual information, you can literally counter any argument there is with, with something. Oh I said, well I read this while I read this. Okay, well that doesn't mean either one of those things are true. Let's go find the truth. You know what I mean? That doesn't exist anymore because people just want to Google that shit, get on and move on with their day, you know, and, and it's laziness on our part and a lot of people don't want them. It's like fucking this thing that everybody's posting with the Goddamn fucking Instagram. I don't give you permission.

Speaker 4:          00:48:19       Use Ebay. I read a whole other thing that says the average American, I believe signs one or two legal documents a day without reading them. And just by logging into shit on your phone, Amazon or Instagram or whatever you, every time you do that you, you subscribe and, and, and, and adhere to their terms and conditions. And some you think a picture of a copied and pasted Instagram thing over something that was from Facebook fucking 12 years ago. It's, it's bananas, bananas. People get roped into things. You know, one person see smart people posting in the sand. Better safe than sorry. Like I've seen that too. What argument is that? They don't know how to Internet. They don't know how to Internet. I'm just saying even if just like you suspect it's wrong, but you know, fuck it anyways. It's like, wait, wait. That's, if you suspect it's wrong, take the extra time or just don't do it at all.

Speaker 4:          00:49:15       Like what do you mean? I'm just using that as an example of how, why we're with the state of things are as they are. Yeah. It's a sneaky little loophole. That's a sneaky little thing that happens to you. You have to, everybody's posting something stupid. Did you send it to me? Oh, Everlast sent it to me. It must be legit. Just post it. You know what I mean? How many times have you done that? I've done that all the time. I was some clown in it and then immediately after it Dana came up. It was him posting the exec they name with the whole like better safe than sorry thing. Christ, you know they gone mad. Oh dude, they got everybody though. They got that fucking grade Perry guy. Everybody. Everybody isn't big Perry's job like fucking protect the nukes or something like governor or something posted to Rick. What did Rick Perry, they said Rick Perry pub, but, but he has a specific job in a government. It's like the energy, the energy secretary. He's like in control. The News, right? Is that what it is? Energy Secretary? Yeah, you are. I don't know. Whatever the fuck he is. He's got a big job and he fell for it.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       Oh, it's bizarro world when bizarro world. Maybe that fucking kid is right. I'm telling you, dude, you're Yo, you're going to be calling

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       me in a couple nights like, fuck you dude. Why did you even tell me about that? I've really about, I've bounced the idea of multiple universes many times. We all have, but this kid watch it. Just you're going to invest it, give it 20 minutes or 1518 minutes, whatever it is, and then you'll be like, oh wow. It's, it's not that. It's Oh fact. It's, but it's like, wow, that's super possible. It's super, super possible. The way he breaks it down. What about this? What if every time you went to sleep and you woke up, you passed into a nearby, very similar universe, but not quite the same. And depending upon your choices and how you live your life, it's how you wake up and what new one you pop into and the other side. And everyone's just a little bit different. The whole world changes just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       Each time you make a decision, one way or another, everything changes. When you wake up, you think the world is static because it is when you're awake and you have no fucking idea what's happening while you're asleep. And when you wake up again, you have this foggy recollection of the past and that's what you're going by. You're going by every morning, waking up with a foggy recollection of the past. That's what you're doing and you're, you're assuming that nothing's changed and everything static. And while you were asleep for eight hours, nothing weird happened. You know the fuck you're talking about. You have no idea. You're dreaming. You're crazy fantasies. It shit weird stuff has happened and you're fucking mermaids. You're flying through the air on a, uh, on a helicopter, you know, you don't, you weird things happen when you're dreaming. What is all that about?

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       We don't even know. We have no idea what that is. That soup of possibilities. It's fucking swirling around in between your ears while you're snoring up a storm and then boom, you wake up. Are you sure those memories are real? Are you sure that this is in a whole completely new university you're living in today or simulation or simulation? There was some ice simulations out on that one right there. There was some fucking, another genius super wizard kid who was talking about that, that, that something about simulations. I forget what, I was high at the house with mom, with the guy who runs my studio divine and, and, and, and we were just fucking laughing, talking shit one day hire like, like what if like I may have heard this could have been on your show, I could have read this. So I'm not claiming like ownership of the thought, but it was like, what if like we just come from a universe like this.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       So perfect and shit and it's boring as fuck and we just plug in to have all these fucked up like weird problems. And that's why everything's getting fucking weird or in crazier because like that's kind of why we're here. That's part of the ride, you know? That could be it. It could be the only way you appreciate love is to no hate. They'll really appreciate it. And it could be the only way we would appreciate all the good that we have is to balance it out with all the bad that we have. And when they start to overwhelm each other one way or the other, there's an imbalance that takes place and leads to all of our fucking problems as a society. And when you think about how long you're going to be alive and what it is that you're doing here and why you're doing it, you know all those weird questions and answers that go on inside your head. It's all you're distributing energy, right? You're trying to figure out, am I distributing my energy right? My, uh, am I living my life in a way that is like the best I can do with what I've got right now.

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       That's it. All these mind fucks. That's all you gotta do though. I mean as even no matter what we're saying, if you woke up every day and that was your objective. Yeah. You couldn't really go or do much wrong. No, no you can't. And what if every day when you did that woke up in the nearby universe that was just to live a bit different because of what you thought and dead dude, that's like, you know, that's a movie magic type Shit. Everlast some movie magic type Shit. I just was like, I tried to be a not such a glutton. There we go. Salute Silo DJ Melody over there. I just wanted to cheers. How bout cheers. Let's go. American guys sent pictures. Cheers. GJ Yeah, you gotta you gotta DJ Bro. The only guy ever. I didn't see the shooting. I believe besides myself as honey, honey man.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       No. [inaudible] I think they're the only one. We're the ones that have done music on the shore. Not totally true. Is that true? You might be right. You were definitely the first. And then Gary Clark brought his guitar, but we just chill. I'm a huge fan of that. I think will brought his guitar the first time. He might not even brought his guitar first time. Joe Simpson Sturgeon. Yeah. No, I hung out with him once. [inaudible] sneaker shop on Melrose. They have a new song that he just released. His new album is fucking incredible. I got a chance to listen to it in advance before it's released and they just released something on youtube. It's like this Japanese Anamae with a, what is the, what's the name of the actual video so people could find it on day two, sing along, sing along. It's fucking amazing song. But the video was coolest shit man.

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       It's all this Japanese anime. So he did all of this, uh, the did like all these crazy animations. He's, that's like a film that takes place while the album plays. Oh Shit. Yeah. So it's all coordinated to the songs. I mean, he's been working on this shit for ever. He's been flying back and forth to Japan and La. I mean this is a labor of love. No, it's like to style. Incredible. I met him, like I said, my buddy owns a sneaker shop on mill road and he was, I guess a bit of a sneakerhead himself. Oh really? Politics. Sturdy Shit. He's one of my favorite people. I like the stuff to the music that the country kind of outlawish like, but like big band dish. Yeah. You know what I love about that guy? He didn't even try to go for it as a professional musician until he was like 36 his wife talked him into it. His wife was like, you know, you don't suck. That's like

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       what? She said, that's, that's great. That's high praise. And she's like, you're fucking

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       good. And he's, and he went for it for somebody who wakes up with Aaron, goes to bed with you so you don't suck. I mean, that's what I praise, you know. But he had like crazy jobs, like railroad worker, shit like that. Like did a bunch of like regular jobs and just was writing music and singing music. And then she convinced him to go for it. Yeah. He's an unusual character, man. This stuff, this, all this new stuff is different. I, it's like he used to be, you would think of him as country, like you can even, you don't even know what to say now with his new stuff is not country. It's wild though. It's really good. Check it out. Yeah. It's like it's a, this kind of hybrid rock thing he's doing, but it's pretty fucking bad ass.

Speaker 2:          00:57:31       This is Waylon. Waylon had sex with Queens of the Stone Age while the black keys watched first comment on the video. Who said that? Who's named that guy? Top comment shall be Riley.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       Shelby. Riley, congrats. Congrats. You won. You won the Internet for the day. That is exactly what it sounds like. It's really good stuff. He's a sing along. You said that was good. Yeah. I'm checking out now. It's doing weird shit. That's the only thing that's doing it, man. It's, you know, and I, you know, weird shit in the sense of like, Yo shit that excites you since you said like, you know, you know, don't worry. I'm not, I've never tried to make the same thing twice, you know, cause it's like I want to be excited. I want to be scared to fail. You know what I mean? Yeah. I want to, I want to be like, you know, oh that didn't work next time. Yeah. Well you, you've always switched shit up. That's one of the more interesting things about you. It's like when, when you were doing what it's like and when you switched up to like Whitey Ford sings the blues, everybody was like, Whoa,

Speaker 2:          00:58:31       what is this? Is this is, this is the jump around. God is the house of pain guy.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       But it it, it was a,

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       it felt so easy to digest for most people because this is before I knew you and I was like, it's so easy because it's so authentic. I gets very obvious that this was the kind of music that you were writing was like music that like came from your feelings and your soul. It was like, wow, this is real shit. And I was 2020 years ago, what it's like was a classic. That was a classic. That was one of those songs was like, that's a heartfelt song. That's how soul filled song,

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       you know, that's like a universal song. Yeah. I went to, uh, New York. I left house of pain and went to New York with a buddy of mine and was kind of sleeping on his couch

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       and he had a guitar there. I started streaming it one night and singing these little words and he came Barston out at his room in the back like, what the fuck is that? And kind of was like, we're recording. That's why we were making a rap record. I was like there to like just kind of further the rap career and nobody really knew I played guitar and stuff like that a little bit. So, but it was his, his, his encouragement. It definitely came back. Like when he was like, I think he was with it broad back there and he just heard the song and jumped out like, wow, what the fuck is that? You know what I mean? And so the next day he, they basically forced me to record it so I had to finish. Right. I had wrote it like that night I had, I think I had the first part, the whole liquor store guy at the liquor store thing, but I didn't really have anything else.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       But he heard that part and was like, Yo, we need to finish that. When you get those ideas, when they come to you, what does that feel like? Does it feel like, like a gift comes out of the universe? The mouth, the really good ones? Yeah. You know what I mean? I mean, what blows my mind, and I'm gonna flip it on you real quick, is, is the, the, the comic art arc of you get to work this thing out for a whole long time and if you're really successful on your level type thing, then you shoot a special and that joke kind of goes away. You can't, you know, really get to tell that anymore. And that blows my mind because like my whole thing is like work this thing out and build this thing that I can go out and play every night for the rest of my life.

Speaker 4:          01:00:51       So like you're, you know what I mean? Like, so all the Kudos being thrown back and forth when I look at you or any amazing comedian that just turns it around and every year or two years is belting out these fucking funny ass specials and then like you can't do that anymore. Like, you know, unless you're Andrew dice clay with the little fucking Hickory dickory dock, you know, and you got the little later. You don't only guy ever that. You want to hear the old stuff over and over and over again like Oh, I don't know. See a whole set of just rhymes or even like, I'm like, and now there's like, you've familiar with this with little Duvall comedian like you know, and hit the whole singing. Like, I mean he's like turning it into, he's flipping this whole script on what comedy and music and entertainment is right now.

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       He's kind of doing some really fucking interesting shit. Also got a bunch of crazy shit going on. His Instagram. Is Instagram hilarious too. He's got something I need them. Favorite follows him. He started like, he starts cultural phenomenon. US. Yes. Here, you know like he set shit off. Like I've watched him say some shit on his Instagram and will it into existence and it becomes like a trend or a [inaudible]. The songs he's written, it's just like, it's amazing. It's like really like, no, it's a, it's a really, it's one of my favorite follows, honestly. Yeah. He's something special. Andrew Schultz really made me take a, I'm an, I, I knew about that song. Smile Bitch actually found out about that song because style bender style bender would come out to with smile

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       bitch. And he came out to fight when they talked about it, he goes, ah, I love bill Duvall. I'm like, Oh, let me check out little Duvall. And I was like, God damn, this guy's good. And then Andrew Schultz says, Yo, he's a comedian. And he goes, he's one of the most insightful and brilliant people I've ever met. And just like, almost like a naturally curious guy. Get him on. Yeah, always. We're working on it. Yeah. We're going to make it happen. But Schultz is, it's going to be, Schultz is a wizard. Schultz tells me that someone's good, I'll buy it. Yeah. And it's like, and he was early Internet like dude, like he's been working these like Internet angles kind of lay you got in really early, saw some he liked and he's got his own thing going on with the, he's got his own thing going on with that whole city boys country boys thing.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       But that's all in relation to the song. I know, I know, I know, I know. But it's hilarious how people like each other. It's like a daily thing. You don't follow him. Go. Yeah go go. He's one of the best falls little Duvall. Just shoot me some tickets to your next show in La. I'm a huge fan that said you'd go to however millions on this show followed little new wall cause he's hilarious and funny and yes. Follow him to make sure that he's not really shadow band anymore. That shit's crazy. I got a friend who going through that right now. Like we're like they just disappear. I felt like shit when you search for him, [inaudible] is up there now they're ghosting you. I feel like it's always how you can find them. Okay, good. Yeah, they are telling you, man, you couldn't find them for awhile. There you go, Andrew. It was tricky.

We didn't, even when I came in last time we did, I think we agreed to just fucking not talk about our Sushi Shit. Like we were both like kind of a little traumatized. That's me. Right. And um, cause what happened was I put this record out last, what do I think? October, right. Hit the road and you know, maybe two weeks in and get a picture of my house on fire. I had to fly home. So yeah, this records out. But we're right now in the cloud where right now I just shot a video for the, for a new song and where we releasing, cause I own everything. It's my label. We're just going to rerelease you know, O g Everlast on all the whatever, whatever's, you know, formats you could find me.

Speaker 4:          01:09:36       Do you feel like when you get through something like a fire with your family that like for some inexplicable reason you feel like a little bit closer? Oh yeah. Cause, I mean, my wife and children were in the house when it was caught fire, you know, I mean, so yeah, I'm not literally, here's how it went down. Let's tell the story, right? Uh, basically I said I was in New York. I get a call from the wife, the fire's right across the hill, like I live literally like Simi Valley, then the mountains, Bang. I'm kind of the first line right there once you come over those mountains. Um, so I get a picture like from her, like the across the street from either of the hills, just like it looks like hell landscape. You know what I mean? As fucking just on fire. And I'm so they're packing up and they're getting ready to get out and there's a fire truck in the neighborhood.

Speaker 4:          01:10:27       Thank goodness. And as my wife's putting the final like stuff in the car, like the kids are running, they're just putting all the dogs and you know, whatever the net, the medicines and stuff we need for Layla. And she turns around and sees like on the corner of the garage, like an orange kind of glow. And the thing about this is like, you know, people think the fire comes in his street and then Johnson Burns all these houses. That's not what happens. If you ever noticed in the middle, if you're watching the news shit, it's like one random house in the neighborhood bar is trees as having a tree right on your house, just touching your house. Well I happened to have a tree right there that was touching the corner of my garage. The tree went up, that thing caught garage went about a third of the house went, you know what I mean? Um, you know where everybody was out already. My wife was able to, the only reason a third of the house and whole like my wife

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       saved our whole block honestly because there's trees between every, all of our houses like for privacy, you know, cause everybody has a pool and everybody wants, you know, nobody wants to be in two story houses, all that shit. So everyone just has these big, huge, like those just spiny looking trees, you know what I mean? Like go head cover, turning to a wall basically. Right. All the whole, the whole block would have went up, has she not been there and had the wherewithal to run down a block and get the firemen that had just drove by and say come back and fucking put this out. She actually ran, she ran down the block and got it done. She's a gangster. She's a gangster out here was so it's so hard for people to understand what it was late. It was frightening. It was like a war.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       It was phrased like we were at war with a natural force. It was very strange man is that everybody was holed up together. Um, me and my family, we get a hotel in town with a bunch of our friends. We were texting, we were texting back and forth and Tommy and his wife, Thomas Gert and his wife, they came over to and we were all in the same place and it was like we were all like refugees for like a small, tiny period of time. It makes you realize how fortunate we really are to be here in this, you know, this place like where we're at right now where we can just, we don't have to deal with most of the bullshit that people are dealing with all over the world. Man. You know, we just one day of fire, one week of fire, whatever it was that freaked everybody out and scare the shit and a lot of people lost their lives or houses rather.

Speaker 1:          01:12:33       A lot of people also lives in northern California. Right. I know that was, that's why it's like even worse than down. Couldn't even it was, yeah. You couldn't even like really get a perspective like for your own shit. Cause the minute you wanted to like do that, you saw an entire town flattened in like an hour. They lost him on the highway and people were trying to get out on the highway and they get caught in their cars and they caught fire. Man, it's horrible. And there's um, you know, for the people that survived, like for us, it sounds ridiculous to call yourself a survivor. It's not like it was a war, but it's something that you really understand when you get through that you're like, wow, like we are barely in control of our own environment. Barely. And all it takes is one good strong wind.

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       One good fucking hot day on one good Gusta fire and next thing you know everything's on fire. I mean that was nuts. The kids, the kids are still dealing with it. You know, I'm trying to explain that thing to the kids of like that universal unsurity like there's just not really, honey, I'm going to keep you safe as I can, but if you really want the absolute truth, I can only tell you that some shit happens. And you know, it was actually another big fire somewhere. Oh is oddly enough, when Notre Dame caught fire, it was all in the news and my daughter, my oldest was like, oh that caught fire. You know, cause she always me, I proposed my wife in, in Paris. So like we talk about Paris a lot so she, you know, looks forward to all that she wanted to see. She was really interested in Notre Dame when thing burnt. But then, but something about that burning and when it did and she saw it, she was like, oh it can happen anywhere. And it Kinda, and it kind of dawned

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       on her like, okay, it's not just there that plea. Cause for a long time I couldn't even drive by the house with her, like to go check on it or something. But if she was in the car and my wife either, cause she just didn't want to be over there. Right. And then after that it kinda changed and she kind of realized like, well it's, I guess it's Kinda can happen anywhere you have it can happen to note it. Which was a crazy thing to witness happen in a human like person, like come to that understanding of like, wow, shit's just not guaranteed. Like in a weird way, you know, but isn't there kind of a, there's a magic of that. Yeah. If you can get through, if you serve, if you're one of the survivors is a magic in that, that doesn't exist without the possibility of that.

Speaker 4:          01:14:50       I have people asking me, what are you going to do? And I'm like, what do you mean? They're like, you're going to build a house in the same spot. I'm like fucking God. Damn right. You know what mean? Absolutely. I don't live in like some crazy bizarro like place. I'm going to build my house right where I was. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do with the House on top of a hill that's put the sprinklers on your house like that. People have the sprinklers. There was a neighbor there was catched that whole neighborhoods burned down and then the one house I had the sprinklers, that couch was pristine. The problem with that is you do get survivor syndrome. You feel you feel weird. You see get survivor guilt of the first three houses in front of me right in front of my house. You know what three houses gone that I could understand that if, if, if you were like the guy who kind of futuristically predicted a fire and put that on and where but after now it's like, Yo, if you didn't put shit on that, everybody knows about that shit. Now, so put this shit in your house or you know, if you're going to live in one of these areas, we're basically in California, they're telling us now this might be a new norm, you know what I mean? These kind of fires, you know, so cause there hadn't been one in the area, you know the air, those areas I go go red hills and Simi Valley and there hadn't been one for many, many, many, like a couple decades. I believe climate change is not real. No, it's fake. It's fake news.

Speaker 2:          01:16:07       It's something that something's clearly happening. Right. This is not normal. Right. If you had to guess my 36 years, so it seems like there's had been an adjustment.

Speaker 4:          01:16:17       I've been the same Irish, white motherfucker all my life and I didn't burn like this when I was young. When did you move to la? Oh, I've been hearing most of my life. Like I was born in New York and whatever and probably did a, a um, kindergarten part of first grade out there. And then for the, like my dad was a construction dude, like during the 70s, boom of like Simi Valley and all that shit and being built. He came out during that era, nobody talked about crazy fires back then. Did they? They didn't, not really

Speaker 2:          01:16:45       the first I got evacuated for the first time while we were filming fear factor. And I remember I was driving home and it started, there was a fire, it seemed like it was a little bit out of control but like wow this is crazy and I'm driving to work and then we filmed the day and then as we're driving home people are letting us know, hey man this is bad. This has gotten really bad. And uh, as we were driving home, a guy got hit a car

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       and he got killed and uh, I didn't see his body but I saw a shoe and really like passing by or like all these people were freaking out because the guy apparently just tried to run into the highway and some guy hit him cause he was panicking cause he was, there was a bunch of shit going on. There was fire, I don't know if he was panicking, but something happened. The guy got hit by a car, so has this ominous feeling of, whoa, somebody just died and we're driving down this highway and the whole right side is on fire. I mean the whole right side of the highway for an hour, like a lord of the rings movie more door dude was like, flakes of ash are falling from the sky like a, like a light snow. It's fucking strange. You just waiting for demons to come riding on fucking horses over the top of the hills.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       It's that bad. And uh, by the time I got back, we had to evacuate from our community and we'd just get the fuck out of dodge. That was the first time that had ever happened ever for me. Uh, living out here since 94 and that was in like 2000, two, three, something like that. And then it's happened twice since then. It's a creepy feeling, man. It's creepy. It's like, you know that no one can do anything if everything goes wrong. If everything goes wrong and the wind gets too strong. And it gets too wide. He goes left and it goes right and everything starts swirling around and ashes fly through the air and they land on other people's houses. Like you gotta get the fuck out of there, just get out of there as a storm of fire.

Speaker 4:          01:18:42       Well, but it's like, all right, so the, I get a picture, the last thing before I get on a plane is a picture of my garage engulfed in flames. Right. So I get on this plane, I gotta take like three planes cause it's like last minute booking and it's all coach. I'm pissed. You know what I mean? I'm like, I'm like, I'm not, I'm just like tucked in corners on the walls. Like everything. I just fly like of to Dallas than to Vegas. And just to get there the quickest and it was like three flights. So I get there. I think the whole way there, I'm like, my house is burned to the ground. You know what I mean? That's, I've, I'm accepted. I'm dealing with those whatever, five stages of grief and like I'm getting to acceptance and then I get home and I a not even at home.

Speaker 4:          01:19:24       I had my wife and kids were at my studio and like, you know, that's where we're, we're laid up from, you know, just trying to figure out what the fuck's going on. I can't get to the house because the whole one-on-one shut down that way I have to literally drive up to paying a hit the one 18 take that out all the way out to like the 20 whatever it is, the three 23 or 27 I don't know. It's one of the, I know it's the 23 it's like out there and you come back down and come around the other way. And I was able to get to the house, I got to the house, I got in my house, literally had 20 fucking cop cars roll in. Like, cause looting was fucking out of control dude. And they're like, oh Gora and Calabasas areas park.

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       It was oak park. Yeah. Well that's, that's, I don't, I think that is a Gora and, and the same thing. Yeah. But yeah, the whole over there was fucking like off the chain with fucking looting. So like I had monk pull up on me. I literally knew like I sh I brought my lease and my father and I, my, my, my mortgage and my electric bill and I brought my, I, you know, I had all my shit so they doesn't miles and I, and they were cool but it was like I pulled up and like saw most of the house standing and like broke down cause I'm a, I'm a big art collector and August. So I was like, I had already liked, just assumed it was all gone, you know. And you know, it was crazy. It was a crazy experience to like pull up in Nice, see like two thirds of it there and you're like, oh wow. Like maybe there's salvage like in the salvage shit. Like they was like, oh, crazy experience man. I'm grateful that my family is safe and all that and all the rest of it is replaceable stuff. But I got extremely lucky. Yeah, no the most,

Speaker 2:          01:21:05       I mean it's like such a cliche thing to say that your health and your happiness and your family is the most important thing. You know, that everybody knows that we are even us. Fucking psychopath knows that. But to feel it, to feel it like in the presence of a natural fury like fires, like wildfires. It's humbling and in the strangest of ways it makes you love each other more, makes you nicer to people. All my refugee friends in her, when we're at the hotel that night, you know, the refugees from the fire, we're all like closer. We're like happy for sure. You know, in a weird way, you know, we're having drinks together, we're toasting, we're hugging, you know, we're in a hotel hiding from a natural fury and you realize like, oh, OK we, we, we have, we have, we get soft when we hit a soft spot. And that's not necessarily good for anybody. And occasionally these are horrific things that happen are good for us overall. Cause they let us appreciate like there's consequences to his consequences to live in here. There's consequences to everything being so hot and dry and never fucking raining. And the fact that it may or may not be getting a little [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          01:22:18       a little warmer, maybe no, maybe who gives a fuck if people have

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       do with it, who cares? Let's pretend that's not even a factor. Something's happening. Something's happened. And we got firestorms like every few years. The God damn firestorm, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:22:35       craziness man. Well, we survived your brother. Yeah. This salon HSA Salon, there's only so much you can think about. Like you, uh, you know, you haven't gone through that man. If you written shit that has a, like the, the touch of that honor. Um, like in, in like a, a very kind of creative state like state at the moment. Like, so we're, I don't what's there's, there's, I'm sure there's elements of it and what I'm like starting to play with right now. Do you sit down and write like on a piece of paper or do you write why you, yeah. For me, writing is a visual process. Visual, yes. And I can't, if I write it down, it becomes two dimensional. And I've never, I've, I've written lyrics that I thought were genius and actually committed them to paper and saw them and they beat and they, it's like they dissolve from this three dimensional beauty to like, oh, it's two dimensional garbage.

Speaker 4:          01:23:38       It's fucking bizarre. I know it's not always like reasonable, but it's my process at this point. How's it visual? It's if you really listen to my songs, they're like photograph. Like it's like flipping through a photographic album almost. If you really listened to like what I'm doing, that's like very visual. I see the pictures, I equate it to like, did you ever watch the show Oz? Sure. I remember the poet guy who, who, who was illiterate but he drew pictures and that's how he recited his poems from pictures. It's similar. It's like, but it's kind of reverse. It's in my brain. It's, it's there. So you're seeing your visual in terms of like the stories that you're painting, like the guy outside the liquor store or the imagery? Yes. Or like, you know, a song like black Jesus where it's like just kind of cultural like fucking pop culture reference after reference leading down a path of just like a stream of consciousness, pop culture references, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:24:32       I'll go on tangents, you know what I mean? But it'll be all within an energy in the inside the brain, you know what I mean? Like once I commit them, I even like after the fact, like when you turn in like music to like entities that have shows or whatever, they want to know the lyrics so they can know if they should put it on air or this, you know, it depends on whatever, if it's public now. But even when it comes to that, I have to have, I have to like recite it to somebody and have them type it, I can't, it'll, it'll just kind of taint it to me. Wow. See it written down in my hand, you know what I mean? And in another hand, it doesn't bother me, but like for me to come to do it, it, it, it, it like it breaks a barrier of some sort and then everything.

Speaker 4:          01:25:15       Vaporizes so do you, uh, how do you capture the various beats? Do you record it as you're coming up with it? There's a, there's a few different ways of Hams from me. Like, you know, if I'm doing like a hip hop ish or hip pure hip hop project, I'll, there'll be a beat involved always first. You know, I mean there'll be somebody who have a track and we'll be like, oh, that's the track we're going to commit to this and we'll write lyrics to it and it'll be just kinda like I said, I'll, I'll drive around a lot with rap stuff and just let it bump and see what word starts popping up. I like word play and pouncing word play, but I'd know it can't just be worth played for the sake of it. It has to like tie into some sort of like idea. Um, when it comes to a song, it's usually I string together some simple chord progression and, and start and, and see and, and if I,

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       once I've see something I really like, it'll just, like I said, pictures will start coming up and you kinda just try to describe the picture a little bit. And sometimes you, you come across poetry when you're describing the picture and you'd be like, that's good. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of like not that's not good and that's not good. There's a lot of that. There's a lot of that. It seems like a mere process to stand up comedy. It's a mirror process,

Speaker 4:          01:26:27       except I get to hold onto mine. Even if they record it and make a special, I still can play mine. And that's, that's what I was with. I, man, comedians are just, that's a little bit, it's a different commitment because like you're, you're bringing, you're like, it's almost like a chow you're raising that you have to watch the life of it finish in a weird way. I'm not, you know what I mean? We both have children. That's extreme, but I know what you're saying, but like you're, you're taking this idea from kind of garbage idea that, you know, there's a premise there and then like over a fucking series of fucking shells or nights or fucking maybe months. You, you find it, you know, with different audiences and then you got it and yet you get to rocket for maybe six months good. And all these places and then you go and record it and make that special. If you're lucky enough to be on that level, you know, it's almost like I almost envy the [inaudible]. I wonder if you guys ever envy the comic who quite, it doesn't quite have that yet. So he can like he has this, you know, bevy of material that he hasn't had to trash yet. You know what I mean? As they talk to the

Speaker 2:          01:27:29       Roy would about that. It was just on right before you hit. That's one of the things that he said that you shouldn't do TV for like 10 years. Like don't do, it's like catalog man. It'll come up with that. I'll get it like the first time you do anything that people get to see like be hardened, like be Polished Samurai of stand up, you know? But I disagree. I say let them see everything. Let them see all the bullshit, all this stuff that sucks. All the terrible jokes. Who Cares? Just keep going. Especially if the progressions there. Then it's like, Oh, you see what? Just keep going and it's good for everybody to see. People don't want to think you just like someone who just figured it out instantly. No, it's good to see these sucked. It's good for everybody. It might be bad for your ego, but it's good for you.

Speaker 2:          01:28:12       When your ego get takes a hit. It's always good. It's always good. It puts everything in perspective. You know? Don't you think like as an artist too, like the thing that gets in your way more than anything, it's your ego, right? The thing that gets in the way more than anything, it's for sure the way you view yourself. You want people to view you. I wouldn't produce my own records until like maybe two albums ago because I felt like if I'd made it through an album without being like seriously challenged, I didn't make the best record I could. And then just being involved with a bunch of really seriously good producers, I learned to challenge myself and, and even the records I've produced for myself, there's other guys involved producing with me that are, that I know are going to be the ones, if that's something, hey that sucked. But you know what I mean? You're going eat dad guy around the, or even a

Speaker 4:          01:29:01       guy just to challenge you how committed you are to certain ideas, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:29:06       How much time do you spend going over? Like when you have a song and you're like, I think, I think this song is solid. Do you, do you it outside of singing the song? Do you ever go over the song and ponder like what you're saying or how you're saying it? Like, how do you, because your stuff is so, it's so interesting because you're, you're, you're telling these stories of your experiences in these songs and in a lot of them and you're also having fun and you're also talking shit, you're having a good time with them as well. But when you decide, okay, this one is going to be recorded like this, how do you make that conclusion?

Speaker 4:          01:29:46       For me, it's, uh, again, if there's not like, cause I can also, even if I'm not doing necessarily a straight rap song, there's times when I get atrack from a producer that I just love the track and I'll build something around that. Other than that, it'll again start with a guitar and I'll either, um, create a, a very, uh, rudimentary drum beat and lay down the guitar and maybe a vocal and I have a very unique voice. You know, it's not like it's there between the guitar and the voice tone start appearing that like resemble other instruments to me. Like it almost starts telling you what to do. Oh, that's not, that sounds, I could hear her Rhodes in there or I, you know, the baseline, I should do that. You know, you can hear that. And the guys I surround myself with are beasts that hear the same, you know, they know, oh yeah, this, I hear that, let's do it.

Speaker 4:          01:30:37       You know, you can start a song, we'll tell you what to do with it. You know, if you really listened to it. I believe that. Cause I, I kinda, uh, you know, one of the things Santana told me, you know, that I always held onto was like, you know, because, and I've experienced this once or twice where I've written very similar songs to friends of mine or people I know that was like, Whoa, I maybe not sounding, but like the idea of wow, I wrote something that was exactly. And he said like, you know, we're all just saying antenna that are like catching energies and shit and like bringing them in and we're, you know, bringing Megan some out of that energies. And sometimes people catch that same energy and similar things happen, you know? And so I always look at a dad. I, I look at my ideas like this also because I don't write them down.

Speaker 4:          01:31:22       I equate it to like my children like this. Like my ideas are like little animals that are wild and I, I see them and I think they're amazing and I want to, and so I, I, I'll play a song until I know it so well. It has to stick around if I train it to stay and if it stays the next morning, that's, this kind of answers your question. The next day. If I arrive, I'm on to some and I write a song, I'll sing it 200 times. If I get it close to done and then I'll go to bed. And then if it's there in the morning in the, in the same, I'm recording. If it's gone, I didn't, it wasn't mine and has happened a lot too. Brave move. Yeah. I have the opposite cowards approach. If I get an idea, I'll run away from everybody, my, my fingers in my ears and write it down, you know, hear what I said. I'll sing it 200 times. You know what I mean? So if I've done it 200 times and I don't wake up and know it, it's fucking trash. I write everything. It's not supposed to happen. I have the total opposite approach in terms of writing comedy. I write, how many specials have you made in your life?

Speaker 4:          01:32:35       I never counted rough guess. It's like eight or nine. Alright. That's how many albums I've done in almost 30 years. Yeah. You know what I mean? So it's like I'm not turning them out like that. I thought, you know, and I don't, again, because of that, there's not like this crazy archive of garbage that's going to be released when I'm dead. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. Cause I even saw as I started to record, if I get halfway through it and I'm like not even satisfied with it, it gets erased. You know what I mean? There, there's a few things out there that, that I, that I probably wouldn't have released, but they're not there like from house of pain days and they're not bad. I've just like, they weren't for, they didn't have a purpose. I think it's good for people to see bad shit from great artists.

Speaker 4:          01:33:22       I do. I think it's good. It's good. It's good for everybody. I have no problem. I mean, I'm the guy that fuck, I'll fuck up live and talk about it for five minutes of the show and be like, Yo, at least you know it's not on fucking tape. Right. And I'll be like, that's real shit. You know, and I'll, I'll, you know, I'm with that. I'm just like, it's my process. It's like, just the way I do, like again, also, I think it has to do with, I had some really hard core producers like DJ Muggs and my man, Dante Ross, these were dudes that would be like, that fucking was garbage do it again. It's for so long that that's, I'm a re, the first time now is going to be decent. You know what I mean? So it's like I gotta push myself to, for it to be better than decent.

Speaker 4:          01:34:00       Otherwise I just clip it. Yeah. Well, that's the only way you could be as productive as you are. Like you've a, you have a well oiled approach, you know, but I don't put out a lot of music, but when I know for a fact when you put something out, you're happy about it. Oh yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm content. That's when you put it out, you're in a great position, man, that you can kind of of decide what to do and when to do it. Writing Three of the biggest songs in the 90s with what is like jump around and put your lights on. Well that was 2000 I think so, but that little period, I know and I, I wrote those songs, jump around with mugs, what it's like and put your lights on totally on my own. That, that provided me with something that I cherish.

Speaker 4:          01:34:51       Like some people cherish private jet rides, which is I can do whatever the fuck I want and still live pretty decent. Not Super Rich Guy or anything, but like better than average. Oh, you got a good life. Take care of my family. But creatively I could do whatever the fuck I want and it's a beautiful thing, man. As I, the older I get like I'm on my whole new shit. My slogan is, fuck it. I'm 50 man. That's my new shit dog. I'm on. Like, I know you ain't gonna Rattle me, man. I'm 50 I don't even care. How's that? If you're, there you go. I'll just try to have fun. Live my life. Go home. Hug My kids. Yes. And fucking know that nobody fucked with them in school. And then they had a gray day and there my universe is complete. Yes. Yeah. Fucking them 50 fuck it. I'm 50 yeah. Beautiful. We need more people to think like that, man. I'm in time doing. I had a heart valve replacement at 28 dude, I didn't think I was gonna make 35 you know what I mean? Yeah. So fifties put that microphone in the chest we ever done in the west. So here, anybody who don't know this is, this is a heartbeat. It's not a watch. It's my heartbeat.

Speaker 4:          01:36:13       It's like a Goddamn metronome.

Speaker 9:          01:36:16       Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:36:19       Well, it's a titanium man. Wrap your head around that? No, I got alien technology in my chest. My to stay together. Hold the doors, don't fly off that thing. Click, click, click. That's crazy. Yeah. It's basically a very simple thing. It's like a ring that goes in the valve and it's like a spring kind of activated flap that is totally self propelled by the heart's pumping up the blood. It pumps the blood out of the flap and then the flap kind of snaps back and that's what you're hearing is the tic has just the spring of that and it's all, I mean, I can take my pulse without w it would just sit in here. Do you know what I mean? I can take my pulse without even thinking about it. Modern technology is so amazing. St Jude's, Val shout out that the St Jude's people, whoever invented that shit, bleep up from the motherfucker.

Speaker 4:          01:37:08       Vega stars is doing whatever they can figure out a way to make your heart work again with a fake valve. Click, click, click. It's wild and that's why you're here. That's why I'm still here, man. It's amazing. I've been wondering afterwards like why, why did it, why it, what killed John Ritter? What killed him was exactly kind of what happened to me, but I was able to get to the hospital faster. Did you ever meet that guy? No, but I know that like when it happened though, like people pointed it out. Like, isn't that what happened to you? I was like, oh yeah, that one. It was a special dude. He was on a, an episode of News Radio. Everybody loved him, man. Like so nice. I like wandering around the set, like friendly to everybody, like in a weird way, like a, like a, just a, he's a genuinely really nice guy who just making sitcoms and um, when he died I was like, oh yeah, that's one of them.

Speaker 4:          01:38:01       Things was just so nice when you find out that someone that's like, you feel like us and nothing's going to happen to him. He's so nice. And then one day the clutch, the plush of death. I was told by the people at the hospital when I went back to visit once that, um, a while after they had brought me in because it took them a minute to figure out what's wrong with me. The only reason they figured out what is wrong with me is because my actual doctor who's is this guy in Beverly Hills, I'm not gonna say anything cause I don't know if he wants that. But uh, he, uh, it was a member on the board of Cedar Sinai. So when they brought me in the hospital, all his records are computer accessible to them. So they found out about my history of like being born with this heart defect and cause up until then they heard rock dude, he's a musician.

Speaker 4:          01:38:47       They were like, all right, how many, how much cocaine did you do? And all my friends were trans. I mean, he doesn't do cocaine, you know, he's not that in there, like going out, if we give them the wrong drugs, we can kill him. And then all of a sudden, like the records came through. And that's what saved my ass. That along with the like, uh, the head of surgery there, like the guy who like did a double eight 99 hour surgery came off of one, told the guys they couldn't do my surgery because it was too complex. It's got Dr. William Trento, he's an amazing person. He will not mind me shouting him out. He like goes to South American, does all these free operations on kids' hearts. He's a fucking saint. This guys, I'll tell you off fucking show some other shitty did. That'll blow your fucking mind.

Speaker 4:          01:39:26       Like wow, that's who does that. But he's, he saved my life and you know, I've just been, like I said, I didn't expect to be here. 50. Fuck it. I'm 50 man. I got two little girls I've got, it's like a whole, my whole thing right now is I want to take my girls like in the next like week or two over to see him, just to be like, Yo dude, these people wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for you dude. Like I think I blew his mind a little bit. Fuck yeah. Wow. Shout out to all the people who fix hearts, all those people fix anything, fix all things. You know, if you fix shit, fucking salute. Right. That's a positive thing. Yeah. Fixed. Don't care if it's a sink or a heart or you fix it all. Anything in between, Dude. Yeah. And that weird fixing shit is good.

Speaker 4:          01:40:15       Fixing hearts though. That's like particularly good. Like when that guy sees you on TV and shit, he's probably fixed that in a minute. But yeah, he probably thinks that I fixed it up. Nice. Fixed it up. Nice. She enjoys music. Thank you. They enjoy my work. Fuck it. I'm going to tell this story. I'm gonna tell it. Here's the story. Okay. A few years after my heart surgery, like when I had my heart surgery, I didn't have, I didn't have medical insurance. I was young and dumb. Didn't, you know what I mean? Just didn't have it. And uh, so it fucking caused a real fucking, and it was like half a million dollar fucking hit. You know what, I, but I, you know, I didn't declare bankruptcy. I paid it all. And I think this dude heard about that and they are, I think guys like this must somehow invest in you when they know they saved your fucking life.

Speaker 4:          01:41:04       There's something, there's a connection after that. Like, oh, that's one of my guy, that's one of my guys right there. So a few years later, my mom, when I was young, had a, I believe Hodgkin's disease of what it was and she had radiation treatment and she beat it and all that. But 20 years later that shit wears on your heart valves and shit. She had to have a triple my pass. Like it was Kinda like, oh shit. Like I was out on tour, I had to come home, put her, I was like, I want that guy to do the surgery just because I'd, he'd already done mine. So he does my mom's surgery and this guy fucking, I get all the bills, you know, and then now I'm doing all right. So it was cool. I could, I get a bill from the fucking anesthesiologists. I get a bill from the fucking operating room and get a bill from the hospital and get a bill from this. I never got a bill from this man for my mom's surgery to just was like, Nah, that was on me. Wow. Fucking crazy. Who gets a surgery done on them? Right? That's an amazing guy. Who's crazy dude. That's amazing. No, this dude goes, and then I like started looking into who he was and this guy goes and does like fucking tons and tons of like sergeant surgeries on kids down in South America and he's just one of them dudes, man. Your mom on the house.

Speaker 4:          01:42:17       What? That guy saved your mom. All that guys. God bless her.

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       God bless him. God bless him. Yeah, man. It's um, there's nice people out there that really are, you know, we were fed this false narrative that everybody sucks because so many people do suck. But there's so many people, it's just a perspective issue. It's the same reason why people think the world is flat. They don't understand perspective, their perspective. When you talking about human beings and 7 billion people, we're just overflowing with people. There's so many of us. There's so many stories that people sucking, but it's all perspective issue because there's so many goddamn people and most of them are cool and most of them want to be cool and they would be more cool if they knew you were going to be cool. We all agree to be cool. We can be cool. We can have a better time here. We're wasting time with nonsense and arguments at all and and, and conflict. That all could have been disrupted from the very beginning by everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:43:17       This is why we need the alien invasion alien because a lot of people are invested in our law and a lot of shit that's meaningless. You know, we won't even go into it. We can all infer what they, what those things are between us and the audience can do the same. But what I'm saying is like, there's just too much fucking bullshit about dumb shit that we need some kind of outside fucking focus that will take us from outside ourselves and make us focus on something else or legalize my showroom, which might be

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       global warming, but that's, that's not real right now. Legalize mushrooms moved to Greenland. Trump's on it. Is there a trick? [inaudible] canceled his fucking trip to Denmark because they said they're not gonna sell him. Greenland is stuck in Chet now. He knows what he's doing. Listen, Trump's going to get his green land when you I, that fucking thing is like, I believe you said what? And then it's like, oh man, I can't. It's bizarro world. That's all. That's all people go to Greenland to bow hand, Dubbo Hunt. I think they bow hunt that, that gigantic fucking furry thing. What is that thing called? The muskox?

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       Google. Greenland. Muskox you ever see a mouse? Cox? You want to sell it? What? I want to see one and now I also want to know when I'm getting invited for an elk barbecue. Dude, come on. I mean I'm gonna, I'm going to put a kitchen in here, in this place. I have, I have plans. I'll tell you I'll come play it at this. Let me show you a mustache. 100% success rate on bowhunting and green land on a muskox cause he just walked right up to him. Oh, you know what it is because they, they have a, an instinct protect themselves against wolves. So they all huddled together when threats. So you could just catch them all in a group. Lympho Huh? Yeah, but look what they look like Bro. They didn't even look real. They look like something metal star wars. Those are kind of interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:45:14       But look, go to the side Jamie. Some of those other images when you see, yeah, they're like that. Perfect. Like you see that walking around, you'd be like, what the fuck is that? And he was like a Tauntaun. That's it. Same Lion fucked a elephant. Fucked a mammoth. What is that? A buffalo. What is that? The fuck is that thing. It was crazy as horns. Wild Mix. I go buffalo with a Tina Turner wig and duty can be 150 million degrees below zero. Those things just chill. They're just out there eating frozen grass and kids come from like their cheekbones to the crazy looking barely looks like a real thing. Barely. They're beautiful and apparently he's good there apparently. It's fucking fantastic. Yeah, that's awesome. My friend Brendan Burns shot one and um, I think he said he got his either in an Antarctica you can go to like really, really cold climates and get, I think it's like, is it north northern Canada or somewhere in northern Canada where you hunt them where it's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       Like you just get on a, you get to get pulled by g by snowmobiles or you get pulled by dogs and you go like way, way, way the fuck out. Where if you break down, if your snowmobile breaks down or if your dogs all die, you are fucked. I mean, you are so, so, so, so, so fucked because there's nothing man, there's nothing. There's the occasional polar bear and these fucking Muskox and they were up there and they're, they don't even look like real things. And you're stumbling across like imagine going through a white out snow storm to stumble a cost across this 2000 pound, enormous, gigantic, hairy prehistoric beast that you could just walk up to and shoot with a bow and Arrow and eat. That's, that's what's up there right now. They're like a remnant of the past, like to the saber to see what they like with this.

Speaker 2:          01:47:13       If the fight with those things, that'd be crazy. Use it to fuck up other males. That's what most of those animals, they're not fighting off predators with that shit. [inaudible] related to breeding and all that. For sure. They think some of it is like in some animals, depending upon how much pressure they get, um, from, uh, predators, like elk keep their antlers very late. They keep their antlers like into march and April. Uh, because, uh, a lot of them live around wolves and the idea is that they need those antlers to protect themselves from wolves. So they hold onto them longer than deer do biology. It's real crazy. Yeah, dude, we're so lucky. We're so lucky. We're out here out the food chain. Oh my God. Not only out the few chain. You had to go right down the street and get a fat stink tenor friend.

Speaker 2:          01:48:06       He just said on the agenda, I cannot the seed now and I would like to do it soon. You know our spot? Yeah. I'm sparking this man. Oh, you're crazy. Now, where does he live? On the edge. Do you have to lie? Oh, I won't do it. You don't use a lighter? Yeah. I'm saying, oh, it's right here. Oh, okay. I thought maybe you were one of those. I only use a mask and it will play into the next tune. We're going to do that. Come off the top. Yeah, they come off the top. Sorry, I wasn't even thinking that way. Oh, it's like a helmet. He kind of thing. I see. I think they fucked things up with that. That bony part in the front above their eyebrows. They keep those for life too. It's not like a deer, you know? Good deer loses their antlers every year.

Speaker 2:          01:48:45       These, these motherfuckers fucked up here. Do they? Does this show beautiful though? They're so beautiful. Like that one right there, Jamie. Clickable hair for church right there. Like above. Above about right there. Right there. Right there. Click on that. That's a beautiful creature. I mean, it's so amazing that nature can make fish. It can make, it's a title Buffalo. You can make that like buffalo or I don't know man. What is it? Bison related. Ox Ox. Muskox aren't they all related? Bison and all that. I wish I knew the kids. Kids. Facts, kids. Facts. Does it say it's cattle often compared to cattle cow with a big coat. Yeah. That's a northern cow to herbivore. Yeah. There you go. Wow. Furry island cow. Part of the vote. Bovie day family. All the species is family of two towed hooves, four chambered stomachs and our herbivores.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       So it's like kind of a cow type thing. Fuck. It's amazing. [inaudible] mutate them. Nope. Those, that's what we're supposed to be right now. Well, we're supposed to be right now. Some sort of stupid fucking hairy dumb ass is run around getting eaten by Shit with the aliens came down and said, listen, let's just plant some of our stuff and these monkeys and see what we can do. I'm man, dude, when they coming back from happened mass, what I'm saying, when they coming back, probably pretty soon it gotta be due. It's been brought up more and more in the narrative and every time we go to sleep we wake up in a new universe and I think along those lines that a, they're coming, they're on the way right now. We're just not quite ready yet. Everlast maybe you are, but some people are not. Some people, if the aliens were hovering over universal studios right now, guys lose their minds moving down to one oh one over the Hollywood bowl saying, well we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, and those little fucking times is the end or the beginning or whatever. It would be amazing. It would be very interesting. The whole thing would go down, you know what I mean? If it was the end of all the cool. Yeah. Let's, I mean I'm not incur, I'm not saying hey, break it off, but I'm saying if that's what it is it is, or if it's the next stage of like enlightenment and fucking, you know, all that goodness. What do you think people do if one of them like hovered over every major city?

Speaker 2:          01:51:09       You know what? I think what we're talking about is what would the majorly religious do because I think that would affect religious thought the most. Right off top. You know what I mean? Besides the fear of like what are they? What are they here for? Right. The first thing was like, Whoa, a whole bunch of ideology goes out the fucking window right now. You know? So that would cause a lot of panic and anxiety right there alone. You know, you tell them your, your, your whatever story of whatever religion. I'm not going. Yeah, we didn't even go there. We were like that. I like that thing. Let's look blanket it. Yeah. It's going to upset a lot of fo. You know what I mean? Right away. Just like, oh my God, that's not what we thought existed. We're the center of everything. You know, I think it would happen.

Speaker 2:          01:51:56       I think people would just start fucking flat earthers go out the window right away. That's is over. Maybe like the aliens travel here from another dimension, they have a new explanation for it. [inaudible] the thing about like being a flat earth or the thing about any kind of like thing that you could decide was already proven is that it doesn't matter what the facts are anymore. What matters is what people agree to. That's what's interesting about it. Like you realize that there's like a certain number of people you need to have to start a community and it doesn't have to make sense. You just have to have enough people that agree to it. If enough people agree to it, you can, uh, you can push, you can push some pretty preposterous ideas through and a bunch of people hop on board and they're happy to be on your group. That's the problem of groups. The problem with groups is people would just join groups. Isn't that the big lie? The big lie

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       there? They're being lie thing. Their whole mind comp. Yup. Big Lie theory. I believe that's theory. Oh Dyke where I'm

Speaker 2:          01:52:52       quoting that from. But I mean even if you think about a country, right? You think about a country and you think about America, which we both love and live in. Yes sir. W It's what is it? You know, it's an idea, right? It's an idea. It's an idea that everybody who's in this thing is cool to each other. Everybody's in this thing as part of a team. That's really what it is.

Speaker 4:          01:53:15       Bring us your broken mass and all that stuff from them in front of the, from the Statue of Liberty. Some more. I've been thinking, I think about this thing, your huddled masses is that that am I getting it? It's been a while and I know I'm 50. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       You're saying it's um, like whatever. We are like B, we are what we agree we are. We are all, we agree. We are like we don't, it's most of what we're in conflict about is fucking stupid. And as a country like we're supposed to be a, we're supposed to agree that we're all in this together. So if we're all in this together, it should be good for everybody. We could do that. We could do that better than we think we can. Way better, way better after. The problem is the conflict. Some of it's unnecessary, man, boom.

Speaker 4:          01:54:03       That's a good sound effect for that month. Perfect.

Speaker 2:          01:54:06       It's, you know, some of it is just unnecessary in these these moments, man. It's moments when we have fun moments, when we get together, moments when we hug moments when we'll have a drink together, homeless, we'll listen to some music moms when we're all leaving a concert together, a movie together that we realize like Raul in this together, we're all right. It's just like, can we just got to navigate it better? That's all it is. We're crashing into each other.

Speaker 4:          01:54:30       I honestly, he goes, he moments we mourn together. I mean honestly, I mean, I hate to say this but you know, I've see a lot of my older friends, more funerals lately than other events and, but they turned into celebrations, if you know what I mean. Cause we all understand like, all right man, well, Hey, I'm glad I am seeing you right now. Let's fucking, yeah, you know, and whoever it was that we're celebrating definitely doesn't want that. They want this for sure. I know when I go party the fuck up party fuck up and say like, yeah, God did. I did. I, he did. Was a pretty good dad ever. You, I've made a few bucks, made a few bucks. That's Dana Man. Dana, just play that song no matter what I man got love. I gotta get my 25 sets, man. I gotta get my 20 slap sets every episode, dog.

Speaker 4:          01:55:17       Man, come on. You begrudge me my 25 cents. I love it. I was walking out of the Octagon, I forget who, uh, who I was interviewing. My favorite is this, every once in awhile, like there's a few people who choose that song. Like, uh, Cynthia Cub. Kavio well, let's get out. Shout out to the first. Marcus Davis. Yeah. Marcus Degas. He did. He did the first day and then he went into the Trump around. But some people every once in a while, I don't know, maybe if they a bad song or something like out of nowhere, out of nowhere. One time like Leo Machida came out to jump around and I'm like, I texted dean, I was like, who the fuck picked daddy? He's like, I did. And he said [inaudible] he didn't go any further. And I was like, oh he must've picked the song. Dana hated her so well. Some of these cats, they'll choose music and Jan, it was like, Nah. And I think the Goto Jam, if you fucking picks it up, he doesn't like cause I'll be like, that was random man. I was like, how did, how did that happen? It's funny. It's funny when there's a song that plays all the time, it connects you to one of your friends. It's like as I'm walking out of the octagon, it's like, eh.

Speaker 4:          01:56:27       There was a period of about six years where anywhere Dana was, it could be, I could be, he could be on this side of world. I'm sleeping, so I'd get a phone call and it'd just be a phone in the air at a club. People play. I feel like, dude, come on. You guys nailed that song so hard. There's like moments in space time that get nailed. Just like you, you, you just hit something that resonates with people. I uh, I, uh, I, I still, uh, Danny's quote Danny Boy's quote of, uh, it's the Louie Louie of the 90s. It's the way little, it's just there. It's part of the like, it's, it's almost not mine anymore. It's like belongs to the universe. It's weird. Every ball game I go to, any event I go to, it gets played. And it's not even like a big deal about, it's like some places it's a big deal.

Speaker 4:          01:57:22       Like you get these football games, college shit like Wisconsin's and stuff where it's like part of a tradition. What I'm saying, any event or an angels game or dodger game or Yankees game or Laker game or football game, it's, it pops up somewhere along the line. You're right up there with queen. It's crazy. It's wild. I mean, as you're talking about songs like individual songs and their imprint on something, it's bananas. It's, it's, it's something to like, I can't, you can't almost invest your thought in it because it can get like, whoa, it's really kind of a part of, of of pop culture. It's ingrained on a, uh, on, on an America. It's an American phenomenon. And worldwide. I mean like worldwide. I mean, where did you, can you go where they probably never heard jump around. It's weird. I mean, to think about it on that level is crazy. Maybe like one of them places where Trump's trying to buy maybe up in Greenland. No, no, they heard it. They heard it. Queen had, we are the champions and, and, and uh, it also had, we will rock you. Those are two of the greatest sports anthems of all time. Queen nailed two of them. Like one of the fucking Panas do of them. We will rock you and we are the champions. It's actually the same song. Two is the same song, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       Yeah. They blend into each other. Different songs. They kind of, they're, they're technically connected. He had to buy them on iTunes. You have to buy two songs I think. Is it a slash in there? Is it? Or we will rock you. We are the champions. They come together on the record. When the record came out, they went right back to back. Yeah, it doesn't, there's no space three or was it recognized as one individual song? The label, it was listed as two different titles. Two different titles. You're not, you're not miked up, people can't hear you. So I'm trying to, oh sorry. Yeah, here you go. Here we go. Sorry DJ man. So that was actually one of the first albums I got when I was a kid. But on the actual label, which has like the titles of the songs, they were listed as two different titles.

Speaker 3:          01:59:21       But on the actual vinyl, the surface of the record, it was one groove. So the songs just went right into each other. So, so if you were in a diner and you put like those quarters in that thing and you played that right, give you one song or would he give you no, it usually gives you both. It gives you both. Good question man. For Man, diner music. I was listening to my memory. That microphone. I feel like my memory, I'll share with you. We share where I feel like my memory, I see like a we will rock you slash we are the champions thing like going on and [inaudible] it's like, I feel like you would've got both songs cause they don't remember. There is no stop. There's not even a clean place to edit it really. If I'm right. It's crazy that it's two songs.

Speaker 3:          02:00:02       Do you remember those wheels of the diners in the east coast and when they roll it's kind of where the champion, oh so it's two songs, one song, two songs, but it's one. So I was just driving a year 45 it only has, we will rock you on one side. That's, I was driving a u haul truck last weekend. I'm in the process of moving. So all you had while we had was amfm radio. So I was listening to k Earth one-on-one and we will rock you came on and right away came we are the champions. So I played it as one song now. Well they go together, you know, perfectly percent. It seems like it's almost, but it is clearly two different jams. Right? It's great. Similar themes like goddamn wizard wacky. We are the champions. That band they were, they were really sorcerers know he was amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:00:57       Freddy Mercury was wow. He was amazed. He was crazy. He was on your vocal on stage. Just a masterpiece of Bohemian rhapsody alone. It's just crazy. I know, right? Like can you think of like rock albums and you think of songs and you think of that one. You're like, why? Like I write these little three chord songs with a nice story over and shit and this month this dude was doing like fucking 16 part harmonies of bis mill long. No, we will not let you go. Like wrote like a rock opera, like within four or five minutes. It was fucking bananas. How genius that Shit is. It's great to listen to like it's super entertaining. It's captivating. He was a damn God damn hero. Yeah, for sure. Right Freddy? Yeah. This isn't, I haven't seen the movie. I wouldn't to say I haven't seen the movie though.

Speaker 3:          02:01:49       After they stopped having fucking [inaudible] do it. I'm like, I'm out. We're see. Cause I like, I liked the show. That guy's on that Mr. Robot. I'm sure I'd like him to, but it doesn't matter that you tease me with Allie g and then you pull them away. I don't know. I mean that's not why I didn't see it. I just haven't had the chance. But I heard that bore out wanting to do a lot of like a crazy dre. He was, yeah, he probably wanted to do all the, you wonder, have dongs flapping around. You know what I mean? He wanted all that. He wanted to go the other, he wanted to go the dark side of Freddy who wanted to be buck wild. I'm sure the guy who did it did a great job. The problem is whenever someone gets attached to the idea of someone else doing it and then the new guy comes in, he's forever tainted, but if you haven't and you ever go on t v Little Show binges, that guy's show, Mr.

Speaker 3:          02:02:38       Robot is really good. It's pretty fucking good. Pretty fucking good. I've heard it's really fun. It's fucking like bizarre, like futuristic hacker weirdness. It's fucking, it's pretty dope too. This is the best time ever. If you want to just sit and watch TV, like is there a better time that's ever existed? Dude, get smoke weed. It's legal. Just sit. Watch 42 episodes of a show. I don't curse too much this behavior, but occasionally I think it's important and probably even therapeutical, but if you could just sit down and watch something on TV, there's more shit to watch today than the human race has ever seen, ever. That's a fact. Then make a new TV shows every goddamn minute they're happening right now. They're putting them out on Hulu. They're putting them out on Amazon. They're putting them out on Netflix. They don't even stagger them now they drop an entire season tickets out, watch it, deal with it, deal with it.

Speaker 3:          02:03:28       Bitch. You watched stranger things? Yes, I'm an episode five. Don't tell me Shit of what the most reasons seasoning. Everybody's skish. It's good. It's good. I enjoy it. I enjoy it. I can't tell you I enjoy it. No, I ain't going to tell you anything else. A little bit better than good. I'll tell you a couple of good ones. I enjoy a couple of good ones. I enjoy you. Fuck with Ozark. Oh Dude, do I fuck. Okay. There we go. There's Ozar, man. What did I give up one? It wouldn't be Ozar.

Timothy Ola fan from like a deadwood. That Guy Yo. It's like I w I'm not even gonna say anything else but yo, y'all can come thank me later.

Speaker 3:          02:04:14       Go check that shit out. It's like two seasons of it and they canceled it for some reason. Hopefully they'll bring it back if a lot of enough people like it. But I'm telling you, it's fucking hilarious. It's like if you like Zombie kind of weirdness, but it ain't really scary and it's fucking hilarious is what it is. It's craziness. Beautiful. If you ever watched the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, I have not got to watch that. Check it out. That is a god damn a Larry Show. That's a good to sit down with your wife because you'll laugh.

She doesn't know what the fuck anything is, but she's hilariously optimistic. It's really [inaudible] on this one.

And she's like a Larry. David is chick. Like she's Larry. David ask, I should say like the show is like, she's always like the fucking mom who's like fucking doing some crazy shit.

Speaker 3:          02:08:10       I'm glad I know now what belt he's talking about. He's talked about it multiple times. That's a great fight. He called down, said, dad, he said, defend this belt. And I was like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       okay. He's talking about the baddest motherfucker in the game belt. I thought he was going to say it, but I, I probably should have asked him what belt it was.

Speaker 3:          02:08:25       No, it's more beautiful like that. There's like this. No, it's perfect. It's like an Easter egg. [inaudible] what a great name. The baddest motherfucker in the game belt. We should be so happy. That guy's a real thing. We should be so happy in that fight. It would be amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:08:45       Yeah, man. That would be incredible. Mazda dolls, a straight up murderer. He's a straight up murderer. Toes Nate. That'd be chaos. That'd be chaos if then those two guys want to do it. Those are two mean just wild dogs going at it. Those guys are both like to the core. They're there. They're fighters to the core. There's no quit in either one of those guys. I mean that's a wild fight, man. Especially right now, like financially, that's an amazing fight right now. People would pay a lot of money to see that fight. Mazda Dal and Nate Diaz there. Those are two guys that are like the most exciting and most talked about guys in the sport right now. If those guys decided to fucking smash horns, Woo. Good. It looked like they were more than willing. Yeah, I hope to make that. That would be, that would be an amazing fight. Hope to make that happen. That'd be God Damn Bananas and maybe one of us will come out to turn around

Speaker 3:          02:09:42       if they pick something shitty enough. No, at their level. I think they get to pick their own music as long as they don't have, like we were talking about, wait, wait. But Leo, Leo Machida, I want to know the story behind that. One day I'm going to corner day and everyone were like, you know, when this, when he's not the fucking busiest dude on earth and, and be like, what the fuck? What happened? What Song did he pick? And you were mad, which the auto fight was that? I don't know man. I'm sure somebody knows. I wonder if he won cause that will be interesting. I think fuck was vibe. I'm not sure. I think he did because I keep track of shit like that cause it's fucking, I hate it almost when somebody, because one of my favorite guys, um, uh, oh my God, uh, the beard, uh, super duper friends with Tate. Uh, thank you. Mean the dean of mean, do you know KCI Giardia? He came out to my version of, of fucking, uh, Folsom prison and I was so jacked about it and he lost that fight and I felt like it made me feel horrible. Like, Oh man, my, Oh, this is Chris Weidman when he fought Liotta cheat. Oh, that's what it was. That's when the auto c you put the Kabash on Liotta. Oh, so he, yeah, he, let's see. See I took was, look man, I didn't ask for that fucking ass for that dude.

Speaker 3:          02:11:05       I don't need that pressure. That wasn't going to say come pick my shit song. Wasn't gonna save him. You know what I mean? That's one of those weird ones. It's like, what is, how bad is the song that you won't let a person pick their own songs? That's what I want to know. It's not that much time. I mean, it's only like a, the walk to the ox guys, not a full song. It's not like three minutes, but it, all those Brazilian guys always come out today, eh, eh. You know what I mean? Like fucking a, they can come up to the fucking loudest music. Some of those dudes, not dax murderer used to come out to some real questionable fucking like touch disco house.

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       He came out to like rock tech. You crazy. Oh my God. Yeah, that's right. Dutch does Swedish house Mafia. Oh my God, you're so right. Crazy. That's exactly what he's coming out to though. [inaudible] like overtly like over the top two. Number one. Worst dorm number one worst walkout song. My favorite was when Randy coture came out to Ted Nugent stranglehold. I was like, if there is ever a song that's like design like that, that seems like a fun fight playing song. You know like you're about to have a fight. That's the song you want plant stranglehold. Michael Kia sees that too. A couple of guys he just trying to hold now that's a song like stranglehold and it's one of those songs. Anything by AC DC. Oh yeah. Thunderstruck come out to a fight. Cool. Yeah, just that good Angus. His tone on the guitar, it's over. You got anger, right?

Speaker 3:          02:12:55       Got some nice rich Franklin used to come out the thunderstruck when he was the middleweight champion does that. This came up to, I know he definitely came out to an ACDC song. Now I think shit is, it feels like right. Questioning that was big like right then to, yeah, AC DC is like one of those bands where you hear like three or four chords. You're like ac DC like instantly, like for Angus young again, this guitar tone just as what's called for those about to rock. Oh, he came up to ask for those ABAP to come out to a fender struck too. I think when he fought Anderson Silva, you're about to find this. Guess he won 26 he did the for those about which a fight was that? Who was he fighting? I think for sure he came out the thunderstruck cause school is your friend.

Speaker 3:          02:13:51       He was a, he was an DC dude. Oh, well he fought for his girlfriend. He was at ac DC. Dude, you think about w walk out music as big as it was. It's a nice someone. Their walkout music was that chuck Liddell, he beat with a broken arm, like Chaz kicked him in the arm broken. I think. I feel like I was there, but I might not, I might just even seen it on TV. He caught his on where it was. I don't know. Chuck broke his arm in the first round and then he, um, he clipped him with a punch with his other hand, like when everybody should with a broken arm. That was crazy. Yeah, same song, UFC 72. Okay. Maybe that was the song for those about to rock. Hmm. Great Song. Either way. Like I, I, when everybody hit me, I apparently when Steve pay knocked out DC, like there's a, that angle where I was like, Oh, you saw me?

Speaker 3:          02:14:40       And then like recently I saw the, did you ever see the meme with Khabib where he's like staring at counter? Like after knocking out fucking, I think it's a Josie and like it's me, like I'm like talking to like fucking cubby, but he's just staring like this and like there's a meme that just like focuses in on him. Like it's fucking crazy side. Like it's got me thinking like, I wonder how I'd be, like I said, I've been to so many of these fucking fights that I don't even, you know, I was like trying to remember and it's like, I can't even remember. Yeah. You've been coming to him almost as long as I've been working for the UFC. Yeah, basically close to it. Not as, but Clo in the neighborhood. Know what I mean? A couple of years behind. Yeah. Yeah, but like you know the first guy ever smoked pot indoors with in Vegas. We just smoke pot here. I was like a little kid. I think when I say where did they going to go? What are they going to go? He's like, go, hey, where are you going to do a club? And I was like, all right dude. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:15:44       somebody had made a meme that says something about even his concentration and he, I started focusing in on him like this. It was hilarious. Make that bigger. Does it make it bigger? Is it possible to make it bigger? Let me tell you something. Listen, look at Khabib's face. Is there a harder man that's ever lived? Look at that and be tell you though. He came out like two fights before that fight and he was the nicest guy to everybody that came up to him. Oh, he's like, he, everybody came to me engage with them, talk to them. Soon as the Conor fight was about to happen. That was it for the whole, he just was watching Connor the whole time and, and like, and like we were talking like he like in the whole time, like I said, we were engaged in what I'm saying to him right there. I was like, Oh shit, y'all probably fighting kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       Cause he was like, I want to fucking fight that guy. And they got into it backstage at that shit.

Speaker 2:          02:16:37       Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:16:38       But I was just made me laugh and it made me start thinking like, hey, I wonder how much shit I want to, how much shit I Mike in the background of, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:16:46       A ton of them. One of the best ones ever is Aryan Dunkin kissing. And when they planned it, they planned it. So these guys, pat the camera passed in front of him and they grab each other and started making out just so they could be on camera. Watch this, they'll get, watch this right here. The camera pans to them.

Speaker 10:         02:17:08       Oh Shit. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       And Dana. Dana texted me afterwards. Did your friends fuck

Speaker 10:         02:17:23       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:17:25       oh man. Oh Shit. What's up? What's up Jamie? I thought I was with them at that fight and it might've been on a substance psychedelic. Oh, they probably were wavy. Yeah, they probably were that that was common practice. Common practice in the day. One of Bang. One more on this. Do it. Let's do it. Let's do a, I'm smoking and drinking. So that seems appropriate. Yes,

Speaker 9:          02:17:52       sure.

Speaker 4:          02:17:53       All right, DJ Melody. Uh, and, and let's one more, give a little shout out it, him and the beat Junkies have a school in Glendale, California. It's called beat Junkies Institute of sound. They teach kids, youngsters and grownups how to DJ like properly, like real djs. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:18:15       By the way. This is real people just listening turntables. This isn't some bullshit. This is like, you backed me up on that real shit. Does he? Russell Peters and proves right show. So [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          02:18:53       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          02:18:53       she advised all there. Then all of a sudden find [inaudible] soap. Dog is day should tell me.

If you got [inaudible] and train again to waste and man no where man shit smelled to waste and [inaudible] they're all with [inaudible] whisky, the whole attitude. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:21:04       the boots have dab in there. So go ahead, grab it. I'm a chrome plated man.

Speaker 7:          02:21:19       [inaudible] all have friends. [inaudible] and drank it two ways there that [inaudible] Shh,

Speaker 4:          02:22:04       whoa.

Speaker 4:          02:22:10       That's a great fucking song. Whitey Ford sings a Whitey Ford's house of pain is the latest album. Let me do all the things my manager will slap me later for if I don't, uh, o g Everlast you can find me on Instagram and that's the only I really do. But I'm on the Facebook and all that with all detours and all that. But if you want to see what I talk about or what I do, it's Oji ever last on Instagram. Um, I got Joe started on Instagram, by the way. That's 100% and he's kicking my ass out over there. He's got like 18 million followers. I got like a 98,000 I always, dude, no, always. That's another, you're people always come and are always beautiful folks. That's still, that's 100% because of the room. But uh, but the, the folks that always come after a podcast are always like, find folks and, and, and are enthusiastic.

Speaker 4:          02:23:03       It's awesome to hear. I think we tapped into a river of cool people. I think they're out there. I think you put it out there and people respond in turn and they realize that a lot of, a lot of the shittiest behavior that we all exhibit is because we're around shitty behavior for making agreement to be nice to each other. We can change everything. I'm working on it. We are, I'm a dead Jack. You're a man and you're Irish. I'm a dick. I'm looking for a quick excuse to be one. If you want to be an ass, you know what I mean? He'd be, but you know, and all the years now, no, you, you're a very, very introspective guy, man. You look at yourself, you know when people make mistakes and they look at themselves like you're, uh, you're a guy who looks at everything, man.

Speaker 4:          02:23:46       You look at yourself, you look at other people. It's nice to be afforded the time and luxuries to do such things too. Let's acknowledge it. Some people, hey man, motherfuckers still got, some people can barely look up from the grind man. It's a blessing to be able to like have that, those moments of like, hey, whatever it is, Joe Rogan in the fucking brush, you know, stalking and elk, that's where he gets his moment. Or you know, or whatever. Me, you know, driving fucking Pacific coast highway, listen to in a beat, trying to fucking come with an idea. You know what I mean? That's a luxury. You know what I mean? Even though it's hard work, you might be thinking of a joke out there while you're fucking [inaudible]. You know what I mean? Now we're lucky. Super Lucky for sure. Well said. That's so important to acknowledge, you know, for everybody and, and we didn't use to be, and that's, that's the grind, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:24:30       And we're all okay. We're all okay. We just got to figure out way through our own individual Mays. The problem isn't comparison. Right. That's a big part of the problem. I, I'm totally paraphrasing, but there's like definitely a famous phrase where it's like, comparison is the death of joy and I think we've even talked about it on, they might, I'm having Deja Vu, so they might've been on here that we talked about that I'm a repetitive fuck. Yeah. And I say a lot of the same shit over and over again. That's a Thomas Jefferson quote. Correct? Comparison is the thief of joy. Thief of joy. I think we have talked about it my days. Who is in high gear right now? It's one of my favorite quotes because it just makes you realize like this is something you can't even control, like you're, you're concentrating on, she also can control, I feel like it's like there's this, everybody's not entitled to the luxury that we're talking about.

Speaker 4:          02:25:13       So it's like, it's, you gotta be thankful for it on an extra high level because it seems like we're in this twisted thought age where it's like everybody thinks they that and I don't even feel like I deserve it. I'm, I'm lucky I'm a fortunate fucking man. You know what I mean? I, I sing songs, I always compare it to like this. Like, you know, when you talk, you know, when like people are talking about the old new music, whatever, whatever, I'm like, whatever happens, if the lights go out and all the power goes out, I can go from fucking little fucking prefecture to prefecture and play a little song for you and get a meal from me and my family. That's how I equate it. Like it's, it's a trade, you know what I mean? And, and it's, it's an imbalanced society that gives, that has be, I mean, I, I've met teachers that I feel like should be making way more fucking money than me, man.

Speaker 4:          02:25:56       Like on real levels that I, that I've seen do things for kids on like, you know, like my school has a mixture. Like, you know, kids that go there because they lived there and then there's a lot of people trying to go to school cause it was very nice school. But you know, so there's imbalances and these, I've seen teachers like come out their own pockets and do things for people that was like, wow man, that's, you know what I mean? I like to think I do nice things and I think I do, but I'm saying it's like when I see it on a level where it's like grassroots ground level, it's, it's impactful to me.

Speaker 2:          02:26:29       Yeah, it's too, you know, when you think about teachers, that's the one that's the heartstring puller. You know, like how much teachers make, you hear about the rocks to how do you, you're taking care of our baby is you're teaching our babies and you hear about the bad ones here about the mean teachers that fuck would a kid's head. You don't realize it. They don't realize what they're doing to the kid. Like, oh some people are just angry. This is angry in me. And it comes out in their teaching. And if your teacher gets stuck or your kid rather, if your kid gets stuck with one of those teachers, like that can have a devastating impact on the kid's life.

Speaker 4:          02:27:06       We're, we're, we're, we're experiencing like something like that but not on a mat on a very minor level of like, you know, like, um, the way the school, we just found out like today, yesterday, like what teachers our kids have, you know what I mean? It's like there's the whole like, um, cultural, parents' circle of knowing who's teaching which teachers you want and which ones you don't, you know what I mean? So it's like, I'm not going to go into whether we got what we wanted or not, but it's like the fucking drama by, and it is, it's a Laramie to me. It's like, it's such a, it's such a like, whoa, like, yeah. Is there abuse going on or why, you know, when teachers a little more strict than the other? I, in my day, my parents would've said like, that's the teacher we want nowadays.

Speaker 4:          02:27:46       It's almost like the opposite. I mean that in an old days, my mom would been like, that's district or teacher yet, put them in that class, put them in that class, cause that's the one that's not gonna take any shit. And that's the one that's going to get, you know, tell him, make sure he knows and people aren't going to take shit from him and like, you know what I mean? And that's, I understand that mentality. You nowadays, it's almost the flip like, oh, that teacher's like, she just so, you know, abrasive too. It's like, well what does she do? Well, she raised her voice to the kid. That was, what was the kid doing? He was fucking losing his mind in class. So the teacher raised their toys. There's that, you know, it's just a general example

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       here, but, well, I, it's hilarious. And we got paddled. Yeah. Paddled at school. I got in a fight with a kid named Preston banks. We duked it out. Well, no, we were like got paddle. I was like, fuck. I lived there from 11 and 13 so somewhere in that range. They fucking whacked me in there. Florida, Florida. Yeah. Yeah, Florida, they used to be a lot of powder you this dude had a paddle, like an actual wooden paddle and me and this kid got in a [inaudible] this I remember thinking even though I was probably like 11 or 12 or whatever it was, when I got in a fight with this kid, I realized this kid had been like badly burned when he was young and we were, you know, we're in school together and he was like missing part of his ear and his neck was all fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:29:04       And I was thinking like, oh, this guy, like he's not doing so well like this is, it made me realize like we, we got into this little scrap over nothing because it just, he wasn't doing so well and I didn't realize that until I was in the principal's office with them and the fight, like we couldn't fight in front of the principal. That was the authority figure. We were both like subdued, but I was realizing when I was around the, but this isn't a mean guy. He's a sad guy. Like, he's the guy that just didn't get any love and he feels like you got ripped off by life cause he got burned when he was a little kid for sure. And it made me think like it, it changed the way I looked at people. But then one little argument fight with one kid and then getting paddles, getting paddled just cemented it like out there.

Speaker 2:          02:29:50       I don't agree with it, you know? And the guy didn't hurt me. He didn't try to hurt me and tried to hurt the other duty either. But he definitely paddled us. He used to be, it used to be a legal thing, staying on it, man. You know what I mean? That's what we grew up with. You guys. I got spanked her, but it's that good I think. I think there's appropriate time in place. I really do for girls. I don't know about that. That's different. Cause I have two girls and I've never, I've never spanked my kids and I don't think I threatened to, but I've never had to actually commit and do it. Uh, so I don't know. Yeah, no, it's, it seems like that might not be the right and even when the boy I'm talking about that physical justice for me, she would be a rare thing.

Speaker 2:          02:30:37       Let me give you an example of when like a time in my life when I definitely deserve physical justice and got it. My father, you know, I was using guns when I was very young. We'd go out and shoot and like, not hunting necessarily, but he'd take us out and shoot in the mountains out in the Angeles for us back in the day. And like fucking, I had a very good gun education and understanding of guns and one time when they were away, I fucked around with his like pumped shotgun and fucking accidentally fucking loaded it and fucking bang and shot into the wall. All right. This was an apartment too. This wasn't a house. This was in an apartment building. Now. It wasn't a wall connected to in another apartment, but put the possibilities, you know what I mean? When they came,

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       uh, a few hours later that apartment outside was surrounded by police, like with guns. Like, they didn't know what happened. The neighbors all called cops, didn't they heard a shotgun? But so after they all settled it down and shit, I got my ass fucking kicked that last, that night on my father. You know what I mean? And you know, some people nowadays would say that's fucking rough, but no, I fucking could have fucking killed a human being easily. I'd just, you need sometimes no, like, okay, this is because what you just did could have wound you up in fucking the penitentiary for the rest of your life. So an ass kicking doesn't seem as extreme as you think when you put it in the balance of that. So when you're getting to like a level of that, I think, especially for a boy, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          02:32:09       And I, I've, I don't know if [inaudible] girl was going that wowed. I mean, I, I would encourage the mom to throw the beginning. I mean, a dad can't throw that beating, you know, it'd be a little rough. But I think there's a time and a place where like, hey you, if you're going to stop you, you gotta let them know and here's, this will be the rest of your life. If you keep down this path, that's, it's gotta be that extreme to me for it to be a beating nowadays. When I was young, a beating could come from talking back. Right. At least a smack in the face. Yeah. Well that's, you know, a shoe. Just a little of my, if it was mom, after like 13 moms stopped using the hands, cause you know it then, you know, I had outgrown her. She, my mom was little, my mom was little, almost a little woman, like four foot 11, five foot tops.

Speaker 4:          02:32:52       That's just throwing shit. Oh yeah. So after awhile I was like, it went from, it went from the hands to like a stirring spoons and shit. And then once those started breaking, it became shoes and like, you know, uh, whatever else, broomstick. And then it became like with to your fucking father gets home and mom might've like gently smacked me upside the head gently, like never like a real like wound, you know, my mom was a Brooklyn Lady. She might've been like, what are you doing? Stupid. I never got my dramas tried to forever drop me. Ma. I remember being like nine or 10 and mom's chasing me down the block catching me and fucking like dead ass beat up in front of it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Happens to happen. The worst had happened. My mom was not chasing me.

Speaker 4:          02:33:46       She'd be like, you're coming home eventually dummy. My mom wasn't, I mean she wasn't having that. No. Oh word. My mom would've never chased me. She would be like, I'm not playing your games. She's little. But she was fast. She was fast. She caught you beat your ass in front of your friends. So rough when you're young boy and you try to be cool. It's like the most embarrassing. Like any day you can just trip on your own Dick and fall face to do a fence like a fucking asshole. Just so goofy. I think it actually

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       made some more friends at the time understand me a little bit differently. Do like, oh wow dude. Alright. Like yeah, for sure. We get you now we understand kind of your whole thing. Like you're Steve, like you're, you guys are nuts. Yeah, for sure. But don't you like when you think of yourself as like a musician, an artist, like you're so fortunate, this is going to sound weird, but you're so fortunate to come from a chaotic upbringing. I feel like everyone who I know that comes from some sort of a chaotic upbringing has like a different kind of like horsepower to their shit. You know, like all my favorite people that I like to listen to and watch y'all at some like real fucked up moments and struggles and chaos. I'm sure madness. You don't, you don't get what you put out without that. That's like the root of it all.

Speaker 2:          02:35:08       That's the seed that causes it all to grow. I mean it's similar to a joke, a song you're trying to find. It depends on what you know. Whenever you you take from it. I like to call it the highest common denominator like that. I'm trying to find, it's like the, the the highest level thing we can all connect on, you know what I mean? Not the basis, most lowest level or common denominator. I'm trying to find the word. What kind of elevated level can I speak to you on? Even if it's about fuckery, can I raise the level of speaking about it and just telling a tale about it without it, you know, being, you know, again the most basin and and easiest lowest hanging fruit [inaudible] yeah. You know, that's the same thing. I think with the joke you're trying to find, there's no real new, like you're just finding new angles on funny shit.

Speaker 2:          02:36:06       You know what I mean? Like things are news when things are newly invented or when there are new events, like it has to be like a significant event or a new invention then then things open up new pathways. Other than that, like you're talking about relationships. You're doing a variation of exactly take on it that everybody's had who's had a long life and been in relationships, especially Larry King. Holla at your boy going on number eight. Was that number seven? They just left eighth divorce. Seventh wife I think here he married one of them. Damn like that. You know Larry King still alive. You didn't know. Oh Roy would Roy would, Roy and I were looking at pictures of a lacking. I'm really impressed that he's still alive. Divorced at 85. Hawkins more power to him. Get busy. If you got the money to get divorced at 85, go for it.

Speaker 2:          02:37:01       And then shooting him up with steroids and cocaine and they're just going to start Viagara just having gals come over to the place he's over at art's Deli, holding court. You imagine if, uh, over the last like year of his life he just banks and unprecedented volume of Internet porn and just releases it all in one blast. Larry King Fox, he just called it king. Yes. King sex tapes. Yeah. King. Yeah. Just Bang it out and just, yeah, that's how I was going to get a lot of pictures. You get so much money if you really just want money, now's the time to act. That's wild. Poor Larry. He doesn't seem like he has um, good posture. Like that's not good when you're an older fellow and he likes the curve, that curve. He was a very nice guy. I was on a show at twice. I was the show twice for fear factor. So he's very nice, very friendly guy. You know, he kind of

Speaker 3:          02:38:08       gotta be when you do that for a living and every night you're talking no person, you gotta be good at that Shit can't be like me. I'd be like, fuck, I go to jail. Is there a Larry King? We need to get a Larry King much shot. Yeah. Get the Larry King Mugshot or that shit up. Go to take the phone. You need you five foot of Larry King Mugshot. How do we not have Larry King? We just decided to get Pablo Escobar and need to get the mugshot of the dude who's still on CNN, who got found out like in central park in New York, like with math and like, uh, like make shift new surround his dick is, they was, oh, what the fuck?

I don't know. New Tech that's like, oh no. Is this not on the Internet? That am I making this up? I was looking for a mugshot. There's not mugshot, but here's an explanation for what happened. Oh, there's an explanation.

Speaker 3:          02:39:46       Okay, this next one, she know I'm not making this up, right? I'm not. This wasn't like a drug induced like hallucination or something, right? God, how hilarious is the way they put this? CNN personality. Richard Quest is busting in central park earlier yesterday with some drugs in his pocket and a rope wrapped around his tie and his genitals. No big deal. And a sex toy in his boot. Law enforcement official said source of said quest was initially busted for loitering. Really wasn't about that. Aside from the oddly configured rope, this search also turned up a sex toy inside of his boot that means his ass hole and a small bag of methamphetamine in his left jacket pocket. It wasn't immediately clear what the rope was for [inaudible] shot. You were showing a picture so he'll know who I'm talking to. Bobby, please. I'm going to talk about that on stage from now on. Send me that guy. Dude, you don't know that guy. He's all over the fucking CNN. I do not know that guy. To me, that article that we just sent it to my Evernote. I hope it provides you something beautiful. Something there. There's something this, the best part about the article, it was not clear. It was not immediately clear what the tow rope floor and I'm like, let me help. Let me help you out.

Speaker 3:          02:41:11       What does it tighten around his neck and his dick? What pocket goes? Mr Quest at 64th street in west drive at about three Oh, the police noticed Mr [inaudible] at 64th street in west drive. They'll have 3:40 AM the official said as he was being escorted out, he volunteered in quotes. I have meth in my pocket. According to an official briefed on the case. The police searched him and recovered a small amount of methamphetamine in a zip lock bag and a rope around his dick and his neck and a sex bullying. More importantly, there's a lot of dudes who do math. Oh, they keep, I take Chandler and they stay on the farm or what kind of boots he had on his, there's a snake in my boot that means in his asshole. Is this an English paper? No, this is New York. It was central park. I think they mean his asshole.

Speaker 3:          02:42:11       I don't think they mean his boot or think they made it his ass. His ass. That's a whole new dementia. It's your trunk Bro. They wouldn't call it English, but it's like this. Isn't this, this New York Times? Yes. They using proper British English. That's America. That's The New York Times called boots and boot in American. Let's go with the better angle on it. This dude was in his ass and that's fun. It's the better New York poster. Do you know our times yet? It was in his asshole. That's what it is. Boot his boot. His boot is, it's proper British for like if you watch like a that is factual. That is factual. Clarkson and fucking Richard Hammonds. James Bay. They were virtual truck is the best of boot. Yes. As soon as asshole. Right. You got sex toys, asshole. Hey, no judgment brought a whole new like fucking like dimension to that. No judgment. Wow. It's okay. It's fine. Yes sir. Even if he didn't get caught

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       with that in his asshole, he's still doing math and talking to cops. Like what? The rope around his

Speaker 3:          02:43:17       Dick and nick. Yeah, that part too. I was going to get to that. It was so crazy. Beata of fucking rubber Dick and his ass like, wait, what? I'm fighting that shit on [inaudible] I'll get you that mugshot. I'm finding it a little math every now and then. Rob Ran his dick and balls, whatever

Speaker 4:          02:43:37       or whatever you got. Not all charges were dismissed. Thank God for a man.

Speaker 3:          02:43:55       You dude is black. Is Wesley stipes with dreadlocks? They catch you with a rub. Proud your Dick and neck with your pocket, Bro. Yeah, I in jail. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. 100% I think so hundred a hundred dismissed. You had meth and a rope already connecting your neck and cock and probably a sex toy in your ass. You can't be UK for a different issue at the very least. And I was going to say in his shoe, which is weird enough, it's my, it might even be weirder, but let's not jump to conclusions. [inaudible] confusing interpretation of the American version of boot and them saying maybe they think shoe means ass too. I was with another man. Oh, maybe nobody's got a fucking rubber Dick in their boots. That's outrageous. That would make your boot off fucking uncomfortable. Why wouldn't you just put it in your pocket? It's in his ass, Bro. Let's just run with this. He had in his pocket. Shit, Google search. Shut off all the computers, spread misinformation. Look, I'm sure it was just an issue. Whatever, whatever. Don't ever volunteer that you have drugs. Let them find the drugs. Let them find the drugs. Unless you want. Fuck the cop. I have a quick, hey, good one on that.

Speaker 4:          02:45:19       On that level. Shit on first time I went to Japan with house pain. What happened? We were on, you know, it was one of them things where we were touring from tour to tour tour. I would go home and literally take one set of clothes out of a bag, thrown in another bag and leave. So we got to Japan and on this particular trip I brought my girlfriend at the time and I think Danny did and lethal brought his own homie or whatever, but all the, we brought a bunch of guests and everybody gets through customs and as I'm getting through customs, the guy reaches into this one jacket I have and he pulls his hand out and there's this little nugget of bud and he's like, what is that? And I was like, well, can you speak English? Because he said it in Japanese.

Speaker 4:          02:46:00       So I said, okay, okay, what is that? I was like, my brain just was like, well fuck man, just, it looks like weed. I said, it looks like we, you know, I just fucking owned it wherever they went and got this little test or put some shit in instead. If it turns blue, it's weed. I was like, it's weed. Let's just fucking save a little trouble. This we, meanwhile, everybody else had gotten through. They brought everybody else back in, right? Fucking gave him the fucking finger. Like I have like my, my lady, everything at the time, everybody got the strip search. They never strip searched me. They searched everything. I had all my bags, everything right? They tested one nug of weed, whatever. I ended up, after several hours, the record label paid off, whatever they ended up pay off. We got into the country and were able to do our tour and the point of the story is everybody fucking hated my guts.

Speaker 4:          02:46:47       The whole fucking bunch of them. We get to the hotel. I'm unpacking my bag and trying to figure out how the whole fucking thing happened and I'm looking at the jacket and I reach into the pocket that was out of, there's nothing in there. I was like, fuck, that's crazy. I reached into the other pocket of the jacket. I pulled out a fucking ounce of fucking weed. They never looked in the other pocket of the jacket out fucking ounce of weed. I Shit, you're done what you wear without even knowing you were doing it. You were like sending a small meal to get busted so that the big ones can sneak around side. I must've been rolling a joint somewhat at the last tour and I had a nug left over and just thrown it in the pocket, not thinking about it on one side.

Speaker 4:          02:47:26       Cartel does that, but if they would have found out other ones first I thought I'd be in jail in motherfucking in Japan for a long time ever and ever. But I got in, I called the whole, I called everybody that smoked in the crew down to the room after that and I was like, Yo, check it out man. I really didn't mean this to happen but I probably had more good ass fucking weed in Japan than anybody at the time. You know what's incredible cause all they had was hash and shit like that. Stop and think of that moment, that moment. If they didn't go in that one pocket and they went in the other pocket first and they found that giant bag of weed, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Nope. We probably wouldn't. No, I don't think so. That's a lot of weed.

Speaker 4:          02:48:05       Who knows though, in Japan it would have been, it took a lot of money to get me out of the AB regardless a lot instead of, I think it cost him like 1000 bucks in there, like you know, which was like 10,000 or something again or $100 a year post. Put your lights on. No, this was in house paint days. This was like when the only story, like it was like Paul McCartney is banned for life because he got caught with some weed. That's, that was like, I don't know if it still exists, but there was a point where he was banned for life cause he got caught with weed over there. Wow. Well you used to be in Nevada, you get sent to jail for life if you had weed and now it's legal there. Yeah. There's a bunch of dudes like looking out those barred windows dad.

Speaker 4:          02:48:47       Yeah. That's just got it. Something's gotta be done about that. That ain't, that ain't working. Yeah, that's the problem. That's the number one problem. Number one problem with laws against things like we'd like as long as you can buy some Wizkid's part of the number one problem. A lot of it too, as long as these prisons are privatized and they don't want to let a lot of these guys go, man, a lot of these guys get money for the amount of fucking people in their prisons. I got a solution. Those private prison dudes just start selling the weed.

Speaker 4:          02:49:15       Right. That's not cleaner way to live your life, man. Don't be a goddamn slave owner. Slave owners. This whole leg, urban legend that, I mean it's very believable about this letter that went around like a bunch of people in, in the, in the hip hop music industry got not, I don't know, maybe it was within the last decade where they described like this guy claimed to be a member of the elite, um, a class of like executives of the music business in there in the mid nineties and whatnot. And there was a time when the private prison industry kind of came and got involved and got a lot of these people to invest and then kind of help direct like things like rap music and if you remember they used to be like public, I don't know if you were, how big are you a fan of music? You were at the time x clans and public enemies.

Speaker 4:          02:50:02       There was all these proactive like you know, counters to like the party drug dealer guys or whatever. You know, there was, there was, there was a nationally, another side to it that existed and was successful in flourished, you know, amongst it, you know, and that disappeared. But, and like their, this letter that went around was I kind of claiming this guy was part of this thing and he left the meeting when they, these guys, it was like a whole conspiracy thing like you going to, but it's like totally believable that the upper could, these guys would direct a music and a fucking media in a certain direction to encourage fucking basically a cycle of fucking prison for fraud. Cause if you look at rap music, if you look at rap music and what happened from the nineties till now, there is no conscious music anymore. There's none. It's um, it's again, it's, some people will tell you it's fucking God's honest truth.

Speaker 4:          02:50:52       So I'm gonna tell you it's the wildest speculation in the world, but you can dig it up easily. Kanye has some conscious music for sure, but like what? Like Jesus Walks, I'm, that was written by a guy named, uh, a rhyme fast, I think is his name. I think is the guy from Chicago, one of his partners from Chicago wrote that song. You know what I mean? Which guy? Remember these guys are like, Connie's a producer and I'm going to say he doesn't write, but what I'm saying is a lot of you know, he's also like, he will take a song and make the song because he's a producer conscious. A lot of people do. I'm not just saying Kanye is like a fraud or anything. I'm just saying like as a producer, like people, Drake doesn't write all his records like, like it was a different era of rap and shit like that going on from when I was young.

Speaker 4:          02:51:31       When I was young, it was pretty much 90% if you couldn't call yourself an MC or a rapper, if you didn't write your own shit, there were cast it didn't do it. It's always been there. There's always been the ghost writing scene. But if you wanted to walk in a room and hold down any kind of respect when people, you had to know, you wrote your Brian's, you know what I mean? It's the same in comedy. Yeah. So it's like, you know, and it's not saying like you're not a fraud, you're just a Democrat of entertainer. You know what I mean? As far as I'm concerned, I don't shit on it. You know what I mean? There's a lot of Drake records I like, there's a lot of other shit I like, you know what I mean? This, I know those guys didn't write those records cause I can look at the writer's credit and see 20 writers credits on it. So, but I come

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       from there era of like, you know, you gotta write your Shit. Yeah. I think some people feel the value of collaboration, which is a legitimate thing. And if your ego is good enough where you can like work with, like Paul Mooney worked with prior, you know, prior is the greatest of all time in my opinion. And he, he worked with Mooney. Mooney helped him a lot, you know, and Richard, Jenny worked with Chris Rock and you know, and others as well, you know, like this, it's not like some of the greatest of all time. I've had people that work with them and oh my God, that's, he's the greatest. He's like, he sees my most important uh, important influencers. When I, when I was at the comedy store, because he was like the first guy that I felt like it was a real, I was scared of him cause I knew he worked for prior. I knew he was like, he's connected to royalty and he'd be around the comedy store and I'd just feeding it still sharp is or a female. It's still right there. That's when I was in like my twins and he laughed. One time I was in, I was on stage in front of like 10 people in, I was doing my act and I heard it in the back of it.

Speaker 6:          02:53:06       Ah, ah.

Speaker 2:          02:53:10       And then he came up to me afterwards and he said that you were funny motherfucker. He goes, you, you did that shit. Like it was a sold out room. He goes, you're a real comic. And I was like, wow. Like Paul Mooney said that to me. Cause I remember he was connected. He's connected to the fucking, the man. He was connected to prize made like all those, the like it's the contribution, like it's, I mean I guess it might be, maybe it's different in hip hop but, but in standup it's similar that we, there's guys like Bill Burr who writes everything he says. Everything he says is coming from a bill. Birthplace of my, he's not contributing with anybody. He's not, you know, he's not collaborating. He's just, he's just being built by, you know, Joey Diaz, same thing. Like absolutely everything that guy says coming out of his head.

Speaker 2:          02:53:55       There's something extra to that, you know, it doesn't sound better or worse. It's just like you'd go into, it's like difference between you going to a restaurant and everything's homemade. It might be the same as if everything wasn't homemade in terms of like the way it tastes, but not the way it feels. Right. Like you got like you writes your own shit. Like when you write your own shit and you play your own songs, it's like I'm getting a piece of you. I'm getting a little piece of you comes out of your art and that's, that's the difference. It's not like does anything wrong with collaboration? Collaboration is, look, if you look at Chris rock stuff, it's arguably some of the greatest work of all time in terms of like the finished product of standby, stand up comedy bigger and blacker. It's one of the greatest comedy specials in the history of the world.

Speaker 2:          02:54:43       Period. End of discussion. Anybody that argues with you as an asshole, so that came out of collaborative efforts. It's nothing wrong with that. Obviously you made something amazing and many other bits and many other things that a lot of great comics have done, but it is different, man. It's different, you know, but we're all, some will in some way connected to each other and collaborating with each other whether we like it or not. It's not like the the as like how many stages into the game? Where are they going to collaborate with you? Are they going to be there for the final product? Are they just going to be influences all along the way in your artistic journey?

Speaker 4:          02:55:22       Well, yeah, it means a lot of words. Even the most, they'd be the thing that I would consider that I wrote completely by myself. If you want it, if you get down to the next level, it's like there's 25,000 things that have influenced why I think that way or feel that way. What I mean, so that's determined. That's why I, that said the whole angle of like there's really nothing new. It's all about the angle. And, and I liken it to like when I watched two a I like, I like watching the, um, old, uh, uh, uh, a dog town like documentaries, dog town and the z boys and shit. And it's like the whole approach to skating was like, everybody can do that, but it's the style you do it in. You know what I mean? That's what it really starts coming down to. There's not many, again, if there's no brand new invention or brand new event, we're rehashing experiences that are, that have been happening since the dawn of time. And you're just finding a new style at a new angle to dress it up. And that makes people feel like it's new. Sure. Sorrow, romance, love. That's you're breaking the boredom of the way it's been thought of before in a new way. And that's what becomes appealing to people. The goddamn when someone hits it and they do get through

Speaker 2:          02:56:43       with something, that's a new way of describing some shit we can all relate to. Makes you feel so good. Like music makes you feel good in a way. The comedy never can. Like comedy makes you laugh and it makes you have a good time together. We're all in a room laughing, hooting it up. But music, when you're by yourself, man, you can just be, it's just be you and that music can you get goosebumps? You can lift more weights. You run faster. Like if fires you up, man. If I'm running hills and I'm listening to music, I honestly feel like I'm cheating. I feel like I'm cheating because I feel like I take this like burst of like artificial energy. It's not dependent upon my discipline or drive. It's not artificial though. I know it's not, but it's, I didn't make it.

Speaker 4:          02:57:23       Yeah, no, but again, see, I don't know if it's, some grass is greener shit and I don't, I don't even know if that's the proper phrase, but like just when I look at as an art form, you like that comparison when you're like, it's good music is this. I'm like, comedy is so much more precious because you work it to that point and even if you tell an amazing joke that lives in me and I fucking love it so much, I take it and tell it to him for me, the minute I tell it to him, its ends, it's like that's the end of that joke from me. You know what I mean? It's, it's like there's a preciousness today. It's like a fucking, to me like there's a finite, you're creating an art that's like a, it's like almost like a dude who creates art just to fucking watch it.

Speaker 4:          02:58:10       Like, yeah, Yup, Yup. I did it like as some Japanese lantern that's going to just go up and flames and fucking disappear. It's like there's a beauty in that. That to me is far different and far more again, precious because it's, it's life is shorter. You have to watch it and that's my point is like you have to watch an idea of yours come to a finite end. Whereas I, when an idea of mine comes to a finite end and it's good and it connects, it can, I can repeat it over and over and over and people accept that, you know, so it's not, it's just a bit to me it's just the, the preciousness of it. You understand? What I'm getting at is like wow, that was that all that work for that. For the, it's like the limp. It's almost like the Olympic athlete training his old life.

Speaker 4:          02:58:59       Like that's how each joke almost is when you write it. When I, the way I allow, I've watched a lot of economy, I'm fucking them all over all y'all motherfuckers shit on the, when they post specials bill, all those dudes, I'm Tony, I'm mind all this shit. So it's like I'm really a fan of comedy and it's just amazing to me. Like I said, the finite, this stuff it is is, is precious, but that's an interesting way of putting it. I never really thought about that way. I thought about it in the way that like you have to write new stuff that I'd never thought about it in a way that like the first time that someone hears it, that's the only time they really hear it every night. Every time after that they know what's coming. They never see it the same way. You know?

Speaker 4:          02:59:40       It's like, again, like an Olympic athlete, you're working that joke, you're working that joke out and your work, the jokes getting better and it's like, okay, it's a bronze metal joke right now and it's a silver manager. If you ever get it to that gold metal joke and then you drop it where it's supposed to be in that place in time of this special or the thing that everybody sees, then it's done. You know what's interesting now is there's a lot of comedy nerds. They want to watch the process is the watch it flip punch lines around and flip things around and they go, hey, you did that thing different now I go, yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to do it. That'd be amazing to me if I had the time to just sit and watch you guys work out like go to the comedy club every night or whatever.

Speaker 4:          03:00:17       These two ladies from Arizona and they came down to the store, they travel around the world, they want to see Ari in Europe or Iceland or some shit, but their, their comedy nerds and they come to watch and they'll like, they'll see you like two months ago and then they come see again. I had conversations with them and I'm like, yeah, I like, I switched that up like you put that there. I'm like, yeah, I'm trying to figure out where to put it. I don't know where that got hurt on. My point is like there's a journey there until you get to that point where it's like dropped in that special or the thing that's been seen across broad spectrum, it is a journey and they know that because they're fans of the comedy, so they know there's things that thing's gonna that thing's going to build into something, you know? That's cool. I would love again, that's, that sounds like a fucking amazing time to me.

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       It's also like if you're a fan of music, it's hard to go watch people practice. It's different. Yeah. Because you're practicing in front of motherfuckers and they're reacting. I'm practicing what we do. We call it shedding. Cause we're locked in a fucking room doing it by ourselves and we ain't going to do it in front of you until we got that shit right. You know, we can't do that. We have to do it in front of people. But the weird, the weird thing about it is it's like a, like they can come and see it. They can see practice. No, that's not, people can't see you practice. Really. It's not practice. You're just fucking perform. It's proof. Comedy's performance art, you know what I mean? Yeah, for sure. So it's like you're working it out. You have the concept, but it has to be worked out.

Speaker 2:          03:01:43       It has to be walked to a destination so to speak. You know what I mean? The other part of it is though, there's so many more people doing music from the rod doing comedy, like the waters are like less populated. What do you think? Like the numbers for sure. Right? Absolutely. Because hey, more great bands and there are great Camino. There's not a lot of great bands. There's a lot of fucking artists. Like there's not a lot of new and great bands. Name a couple new gray pants. Oh yeah. Okay. I saw, I thought we were talking about like coming, you know the mailers for all active currently. Yeah. Do the rolling stones are still on tour? What the fuck is happening? They just waiting for someone to explode. The funny thing was I think I went to their farewell tour and like fucking blossom and everybody back then was saying, isn't it amazing?

Speaker 2:          03:02:34       They're still touring amazing Aerosmith too. Same deal. They were probably in their 50s then you know now what the like seventies eighties, David Lee Roth looks healthy as fuck. It was funny when you were, you had him in his, uh, in your lyrics. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude, he's healthy as fuck, man. That guy has no connection to the outside world. He has a lady he uses. The lady has a phone. She, she tells David where he should go and when did she meet you? David goes there and David doesn't bring a phone. I don't even know if he had a wallet. I paid for dinner. I'm like, this guy is, he's not connected at all to give a fuck smiles and everybody couldn't be friendlier. He just knows his vibration. He figured it out and he sticks with it. Can't, hey, he's hilarious, man. He's a fascinating cat that David Lee Roth, you know, he lived in Japan for like a year and learned Kendo, which is the art of sword fighting, trained under a Japanese mastery, brought his dog, renting an apartment, got a fucking apartment in Tokyo, and just every day went to Kendo. Practice got whacked with bamboo swords. My, my, one of my traumas, the guy, he's a fish, he's actually the band fish bone into one of the namesakes and uh, uh, he's into all that, like heavy Jujitsu, but like martial arts. But he's weapons trained. Like how many people move to Japan to train with a Japanese Kendo master

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       for a fucking year? He didn't even speak Japanese. He brings his dog to the other side of the planet to learn sword fighting for a year. And he's David Lee Roth and he learned of these things. Oh, he learned a lot of shit. Yeah, he can speak like a broken version, I'm sure of of Japanese, but I bet his candles pretty bad ass. I don't want a sword fight him. He really went for it. You know, he trained a martial arts and karate and kickboxing under Benny, her or Ketos Benny the jet or Kitezh who was like a California legend, a worldly Jim like in Van Nuys ran eyes. When I first came to California, there's two things that I needed to do. I needed to go to the comedy store first and foremost. Number two is I needed to go to the jet center. The jet center was bending the jets.

Speaker 1:          03:04:44       Place a van. I shot my first album cover there. Did you really? I'm pretty sure that's what year, like 1988 oh my God. I wasn't out here yet. That's crazy. I was just starting the first ever last record with ice tea. Iced tea, like had a sign. Wow, that's crazy. The label. Yeah. I got here too late man. I got here in 94 and the gym had been so badly damaged by the earthquake that when it started raining was a year after the earthquake. When it started raining, the rain was leaking all throughout the ceiling. The ceiling was a wreck and they had abandoned the building and I don't think they ever, they started off another place in north Hollywood but it wasn't quite the same thing. Like the jet center in Van Nuys was like one of those places where I'm positive. No, that's where it is.

Speaker 1:          03:05:28       Cause it's a boxing ring like, and I remember the Jetson incident, that's where we shot it. That's how I knew about banks. And all. That's how I learned about tough dudes, man. I went there, I was so nervous cause I came here from New York and I was still sparring back then. I had decided to stop sparring yet I just needed something to do and I was out here doing TV work and I was training with all these gang bangers. Man. I remember this one dude, he had something on his back, I don't remember what he, what the name of the gang was, let's like flopped us or something like that. And then it just said fuck the rest on his back. And I remember thinking Jesus and one of the guys like blinky Rodriguez who was a world class world championship level kickboxer he knocked out Johnny Terrio.

Speaker 1:          03:06:10       He was like a, like top of the food chain kickboxer he had a son that succumb to gang violence and so he like worked really, I'm sure. Pretty sure this is a story. And he worked really hard to like help the, the gang members in the community and bring them in the gym for free and teach them kickboxing and show them that they have value in that they get work out their differences inside the ring like men and not get involved in gang violence, check test. And so it was a weird thing because we'd go there and he was like, you're taking kickpop on the fucking kid from the suburbs of Boston. Okay. And I'm a comedian and I'm like fucking 26 years old and I'm hanging out with gang bangers and there's like hardcore kickboxing gym of one of my martial arts idols, Benny or Kitezh.

Speaker 1:          03:06:55       And another one, blinky Rodriguez was another one of my martial arts idols and you know, they didn't know who the fuck I was and I was just in there like training with them. And then it went under and I was like, if I got this brief glimpse into this place that was in my childhood, like my, my martial arts childhood, like that was one of the MCAS that I need to go to. I needed to go drays the jet center, but it just all went away real quick. Like within, I don't know, I don't know how many months after I joined there. One was forever everlasting. Me Like in a corner of a building, cause they had the Everlast they had me in a boxing ring. Then just fucking [inaudible]. That was the jet center. We shot that. It's Benny. The jet was nasty. There it is.

Speaker 1:          03:07:36       You Go, wow. That's actually my father. That's my father on the, on the upper right there. Dude. I bought that. Guaranteed. I bought that CD 100% a hundred percent I bought that. So that was all with the jet center man. Wow. That guy was a legend man. Benny or Ketos was a beast. He would go to Hawaiian fighting these crazy mixed tournaments or they do judo on you and boxing and all kinds of crazy shit. These guys were the originators, man. They were the hardcore second wave after Bruce [inaudible]. Damn handsome bastard. God Damn He, look dude, I got like a little Hitler stash or something going on there. What would I think? I was trying to grow it. I looked like a quarterback in a movie like a high school movie Burley Asshole who I was I think 16 right there, man. That shot is taken by a legendary photographer.

Speaker 1:          03:08:31       Don't name by the name of Glen Friedman. Man. He took many, many of the most iconic shots ever do. Shout out to Glenn. You would play a perfect guy in like a movie about a quarterback was an asshole to his girlfriend. There's another guy in the, in the school and he's like real sensitive and he writes poetry and the girl wants to be with him like want to kick his ass. Yeah, that's you right there. Bullying. Yeah.
