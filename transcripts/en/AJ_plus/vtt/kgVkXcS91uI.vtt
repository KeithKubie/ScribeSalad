00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.780
The National Football League:

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.280
It’s the most popular sports league in the U.S.,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.940
and brings people together over food, family, fun,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.800
love of country and, uhh ...

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.140
Now we're gonna go to a troubling new study about

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400
the risk of brain injury and football

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.420
Ezekiel Elliott

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.020
suspended without pay over allegations of domestic violence.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.240
Colin Kaepernick is taking his collusion case

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.460
against the NFL to trial.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.140
And one of the many NFL issues that doesn't get as

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.620
much coverage is the sexual harassment and overall

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.340
exploitation of the games cheerleaders.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.940
Washington Redskins cheerleaders on this

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.700
2013 trip tell NBC News they felt

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.980
sexually exploited.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.760
Hey guys, it’s Omar,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.600
and this Sunday we’re talking about how the NFL’s

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.620
been mistreating its cheerleaders for decades,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.020
and how some cheerleaders are starting to fight back.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.620
But before we get into it, if you like topics like this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.540
Well, dance and cheerleading are not only a sport, it's an art.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.460
And I think that's why I fell in love with it.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.280
It's expressing yourself through movement and it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.100
performing and making other people happy.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.620
And that's why I love it so much.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.640
That’s Bailey Davis, former cheerleader

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.140
with the New Orleans Saints.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.940
After three years of being on the team she was fired

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.640
by the Saints for posting a photo of

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.540
herself in a one-piece outfit

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.660
on her Instagram page.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.280
The team said that her post violated their rules

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.600
that cheerleaders not appear nude, semi-nude or in lingerie.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380
It just didn't make sense to me that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.040
they could promote me however they wanted to.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.580
But when I did it, it was seen as inappropriate

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.620
and made me a bad representation of the team.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760
I didn't really understand that they could post

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.380
pictures of me in my uniform, which is a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.400
two-piece and low-cut, but the bodysuit was inappropriate.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.100
They also allege without proof that Davis attended a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.560
party where a player from the organization was present

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160
– something that would also violate team rules.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.580
They told me that if a cheerleader's name even came

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.800
out of the football player's mouth, she would be fired.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.540
And that's when I realized, wow, the players

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.900
don't have this rule at all.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.040
Davis and her lawyer have since filed a federal complaint

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.800
against the NFL and the Saints

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.920
on the basis of gender discrimination, arguing that the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.100
no-contact rule between cheerleaders and players

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.920
should go both ways if the rule were to remain.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.200
The first thing to do, that is absolutely free of the NFL,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.860
is to change the rules, have them equal.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.280
Have us not feel like we're the ones having to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.140
protect ourselves from the football players.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.640
Don't put it completely on us,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.080
and our job shouldn't ride on whether a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.220
football player is trying to contact us or not.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.000
But even though this might seem

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.800
like an open-and-shut case, it's not.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.200
The NFL’s been able to argue on numerous occasions – which we’ll get to –

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.200
that cheerleaders are not its direct employees,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.040
and that gender discrimination rules only apply to "NFL personnel,"

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.500
a title that Davis and her lawyer argue also applies to her.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.320
OK, before I continue telling you about Davis,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.920
let's contextualize cheerleading a bit and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.640
figure out how we got to this point.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.140
Organized cheerleading as a profession goes back to the 1890s

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.820
and was a male-dominated activity.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.580
And female cheerleaders don't arrive on the scene

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.500
until the 1940s as men were being

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.800
drafted and sent off to serve in World War II.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440
Oh, and some famous male cheerleaders of the past?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.680
Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mitt Romney, George W. bush...

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.540
… Dubya did a whole lot of cheering for war, didn’t he?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.380
Checks out.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.440
The NFL introduced professional cheerleading in the 1950s

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.820
for the then Baltimore Colts,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.760
and the cheerleaders wore noticeably more modest uniforms.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.300
It wasn't until the 1970s that NFL

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.920
cheerleader uniforms changed to what we know today.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.500
The Dallas Cowboys introduced new uniforms

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.460
that caught America's attention, especially after

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.700
the 1972 Super Bowl, where the cheer squad

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.820
performed dance routines as opposed to their usual acrobatics.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.960
But since then, criticism that NFL cheerleaders are used

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160
as props for ogling has been a

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.360
consistent grievance leveled against the league.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.240
Nancy Armour is a sports columnist for USA Today

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.020
and has reported on this ongoing story.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.560
I think the problem with professional cheerleading

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.180
is in a lot of ways it's not cheerleading.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.560
It's basically treating women as objects.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.020
If you look at cheerleading in college it's much more

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.240
of an athletic endeavor, a sport.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.500
It's open to men and women and that's not the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.180
case with professional cheerleaders and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.180
unfortunately that leads to abuses of

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.500
the women by the people who are employing them.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.360
Not only do they have to deal with fans

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.720
ogling them and scrutinizing their appearance,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.220
they had to deal with

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220
scrutiny from NFL teams themselves.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.400
The majority of NFL teams have weight

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.880
restrictions for their cheerleaders,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.620
where they have to stay within a certain

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.560
weight level and are forbidden from

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.060
gaining even a few pounds.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.020
Of course, this not only has to do

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.960
with their appearance on the field, but also on the wildly

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.700
popular cheerleader calendars.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.880
One example of this is the terribly-named

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.600
Washington Redskins who flew their

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.160
cheerleaders to Costa Rica for a

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.140
calendar shoot in 2013.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.620
During the shoot, some cheerleaders reported

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.920
they were acquired to stand around topless, even

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.280
though there wouldn't be any nudity in the calendar,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.400
while others stood around with only body paint to cover them.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.840
But it gets even worse.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.600
The cheerleaders had to deal with

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.700
spectators from the Redskins fan base

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.960
who had been invited to attend the photo shoot.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.420
By having cheerleaders in their current form,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.320
in these sexed-up objects on the sidelines,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.580
that have really no other role

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.240
or no other purpose than to be ogled

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.000
by fans, the NFL is telling women,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.520
"We really don't care about you.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.200
We want your money,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.080
but you as people, you as employees,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.640
we don't really care about you."

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.180
Davis also experienced a lot of rules

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.800
and restrictions around her appearance

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.500
at the games and even at practice.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.240
Our contract was very strict as far as

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.920
appearance goes we always had to have

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.900
our nails manicured and done either

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.360
nude or French tip. We always had to have full

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.900
face gameday makeup that was for appearances.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.320
Obviously game day and practice,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.660
we always had to have her hair done,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.720
we always had to have a spray tan,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.680
and all that we had to pay for ourselves.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.640
But Davis also experienced numerous episodes

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.340
of full-on sexual harassment while

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.300
trying to sell cheerleader calendars to

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.220
fans at the game.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.860
And in order for Bailey to cheer

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.760
on the field, she had to sell a minimum

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.240
number of these calendars in

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.760
massive crowds that often led to uncomfortable situations.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.360
They would say rude sexual comments.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.200
I've had my butt grabbed before and it is a very shameful

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.540
feeling and you feel like it's your fault.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.040
And there was one instance where a fan

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.560
pulled a calendar out of my hand

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.140
and he immediately flipped to my month in the

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.840
swimsuit calendar and he made just a

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.860
simple sexual comment about my body and

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.820
that was kind of my breaking point.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.660
Davis believes that to prevent sexual harassment,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.120
cheerleaders need protection in these situations,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.100
just as the players receive protection when they're in public.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.020
Don't have us up on a pedestal as

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.360
celebrities and in these beautiful

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.120
uniforms and then throw us out into the

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.660
crowd with no protection, having fans be

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.540
able to speak to us however they want

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.380
and touch us if they want.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.200
That's just completely ridiculous

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.980
And then there's wages.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.780
While some players are making millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.520
cheerleaders aren't even making minimum wage.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.620
In 2014, the now Las Vegas bound Oakland Raiders

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.260
settled a lawsuit where they were accused of only paying

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.560
their cheerleaders 5 dollars an hour -

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.720
when minimum wage in California at the time

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.080
was $8 an hour.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.740
And that same year, the

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.820
Buffalo Bills disbanded their

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.820
cheerleading squad after five former members filed a

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.060
lawsuit alleging they had gone unpaid for hours they

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.560
had worked.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.480
And Nancy Armour believes this is

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.360
further evidence that the

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.680
multibillion-dollar NFL doesn't value these women.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.200
If you are contending that these women

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.400
are valued employees, that they're an

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.200
important part of the message that you send,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.860
they're an important part of your

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.900
team's community, then their pay should

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.700
reflect that. It should be more than, you

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.120
know, minimum wage or whatever it is that they get.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.980
Compensate them fairly.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.840
So, in the wake of the #MeToo movement with open

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.920
conversations about sexual misconduct

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.180
and creating safer environments for

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.420
women, why have the NFL and its clubs

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.160
been so slow to enact better pay and

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.840
create a safer environment for the cheerleaders?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.160
The questions about cheerleaders and kind of the grousing

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.560
about them has been going on for years.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.700
But I think women are finally saying, "No.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.520
You know what? This is not

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.780
fair, this is not acceptable, and I'm not

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.880
going to take it anymore."

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.260
Despite the slow response the NFL has

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260
agreed to hold meetings with Davis and

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.640
her lawyer to address unfair pay and

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.880
discuss creating safer environments for cheerleaders.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.140
But many remain skeptical about how far the league is willing to

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.960
go to bring that change, especially when

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.640
they're so hesitant about making change in general.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.080
Cheerleader rules are set by each team.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.720
So, the league can only do so much.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.940
But the league can send a very important message that this is appropriate,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.260
this is not, and we really

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.660
think that you should conform to the more appropriate set of rules.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.420
So, what can change?

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.060
Well, some think the reintroduction of men into NFL cheerleading squads

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.120
could change the pervasive climate of sexual harassment.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.580
Both the Los Angeles Rams

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.680
and New Orleans Saints - Davis's former

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.960
team - have introduced men as part of

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.400
their upcoming cheerleading squads.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.740
Nancy Armour thinks it's not necessarily a

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.660
matter of including men on cheerleading

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.380
squads and more about NFL ownership.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.140
I'm not sure if the NFL will ever get rid of

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.960
cheerleading altogether. I think it's

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.680
engrained in the sport and I think there

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.420
are unfortunately too many people who

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.880
think that it's necessary to objectify

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.580
women as part of the entertainment.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.320
I think within the next hopefully five

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.020
years cheerleaders will look different,

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.060
they will be treated differently,

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.620
and there will be a different attitude about what they do.
