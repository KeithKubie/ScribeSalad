00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:03.128
SUBJECT 1: I didn't
know any trans

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.610
or gender-nonconforming folks,
really -- not out folks--

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.120
in the late '90s, early 2000s.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.686
SUBJECT 2: Even
after I came out,

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:12.820
I was definitely shutting
down a part of myself

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.020
so that I could just fit in
with my existing friends.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.590
SUBJECT 3: For me,
it was a huge deal

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.847
to have finally articulated to
someone that I was something

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:22.680
other than straight.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.054
JUDY JARVIS: Hi,
I'm Judy Jarvis.

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:26.670
I'm director of the Princeton
University LGBT Center,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.710
and we have this incredible
project, the Princeton LGBTQIA

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.229
Oral History Project.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.760
The goal of the project is to
capture, record the stories,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.670
and archive the stories
of LGBTQ Princetonians

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.257
from all different class years.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:42.840
RITA KEAZER: I think I was very
naive, thinking that Princeton

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.414
was always the way it is today.

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:47.580
I forgot there had to be
an evolution that came here

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.955
and there were
lots of people who

00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:50.760
had to really make sacrifices.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.280
JUDY JARVIS: The goal here is
to really center stories that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.180
have not always been centered,
to say to alums that what

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.530
your experiences were,
whether positive,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.250
negative, some mix of
both, whatever they were,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.980
they really matter, and they're
really important to students

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.780
now and to future students.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.640
Elders in the community,
LGBTQ alums of color, trans

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.710
and non-binary alums
are really important.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.460
So those were our
four focuses, the idea

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.720
being that not only do we
want to center LGBTQ voices,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.430
but we particularly
want to center those

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.390
that don't always get centered.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.420
PALOMA AGUAS: It felt
like an extreme privilege

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.836
to be able to learn
what Princeton

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:28.470
was like from the
alumni we talked with.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.400
Having not known much about
the history of this institution

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100
for when they went
here, and then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.850
getting to hear what
their perspective was

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.820
like about that time
was really enlightening.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.180
JUDY JARVIS: The Every
Voice conference in 2013,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.249
which was for LGBTQ
alumni to come back,

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.790
there were actually some oral
histories done as part of that.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.900
We knew that there
was a lot to tell.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.160
So I reached out to
the Princeton BTGALA,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.580
the alumni group, to gender
and sexuality studies,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.560
to the University
Archives to see,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.690
could we partner together
and do a project.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.760
We know there's interest,
but do we really

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.550
have everyone at the
table to make this happen?

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.060
And excitingly, all
of them were all in.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.500
They were so excited
to be able to capture

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.720
the stories of LGBTQ alums.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.540
So with that partnership and
the funding of the Princeton

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.620
Histories Fund, we were able
to set off on this project.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.540
We formed an advisory
board and that board

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.870
really said, OK, how
do we find alums?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.940
How do we reach out
to folks, especially

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.340
those who didn't have a positive
experience at Princeton,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.312
who might not be really
clicked into what's going on?

00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.020
So we're on the cusp
of figuring out what

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.660
phase two of this project is.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.760
So we did one summer,
collected the 73 interviews.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.400
So now myself, the advisory
board, and our partners

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.430
are in the process of seeing if
we can get the funds together

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.290
to do another round
of interviewing.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.530
So we hope that will come to
pass, and if it comes to pass,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.479
we will definitely be looking
for more alums to interview

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.270
and we'll also be
looking for more students

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.695
to be part of the project.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:57.590
RITA KEAZER: It does make
you have hope for the future,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.048
feel like, well,
we've come so far.

00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:02.190
There is long way to go, but
I think we can get there.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.290
It's in our sights.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.640
