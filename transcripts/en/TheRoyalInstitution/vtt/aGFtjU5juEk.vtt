00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.190
I'm Richard Dawkins, University
of Oxford.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.160
And I gave the Christmas
Lectures, Christmas 1991.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.470
This is a heavy cannonball.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.840
I'm going to stand here and I'm
going to release it and

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.860
it's going to go over there and
it's going to come roaring

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.055
back towards me.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:32.040
And all my instincts are going
to tell me to run for it.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.900
But I have enough faith in the
scientific method to know that

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.980
it's going to stop just about
an inch short, or perhaps

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.530
less, of my head.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.780
So here goes.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.530
The title of the lectures was
Growing Up in the Universe.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.030
And I meant growing up in a
number of different senses.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.464
There's the child growing up
and discovering for herself

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.650
what a wonderful place the
universe is and what a thrill

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.540
it is to understand it.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.010
Then there's humanity growing up
in understanding, which is

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.480
the progress of science,
the history of science.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.590
Then there was growing up in
the sense of evolution.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.580
In the sense of our evolution
from our bacterial, whatever

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.240
they were, beginnings through
mammals and primates, to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.100
become the species we are now
when we really do have a large

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.650
measure of understanding, thanks
to the development in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.135
history of modern science.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.290
DNA comes like an ever-flowing
river down the generations.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.540
The river of DNA that flows
through us into the future is

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.780
a pure river that leaves us
exactly as it finds us, with

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.406
one exception.

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:03.940
There are very occasional
random

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.690
changes called mutations.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.860
Because of these, there is
genetic variation in the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.750
population and that opens the
way for natural selection.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.630
A children's audience is quite
a frightening audience,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.400
because they're in some
ways harder to please

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.050
than an adult audience.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.050
One of the nice things about
doing the Christmas Lectures

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.270
is that it's a key to
open many doors.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.300
And if you ring up almost
anybody in the country and say

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.195
I'm doing the Christmas Lectures
can you help me, they

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.420
instantly say yes.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.740
And so you can get really
quite complicated and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.270
expensive apparatus and people
from all over the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.130
country will deliver.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.600
We had a virtual reality company
that sort of down

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.100
tools and spent an enormous
amount of time and trouble

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.500
making a virtual reality
version of this lecture

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.740
theatre, no doubt very advanced
for its time, where a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.030
child could come up and put on
headphones and goggles and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.270
would see a very vivid
representation of a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.090
three-dimensional world.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.640
So you could fly around
the Ri Lecture

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.140
Theatre in virtual reality.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.470
And that was something
which I couldn't have

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.380
done but for the Ri.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.200
Because the Christmas Lectures
have become so well respected

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.050
in the country, with their noble
history going back to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.370
Faraday, that you can get
whatever you like.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.450
Well, this idea reminds me of
a brilliant passage from one

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.380
of my favourite works of
fiction, The Hitchhiker's

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.780
Guide to the Galaxy
by Douglas Adams.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.010
In fact, I'm so fond of this
passage that I was wanting

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.110
somebody to read it out.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.320
Would anybody like
to volunteer?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.860
We put in various jokes, and
one was because I wanted to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.450
have somebody read from one
of Douglas Adams' books.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.270
A very interesting idea, very
wittily expressed, of the idea

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.480
that one might breed a species
of animal which actually

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.010
wanted to be eaten and was
capable of telling us so.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.650
And that would remove at a
stroke the moral objections to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.200
eating meat.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.080
And Douglas Adams had a very,
very witty story, a science

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.540
fiction fantasy about
such an animal.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.290
And the obvious thing to do
would be to ask a child to

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.135
come up and read
this paragraph.

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:20.079
But then we thought, wouldn't
it be fun to get

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.960
Douglas Adams himself?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.230
Your name is?

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.200
Douglas.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.350
Douglas what?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.970
Adams.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.800
Douglas Adams, what an
amazing coincidence.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.180
"A large dairy animal
approached Zaphod

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.050
Beeblebrox's table.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.545
A meaty bovine quadruped with
watery eyes, small horns, and

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:51.430
an ingratiating smile
on its lips.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.560
'Good evening,' it lowed, and
sat back heavily on its

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.110
haunches. 'I am the main
Dish of the Day.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.870
May I interest you in
parts of my body?'"
