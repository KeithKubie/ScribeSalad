00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:07.650
ALAN SEALES: Having
left her job as a CIA

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.200
analyst for ethical reasons,
newly appointed Secretary

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.910
of State Elizabeth
McCord returns

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.080
to the public life at the
request of the president

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.074
after the suspicious
death of her predecessor.

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:18.490
This is the beginning
of the show.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.017
Valued by her boss and
her apologetical leanings,

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.100
knowledgeable of the Middle
East, language skills,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.520
and creative thinking, Elizabeth
drives international diplomacy,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.920
battles office politics,
and circumvents protocol

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.090
when negotiating national
and international issues.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.150
At home, politics and
compromise take on a new meaning

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.660
with her supportive husband
and three bright kids.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.451
We're going to roll a
little sizzle for you

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:41.994

- If I was going to
have someone killed,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.890
I'd at least be a little
discreet about it.

MORGAN FREEMAN:
I'm Morgan Freeman.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.300
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:17.576
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.340
Have a seat there.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.190
MORGAN FREEMAN: OK.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.332

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.290
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.414
MORGAN FREEMAN: He told me
to take the middle seat.

00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:26.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.250
ALAN SEALES: I want--

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.122
when I was preparing
for this event,

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:32.580
I was kind of
conflicted, because I

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.550
didn't know how deep to dig
this into the story of "Madam

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.196
Secretary" and the CBS show.

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.570
And what I decided,
the direction

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.510
I decided to take this in was
to be more about the two of you

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.690
as a duo, as a pair, as a
producing team, because--

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.730
well, I guess I should
let you tell that story.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.340
Like, what is your
production company?

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.727
How did the two of
you get connected?

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:57.476
MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm
not going to tell you.

00:01:57.476 --> 00:01:58.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:00.150
ALAN SEALES: And
we're out of time.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.900
LORI MCCREARY: Oh.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.280
MORGAN FREEMAN: Back in
the early '90s, '90--

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.210
[GIBBERISH]

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.360
--'92, we did a movie.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.285
And she was the producer,
I was the director.

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:22.410
LORI MCCREARY: I hired him.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:29.460
MORGAN FREEMAN: It's true.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.377 --> 00:02:35.630
And we just--

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.370
I don't know, I had the same
mindset, frame of reference.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.970
What to do, how best
things should work,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.690
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.440
And we made a pretty good movie.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.080
And a couple of years
later, we were talking.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.250
Somehow we held
on to each other.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.470
And I remember--

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.960
I don't know if I asked Lori
what it was that she wanted

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.855
to do or what, but at
the time, Dustin Hoffman

00:03:19.855 --> 00:03:21.490
had told me, listen.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.620
You want to get your own stuff
done, form a film company.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.652
That's easy to do.

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:29.110
You can just form a film company
or call it a film company,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.450
and it's just a name
on a piece of paper

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.210
that you register somewhere.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.370
And I did, because then you can
acquire and store properties.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.950
And so in this
conversation with Lori,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.040
she said, what I really want to
do is run my own film company.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.060
And you get one of those
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) ding

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.240
things going on.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.970
I said, well, guess what?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.480
I have one, and I need
somebody to run it.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.850
So that was the beginning of it.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.700
OK, said, what do
we call ourselves?

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.780
Well, depends.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.980
What do we want to do?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.970
Well, we want to make
movies that speak truth

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.437
and what's that--

00:04:21.437 --> 00:04:24.020
LORI MCCREARY: Enlighten people,
enhance the human experience.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.353
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah, that's it.

00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:29.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.856
So I said, Revelations.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.100
She said, great.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.690
She's Christian, so she
immediately went to the Bible

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.440
with the idea.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.246
And I thought, that's not it.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.380
We're revealing.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.890
This is-- revelation
means to reveal.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.050
So there we are,
and here we are,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.490
I don't know how
many years later.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.440
Because I can't count.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.581
I don't do math very well.

00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:54.080
How many?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.826
LORI MCCREARY: 20.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:55.200
MORGAN FREEMAN: 20.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.400
LORI MCCREARY: 20 since
we started the company, 25

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.678
since we made the movie.

00:04:58.678 --> 00:04:59.594
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:04:59.594 --> 00:05:00.970
Wow.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.780
And there you go.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.463
LORI MCCREARY: I was 10.

00:05:03.463 --> 00:05:06.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.320
Can I add a little
color to that?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320
ALAN SEALES: Oh, please.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.530
LORI MCCREARY: So we--

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.740
we made a movie in Zimbabwe in
1992, which was a little crazy.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.765
And I was a computer scientist
before I became a producer.

00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:20.560
[CHEERING]

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.460
[LAUGH]

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.580
MORGAN FREEMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.190
LORI MCCREARY: A programmer.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.480
C++ programmer.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.976
I loved programming.

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:30.810
[CHEERING]

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.650
I was really good at it.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.882
I was really good at it, but I
really also was a storyteller.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.840
From when I was eight
years old, I did theater.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.690
And I was sitting at the
computer coding one night,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.280
and I thought, I
really want to do

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.999
something that tells stories.

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:46.540
And at the time, I had started
a software company that helped

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.010
lawyers bill people more.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.440
So I was, like, conflicted.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.650
And so when Morgan and I were
in Zimbabwe making this film--

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.210
and by the way,
Paramount Pictures

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.310
sent me and my
producing partner there

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.890
without any other
producers only because I

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.346
went into Paramount Pictures
to the head of production,

00:06:05.346 --> 00:06:06.970
because he was going
to grill me to see

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.094
if I knew what I was doing.

00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:11.830
I went in with a compact
dual drive computer

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.340
with the first budgeting and
scheduling software program

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.480
on DOS.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.400
And he thought I was
a genius, because he'd

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.040
say, well, you need to cut
four days out of your schedule.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.650
And I'd put minus 4,
and tell him how much--

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.960
we're going to save $436,000.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.950
And he was writing
down all these numbers.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.760
And what I found out much
later was Paramount Pictures

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.785
was still doing all
their budgeting on paper.

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:35.170
You know, with calculators.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.900
So they thought I was,
like, this genius producer.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.510
And all I really knew how to
do was, like, search for grip

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.220
and change a number on a budget.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.330
So it was really great to
have the experience I had.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.790
And when Morgan
and I were talking,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.700
Dreamworks was just starting
their interactive division,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.070
and I was talking to them
about going there and working.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.180
And I was conflicted,
because I love technology.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.400
I love what it's
doing to our industry.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.040
And I was really--
but I really wanted

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.200
to go more into
storytelling, but I

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.920
didn't want to let
go of the technology,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.580
and so this was the
conversation we were having.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.610
And when he said,
oh, would you like

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.720
to start a film company,
what I said was,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.400
what would that look like?

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.450
And what I was thinking on
the inside was, oh my God!

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.510
So it was a match
made in heaven.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.723
He's a great, great partner.

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:26.806
MORGAN FREEMAN: Let him
talk about me for a while.

00:07:26.806 --> 00:07:28.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.770
LORI MCCREARY: Go.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.619
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.660
ALAN SEALES: I've got a
whole bio section on you.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.826
MORGAN FREEMAN: I like that.

00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:35.254
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.720
What one of the lead-ins to
this whole movie-making thing

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.380
that we did was
the year before, I

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.570
had worked with Clint Eastwood,
the first movie I did with him.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.510
And Clint Eastwood as a
director was like this.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.878
[SNAPPING FINGERS]

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.870
He's always on time.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.190
He was always on budget,
because he doesn't fool around.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.164
So we brought our picture
in on time and under budget.

00:08:00.164 --> 00:08:01.330
LORI MCCREARY: Under budget.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.141
Like, $800,000 under budget
because of the director.

00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:06.890
MORGAN FREEMAN: Because
of Clint Eastwood.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.170
LORI MCCREARY: And this--

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.250
MORGAN FREEMAN: Quick teacher.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.500
LORI MCCREARY: What I didn't
know until my first film,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.959
I thought every film started
at 6:00 in the morning

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.500
and wrapped by 3:00
in the afternoon,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.600
because that's the
hours that Morgan kept.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.370
So my first movie, I
thought, this is great.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.940
And then the next movie we
did, it was 14-hour days.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.460
And I was thinking,
what are we doing?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.710
I need Morgan to direct again.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.820
ALAN SEALES: I just love that
I've been up here for, like,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.210
seven minutes and
asked one question.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.085
LORI MCCREARY: Sorry.

00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:32.697
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:32.697 --> 00:08:33.780
MORGAN FREEMAN: All right.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.446
Ask another one.

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:35.321
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:37.820
ALAN SEALES: Well, you're here
to promote "Madam Secretary,"

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.299
among other things.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.606
So tell us about-- tell
us about this show.

00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:42.980
Why did Revelations
Entertainment

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.297
decide to create and
produce "Madam Secretary?"

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:46.380
MORGAN FREEMAN: Good idea.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.120
I mean, good question.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.430
It also was a good idea.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.180
Looking around for something--

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.790
Lori should actually
start talking

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.690
on one of these situations,
because I draw blanks.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.980
But I know we were looking for
an out, some way to make money,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.365
to work.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:10.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:11.420
ALAN SEALES: As one should.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.294
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:09:12.294 --> 00:09:13.274
And we talked to--

00:09:13.274 --> 00:09:14.440
LORI MCCREARY: Nina Tassler.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.420
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah, we had
lunch with Nina Tassler of CBS.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.877
And I don't know--

00:09:19.877 --> 00:09:21.710
she said come up with
something, didn't she?

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.910
LORI MCCREARY: She Said yeah.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.284
We had lunch with Nina, and
I said, you know, filmmaking,

00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:27.050
the middle class of
film was drying up.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.956
The "Million Dollar
Babies," "Shawshanks,"

00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:30.830
those kind of movies
are really hard to make.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.299
And five years
ago, hard to make.

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:34.590
And so we thought, maybe we
should get into television.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.200
So I basically just-- we had
lunch with her and we said,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.450
how do we get into television?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.360
And she said, come back to
us with a character that you

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.940
can spend 100 hours
with, or a place that you

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.590
can spend 100 hours in.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:51.010
And being filmmakers, like,
two hours, I was like, OK.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.700
And we went away and
thought about it.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.190
And the real story of the
inception of the idea,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.650
I was sitting with our head
of development at a bar

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.220
next to our office, and
Hillary's Benghazi hearings

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.927
were on, and you know, this
image of her doing this.

00:10:05.927 --> 00:10:08.260
MORGAN FREEMAN: What difference
does it-- at this point,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.990
what difference does it
make, that statement?

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.073
LORI MCCREARY: And-- yeah.

00:10:11.073 --> 00:10:13.240
And I thought, oh
my gosh, because I

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.310
figured she'd be going
home that night, talking

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.360
about what happened.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.110
And I thought, OK.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.170
We could spend 100 hours with
a female secretary of state

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.570
who has a family,
and what's going on?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.020
MORGAN FREEMAN: By that time,
she was the third one we'd had.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:32.220
And all three of them had
left an indelible mark

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.140
as our country's
representatives.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.000
So boy.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.080
There we go.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.950
We got strong women.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.700
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.687
I mean, Madeleine
Albright, Condoleezza Rice,

00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:43.520
and Hillary Clinton.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.470
Yeah.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.430
So what is the truth that
you were trying to show in--

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.450
like, in the show of
"Madam Secretary," what

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.860
truth are you trying to reveal?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.910
MORGAN FREEMAN: How government
really, really works.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.650
ALAN SEALES: So is it based on
a lot of, like, true stories

00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.090
that you knew about?

00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.881
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:02.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.270
She says, I say.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.511
Well, you have to--

00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:06.510
LORI MCCREARY: Inspired.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.080
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.580
Yeah.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.820
We have to use current events.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.820
They inform the
stories that we tell.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.325
But you know, we
make up shit too.

00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:19.200
LORI MCCREARY: Right.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.324
President Clinton
came to us one time

00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:25.240
and said he loved our
show, "Madam Secretary."

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.510
And then he said, but I wanted
to be the character Henry,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.970
because he's an agent
and a professor.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.710
He's like, I wanted
to go into the field.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.220
I want to do that.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.565
So it's not really true.

00:11:35.565 --> 00:11:36.440
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:36.870
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.020
You guys are good
at name dropping.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:38.670
It's fun.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.760
Yeah.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:39.990
MORGAN FREEMAN: Well--

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.370
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, when Bill
Clinton came and called me

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.370
the other day, I was just
like, what's up, Bill?

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.120
It just happens.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.290
MORGAN FREEMAN: I know Bill.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.415
ALAN SEALES: I know you do.

00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:48.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:50.620
MORGAN FREEMAN: I've
known him since he

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.445
was governor of Arkansas.

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:51.990
ALAN SEALES: Did you really?

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.780
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.370
ALAN SEALES: Wow
And did he influence

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:54.920
any of the show at all?

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.060
Do you go to him for--

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.350
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.710
No, no no.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.250
ALAN SEALES: --her
secret stories?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:57.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:57.845 --> 00:11:58.970
MORGAN FREEMAN: No, no, no.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:59.724
No, no.

00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:00.390
ALAN SEALES: No?

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:00.820
You can't say that?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.903
MORGAN FREEMAN: We can't--

00:12:01.903 --> 00:12:07.150
you know, because we can't
use, really use them, you know?

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.680
It adds too much
something-- what?

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.310
Come on, help.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.880
LORI MCCREARY: Pressure.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.921
MORGAN FREEMAN: Pressure.

00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:14.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.490
ALAN SEALES: I love
how you complete

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.310
each other's sentences.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.101
LORI MCCREARY: Yes.

00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:18.610
ALAN SEALES: Wonderful.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.369
And both of you wear so many
hats, both in real life--

00:12:22.369 --> 00:12:23.410
well, it's all real life.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.610
But in--

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.720
I guess outside of the show
and inside of the show,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.390
specifically.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.930
So Morgan, you're executive
producing, obviously.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.570
And you have a few--

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.480
you have a role that you
reprise every now and then.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.460
And then now you're about
to-- or have directed

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.960
your third episode of it?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.410
MORGAN FREEMAN: I have.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.160
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.740
So when do you look
at this and say, like,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.530
I'm going to be that guy, or I'm
going to direct this episode?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.988
How do you go
through that process?

00:12:48.988 --> 00:12:51.190
MORGAN FREEMAN: No, we've
decided that I'm-- this is

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.260
going to be a tradition.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:13:01.910
I will direct the first episode
of each season that we're on.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:08.530
So hopefully, we have about
eight more seasons to go.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.590
By which time, I'll
be ready to retire.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.090
ALAN SEALES: And why do--

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.480
or why do TV shows--

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.930
I've always wondered this-- why
do TV shows switch directors

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:20.982
so often?

00:13:20.982 --> 00:13:22.690
LORI MCCREARY: It's
a very good question.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.610
We shoot every eight days.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.800
We're either prepping
the next episode,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.400
shooting the current episode,
or editing the episode before.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.434
So at a minimum, you
need three directors.

00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:33.850
If you had three
directors, they'd

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.711
be working all the way
through, and it's hard--

00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:37.960
MORGAN FREEMAN: Day and night.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.600
LORI MCCREARY: Yeah, and it's
hard to find three directors

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.920
who want to do the same show.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.510
And so we alternate directors.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.970
The first season, we had
17 different directors

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.770
doing 23 episodes.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.900
This season, we have about 14
directors doing 23 episodes.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.530
So many of them do two,
and over half of them

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.080
are female, which
I'm very happy about.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:00.832 --> 00:14:04.230
ALAN SEALES: So 22, 23
episodes per season.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.859
That's a lot.

00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:05.650
LORI MCCREARY: Yes.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.110
Every eight days, we get a
new script, a new director,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.962
and a new story.

00:14:08.962 --> 00:14:10.420
ALAN SEALES: So
typical season now,

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.461
I mean, especially with
the on-demand generation,

00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:14.211
you get, like, eight
or 10 or 12 episodes.

00:14:14.211 --> 00:14:15.044
LORI MCCREARY: Yeah.

00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:15.890
That would be nice.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:16.469
[LAUGH]

00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:18.010
ALAN SEALES: So was
it your decision?

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.230
It doesn't sound like it to do--

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.396
LORI MCCREARY: It's network.

00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:23.830
Network television is
typically 20 to 24 episodes,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.722
and it's the very clear season.

00:14:26.722 --> 00:14:28.930
The things that are happening
in streaming and cable,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.388
it's kind of a
year-round business.

00:14:30.388 --> 00:14:32.750
And you can do six
episodes, you can do 12.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.720
It's a little bit amorphous.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.970
And you usually get
more time to spend.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.470
We have eight days to shoot.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.809
Sometimes they have 12, 15
days to shoot one episode.

00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:43.600
ALAN SEALES: So we're
about to see season--

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.970
episode 1, season 4 this Sunday.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.440
Are Is the whole season done?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.670
Are you still filming?

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.530
LORI MCCREARY: We are
on 8, 4-08, episode 8.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.492
And this will-- we
shot episode 1 in July,

00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:57.700
and it's airing in September.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.190
But by the time we get to
Christmas, we'll have shot--

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.410
I think it's episode
14, and it will air--

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.300
we'll finish it on a Friday.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.530
We'll edit it the next
Friday, and it'll air Sunday.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.480
So it's very quick.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.290
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.630
And obviously, things happen
in real life, we'll call it.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.280
You know, for example, like
Tim Daly had his ski accident.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.582
[LAUGH]

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.790
I think it was middle of
season 2 or season 3, right?

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.130
So how did that affect shooting?

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.665
Did you have to write that--
write in any changes for that?

00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:23.830
LORI MCCREARY: Yes.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.690
We had to-- the
writers had to go back

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.990
to two episodes that were
already written and write in.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.850
The good news is
at that moment, we

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.664
were shooting a big action
scene where miraculously he

00:15:33.664 --> 00:15:34.330
didn't get hurt.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.730
So we just had him get hurt.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.917
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:40.000
ALAN SEALES: That's funny.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.132
I guess that makes sense.

00:15:41.132 --> 00:15:42.090
You make the use of it.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:42.340
LORI MCCREARY: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.060
It was more realistic
for the show really.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.530
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:44.760
Right.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.468
LORI MCCREARY: Not so
good for him, but--

00:15:46.468 --> 00:15:47.350
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.580
So Morgan, let's talk about you.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.621
MORGAN FREEMAN: Go ahead.

00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:50.890
ALAN SEALES: OK.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.930
Probably more well known
as an Oscar-winning actor,

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.100
got started at the age
of nine in a school play,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.010
won a drama competition at
age 12, performed on the radio

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.520
during high school, served
in the US Air Force,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.326
raising to rank
Airman First Class.

00:16:05.326 --> 00:16:06.700
You took acting
lessons, you were

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.800
a dancer in the
World's Fair, you've

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.840
been in Off-Broadway
in '67, and then

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.740
in Broadway for an all-black
version of "Hello, Dolly"

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.580
in '68.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.930
You didn't get to
film until '71.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.072
Why-- what made you
do that transition?

00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:23.030
MORGAN FREEMAN: No, no.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.130
I-- from childhood, I
wanted to be in the movies.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:26.880
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.754
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:16:27.754 --> 00:16:29.297
But how do you get into movies?

00:16:29.297 --> 00:16:30.380
ALAN SEALES: Off-Broadway?

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.210
Broadway?

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:31.710
MORGAN FREEMAN: Well, yeah.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.870
I thought you could just go
to Hollywood and say, hey.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.369
I'm here.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.240
Because that's what I did.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.837
I went to Hollywood and
I went to Paramount.

00:16:39.837 --> 00:16:40.920
I didn't go to the studio.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.240
I went to offices that they
had in Hollywood on Sunset.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.550
And I-- I'm an actor, and I'm
looking for something to do,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.050
you know?

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.618
And she said, do you
belong to a union?

00:16:54.618 --> 00:16:55.499
No.

00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:57.290
She said, well, you
have to join the union.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.910
I said, well, OK.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.740
How was that-- [INAUDIBLE]
said, all right.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.775
So I got all the information.

00:17:02.775 --> 00:17:04.150
I didn't have any
money, so I had

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.916
to walk to the union office.

00:17:06.916 --> 00:17:09.290
And I walked in there and
said, I want to join the union.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.498
They said, do you have a job?

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:12.712
And I said, no.

00:17:12.712 --> 00:17:14.295
They told me I had
to be in the union.

00:17:14.295 --> 00:17:16.440
They said, well, you
have to have a job.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.400
So that catch-22, it
still exists, you know?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.650
LORI MCCREARY: Still that way.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.025
MORGAN FREEMAN:
I said, now what?

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:30.090
So eventually, I wound up in
school, taking acting lessons,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.800
Acting 101, I got a D in.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.970
Murmur, go ahead.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.810
Because it's the
truth, you know?

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.140
It's like-- so I'm going
to tell you right now,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.560
acting is not something
you can really teach.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.858
Technique, you can, but
the actual art, you can't.

00:17:51.858 --> 00:17:52.910
Is it an art?

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.320
LORI MCCREARY: You mean you
either have it or you don't?

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:54.890
Or you--

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.790
MORGAN FREEMAN: I kind
of think that-- yeah.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.750
ALAN SEALES: Capital I, It.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.990
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.740
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.040
LORI MCCREARY: It.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.450
MORGAN FREEMAN: There's
this story about--

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.370
and these things
always come from China.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.130
But he was a wheel
maker, and this woman

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.959
wanted him to teach
her son the art.

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:14.250
And he said, well, I can
teach him how to make a wheel,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.863
but I can't teach him the art.

00:18:15.863 --> 00:18:16.810
ALAN SEALES: Hmm.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.730
True.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.070
So I don't know if I'm
allowed to say this,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.500
but you just celebrated
your 80th birthday back--

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.291
MORGAN FREEMAN: You're
allowed to say that.

00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:27.768
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:27.768 --> 00:18:29.740
ALAN SEALES: Wonderful.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.720
MORGAN FREEMAN: I feel
like Muhammad Ali.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.510
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.070
So now you're 80, and then you
credit your first breakout role

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.580
to be the role of Fast Black
in "Street Smart" in '87

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.060
at the age of 50.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.870
So you were acting for decades--

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.870
MORGAN FREEMAN: That was
my movie breakout role.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.120
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.480
Yeah.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.060
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.851
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:18:49.851 --> 00:18:51.940
So would you ever--

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.920
do you ever consider
returning back to theater?

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.510
Do you miss that sort of thing?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.504
Or do you like--

00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:58.420
do you like acting in
front of the camera now?

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:58.590
Or--

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.740
MORGAN FREEMAN: Did you
know what I just said,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.480
a little bit about-- what?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.830
A minute and a half ago?

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.880
ALAN SEALES: I don't
pay much attention.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.421
MORGAN FREEMAN: From childhood,
I wanted to be in the movies.

00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:07.054
In the movies.

00:19:07.054 --> 00:19:08.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.275 --> 00:19:11.050
Movies.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:15.980
Back in '08, I
went back on stage,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.650
and I was with Frances
McDormand and Peter Gallagher.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.819
And I remember one night,
we came out on stage,

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:23.110
ready for the curtain to go up.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.790
And we looked up there and
said, what are we doing here?

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.165
All three of us
are movie actors.

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:28.440
[LAUGH]

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.570
Uh-uh.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.420
No.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.860
I've done that-- been
there, done that, and--

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.100
ALAN SEALES: You're over it?

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.975
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.079
It's a lot of work.

00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:35.870
ALAN SEALES: It is.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.730
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.146
And I think it's
for young people.

00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:40.723
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.723 --> 00:19:42.722
ALAN SEALES: Young people
with makeup sometimes.

00:19:42.722 --> 00:19:43.598
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:19:43.598 --> 00:19:44.680
ALAN SEALES: That's funny.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.990
So do you enjoy-- now
that you're in the movies,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.907
do you enjoy the behind
the camera or in front

00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:49.531
of the camera--

00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:50.372
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yes.

00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:51.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:52.600
ALAN SEALES: Fair.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.530
Let's talk about Lori.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.290

In addition, were profiled

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.490
Just wow.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:33.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.894
And so you've joined
up with Morgan,

00:20:36.894 --> 00:20:38.560
you've had this great
career, but your--

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.022
MORGAN FREEMAN:
Call me Svengali.

00:20:40.022 --> 00:20:40.980
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.520
You joined up with Svengali.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.570
LORI MCCREARY: Yes.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.930
ALAN SEALES: And--

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.300
Svengali Freeman?

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.730
And you've got this great
production career and things

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.740
that you're doing now
for CBS and for Nat Geo,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.030
National Geographic, we'll
touch on in a little bit.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.920
But your computer science
history, how did that even get

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.730
started?

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.910
And then why bring that
into motion pictures now?

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.670
LORI MCCREARY:
Well, so I started

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.900
when I was eight in theater.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.108
And I thought what I was
going to do with my life was

00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:12.490
own a theater and put
on plays for a living

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.610
until I found out that it's
hard to make money doing that.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.170
But literally I was filling
out my college application,

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.529
and a couple nights before,
we had a computerized lighting

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:24.070
system in our local theater,
and the computer didn't turn on,

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.590
and I had to run it manually.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.730
And I was kind of annoyed,
so I thought, oh, I

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:28.540
don't want to study theater.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.140
I've already done it.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.306
I'll study computer science.

00:21:30.306 --> 00:21:34.335
So kind of a fluke to
do that, but I loved it.

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.370
And I also, like, really
dug in, because when

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.453
I went to the counselors--

00:21:37.453 --> 00:21:38.120
I went to UCLA--

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.077
they told me I could,
like, write my own major.

00:21:40.077 --> 00:21:42.110
And I wanted to write a
major between the arts--

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.950
the College of Fine Arts and
computer science department,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.720
cause I thought they
were connecting.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.020
And literally, the
counselor said to me,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.350
you got to choose one, and you
should probably choose theater.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.170
And I was like, OK, I will--

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.980
I'm going to go to
computer science.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.470
So I got my computer science
degree, and I loved it.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.940
And I just saw-- it was
like, just the beginning.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.961
I'm old, a lot
older than you guys.

00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:09.210
But it was just the beginning.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.620
We had to build with our own
breadboards, circuit boards,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.369
we had to build the
computer from scratch,

00:22:13.369 --> 00:22:16.780
write with mixed machine
code to make it work.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.560
So I loved it.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.520
I would still do it
for a living if I

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.700
didn't love even more
telling stories I

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.990
think that make a difference.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.780
And in our business,
our industry,

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.800
the actual making of film and
TV is still very blue collar.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.040
We need so much
help from you guys.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.590
There's a lot that we can do
just kind of on an enterprise

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.260
level to help us be more
efficient in filmmaking

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.140
and make better product
more efficiently.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.140
And so that's what we've been
talking about for the last 20

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.460
years in our company.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.320
We tried to push our
industry to go quicker

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.470
into downloading a film
when the music industry was

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.660
kind of crashing and burning.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.640
Our industry didn't go
quick enough, I think,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.360
but we're getting there.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.660
And so there's a
lot of room for all

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.060
of y'all in the
entertainment business.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.784
We need help.

00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:07.200
ALAN SEALES: And what is the
Picture Technology Committee?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.324
LORI MCCREARY: Motion
Picture Technology Committee,

00:23:09.324 --> 00:23:10.570
there's a lot of--

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.534
there's 8,000 producers
in the Producers Guild,

00:23:13.534 --> 00:23:14.950
and there were a
lot of committees

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.075
that were called new media.

00:23:16.075 --> 00:23:18.190
So people doing kind
of short-form content

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:21.730
and back in the day, CD content
and DVD content, and now

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.750
online content.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.610
But there was no
committee that looked

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.900
at the way we make
motion pictures,

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.430
the literal coming there
with our film cameras

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.250
and all the people with
a lot of paper on set,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.660
and figure out how to
make it more streamlined.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.674
And I would love some
cloud-based system

00:23:38.674 --> 00:23:39.340
that we all use.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.450
We don't have that yet.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.430
So the Motion Picture
Technology Council

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.190
looks at all of those things
and tries to go to vendors

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.342
and asked them to help us
build systems like that.

00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:48.050
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.920
I feel like you could get James
Cameron to help out with that.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.400
LORI MCCREARY:
That would be good.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.400
ALAN SEALES: Just more
explosions, he would say.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.380
More technology for
more explosions.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.870
And that has led to ClickStar.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.434
What is that?

00:23:59.434 --> 00:24:00.850
LORI MCCREARY:
Well, ClickStar was

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:05.560
a company we started
in 2005, back

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.960
before streaming
was the thing, back

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.780
before iTunes was
downloading movies.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.890
And we were the first
downloadable movie site for--

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.720
MORGAN FREEMAN:
What was that movie?

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.872
Our music thing--
where downloading--

00:24:20.872 --> 00:24:21.830
LORI MCCREARY: Napster.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.310
MORGAN FREEMAN: Napster.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.300
Anyway-- and

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.540
LORI MCCREARY:
Post-Napster, pre-iTunes.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.110
MORGAN FREEMAN: The
idea was, figure out

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.810
a way to download movies,
but have digital rights

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.790
management--

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.336
that right?

00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:34.835
DRM?

00:24:34.835 --> 00:24:36.370
LORI MCCREARY: Very good.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.110
MORGAN FREEMAN: So
that it was a safe--

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.450
safe to do when we did it.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.789
But we were a couple of
years ahead of our time.

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:45.330
LORI MCCREARY: The bleeding edge
instead of the cutting edge,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.504
so we kind of got--

00:24:46.504 --> 00:24:48.670
ALAN SEALES: You were the
Google Glass of wearable--

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.628
LORI MCCREARY: Exactly.

00:24:49.628 --> 00:24:51.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.840
I wore Google Glass to the Emmys
the first year they came out.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.522
I loved it.

00:24:56.522 --> 00:24:57.730
ALAN SEALES: And do you get--

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.780
LORI MCCREARY: I got
a lot of photographs.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.530
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:04.660
Talking-- I want to go
back to "Madam Secretary"

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.030
for a little bit here.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.030
The casting, the cast
complements itself--

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.560
complements each other so well.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.080
And Tea Leoni is an
incredible choice

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.516
for the character of Elizabeth.

00:25:15.516 --> 00:25:16.390
How did you find her?

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.560
And was she an obvious choice?

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.601
Or was it a hard-- was it
hard to cast Elizabeth?

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:20.180
[LAUGH]

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.971
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:25:20.971 --> 00:25:21.781
LORI MCCREARY: No.

00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:24.280
She was the first person that
Nina Tassler brought up to us.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.740
They'd been evidently
trying to get

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.490
Tea to do something
for nine years,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.434
CBS had, and all
the other networks.

00:25:29.434 --> 00:25:31.350
But she had-- you know,
she lives in New York,

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.832
she was raising her kids.

00:25:32.832 --> 00:25:33.623
She was-- you know.

00:25:33.623 --> 00:25:35.410
MORGAN FREEMAN: And
she had another show.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:35.720
LORI MCCREARY: Yeah.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.719
And actually, she had
committed to another show,

00:25:37.719 --> 00:25:39.080
and then she read our script.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.931
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.547
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:25:41.547 --> 00:25:42.880
LORI MCCREARY: And she loved it.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.338
MORGAN FREEMAN:
That was a shoo-in.

00:25:44.338 --> 00:25:46.910
ALAN SEALES: So she was attached
early on, it sounds like.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.320
And then how did you
flesh out the rest?

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.280
Like, Tim Daly's great.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.570
Patina, I knew Patina from
when she was in "Sister Act."

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.590
LORI MCCREARY: Oh.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.960
We saw her in
"Pippin," and thought

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.640
she was just extraordinary,
and we knew we-- you know,

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.240
she's a powerhouse and
really great actor.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:02.990
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.910
So did you audition
these people,

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.830
or did you kind of
hand-pick who you wanted?

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.600
And did Morgan have to audition?

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.770
Sorry, Svengali.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.504
Did he audition?

00:26:10.504 --> 00:26:11.420
MORGAN FREEMAN: I did.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.900
LORI MCCREARY: Svengali
actually auditioned.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.500
We were doing a casting
session where he was directing,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.310
and we needed the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.764
We had a couple names of people.

00:26:20.764 --> 00:26:23.180
So we went through this, like,
three-hour casting session.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.550
And then Mark Saks, the
casting director, said,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.470
who are we going to get
to play Chief Justice?

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.700
And we both looked at
Morgan, and Morgan said--

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.935
MORGAN FREEMAN: Do you
want me to audition?

00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:39.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.000
Would you audition?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.944
Sure.

00:26:41.944 --> 00:26:43.610
LORI MCCREARY: So he
literally jumped up

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.030
in front of the camera, and
we sent his tape to CBS.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.690
And I kept getting phone calls.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.630
Did he literally
audition for himself?

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.350
And he was directing, so he--

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.920
I don't know if you
had to sleep with--

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.253
MORGAN FREEMAN: I was a shoo-in.

00:26:56.253 --> 00:26:58.862
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:58.862 --> 00:26:59.922
Yeah.

00:26:59.922 --> 00:27:01.880
ALAN SEALES: Do you
remember the point at which

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.046
you didn't have to audition?

00:27:03.046 --> 00:27:04.597
Was that your last audition?

00:27:04.597 --> 00:27:06.430
MORGAN FREEMAN: After
"Street--" for movies?

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.870
ALAN SEALES: Mm-hmm.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.210
MORGAN FREEMAN: "Street Smart."

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.510
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.930
LORI MCCREARY: Wow.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:09.971
MORGAN FREEMAN: I didn't.

00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:13.390
But what happened after "Street
Smart" was I kept getting--

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.172
I play the "pim-p."

00:27:15.172 --> 00:27:17.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.300
And I got a nomination
for playing a pimp.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.690
Try that.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.810
But I kept getting these
scripts for these kinds of guys,

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.310
you know?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.770
They said-- well, they
thought that actually I

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.170
had been brought
in off the street,

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.240
and just happened to be one of
those, you know, lucky things.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.430
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.220
MORGAN FREEMAN: And the people
in New York, because I'd

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.470
been doing everything
from [? Dunton ?] Theater

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.970
to Broadway in New York said,
well, this guy is a Broad--

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.260
is a Shakespearean
actor, you know?

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.070
You know, you don't know him.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.220
Because they were--
who was that?

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.637
So what was I saying?

00:27:55.637 --> 00:27:57.220
ALAN SEALES: Last
time you auditioned.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.011
MORGAN FREEMAN: Oh.

00:27:58.011 --> 00:27:59.380
Yeah.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.512
I didn't have to
audition after that.

00:28:01.512 --> 00:28:02.750
[LAUGH]

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.495
That was just--

00:28:03.495 --> 00:28:05.370
ALAN SEALES: And you
auditioned for yourself.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:05.780
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.030
ALAN SEALES: Did you give
yourself any audition notes?

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.962
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah, I
use the KISS principle.

00:28:12.962 --> 00:28:14.420
ALAN SEALES: Keep
It Simple Stupid.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.295
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:16.740
ALAN SEALES: Yep.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.000
And the dra-- this is a drama.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.208
The show is a drama for
pretty much most of the time.

00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:22.140
But do you have any
funny moments on set?

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.210
Like, what are some
of the funniest times

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.720
you've had during filming?

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.470
MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm
not going to tell you.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.454
Bad language.

00:28:30.454 --> 00:28:31.620
ALAN SEALES: It's all right.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.170
We're all adults here.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.060
MORGAN FREEMAN: Tea
doesn't like to fuck up.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:39.930
She doesn't.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.290
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.081
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:28:41.081 --> 00:28:44.526
And when she does,
that's what she says.

00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:45.950
ALAN SEALES: And that's funny?

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:47.408
MORGAN FREEMAN:
That's funny to me.

00:28:47.408 --> 00:28:49.563
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:52.870
ALAN SEALES: So
collective single moment.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.306
So we will have time, if
you want to start up with--

00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:56.930
lining up for a few
audience questions,

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.230
we can take a few
here if anybody has

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.170
anything for the two of them.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.750
The kids on the show,
Kathrine, Evan, and Wallace,

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.000
they've-- over the last four
years, you've known them.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.510
Obviously, probably
since before the filming

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.300
started with the auditioning,
and you've seen them grow up.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.120
Have you seen changes to
the characters based on them

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.304
getting older in real life?

00:29:19.304 --> 00:29:20.970
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah,
the middle-- the--

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.330
LORI MCCREARY: Kathrine.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.820
MORGAN FREEMAN: Kathrine.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.732
I think she's
grown tremendously.

00:29:25.732 --> 00:29:28.190
LORI MCCREARY: She hadn't done
a lot of acting before that,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.898
and so I think having--
being on the show

00:29:29.898 --> 00:29:32.410
and Tim and Tea are
amazing with them.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.285
And so she's really
kind of taken it on.

00:29:34.285 --> 00:29:35.160
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.600
ALAN SEALES: It was fun.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.660
Yeah, I always enjoy
watching kids, like,

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.690
for long-running shows,
just seeing them--

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.690
MORGAN FREEMAN: Develop.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:40.950
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:41.720
MORGAN FREEMAN: How they-- yeah.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:41.890
LORI MCCREARY: Oh, no.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.279
And Evan is, like, taller
than Tea almost now.

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:45.070
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.330
Right.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.204
MORGAN FREEMAN: And
their voice is deepening.

00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:48.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.693
ALAN SEALES: Question over here.

00:29:49.693 --> 00:29:50.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.845
Thank you both for coming.

00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:54.490
I'm so excited to
see you both here.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.632
And I must admit that I haven't
watched "Madam Secretary" yet,

00:29:57.632 --> 00:29:58.340
but I was a big--

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.131
MORGAN FREEMAN: What
are you talking about?

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:00.804
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.804 --> 00:30:03.220
AUDIENCE: I'm still working
my way up to the 21st century,

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.720
but it's the first
show on my list,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.070
so I'm excited to get started.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.650
But when you were talking about
kind of all of the writing

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.680
that goes into it
constantly, thinking

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.350
about contemporary political
events and this being

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.761
a political show, how much do
you let kind of the real world

00:30:17.761 --> 00:30:19.510
and, like, what people
who are watching it

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.450
are probably thinking about
and see in actual politics

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.200
influence the direction
that the show takes?

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.950
LORI MCCREARY: You
want me to take it or--

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.116
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yes, please.

00:30:28.116 --> 00:30:29.740
LORI MCCREARY: I
think that we do--

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.120
what we do is we get inspired.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.510
So last season, we
ended-- the season finale

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.780
was all about NATO.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.430
And when we were
conceiving of what

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.610
the show would be, there
was a lot of talk about,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.180
should NATO be disbanned?

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.561
And there were-- and we felt,
even in the writers' room,

00:30:43.561 --> 00:30:45.310
maybe we all didn't
really understand NATO

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.831
and why it started, and what the
ramifications of not having it

00:30:48.831 --> 00:30:49.330
were.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.845
So we built that
into a storyline

00:30:50.845 --> 00:30:53.200
in the last two
episodes of last season.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.810
And the season premiere
is all about fake news,

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.720
which I think we all deal
with hearing about every day.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.060
So we're inspired by the topics.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.730
And what we love to do is kind
of really unpack them and try

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.510
to look at both sides.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.970
Our president as an independent.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.770
He's not a Democrat
or a Republican,

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.762
so we try to stay away from
the politicizing of issues.

00:31:13.762 --> 00:31:14.858
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:14.858 --> 00:31:16.066
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, over here.

00:31:16.066 --> 00:31:16.812
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:19.270
Given your computer science
background and artistic theater

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.040
background, was computer
animation something

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.206
you were interested in, or
something your production

00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:24.460
company would pursue?

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.430
LORI MCCREARY: We do have a
couple animation projects.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.170
One of the things
that it helped me do

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.840
is really look
deeply at our effects

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.360
budgets and our animation
budgets to really see.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.210
Because I was surprised when
I came from computer science

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.070
that, you know, you
could spend $80 million

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.670
doing effects for a movie.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.670
And I was like, I could
start a lot of companies

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.110
for $80 million.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.870
And I'm just going
to get this film.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.120
So we are interested
in animation.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.870
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.040
Thank you.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.970
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, over here.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.440
AUDIENCE: Lori, in
passing you said

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.130
that the middle class
of film is shrinking.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.790
What does that mean?

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.850
LORI MCCREARY: What it
means is the middle class

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:01.720
in terms of the budget.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.594
So there are-- you know,
you can make a movie

00:32:03.594 --> 00:32:05.350
for less than a
million, or you can make

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.050
a movie for over $100 million.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.430
The $10 million and
under budget movies

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:13.605
are fairly easy to get greenlit
today, and $100 million

00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:14.980
and over, because
there's usually

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.050
two big stars and a big brand.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:20.430
The middle class, "The
Bucket Lists," the--

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.420
help me with another movie.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.729
MORGAN FREEMAN: Um, um--

00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:25.270
LORI MCCREARY:
"Million Dollar Baby."

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.200
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah,
"Million Dollar Baby."

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:26.770
LORI MCCREARY:
The kind of movies

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.215
that would cost normally
$30 to $60 million,

00:32:29.215 --> 00:32:30.940
they're hard to find
a home right now.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.550
All the studios used to
have independent divisions,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.130
and that's where the
independent movies would go.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.670
But the studios are really
looking for the big brand

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:44.290
boy, four-quadrant movies,
or the lower budget movies

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.240
that you can-- it's
hard to lose money on.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.090
So the middle class, you'll
see a lot of my friends

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.024
who are movie makers are
taking the subjects--

00:32:52.024 --> 00:32:54.190
"Million Dollar Baby"-type
subjects and putting them

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:58.180
on television now as, you
know, either limited series

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.142
or a series.

00:32:59.142 --> 00:32:59.850
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.610
LORI MCCREARY: Sure.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.290
ALAN SEALES: I want to
give a quick plug to you

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.360
guys' book, as you're
also promoting something

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.430
for National Geographic.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.610
You both produced, of
course, "The Story of God"

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.580
with Svengali Freeman.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.330
But now you have
something else premiering

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.490
called "The Story of
Us" with Morgan Freeman.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.730
What is that about, and
why did you do that?

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:25.430
MORGAN FREEMAN: Well,
the why is while we

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.690
were doing "The Story
of God," and you

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.200
know, we went around the
world, talking to people,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.370
meeting people, getting
all these wonderful stories

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:41.250
and inputs about humans.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.770
So I said, we should do that.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.880
We should talk about man.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.150
We should do a story on man.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:52.610
And then we had to put
that in the pot and let it

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.500
simmer, let it boil.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.650
And we came out with
not the story of man,

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.690
but "The Story of Us."

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.930
We're talking about
us now, not mankind

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.710
as an evolutionary thing.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.880
That was the genesis
of that, I think.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.840
Am I right about this?

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.048
LORI MCCREARY: You are right.

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:12.860
And we-- because
tribalism and nationalism

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.989
seems to be brewing
all around the planet,

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.260
we decided to look at the
big topics that are trend--

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.030
having us trend towards that.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.297
And we're looking at long--

00:34:22.297 --> 00:34:24.380
thousands of years of
history in what we're doing.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.639
So we look at love, we
look at war and peace,

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:27.679
we look at rebels.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.070
Turns out rebels are a great
way to help us get society back

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.679
on track.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.409
So it was a fun--
it was a fun series.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:34.159
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.533
I mean, you've spoken with
some amazing people like Megan

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:39.440
Phelps-Roper from Westboro
Baptist Church and Joshua

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.719
Coombes from-- the founder of
dosomethingfornothing movement,

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:43.530
and then even--

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.630
name drop-- Bill Clinton.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.931
[LAUGH]

00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:46.889
So how did you decide--

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:48.590
MORGAN FREEMAN: Paul
Kagame of Rwanda.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.340
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.714
How did you decide
who you wanted

00:34:50.714 --> 00:34:51.800
to focus the episodes on?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.400
MORGAN FREEMAN: I didn't have
anything to do with that.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.179
ALAN SEALES: No?

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.070
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.650
ALAN SEALES: Did you?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.483
LORI MCCREARY: Yeah.

00:34:56.483 --> 00:34:57.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:58.910
We have great
associate producers

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.990
who basically gave us about
120 different stories to choose

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.190
from for our six episodes.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.910
So we pulled about 40--
some of the best stories,

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.160
the stories that were really--

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.940
felt, like, emotionally resonant
and would fit within the season

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:14.980
1 of "The Story of Us."

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.980
ALAN SEALES: That's fun.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.105
Would you ever do anything
like the story of Google

00:35:18.105 --> 00:35:18.974
with Morgan Freeman?

00:35:18.974 --> 00:35:20.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.306 --> 00:35:21.320
The The story of who?

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.236
LORI MCCREARY: Google.

00:35:22.236 --> 00:35:23.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.914
ALAN SEALES: Have
you heard of it?

00:35:25.914 --> 00:35:27.080
MORGAN FREEMAN: I was just--

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.050
I was just looking at the
musical thing over there.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.091
LORI MCCREARY: It's nice.

00:35:30.091 --> 00:35:30.800
Yeah.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.000
MORGAN FREEMAN: And the "Starry
Night--" what do you call that?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.350
As you're walking in,
there's a Google--

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.200
there's--

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.570
ALAN SEALES: The doodle?

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.100
MORGAN FREEMAN: Painted-- yeah.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.480
Like van Gogh's "Starry Night."

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.250
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:42.430
Yeah.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.970
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:44.386
See, you didn't
think I knew that.

00:35:44.386 --> 00:35:46.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:47.690
Yeah.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.149
I use Google all the time.

00:35:49.149 --> 00:35:49.940
ALAN SEALES: Well--

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:50.859 --> 00:35:51.650
I got connections--

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.774
MORGAN FREEMAN: Google is--

00:35:52.774 --> 00:35:55.929
Google is now--
it's now in action.

00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:57.220
ALAN SEALES: It's a verb, yeah.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.010
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.510
ALAN SEALES: Which they
don't want us to say, but--

00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.990
MORGAN FREEMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.582
ALAN SEALES: Sorry, it is.

00:36:01.582 --> 00:36:03.400
Yeah, let's take a
question over here.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.025
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:04.025 --> 00:36:04.870
I actually have two.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.240
So my first is, what are
your guys' favorite TV shows

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.150
or movies out there right
now besides "Madam Secretary"

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.040
that you watch?

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.410
And then my second one was
there are so many political

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:19.072
shows out there right now,
both dramas and comedies.

00:36:19.072 --> 00:36:20.780
How do you guys deal
with the competition

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.104
in keeping the storyline fresh?

00:36:23.104 --> 00:36:24.770
MORGAN FREEMAN: There
is no competition.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.650
We are the only show that has
a female secretary of state.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.434
So-- duh.

00:36:33.434 --> 00:36:34.350
ALAN SEALES: Mic drop.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.282
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:37.322 --> 00:36:38.280
What was the first one?

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.840
LORI MCCREARY: Favorite show.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.600
ALAN SEALES: Your favorite show.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.225
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:40.225 --> 00:36:42.410
Favorite show or
movie right now.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:46.000
MORGAN FREEMAN:
Favorite show or movie?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.730
Gosh.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.720
I just watched--

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.320
I binge-watched-- and I can't
even remember the total title--

00:36:53.320 --> 00:37:00.500
but it's on Netflix, and
it's Jane Fonda and--

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.280
LORI MCCREARY: Lily Tomlin.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.780
MORGAN FREEMAN: What she said.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:11.397
Lily Tomlin, Martin
Sheen, and Sam Waterston.

00:37:11.397 --> 00:37:12.397
ALAN SEALES: What is it?

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:13.727
AUDIENCE: "Grace and Frankie."

00:37:13.727 --> 00:37:14.560
MORGAN FREEMAN: Huh?

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.470
LORI MCCREARY:
"Gracie and Frankie."

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.660
ALAN SEALES: "Grace
and Frankie."

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.159
"Frankie."

00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:18.510
MORGAN FREEMAN: "Frankie."

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.950
I had the "Gracie" part.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.802
"Frankie and Grace."

00:37:20.802 --> 00:37:22.760
ALAN SEALES: That sounded
like frogs in a pond.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.530
MORGAN FREEMAN: Just
an outstanding show.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:32.160
I'm just enthralled watching it.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:38.970
Wonderful performances, great
writing, way out concept.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.600
That's mine.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.853
And she's got one too.

00:37:40.853 --> 00:37:41.936
ALAN SEALES: What's yours?

00:37:41.936 --> 00:37:44.530
LORI MCCREARY: Well, I
have a lot of favorites.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.200
What I just recently
finished watching

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.120
was season 1 of
"Handmaid's Tale."

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.909
ALAN SEALES: Mm.

00:37:48.909 --> 00:37:50.450
LORI MCCREARY: Did
you guys see that?

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.230
Oh.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.880
Yeah.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.000
Intense, and I couldn't
stop watching it.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.750
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:55.470
Very good.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.140
MORGAN FREEMAN: All right?

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.755
LORI MCCREARY: Thanks.

00:37:56.755 --> 00:37:58.350
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
question over here.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.850
AUDIENCE: Do you
license your voices

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.500
for use in
text-to-speech engines?

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.000
Like--

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.240
--Google Assistant.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.865
LORI MCCREARY: He wants to know
if you would license your voice

00:38:07.865 --> 00:38:10.741
to use in a
text-to-speech engine.

00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:11.740
MORGAN FREEMAN: Depends.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.180
LORI MCCREARY: It depends.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.930
ALAN SEALES: He works
on Google Assistant.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:15.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.666
MORGAN FREEMAN: Oh, does he?

00:38:16.666 --> 00:38:17.625
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:19.874
MORGAN FREEMAN: Well, I got
to tell you, that depends.

00:38:19.874 --> 00:38:21.089
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:21.089 --> 00:38:22.630
AUDIENCE: If you
want to sound smart,

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.570
you want to be the voice of
Assistant, not the other guys.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.653
MORGAN FREEMAN: Oh really?

00:38:25.653 --> 00:38:27.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.602
OK.

00:38:28.602 --> 00:38:29.560
We can talk about that.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.050
ALAN SEALES: I
actually was planning

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.346
on giving you the Google
Play terms and conditions,

00:38:36.346 --> 00:38:38.220
and just having you read
that for 30 minutes,

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.719
but then I actually
wrote questions.

00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:41.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.410
Because we would have
all listened to that too.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.207
Yeah?

00:38:44.207 --> 00:38:46.290
AUDIENCE: So I was just
wondering, how, if at all,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.540
did the results of the
presidential election

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.210
last year change the
way you were envisioning

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.202
the development of
the plot for this show

00:38:53.202 --> 00:38:54.285
over the next few seasons?

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.750
MORGAN FREEMAN: You know,
you watch something like that

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:06.360
and ask yourselves,
can we use it?

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.012
The answer is a universal no.

00:39:10.012 --> 00:39:12.220
LORI MCCREARY: I mean, the
good news for us, I think,

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.290
was we started the
show three years

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.980
before the
presidential election.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.050
So we imagined we'd started the
show two election cycles ahead

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.520
of where we were then currently.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.360
So in our world, the current
administration never existed.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.410
So we choose to look at our show
as a more aspirational version

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.660
of maybe what we're seeing
in real life right now,

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.620
and we try to--

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.969
we try to create something
that on Sunday nights,

00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:36.760
you could watch, feel
good about the world,

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.185
and sleep a little better.

00:39:38.185 --> 00:39:40.165
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:40.165 --> 00:39:41.557
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:41.557 --> 00:39:42.640
MORGAN FREEMAN: Well done.

00:39:45.178 --> 00:39:46.886
ALAN SEALES: Do you
have anything to add?

00:39:46.886 --> 00:39:47.820
No?

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.630
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.940
ALAN SEALES: Sweet.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.440
All right.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.481
Two more quick questions.

00:39:50.481 --> 00:39:51.090
Yeah?

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.135
AUDIENCE: Hi Morgan.

00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:52.570
MORGAN FREEMAN: Hi.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.611
AUDIENCE: My name is Fez.

00:39:53.611 --> 00:39:56.590
And you clearly have
such a celebrated career

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.410
with so many different roles
that people recognize you for,

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.550
right?

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:04.840
I can't think of any other
voice or character that's

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.590
been associated with God as much
or as frequently as you have.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.169
How does that feel?

00:40:11.169 --> 00:40:11.960
Is that empowering?

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.140
Is that strange?

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.820
Do people come up to
you, asking about that?

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.875
Or am I the first--

00:40:17.875 --> 00:40:19.117
the guy asking this question.

00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:20.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.680
MORGAN FREEMAN: It's
gotten to be a PITA.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.130
LORI MCCREARY: A what?

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.446
MORGAN FREEMAN: PITA.

00:40:25.446 --> 00:40:26.612
LORI MCCREARY: Pain in the--

00:40:26.612 --> 00:40:27.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.425
MORGAN FREEMAN: You got it.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:37.940
It's terrible to be
so closely associated

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:44.960
with the idea of God.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:52.030
It tends to reduce the
importance of the idea of God,

00:40:52.030 --> 00:41:00.670
to walk around saying, this
guy reminds you, you know?

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.040
I'd rather not.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.960
Here again, we're
talking about something

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.482
that's good on one
side and really,

00:41:06.482 --> 00:41:07.690
really bad on the other side.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.720
You like getting recognition
for the work that you've done,

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:21.070
but some of it's a
little over the top.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:21.645
OK?

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:22.270
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.760
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.259
Yes.

00:41:25.259 --> 00:41:25.849
Last question.

00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:27.390
AUDIENCE: I'm a huge
fan of the show,

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.750
so thank you so much for coming.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:33.115
And since starting to watch
it, I have cut my cord

00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:34.660
and I don't have cable, right?

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.770
So it's the world of
Netflix, world of Hulu.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.790
CBS is on its own.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.900
So I just wondered,
as creators--

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.690
and you mentioned
film friends are

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.480
moving on to this TV world--

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.026
as creators, how are you--

00:41:49.026 --> 00:41:50.650
how do you feel about
this whole thing?

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:54.340
Like, how do you feel about CBS
being separate from the others?

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.500
And does it disappoint you, or
is it exciting, and how do you

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.359
feel?

00:41:58.359 --> 00:42:00.400
LORI MCCREARY: You want
to go, or you want me to?

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:00.760
MORGAN FREEMAN: No.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.551
I don't even know what
we're talking about.

00:42:02.551 --> 00:42:03.461
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:03.461 --> 00:42:05.710
LORI MCCREARY: She was asking,
because a lot of people

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.530
are cutting their cords,
they either don't have CBS

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.930
or you have to subscribe
to CBS All Access

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.190
to see "Madam Secretary."

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.314
It's not yet on Netflix.

00:42:14.314 --> 00:42:15.730
There was just
announced last week

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.580
that Netflix just did
a big deal with us,

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.110
so that's the good news.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.840
We went into syndication
early, so that's good.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.580
But personally,
as a filmmaker, I

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.080
love the fact that
there are so many

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.490
places that we can
create content for.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:33.700
So I think it allows more
people to get-- it used

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.050
to be you had seven places.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:37.927
If you were a filmmaker, you
had to go to those seven places.

00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:39.510
You had to know
someone there, and you

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.920
had to kind of get
funneled into these places.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.840
There are hundreds
of places now.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.050
And quite frankly, you
can make your own content

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.280
and put it on the internet.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.230
So we love it.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.630
We've been a big
proponent of people

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.240
being able to access
content any time, any place.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.480
I would love it if our
films and our TV content

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.040
are more accessible to everyone.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.790
It's going to take a while,
because it's all still flushing

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.710
out and people have
business models.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.506
Like, CBS has a
business model, and they

00:43:07.506 --> 00:43:09.130
know what they're
going to make and how

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.171
they're going to make it.

00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:12.875
And if you break it
up, it's going to--

00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:14.739
if you break up, like,
network television,

00:43:14.739 --> 00:43:16.030
it could break the whole thing.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.350
So they're doing it slowly.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.240
And CBS is one of the first to
have their own CBS All Access.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.290
So I applaud them
for dipping their toe

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.240
in before some of the others.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.875
And I'm just-- I'm just
excited to see what's next.

00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:30.708
MORGAN FREEMAN: You
know why she's so smart?

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:31.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.387
She had a-- has an
outstanding set of parents.

00:43:37.387 --> 00:43:38.220
LORI MCCREARY: I do.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:43.086
MORGAN FREEMAN:
Really created her.

00:43:43.086 --> 00:43:44.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.025
ALAN SEALES: Literally?

00:43:46.025 --> 00:43:46.310
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:46.670
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.120
LORI MCCREARY: Literally.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.510
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:48.468
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:43:48.468 --> 00:43:50.360
So last question from me.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.210
Looking back on your
careers, both of you,

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.331
is there a single
defining moment

00:43:55.331 --> 00:43:56.810
that you can look
at and say, this

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.560
is why I am today,
because of that moment?

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.590
MORGAN FREEMAN: Yeah.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.796
Yeah.

00:44:04.796 --> 00:44:06.670
When I was 12 years old,
I pulled a chair out

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:07.590
from under a girl.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.870
And she chased me.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.620
I thought she was
really going to kill me.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.344
[LAUGH]

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:24.480
And I was collared by an English
teacher who frogmarched me

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.680
down a hall and shoved me into
a room and said, here he is.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.430
And that was my
first opportunity

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:34.192
at getting on stage as an actor.

00:44:34.192 --> 00:44:37.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.880
ALAN SEALES: And you enjoyed it?

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.990
MORGAN FREEMAN: Immensely.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.910
I got my first best actor award.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.007
ALAN SEALES: Detention?

00:44:46.007 --> 00:44:47.090
MORGAN FREEMAN: Detention?

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.548
ALAN SEALES: For pulling the
chair out from under the girl?

00:44:49.548 --> 00:44:51.640
MORGAN FREEMAN: Well,
I tell that story now,

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.371
and she was at my 80th
birthday party, grinning.

00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:56.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.050
ALAN SEALES: That's funny.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.419
Lori, do you have a moment?

00:44:59.419 --> 00:45:01.710
LORI MCCREARY: I honestly--
not just because he's here.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.290
I think meeting Morgan was the
defining moment in my career.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:06.180
I came from--

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.980
--I was making my first movie.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.620
I didn't know if it's
what I was going to be

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.760
doing the rest of my life.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.470
And And thankfully,
when we connected,

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.924
I immediately got
something that is

00:45:21.924 --> 00:45:23.340
hard to get in our
business, which

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.880
is when I walked into a room,
he, even if he wasn't there,

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.960
walked in before me.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.400
So people automatically gave
me more credit for being smart,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.310
full of integrity, everything
you see this man is.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.362
And so I've been able--

00:45:36.362 --> 00:45:37.695
MORGAN FREEMAN: Not bad looking.

00:45:37.695 --> 00:45:37.980
LORI MCCREARY: Yeah.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.521
Good looking.

00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:41.258
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.258 --> 00:45:44.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:44.295 --> 00:45:46.564
So I would credit
connecting with Mr. Freeman.

00:45:46.564 --> 00:45:47.730
ALAN SEALES: That's amazing.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.520
Well, thank you both for being--

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.186
MORGAN FREEMAN: Did
you write that down?

00:45:50.186 --> 00:45:51.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:53.000
ALAN SEALES: It's now
out there on Googleverse.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.240
MORGAN FREEMAN: OK.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.870
ALAN SEALES: The
Googleverse, yes.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.390
Yeah, so you can follow
Lori McCreary on Twitter

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.080

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.330
Morgan, you aren't on Twitter.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.205
MORGAN FREEMAN: Nope.

00:46:01.205 --> 00:46:02.080
ALAN SEALES: Nope.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.590
You can follow the
