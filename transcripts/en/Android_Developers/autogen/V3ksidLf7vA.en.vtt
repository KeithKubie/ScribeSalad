Android team at Google I work on

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.730
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animation and today I

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
graphics and animation and today I
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.530
graphics and animation and today I
wanted to talk about some animation

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
wanted to talk about some animation
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.930
wanted to talk about some animation
capabilities of drawables specifically I

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
capabilities of drawables specifically I
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.430
capabilities of drawables specifically I
want to talk about keyframe animations

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
want to talk about keyframe animations
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.400
want to talk about keyframe animations
using the class transition drawable this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
using the class transition drawable this
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.529
using the class transition drawable this
is a way of specifying not only what

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
is a way of specifying not only what
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.810
is a way of specifying not only what
image is going to be displayed at any

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
image is going to be displayed at any
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.220
image is going to be displayed at any
given time but how long you're going to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
given time but how long you're going to
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.420
given time but how long you're going to
display it before displaying

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
display it before displaying
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.279
display it before displaying
the next in a sequence of drawables

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
the next in a sequence of drawables
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.750
the next in a sequence of drawables
you've actually loaded into this thing

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760
you've actually loaded into this thing
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060
you've actually loaded into this thing
so let's take a look at the demo

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
so let's take a look at the demo
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.490
so let's take a look at the demo
fascinating demo where we see a gray

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
fascinating demo where we see a gray
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380
fascinating demo where we see a gray
rectangle with some text on top when I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
rectangle with some text on top when I
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.760
rectangle with some text on top when I
click on this it's going to start

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
click on this it's going to start
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.959
click on this it's going to start
running this animation with the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
running this animation with the
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.150
running this animation with the
drawables that I've pre-loaded so click

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
drawables that I've pre-loaded so click
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610
drawables that I've pre-loaded so click
on it we say frame 0 1 2 3 all that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
on it we say frame 0 1 2 3 all that
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.150
on it we say frame 0 1 2 3 all that
click on it it stops a very exciting

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
click on it it stops a very exciting
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.529
click on it it stops a very exciting
application it's a little more

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
application it's a little more
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.940
application it's a little more
interesting in code so why don't we take

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
interesting in code so why don't we take
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040
interesting in code so why don't we take
a look at that now so we see this class

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
a look at that now so we see this class
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900
a look at that now so we see this class
called keyframe animation that I created

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
called keyframe animation that I created
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.560
called keyframe animation that I created
and there's an image view in here which

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
and there's an image view in here which
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.529
and there's an image view in here which
is centered in there where we load in

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
is centered in there where we load in
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090
is centered in there where we load in
these drawables so we create an

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
these drawables so we create an
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
these drawables so we create an
animation drawable object where we're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
animation drawable object where we're
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.780
animation drawable object where we're
going to load these things and for each

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
going to load these things and for each
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609
going to load these things and for each
of these we're going to add a frame so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
of these we're going to add a frame so
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.050
of these we're going to add a frame so
basically to create this keyframe

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
basically to create this keyframe
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640
basically to create this keyframe
animation you're going to keep adding

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
animation you're going to keep adding
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350
animation you're going to keep adding
frames to it and this represents the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
frames to it and this represents the
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.730
frames to it and this represents the
series of images that it's going to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
series of images that it's going to
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.480
series of images that it's going to
animate between so we add frame calling

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
animate between so we add frame calling
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.070
animate between so we add frame calling
get drawable for frame number and we

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
get drawable for frame number and we
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990
get drawable for frame number and we
pass in I so basically I'm just creating

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
pass in I so basically I'm just creating
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.020
pass in I so basically I'm just creating
these simple drawable images that have

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
these simple drawable images that have
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030
these simple drawable images that have
the number embedded in them there's some

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
the number embedded in them there's some
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.350
the number embedded in them there's some
code down here to show you how I did

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
code down here to show you how I did
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.710
code down here to show you how I did
that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
that
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380
that
so we just create a bitmap of a certain

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
so we just create a bitmap of a certain
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.330
so we just create a bitmap of a certain
hard-coded size we have canvas we draw

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
hard-coded size we have canvas we draw
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340
hard-coded size we have canvas we draw
this gray color into it and then we draw

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
this gray color into it and then we draw
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.109
this gray color into it and then we draw
the text into it at an appropriate place

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
the text into it at an appropriate place
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.780
the text into it at an appropriate place
and then return a bitmap drawable based

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
and then return a bitmap drawable based
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.420
and then return a bitmap drawable based
on that bitmap so for each one of those

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
on that bitmap so for each one of those
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.149
on that bitmap so for each one of those
we add a frame to the animation drawable

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
we add a frame to the animation drawable
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.179
we add a frame to the animation drawable
set one shot to fall so we're just going

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
set one shot to fall so we're just going
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649
set one shot to fall so we're just going
to repeat this infinitely until the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
to repeat this infinitely until the
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.630
to repeat this infinitely until the
thing gets clicked on again we're going

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
thing gets clicked on again we're going
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190
thing gets clicked on again we're going
to set this as the image drawable on

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
to set this as the image drawable on
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.660
to set this as the image drawable on
that image view and then we're gonna

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
that image view and then we're gonna
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100
that image view and then we're gonna
have a click listener and listen for the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
have a click listener and listen for the
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630
have a click listener and listen for the
user to actually click the image and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
user to actually click the image and
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249
user to actually click the image and
then we'll start the animation running

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
then we'll start the animation running
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830
then we'll start the animation running
or stop it so if the animation when they

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
or stop it so if the animation when they
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120
or stop it so if the animation when they
click if the animation is already

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
click if the animation is already
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.200
click if the animation is already
running we're going to call stop

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
running we're going to call stop
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819
running we're going to call stop
otherwise we're going to call start

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
otherwise we're going to call start
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160
otherwise we're going to call start
fairly straightforward I'm not doing

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
fairly straightforward I'm not doing
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570
fairly straightforward I'm not doing
anything interesting here if you had

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
anything interesting here if you had
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820
anything interesting here if you had
something like an image resource with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
something like an image resource with
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.280
something like an image resource with
actual timings embedded in the metadata

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
actual timings embedded in the metadata
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.970
actual timings embedded in the metadata
you could create a animation drawable to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
you could create a animation drawable to
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.740
you could create a animation drawable to
mimic that exactly here I'm just using

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
mimic that exactly here I'm just using
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.110
mimic that exactly here I'm just using
the same hard-coded 300 milliseconds to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
the same hard-coded 300 milliseconds to
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.449
the same hard-coded 300 milliseconds to
animate and move on to the next image in

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459
animate and move on to the next image in
 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.479
animate and move on to the next image in
sequence and that's it for animation

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
sequence and that's it for animation
 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.870
sequence and that's it for animation
drawable thanks for tuning in
