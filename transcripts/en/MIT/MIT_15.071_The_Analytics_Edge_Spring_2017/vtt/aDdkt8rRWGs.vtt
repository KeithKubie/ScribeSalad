00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.109
Often, in linear
optimization problems,

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.260
we've estimated the data
we're using in the problem,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.640
but it's subject to change.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.290
Understanding how the solution
changes when the data changes

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.290
is called sensitivity analysis.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.540
One way that the
data could change

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.740
is through marketing decisions.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.300
Suppose that American
Airlines' management

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.360
is trying to figure
out whether or not

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.850
it would be beneficial to
invest in marketing its fares.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.290
They forecast that
the marketing effort

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.560
is likely to attract one more
unit of demand, of each type,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.940
for every $200 spent.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.370
So for the discount fare,
the marketing cost per unit

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
is $200, and for
the regular fare,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.690
the marketing cost
per unit is also $200.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.250
We want to know how
much this will increase

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.590
our marginal revenue
for each type of fare.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.950
This graph shows our current
feasible space and optimal

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.240
solution.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.260
What would happen if we
increased the marketing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.210
for discount fares?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.060
The demand for discount
fares would increase.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.120
But since we're not even meeting
the current demand for discount

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.670
fares with the
optimal solution, this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.850
doesn't give us
any extra revenue.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.070
So we shouldn't add any
marketing for discount fares.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.240
Actually, American Airlines
could decrease their budget

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.810
to market discount fares, and
even if the demand decreases,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.020
it wouldn't change our revenue.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.880
The demand could go
all the way down to 66

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.780
without affecting our decisions.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.280
In sensitivity
analysis like this,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.710
we're often concerned with the
shadow price of a constraint.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.950
For a discount
demand constraint,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.620
this is the marginal
revenue gained

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.630
by increasing the
demand by one unit.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.940
In this case, the shadow
price is 0 for demand

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.670
greater than or equal to 66.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.229
Now, let's look at what happens
when we market regular fares.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.120
If we increase the
demand for regular fares,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.020
our revenue increases.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.050
If we increase by
25 units of demand,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.380
our revenue
increases to $86,883.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.930
If we increase by another
25 units of demand,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.440
our revenue
increases to $96,358.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.650
So what's the shadow
price in this case?

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.700
Remember that the
shadow price is

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.550
the marginal revenue for
a unit increase in demand,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.440
in this case, of regular seats.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.790
From 100 to 125, the
revenue increased

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:03.480
by $86,883 minus $77,408,
which is equal to $9,475.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.250
Since this was an increase
of 25 units of demand,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.040
the shadow price
is 9,475 divided

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.540
by 25, which equals 379.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.990
We can calculate that
this is the same shadow

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.220
price from 125 to 150.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.990
So the marginal revenue
for every extra unit

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:33.670
of regular demand from
100 to 166 is $379.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.120
So given this
analysis, how can we

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.420
help the marketing department
make their decisions?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.020
The forecast was an extra unit
of demand for every $200 spent.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.040
For discount fares, this isn't
worth it, since the shadow

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.510
price, or marginal
revenue, is 0.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.340
But for the regular
fares, this is worth it,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.180
since the shadow price is $379.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.020
So the marketing
department should

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.590
invest in marketing
regular fares

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.010
to increase the
demand by 66 units.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.410
Another sensitivity analysis
question in our problem

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.760
is whether or not it would be
beneficial to allocate a bigger

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.050
aircraft for this flight.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.290
This would change the
capacity constraint,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.390
which currently limits
the capacity to 166.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.860
With our current
aircraft, the management

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.950
knows that the cost
per hour is $12,067.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:37.680
So the total cost of the
six-hour flight is $72,402.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.450
With the 166 seats
filled, we get a revenue

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.530
of $77,408 from our
optimal solution.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.490
If we increase the capacity
of the aircraft to 176 seats,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.030
the total cost would
increase to $76,590.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.310
But how much would this
increase our revenue?

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.080
And if we increase the capacity
of the aircraft to $218,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.230
the total cost would
increase to $87,342.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.680
But how much would this
increase our revenue?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.080
For our analysis, let's assume
that the demand does not

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.590
change.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.520
If we increase our
capacity to 176,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.170
the capacity constraint
will move right.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.900
And our optimal solution
will move right too.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.520
We now get a revenue of $79,788.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.480
If we then increase the
capacity to 218 seats,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.140
the capacity constraint
will move right again,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.890
and our revenue will
increase to $89,784.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.900
So let's look at
our extra profit

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.630
from increasing the capacity
to see if it's worth it.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.940
With our current costs and
revenue, the profit is $5,006.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.700
If we increase the
capacity to 176 seats,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.350
our profit actually
decreases to $3,198.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.390
And if we increase the
capacity to 218 seats,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.580
our profit decreases
even more to $2,442.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.470
So even though our
revenue is increasing,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.210
the cost increases too.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.820
So it's not profitable
for us to increase

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.610
the capacity of our aircraft.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.170
You can also see this by
using LibreOffice, which we'll

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.390
ask you to do in the
next quick question.
