Wet Dog smell: bad? or THE WORST SMELL YOU’VE
EVER SMELLED, EVER?

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.280
OH GOD, ITS IN MY CAR UPHOLSTERY WHY WONT
IT STOP?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.849
Hello Everyone, welcome to DNews.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.930
I don’t have a dog, Im actually a “cat
person”, but even I am familiar with the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.930
stench of a wet canine.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.619
What is it about water that makes man’s
best friend so … odiferous?

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.279
The answer lies a little bit with the yeast
and bacteria living in your dog’s ratty

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.579
mange, I mean silky coat, and a little bit
with the way we perceive smells in general.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.649
It can’t be helped, even the most pampered
pooch is a breeding ground for yeast and bacteria.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.670
Your dog’s skin and fur is a hospitable
home for microorganisms because it offers

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.489
the warmth and humidity they need to really
thrive.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.559
Growing happily on their doggy host these
microbes absorb nutrients from their environment

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.980
and excrete waste in the form of smelly gases
and other molecules.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.300
Now some colonies of microorganisms smell
delightful (bread! beer!) others (B.O.! moldy

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.030
leftovers! cheese!) really reek.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.430
So what is it about a WET dog that’s so
special?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.850
Well my favorite hypothesis is that the aromatic
compounds released by those microbes become

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.329
dissolved in the water.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.100
As your dog dries and the water evaporates,
those compounds become airborne.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.130
This raises the concentration of those smells
in the air around your dog and you start to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.180
smell something … rank.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.560
The human nose perceives smells when individual
molecules bind and activate receptors in our

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.909
nose called olfactory receptors.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.229
Activation of these receptors leads to pattern
recognition in our brains and we perceive

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.869
that as a specific smell.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.871
A molecule that can’t activate our receptors
is perceived as having no smell, also, the

00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:41.760
higher a local concentration of scent molecules,
the more receptors are activated and the stronger

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.430
we perceive a smell.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.980
So what can you do about the “local concentration”
of smelly bacterial excrement that is making

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.009
your dog unpleasant to be around?

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.859
Well, getting him or her wet again to give
them a bath may be counterintuitive in the

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.570
short term, but killing off some of those
microbes and then giving your furry friend

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.450
a good blow dry is really the only way.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.640
So tell us, dog lovers - have you gotten used
to wet dog smell or do you have tricks to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640
get rid of it?
