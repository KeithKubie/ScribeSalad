00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:03.085
- We're to let a and
b be rational numbers,

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:05.828
and let b be non-zero, they
have to say let b be non-zero

00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:08.002
because we're about to divide by b.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.853
Is a over b rational or irrational?

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:13.531
Well let's think about it,
they're both rational numbers

00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.314
so that means that a, since
it's rational, can be expressed

00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:19.971
as the ratio of two integers,
so I can write a is equal to m

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:24.116
over n, and same thing about
b, I could write b as being

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:28.999
equal to p over q, where

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.035
where m, n, p,

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:36.419
and q are integers,

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.832
are integers, by definition of what a

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:41.478
rational number is, they're
telling us these numbers

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:44.363
are rational so I can express
them as these types of ratios.

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:46.528
So what is a over b going to be?

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:48.800
a over b is going to be

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.800
m over n over p over q

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:57.822
which is equal to m over n,
if I divide by a fraction,

00:00:57.822 --> 00:01:00.382
it's the same thing as
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:04.017
q over p, let me write that a little bit,

00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:07.317
q over p which is equal to

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.811
mq over np.

00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:13.128
Well mq is going to be an
integer, if the product of

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:15.809
two integers is going to be
an integer, and np is going

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.597
to be another integer, the
product of two integers

00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:20.558
is an integer, so I've just shown that

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:22.935
a over b can be

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:25.516
expressed as the ratio of
two integers, so a over b

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:28.827
is for sure, in fact I've just
proven it to you, a over b

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:32.231
is for sure going to be rational.

00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:35.129
Let's do a few more of
these, this is interesting.

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:38.785
All right, so now we're saying let a and b

00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:41.224
be irrational numbers.

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:45.449
Is a over b, let a and
b be irrational numbers.

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:48.761
Is a over b rational or irrational?

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.914
And, like always, pause
the video and try to think

00:01:50.914 --> 00:01:53.658
this through, and you
might want do some examples

00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:56.095
of some irrational numbers
and see if you can get,

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.498
when you divide them, you can get rational

00:01:57.498 --> 00:01:59.631
or irrational numbers.

00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.845
Well, let's just imagine
a world where, let's say,

00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:04.848
that a is equal to, I dunno,

00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:07.103
two square roots of two,

00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:10.760
and b is equal to the square root of two.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.294
Well, in that world, a
over b, a over b would be

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:18.103
two square roots of two
over the square root of two

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:20.975
which would be two, which is
very much a rational number,

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.027
I can express that as a ratio
of integers, I can write that

00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:25.851
as two over one, there's actually
an infinite number of ways

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.089
I can express that as a
ratio of two integers.

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:32.112
So, in this case, I was able
to get a over b to be rational,

00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:34.408
based on a and b being irrational.

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:37.764
But, what if, what if instead of,

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:39.938
what if a was equal to

00:02:39.938 --> 00:02:41.520
the square root of two

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.482
and b is equal to the square root

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:50.482
of, let's say, b is equal
to the square root of seven.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.190
Well, then a over b would
be equal to the square root

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.704
of two over the square root
of seven, which is still

00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:00.204
going to be irrational, I
mean another way to think

00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:02.377
about it, and I'm not proving
it here, but you could

00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:03.962
think about it, this is
going to be the square root

00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:07.427
of two sevens, so we
have something that's not

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:10.243
a perfect square under the
radical, so we're going

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:13.574
to end up with an irrational number.

00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:16.338
So, we can show one example where a over b

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:18.796
is rational and we showed one example

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:23.084
where it is irrational,
so it can be either way.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:26.544
Let's do a few more of these.

00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:30.323
All right, let a be a
non-zero rational number.

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:33.757
Is a times the square root of
eight rational or irrational?

00:03:33.757 --> 00:03:38.043
Well, the key here is, if you
multiply an irrational number

00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:40.461
and why is this an irrational number?

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:42.818
It has a perfect square
in it, but it's not

00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:44.707
a perfect square in and of itself.

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:47.165
The square root of eight is,
the square root of eight is

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:50.376
equal to the square
root of four times two,

00:03:50.376 --> 00:03:52.467
which is equal to the
square root of four times

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.500
the square root of two, which is equal

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.755
to two square roots of two.

00:03:56.755 --> 00:03:58.950
And, this is kind of
getting to the punchline

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.566
of this problem, but if I
multiply a rational times

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:05.918
an irrational, I am going
to get an irrational.

00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:07.909
So the square root of
eight is an irrational,

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.973
and if I multiply that
times a rational number,

00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:16.107
I'm still going to get
an irrational number.

00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:19.989
So this is going to be,
for sure, irrational.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.642
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.437
So we're to let a be an irrational number.

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:29.296
Is negative 24 plus a
rational or irrational?

00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:32.771
And I won't give a formal
proof here, but to give you

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.047
more of an intuitive feel,
it's nice to just try out

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:37.017
some numbers, and I encourage
you to pause the video

00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:39.513
and try to think through it yourself.

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:44.372
Let's just imagine some values,
imagine if a is irrational,

00:04:44.372 --> 00:04:48.977
a is irrational, so what
if a was equal to negative

00:04:48.977 --> 00:04:52.128
pi, which is approximately
equal to negative three point

00:04:52.128 --> 00:04:54.911
one four one five nine and it keeps going

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.123
on and on forever, never repeating.

00:04:59.123 --> 00:05:02.468
Well, then we would have

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.528
negative 24 plus a

00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:09.780
would be equal to negative 24 minus pi,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.539
which would be approximately negative 27

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.979
point one for one five
nine, the decimal expansion,

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.535
everything to the right of
the decimal, is going to be

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.931
the exact same thing as pi.

00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.186
So this looks like, at least
for this example, is going

00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:25.620
to be irrational, and let's
see, if a was square root of two

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.595
negative 24 plus the square root of two,

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.855
well, once again, I'm
not doing a proof here,

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:36.766
but intuitively, this is
going to be a decimal,

00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:38.459
it's going to have a decimal expansion

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:40.836
that's going to go on
forever and never repeat,

00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:43.294
and so this would just
change what's to the left

00:05:43.294 --> 00:05:46.382
of the decimal, but not
really change what's,

00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:48.507
well it would change what's
to the right of the decimal

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:50.681
because this is negative,
but it's still going to go on

00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:54.906
forever and never repeat,
and if, in fact, this was

00:05:54.906 --> 00:05:58.132
if this was this way, then
to the right of the decimal,

00:05:58.132 --> 00:06:00.326
you would have the same thing
as the square root of two

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.012
to the left of the decimal,
you would just have

00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:05.974
a different value, you
would have negative 25 point

00:06:05.974 --> 00:06:09.306
whatever whatever whatever,
and so this is, when you add

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.431
a rational number to an
irrational number, we've proven

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.661
in other videos, a
rational plus an irrational

00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:20.217
is going to be irrational, irrational.

00:06:20.217 --> 00:06:22.269
If you want that proof,
we have other videos

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.774
within this tutorial.
