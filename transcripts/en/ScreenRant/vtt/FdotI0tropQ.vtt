00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.280
The life of an actor seems so glamorous from
the outside.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.360
Fame, money, and fans are all part of the
gig.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.930
When we become so used to seeing these people
on the big screen, it’s easy to forget that

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.140
they’re real people too.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.630
And when real people need to blow off some
steam, everyone has a favorite method.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.840
But these stars have found solace in some
particularly interesting places.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.450
Here are 10 Famous Actors With Weird Hobbies/Obsessions.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.480
Johnny Depp, Dolls
Johnny Depp has played a ton of different

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.080
characters over the course of his career.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.380
And has the ability to completely transform
himself with every one.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.730
What’s his secret?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.730
Character development.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.460
And as a part of his process, Depp occasionally
uses props to assist with the method: Barbies.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.960
The actor has an insane doll collection, including
many rare Barbies.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.570
But he’s not going to keep them in the box,
oh no.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.680
Depp has been quoted as saying that he uses
playtime to workshop new voices for his upcoming

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.840
characters.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.900
We’ve heard of method acting before, but
he does it differently.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.609
And given that it’s Johnny Depp we’re
talking about, that’s exactly what we would

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.609
expect.

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:07.880
Nicolas Cage, Spending money
If you won the lottery, what would you spend

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.880
the money on?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.410
This idea is something that most of us can
only dream about.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.310
But for Nicolas Cage, those dollar signs are
very real.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.040
No, he didn’t technically win the lottery,
but his spending habits indicate otherwise.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.900
It seems the actor just loves shelling out
the Benjamins.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.939
Where the average person fantasizes about
going on a vacation or paying off their debts,

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.159
Cage would rather spend that dough on albino
king cobras, shrunken heads, and haunted mansions.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.259
That’s an unorthodox collection, but when
you consider who it belongs to, it kinda makes

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.320
sense.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.090
Gwyneth Paltrow, Spanish/Goop
With every new season, Gwyneth Paltrow has

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.830
a new obsession and one hell of a soapbox
to shout them from: her blog!

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.860
Paltrow’s high-horse is named Goop, and
thanks to the actress’ obsession with Spanish,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.189
now she can be condescending in two languages!

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.719
Paltrow’s impossible recommendations have
come under fire for being expensive, unnecessarily

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.040
complicated, and downright unsustainable.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.159
But if you don’t care about any of that,
then fear not, Spanish speakers!

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.159
Because if you’d like to read about $90
face wash or the latest in bronze Japanese

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.850
tea-scoop technology, Paltrow has your back.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.080
And is now offering a version of Goop written
in Spanish.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.060
How worldly.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.150
Will Smith, Fencing
At this point, we’re pretty much convinced

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.580
that Will Smith can do anything.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.949
An actor, rapper, and producer, Smith has
been an entertainment heavyweight for decades.

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.389
As you can probably imagine, that kind of
lifestyle would take it’s toll on the best

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.389
of us.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.610
And as Smith has gotten older, he’s joked
about finding low-impact hobbies to keep himself

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.130
in tip-top shape, mentally and physically.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.750
So when old pal Tom Cruise introduced him
to fencing, he was all over it.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.859
Apparently the duo would get-together and
practice their skills with David Beckham too.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.419
When you step back and think about it, a movie
starring them as the Three Musketeers might

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.949
actually be kind of awesome.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.320
Daniel Radcliffe, Gymnastics
As a child, Daniel Radcliffe got a crash course

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320
in fame.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.470
His work on the Harry Potter movies made him
a household name overnight, and is a title

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.220
he carries with him to this day.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.090
Being a part of the wizarding world came with
a lot of challenges for the young actor, including

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.090
coordination.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.220
Radcliffe lives with a condition called Dyspraxia
which affects his motor skills.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.950
Since there were some physically demanding
scenes, the actor received gymnastics training.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.310
And after much practice, he found that he
was better able to coordinate his movements

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.730
and get through the stunts.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.730
Good thing, too.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.350
Since we can’t imagine anyone more suited
to the role than Radcliffe himself.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.410
Angelina Jolie, Daggers
Angelina Jolie is famous for living a life

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.600
off the beaten path.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.919
Wether it’s wearing a vial of her partner’s
blood, or kissing her brother a little too

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.720
hard in public, the actress has a bit of a
dark side.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.830
Jolie has said that she’s been building
a collection of knives and daggers ever since

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.040
she was a kid.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.440
And when her son Maddox began to show an interest
in Mom’s assortment, she encouraged him

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.980
to start a collection of his own.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.970
Throughout it all though, the main undercurrent
in her teachings seems to be about having

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.310
respect for the instrument.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.350
Which, when you think about it, isn’t that
different from any other collection.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.610
Tom Hanks, Typewriters
In the ever-evolving world of technology,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.760
it seems like there’s a new device promising
to change your life everyday.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.720
And as a result, there’s a niche of people
raging against the machine.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.750
But for Tom Hanks, his love for the good old-fashioned
typewriter began burning in the late seventies.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.290
The actor has over fifty of them, and even
wrote an essay for the New York Times about

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.540
all the reasons why.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.820
Hanks even developed a typewriting app, complete
with different model-specific sound effects.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.700
No matter how good the technology gets, sometimes
going old-school just more satisfying.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.870
Mila Kunis, Star Trek/World of Warcraft
When you think of a stereotypical World of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.200
Warcraft or Star Trek fan, you might picture
a hunchbacked, Mountain Dew-guzzling, Dorito-fingered

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200
outcast.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.970
And sure, there might be some of that.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.970
But guess what?

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.600
Nerds can be hot too!

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.870
Take Mila Kunis, for example.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.400
The actress has been in the public eye since
That 70’s Show.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.800
But in her private time, she’s a huge fan
of Sci-Fi and identifies herself as a Trekkie.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.440
Apparently Kunis was also so into World of
Warcraft that she had to quit playing for

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.010
hours a day in order to maintain her career.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.430
Now that’s dedication.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.690
Liam Neeson, Fly fishing
Let’s play a game.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.180
What kind of activities do you think Liam
Neeson enjoys in his spare time?

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.180
Karate?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.180
Shooting guns?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.280
Tracking down lost teens?

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.660
If you guessed fly fishing, congratulations!

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.660
Your prize is in the mail.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.701
For a man who makes his living kicking ass
and taking names, a calm, easy-going activity

00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:10.600
like fishing might seem like a weird choice.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.880
But it actually makes a lot of sense.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.160
Nobody can kick ass 100% of the time, even
if they’re really good at it.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.910
And a quiet retreat to the water can be a
nice change when you spend your days snapping

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.730
bad guys’ necks.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.280
Leslie Mann, Unicycling
Leslie Mann is one of the most hilarious ladies

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.450
working in Hollywood today.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.650
She’s been in some of the funniest movies
of the last 15 years.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.380
From Knocked Up to The 40-Year Old Virgin,
Mann has perfected her own little breed of

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.380
comedy.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.920
It turns out that she’s also pretty coordinated
too!

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.630
The actress is a big fan of the unicycle,
and is one of the few people who can actually

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.630
ride one.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.500
Riding a bike with two wheels can be challenging
enough, and when you’re left with just a

00:05:43.500 --> 00:06:03.080
single wheel, it only gets harder.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.770
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.530
Did we miss any other famous actors with weird
hobbies or obsessions?
