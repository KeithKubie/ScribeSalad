00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.780
And the answer should be 8. There are 3 odd rows and each odd row has 2

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.587
circles, so we get 6 circles from odd rows. And there are 2 even rows and each

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:14.545
of those has 1 circle, so we add 2. In general, that would be the number of odd

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:18.915
rows times the number of circles per odd row. Plus the number of even rows

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:23.843
times the circles per even row. You'll want to use this equation in your

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:25.159
program.
