00:00:00.028 --> 00:00:01.119
- [Narrator] Now I'm going to talk about

00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.328
one of the greatest
philosophers and teachers

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:07.963
in human history, and that is Confucius,

00:00:07.963 --> 00:00:12.130
known to the Chinese as Kongzi,
which means Master Kong,

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:16.423
or Kong Fuzi, which
means Grand Master Kong.

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:19.173
And once again, my apologies
for my pronunciation.

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:23.499
The word Confucius is a
Latinization of Kong Fuzi.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.421
So you can imagine Kong
Fuzicius, Confucius.

00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:30.728
Now what's interesting about Confucius is

00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:35.128
he grew up in a time
when China was getting

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:37.110
more and more divided.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.169
In other videos we talked
about the Zhou dynasty,

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:45.299
which begins at the very end
of the second millennium.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.837
But in the time of Confucius we're in

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:51.571
what's known as the end of
the Spring and Autumn period.

00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:54.571
Confucius lived from 551 to 479 BCE.

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:59.705
And we're ending the
Spring and Autumn period

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.863
and we're getting into the
period of the Warring States.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:05.099
So even in the time of Confucius

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.658
there was more and more
tension between states.

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:11.968
People felt less confident
in the central government,

00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:15.048
and as we'll see, in this
late Spring and Autumn period,

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:17.881
and especially as we get into
this really violent period

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.132
known as the Warring States period,

00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:23.475
a lot of philosophers started to arise

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:24.985
and philosophies began to arise

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.390
because people were struggling
with these questions

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.049
of, what is the role of the state?

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.956
What does it mean to be a good person?

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:36.915
How does humanity fit in
with the cosmic order?

00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:39.157
Now, what's interesting about Confucius is

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:43.652
by his own account he says
that he doesn't come up

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:44.705
with anything new.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:48.777
It's more of him trying to
resuscitate or rejuvenate

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:51.321
some of the traditions of the past.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:53.434
Most historians would
give him more credit.

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:57.029
Even though Confucius does
look to the early Zhou dynasty

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.063
for a lot of his
inspiration, and he looked

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:01.905
to a lot of the traditions
of the ancestors,

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:03.761
he definitely puts a spin on it

00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.080
which makes it a very powerful philosophy

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.833
and arguably religion as we get into

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:11.142
this Warring States period,
and especially as we get into

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:15.309
a more unified China under
the Qin and Han dynasties.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.445
And as we'll see under the
Han dynasty in particular,

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:23.885
Confucianism becomes
essentially the state religion.

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:27.923
Now to get a sense of
what Confucius preached,

00:02:27.923 --> 00:02:30.719
and his life, he spent most of his life

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.593
both teaching and preaching.

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:34.830
A lot of people compare him to Socrates

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.240
even though he predates Socrates.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.442
And simultaneously he was
also building a career

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:44.765
as a civil servant, but
his legacy is definitely

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.728
around his preachings,
and most of his life

00:02:48.728 --> 00:02:52.478
was here in the state
of Lu in eastern China.

00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:57.421
So there's three general themes
that you could talk about

00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:58.554
Confucius's teachings.

00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:00.955
I encourage you to go
look at his Analects,

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:04.521
they're quite interesting, to
get many many more of them.

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:07.381
But a lot of it is around
respecting traditions

00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:08.607
and respecting elders.

00:03:08.607 --> 00:03:10.266
Here's a quote from the Analects.

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.969
"A young man should
serve his parents at home

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.717
"and be respectful to
elders outside his home.

00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:17.812
"He should be earnest
and truthful, loving all,

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:21.242
"but becoming intimate with
his innate good-heartedness.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.356
"After doing this, if
he has energy to spare,

00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:26.114
"he can study literature and the arts."

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:28.772
And there's a lot of talk
of, if someone is to be

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:32.342
a good citizen they need
to be a good child first.

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:35.232
They need to be a good son.

00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:36.405
Now he also talks about,

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:39.238
what does it mean to be a just ruler?

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:41.397
"If you control people by punishment,

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:45.039
"they will avoid crime, but
have no personal sense of shame.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.891
"If you govern them by means
of virtue and control them

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.477
"with propriety, they will
gain their own sense of shame,

00:03:51.477 --> 00:03:52.910
"and thus correct themselves."

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.921
And as we'll see, morality and ethics

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:57.532
plays a huge role at a personal level

00:03:57.532 --> 00:04:00.013
and also at a state level to Confucius,

00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:01.921
and we'll talk about other philosophies

00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:05.433
where that might not be
as strong of a sense.

00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:08.788
Now another very big theme to Confucius

00:04:08.788 --> 00:04:10.448
was looking to yourself.

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:13.185
Through self-improvement
you can be a better citizen,

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:16.191
a better child, a better ruler.

00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:19.510
"Real knowledge is to know
the extent of one's ignorance.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.094
"Learning without thought is labor lost;

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:24.879
"thought without learning is perilous.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.769
"When you see someone of worth,

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:28.845
"think of how you may emulate.

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:33.547
"When you see someone unworthy,
examine your own character."

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:35.504
I like that one in particular.

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:39.656
"Do not impose on others what
you yourself do not desire."

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:43.614
So a very close statement
to the Golden Rule.

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:46.946
Now as I mentioned,
Confucius and Confucianism

00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:51.679
was not alone in this period
of the Spring and Autumn period

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:55.414
and especially as you get into
the Warring States period.

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.846
During that time we have what's known as

00:04:57.846 --> 00:05:01.058
the Hundred Schools of Thought, which,

00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:04.167
this time period starts
around the time of Confucius

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:08.214
and goes until Qin dynasty
ends the Warring States period,

00:05:08.214 --> 00:05:11.464
and in a very strong way unifies China.

00:05:12.503 --> 00:05:14.764
Now we already talked about Confucianism,

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:18.540
which talks a lot about
ethics, but its goal,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.090
remember Confucius himself
was a civil servant.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.964
He was an administrator.

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:23.113
He thought a lot about,

00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:25.500
what does it mean to be a just ruler?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.639
So it definitely touches on
the practical to a good bit.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.513
Now, many people say
it's an ethical system,

00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:34.438
but many would also consider it a religion

00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:36.973
because it does touch on the
metaphysical, the notions

00:05:36.973 --> 00:05:41.014
of heaven, and it borrows
a lot from China's past.

00:05:41.014 --> 00:05:45.222
Now, other samples of the
Hundred Schools of Thought,

00:05:45.222 --> 00:05:47.866
especially ones that have
had a significant role

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:51.669
on China's history, and even modern China,

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.539
include the Legalists.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.149
The Legalists have a strong pragmatism.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.157
They are dismissive of
the Confucian notion

00:05:59.157 --> 00:06:01.908
of strong internal ethics
and that will guide

00:06:01.908 --> 00:06:03.514
people and rulers.

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:05.234
Legalists are much more about, look,

00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:07.956
we need a strong, orderly central state.

00:06:07.956 --> 00:06:09.588
We need to do whatever it takes,

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:12.206
and it might be clamping
down on people hard,

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:16.373
in order to have stability,
in order to have rule.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:20.412
And you can imagine the context in which

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:23.142
this Legalism is coming about.

00:06:23.142 --> 00:06:25.571
This is during the Warring States period,

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:28.456
this incredibly violent
period where the states

00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:31.478
in China are fragmented,
and so you can imagine

00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:32.844
these people who are very realistic.

00:06:32.844 --> 00:06:34.554
They're like, "Look, we've
had this Confucianism.

00:06:34.554 --> 00:06:35.930
"We have these other philosophies.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.847
"But we need strong,
super centralized rulers."

00:06:40.693 --> 00:06:43.798
And it ends up being
that Legalist philosophy

00:06:43.798 --> 00:06:46.159
that wins the day as
you have the emergence

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.869
of the Qin dynasty in
221, and the Qin dynasty

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.242
is what modern China is named after

00:06:52.242 --> 00:06:54.522
and it's considered the first dynasty

00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:58.218
to really unify China in a very strong way

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.931
and create its administrative
and bureaucratic systems,

00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:02.672
and it really is based on Legalism

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.511
and it was able to put an end
to this Warring States period

00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:10.967
by putting so much power,
central power, in strong rulers

00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:13.092
who were willing to be quite violent

00:07:13.092 --> 00:07:16.958
in repressing other people in
order to bring that stability.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.005
And it's notable that
the emergence of the Qin

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:21.548
is also considered the end

00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:22.903
of the Hundred Schools of Thought,

00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:24.688
'cause the Qin as part of that order

00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:28.281
started persecuting many of
the other forms of philosophy,

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.263
including many of those
that followed Confucius.

00:07:32.263 --> 00:07:34.990
Now other forms of philosophy,
and this is just a sample,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.059
that have strongly influenced China.

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:38.596
You have Taoism.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:41.952
Taoism is, according to Taoist belief,

00:07:41.952 --> 00:07:46.119
comes from Laozi, and the
historical record of Laozi

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:50.227
isn't as clear as we have for Confucius,

00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:53.837
but it's believed that he
lived around the same time.

00:07:53.837 --> 00:07:57.208
Some people view him as
more of a legendary figure.

00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:00.280
But Taoism is much more
concerned with the spiritual

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.853
than Confucianism.

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:04.567
You see quotes, the Tao is really The Way.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.525
It's all about harmony with the universe.

00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:09.567
"Free from desire, you
realize the mystery.

00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:13.286
"Caught in desire, you see
only the manifestations."

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:15.126
The Tao Te Ching.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:17.056
Now later on, Buddhism.

00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:21.124
It's interesting, Buddha
lives at around the same time,

00:08:21.124 --> 00:08:22.347
once again, his birth and date

00:08:22.347 --> 00:08:24.282
are under a little bit more in contention,

00:08:24.282 --> 00:08:28.449
as Confucius, and he lives in
northeast India, Nepal area,

00:08:29.303 --> 00:08:32.689
and Buddhism really comes about in Indian,

00:08:32.689 --> 00:08:36.415
but it eventually makes
its way into China,

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:40.515
especially as we get into
the first millennium CE.

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:43.572
And in modern day China
a lot of the culture

00:08:43.572 --> 00:08:45.237
and the philosophy and the religion

00:08:45.237 --> 00:08:47.059
is a combination in particular

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:51.973
of Confucianism most strongly,
but also Taoism and Buddhism.

00:08:51.973 --> 00:08:53.375
But there were other philosophies.

00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:56.188
For example Mohism is a
quite interesting one.

00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:57.452
I encourage you to look at it.

00:08:57.452 --> 00:09:00.161
But it's all about this
notion of impartial love.

00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:02.865
It actually has a lot of
similarities, parallels,

00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:07.405
with the teachings of Jesus
as told by the gospels.

00:09:07.405 --> 00:09:10.491
But that notion was viewed
somewhat impractical

00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:12.512
by many of the followers of Confucius

00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:14.877
and especially the
Legalists, and Mohism really

00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:18.157
didn't last much beyond the Qin dynasty.

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.979
But one way to think about
it is, Legalism allowed

00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:24.125
the Qin dynasty to really
end the Warring States period

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:26.385
and centralize China.

00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:29.143
But then that short-lived
dynasty as a transition

00:09:29.143 --> 00:09:33.370
to the Han, the Han took over
the administrative structure

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.431
and the stability of the
Qin to a large degree,

00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:40.974
but then they made Confucianism
really the state philosophy

00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:43.590
and you could even say the state religion.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.324
And to appreciate the
importance of Confucianism

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:48.021
to Chinese culture, I'll leave you

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:52.400
with this last quote by
the historian Huston Smith.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.188
"For though Confucius did
not author Chinese culture,"

00:09:55.188 --> 00:09:56.439
as we talked about, even Confucius says,

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:57.967
"I didn't invent anything,"

00:09:57.967 --> 00:10:00.384
"he was its supreme editor."
