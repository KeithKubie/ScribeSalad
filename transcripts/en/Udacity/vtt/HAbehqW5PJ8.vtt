So, using this as your guide, what do you think the solutions would be for this

00:00:03.164 --> 00:00:07.825
equation? You want to write your answer here using the plus or minus symbol, or

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:12.169
you can enter them separated by a comma. Now not every single step on this left

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:18.066
side will match this side, but I think you can figure the steps out. Good luck.
