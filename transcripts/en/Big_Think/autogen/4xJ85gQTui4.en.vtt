it is an interesting challenge that in

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460
it is an interesting challenge that in
 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.260
it is an interesting challenge that in
order to motivate people to excel and do

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.270
order to motivate people to excel and do
 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.940
order to motivate people to excel and do
things it's part of human nature that

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950
things it's part of human nature that
 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.290
things it's part of human nature that
you need to there needs to be some sort

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300
you need to there needs to be some sort
 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.100
you need to there needs to be some sort
of incentive so in the market economy

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110
of incentive so in the market economy
 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.460
of incentive so in the market economy
it's very much based on financial

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470
it's very much based on financial
 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.880
it's very much based on financial
rewards in academia it's very much based

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890
rewards in academia it's very much based
 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.630
rewards in academia it's very much based
on reputation and so either way there's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640
on reputation and so either way there's
 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.509
on reputation and so either way there's
competition I do think in academia it's

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519
competition I do think in academia it's
 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.580
competition I do think in academia it's
much more collaborative so I think that

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590
much more collaborative so I think that
 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.660
much more collaborative so I think that
although people can criticize academics

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670
although people can criticize academics
 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.299
although people can criticize academics
at times for holding back certain

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309
at times for holding back certain
 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.310
at times for holding back certain
research results and it's not ideal it's

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320
research results and it's not ideal it's
 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.770
research results and it's not ideal it's
not optimal at the same time I do think

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780
not optimal at the same time I do think
 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.410
not optimal at the same time I do think
that that there is a real sense of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420
that that there is a real sense of
 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.319
that that there is a real sense of
collaboration and the desire to have

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329
collaboration and the desire to have
 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.200
collaboration and the desire to have
great 22 to create great results

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210
great 22 to create great results
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.020
great 22 to create great results
together but I do think that there we do

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030
together but I do think that there we do
 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.180
together but I do think that there we do
have to be collaborating more and we are

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190
have to be collaborating more and we are
 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.599
have to be collaborating more and we are
collaborating more perfect example is

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609
collaborating more perfect example is
 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.270
collaborating more perfect example is
the human genome project so that would

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280
the human genome project so that would
 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.249
the human genome project so that would
not have come together unless you had

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259
not have come together unless you had
 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.190
not have come together unless you had
there's many universities and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200
there's many universities and
 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.170
there's many universities and
researchers that came together to work

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180
researchers that came together to work
 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.050
researchers that came together to work
for the greater good on this project and

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060
for the greater good on this project and
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.899
for the greater good on this project and
ultimately it was clear who the big

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909
ultimately it was clear who the big
 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.420
ultimately it was clear who the big
contributors were is really a part of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430
contributors were is really a part of
 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.460
contributors were is really a part of
the whole ethic is to try to be able to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470
the whole ethic is to try to be able to
 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.010
the whole ethic is to try to be able to
track that but there are challenges

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020
track that but there are challenges
 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.020
track that but there are challenges
because if you're if you're starting to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030
because if you're if you're starting to
 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.090
because if you're if you're starting to
bring together lots of other people you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100
bring together lots of other people you
 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.770
bring together lots of other people you
want to make sure that you we need to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780
want to make sure that you we need to
 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.929
want to make sure that you we need to
make sure that we maintain that ethic

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939
make sure that we maintain that ethic
 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.560
make sure that we maintain that ethic
for providing acknowledgement to the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570
for providing acknowledgement to the
 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.350
for providing acknowledgement to the
people who contribute we have lots of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360
people who contribute we have lots of
 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.630
people who contribute we have lots of
big challenges ahead of us whether it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640
big challenges ahead of us whether it's
 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.069
big challenges ahead of us whether it's
trying to reduce the cost of solar

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079
trying to reduce the cost of solar
 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.039
trying to reduce the cost of solar
energy or trying to deliver clean water

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049
energy or trying to deliver clean water
 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.660
energy or trying to deliver clean water
so the whole world or you know renewable

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
so the whole world or you know renewable
 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.010
so the whole world or you know renewable
energy in general and global warming all

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020
energy in general and global warming all
 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.100
energy in general and global warming all
of these things are going to really need

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110
of these things are going to really need
 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.550
of these things are going to really need
to have large collaborations and I don't

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560
to have large collaborations and I don't
 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.020
to have large collaborations and I don't
know that we've completely figured that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
know that we've completely figured that
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.480
know that we've completely figured that
out yet I also think that it will cause

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490
out yet I also think that it will cause
 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.969
out yet I also think that it will cause
a bit of it is a prediction that will

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
a bit of it is a prediction that will
 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.859
a bit of it is a prediction that will
cause some pressure and some challenge

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869
cause some pressure and some challenge
 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.300
cause some pressure and some challenge
for some you from four universities

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
for some you from four universities
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.000
for some you from four universities
because right now especially the larger

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
because right now especially the larger
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.220
because right now especially the larger
elite universities they have large

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
elite universities they have large
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.780
elite universities they have large
research enterprises that they

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790
research enterprises that they
 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.209
research enterprises that they
can build on and they can they can build

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219
can build on and they can they can build
 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.770
can build on and they can they can build
on the reputation by bringing in more

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
on the reputation by bringing in more
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.399
on the reputation by bringing in more
research dollars and to be doing more

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409
research dollars and to be doing more
 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.679
research dollars and to be doing more
exciting research and at the same time

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689
exciting research and at the same time
 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.259
exciting research and at the same time
if universities and universities are

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269
if universities and universities are
 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.780
if universities and universities are
collaborating more on programs then the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
collaborating more on programs then the
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.819
collaborating more on programs then the
universities will maybe be asking

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829
universities will maybe be asking
 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.770
universities will maybe be asking
themselves well how do we preserve our

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
themselves well how do we preserve our
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.770
themselves well how do we preserve our
brand because brand is important in that

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
brand because brand is important in that
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.569
brand because brand is important in that
collaboration so there needs to be the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579
collaboration so there needs to be the
 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.910
collaboration so there needs to be the
universities as individual universities

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920
universities as individual universities
 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.849
universities as individual universities
need to have a value proposition so that

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859
need to have a value proposition so that
 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.509
need to have a value proposition so that
it's not just a place where faculty sit

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519
it's not just a place where faculty sit
 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.179
it's not just a place where faculty sit
and get a paycheck you know it's really

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189
and get a paycheck you know it's really
 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.520
and get a paycheck you know it's really
the because faculty can take their

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
the because faculty can take their
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.229
the because faculty can take their
research and they can move to another

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239
research and they can move to another
 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.110
research and they can move to another
place so it will put more pressure on

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
place so it will put more pressure on
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.990
place so it will put more pressure on
universities to ensure that they're

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000
universities to ensure that they're
 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.420
universities to ensure that they're
doing their jobs and creating that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430
doing their jobs and creating that
 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.759
doing their jobs and creating that
environment that innovative environment

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769
environment that innovative environment
 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.399
environment that innovative environment
that enables people to collaborate and

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409
that enables people to collaborate and
 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.289
that enables people to collaborate and
work together and that's really one of

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
work together and that's really one of
 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.330
work together and that's really one of
the huge values of universities and a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340
the huge values of universities and a
 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.939
the huge values of universities and a
place like USC for example we've been

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949
place like USC for example we've been
 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.689
place like USC for example we've been
around for almost 130 years absolutely

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699
around for almost 130 years absolutely
 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.849
around for almost 130 years absolutely
integral to the local community and also

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859
integral to the local community and also
 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.530
integral to the local community and also
within our own you know we've built up

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540
within our own you know we've built up
 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.339
within our own you know we've built up
this faculty over the years and that

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349
this faculty over the years and that
 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.259
this faculty over the years and that
enables us to get the absolute best

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269
enables us to get the absolute best
 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.809
enables us to get the absolute best
students to come through and so it's

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819
students to come through and so it's
 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.390
students to come through and so it's
it's based on a real foundation and we

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400
it's based on a real foundation and we
 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.030
it's based on a real foundation and we
need to you know as an example we just

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040
need to you know as an example we just
 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.740
need to you know as an example we just
need to make sure that we maintain that

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
need to make sure that we maintain that
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.119
need to make sure that we maintain that
and we keep growing and we keep

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129
and we keep growing and we keep
 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.490
and we keep growing and we keep
increasing that or else we're not going

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500
increasing that or else we're not going
 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.040
increasing that or else we're not going
to be relevant
