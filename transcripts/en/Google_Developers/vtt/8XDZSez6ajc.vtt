ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.083
to another great exciting
episode of "Googles Developers

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:12.604
Live."

00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:14.020
My name is Arun
Nagarajan, and I'm

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.090
with the Google Apps
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.030
And we're actually live
here from our studios.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.756
We have a great partner,
PandaDoc, that's joining us.

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:23.130
And they're going to be walking
us through a great add-on

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.680
that they've built
for Google Docs.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.000
And we'll have a conversation,
but more importantly, also

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.600
see a demo of the
product, itself.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.059
But before we get started with
some of the technical demos,

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.850
and the product stuff,
tell me a little bit

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.190
about what the company does.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.650
What are your typical products?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.120
And what are some of the use
cases you're trying to solve?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.610
DUSTIN YODER: Yes, so we
built PandaDoc out of the idea

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.169
that we had another application
that we were sending proposals.

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:47.710
And what we realized
is people wanted

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.360
to send all kinds of documents.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.640
They wanted people to be
able to sign, comment,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.540
annotate, and even track
the document they sent out.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.050
So that's where
PandaDoc came from.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.780
And with the PandaDoc
Google add-on,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.770
or the add-on to Google,
it allows any document

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.270
to be uploaded, sent to anyone
you choose, and then you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.764
can comment back and forth,
sign in, and get confirmation

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:12.180
that they've opened
it, signed it,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.859
and you can communicate
right inside.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.400
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So it's a whole
electronic document workflow?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.250
DUSTIN YODER: Exactly,
but it's all inside,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.751
and so it's just
one clean workflow.

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:20.958
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.270
And who is a typical user?

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.900
And who are using
PandaDoc today?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.750
DUSTIN YODER: Yes, so we created
it with the consumer and SMB

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.680
in mind.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.600
So we thought there was this big
gap in these smaller companies,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.850
and the everyday
user like ourselves,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.500
the 25-person software
company, sending documents.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.460
We didn't have these enterprise
applications for doing this.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.130
And so we all use the Google
Docs and all the other document

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.220
storage companies.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.140
And we said, let's
build something

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.640
that works with these guys.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.000
And since we use Google
Docs inside our company,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.397
and we know a lot of other
consumers and SMBs do,

00:01:57.397 --> 00:01:59.980
we said let's build it for them,
and give it to them for free,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.630
and have a great
product for them.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.630
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Perfect.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.570
And how does the Google add-ons
for sheets, for Docs rather,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.490
help a business?

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.410
Like what are some
of the selling

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.494
points of the integration?

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:13.826
SASHA KOVALIOV: So the first
one is seamless integration

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:15.110
with your processes, actually.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.560
So you don't have to two or
three different applications,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.820
everything is done
inside Google Docs?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.300
The other one is simplicity.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.430
It's very simple, as we'll
see later in the demo

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.580
how it's done.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.900
And we have a really clearer UI.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.650
A lot of people are complaining
that right now the e-signature

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250
in software and applications,
they're a pain to use.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.680
We've devised PandaDoc
with a clearer UI,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.400
from the very beginning.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.620
And this is the main benefits.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.580
And we've built it really fast.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.110
It took us only a month,
month and a half to do,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.320
and we'll see how it works.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.850
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.370
That's great.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.350
Let's take a look at the demo.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.350
SASHA KOVALIOV:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.130
So we were using
Google Docs, ourselves.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.530
And we hate to use three,
four, or five tools

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.000
to just send and complete a doc.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.180
So that's why we decided
to build PandaDoc.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.650
And I'll show you how easy
it is to send a document.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.730
So I'm sending an agreement
to Dustin for him to sign.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.500
So let's see how it works.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.780
You login into your Google
Docs, and you open your doc.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.120
So you have PandaDoc
menu on the top,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.670
you open the PandaDoc
panel, and we

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.490
will define who are we
going to send it to.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.830
So we're sending it to Dustin,
so we type Dustin's email.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.435
And we need to add
several widgets,

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:28.000
so name, it will be filled by
Dustin, we select and enter.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.800
This will be filled by Dustin.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.680
Then we will add
a Date Selector,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.840
which again will be
completed by Dustin.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.170
And the last one
is his signature.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.420
So we add a Signature
block into the document.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.730
And when we're done,
we just click Send,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.782
and we will be able to insert
a small note to say, Dustin,

00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:54.740
what we want him to do.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.115
So we'll just say, hey Dustin,
just please sign and date,

00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:57.890
so we can start.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.190
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And all of
that is fully integrated

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.990
into Google Docs?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.160
SASHA KOVALIOV: Absolutely.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.730
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You
haven't left the doc yet?

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.760
SASHA KOVALIOV: We
don't leave anything.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.260
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.140
SASHA KOVALIOV: So
we send him the doc.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.354
We can open the doc in PandaDoc
now, to look at the timeline,

00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:09.270
and to track activity.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.000
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And this is
your tool, this is the web app?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.410
SASHA KOVALIOV: This is
yes, this is the web app.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.190
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.773
SASHA KOVALIOV: And we can see
what fields Dustin has to fill.

00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:16.769
Let's take a look
at what Dustin has

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.380
to do to complete the document.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.820
So he gets an email,
he opens the document,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.060
and he can fill the document
in three simple steps.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.440
He enters his email,
he picks the date,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.930
and then he adds his signature.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.840
He can upload his
PNG, he can draw,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.750
or he can just select
the typed signature.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.605
He clicks, Complete the
Document, and this is it.

00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:40.630
It's done.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.090
I can track all the activity.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.250
I can track when Dustin
opens the document.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.650
We have the notification,
we have the Dashboard.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.402
So whenever somebody
says, well I

00:04:48.402 --> 00:04:50.110
haven't received the
document, I can say,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.670
well I see you have received it.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.780
And also we give you the
legally binding PDF copy,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.950
for your old-style users,
with a certificate and IP

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.490
address and the hash.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.600
ARUN NAGARAJAN: If you
had to actually print it?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.480
SASHA KOVALIOV: Yeah,
if you need to print it.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.688
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:05:04.688 --> 00:05:05.395
That's awesome.

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:06.770
And I think you
mentioned that it

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.635
took about a month and
a half to build this?

00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:11.010
SASHA KOVALIOV:
Yeah, about that.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.790
So API is very easy to use.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.740
There is really
good documentation.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.435
And let me quickly go
through how it was built.

00:05:17.435 --> 00:05:19.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah
let's take a look.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.850
SASHA KOVALIOV: So
as you can see here,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.230
the plug-in itself consists
of two sides, the panel

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.090
and whatever happens
on the server, right?

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.650
So, there's a server side,
which is actually a script.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.504
And we have HTML Panel client,
which talks to the server side.

00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:36.420
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.280
SASHA KOVALIOV: All
the widgets here, we

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.880
inserted them as images
into the Google Doc,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.580
and we'll link them to
the appropriate instances

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.210
into PandaDoc.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.793
So when you click
Send, all the images

00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:52.970
will be transformed into HTML
slices in PandaDoc, which

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.630
the signee can fill
in, and sign them.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.600
So in a nutshell,
this is how it works.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
That's very cool.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.870
Thank you very much for sharing
all the details of your add-on,

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.450
and also some of
the business context

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.900
of why you built
this add-on, and what

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.260
you're looking to get out of it.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.890
I've personally used
the add-on, and I

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.440
think it's a really
awesome add-on.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.340
These guys have
done a terrific job.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.160
Good luck with the
launch, and we really

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.460
hope you guys out there
check it out, and give us

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.507
a lot of feedback on it.

00:06:16.507 --> 00:06:17.340
Thank you very much.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.140
DUSTIN YODER AND SASHA
KOVALIOV: Thank you.
