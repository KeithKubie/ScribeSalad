Hello, and welcome to Computability,
Complexity, and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.960
Algorithms, the introductory
theoretical computer science course for

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.660
the Georgia Tech Masters and
PhD programs.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.780
I'm Lance Fortnow, professor in
the School of Computer Science

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.310
at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.530
&gt;&gt; And I'm Charles Brubaker,
a PhD graduate from Georgia Tech, and

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.200
Udacity course developer.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.780
&gt;&gt; In this course,
we'll ask the big questions.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.020
What is a computer?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.840
What are the limits of computation?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.560
Are there problems that no
computer will ever solve?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.170
Are there problems that
can't be solved quickly?

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.619
What kinds of problems
can we solve efficiently?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.639
And how do we go about
developing these algorithms?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.980
Understanding the power and limitations
of algorithms helps us develop the tools

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.370
to make real world computers smarter,
faster, and safer.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.340
We step away from the particulars
of programming languages and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.210
computer architectures and instead
take an abstract view of computing.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.573
This viewpoint allows us to understand
where the computation problem is

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:56.580
inherently easy or hard to solve.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.540
Independent of the specific limitation
of a machine we plan to use.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.410
These results have stood the test of
time, being as valuable to us today

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.870
as they were when they
were developed in the 70s.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.830
While the topic of the course is theory,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.430
understanding the material can
have very practical benefits.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.798
You will learn a wealth of tools that
will help you recognize when problems

00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:17.136
you encounter in the real
world are intractable and

00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:18.892
when there is an efficient solution.

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:22.222
This can save you countless hours that
would otherwise have been spent on

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:24.580
a fruitless endeavor or
in reinventing the wheel.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.230
Certainly by having followed the
rigorous arguments made in this course,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.810
you'll have given yourself
a kind of training.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.740
The athlete doesn't just
practice on the field or

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.150
the court where the competition is held,
he goes to the gym.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.910
And when he returns, he finds he
is better prepared for the game.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.480
In a similar way, by taking this course,
you'll improve your thinking,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.840
as you make engineering, or
even business decisions.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.700
You will find that you have better
reasons to prefer one strategy

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.850
over another, and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
will be able to articulate more rigorous
arguments in support of your ideas.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.810
Shall we get started?

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.660
&gt;&gt; Let's hit that gym!
