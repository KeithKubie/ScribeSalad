DAVID LEE: One by one we shine.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.770
But together we flourish.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.010
We Flourish
celebrates the stories

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.680
of Asian and Asian
American Princeton alumni,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.610
while also highlighting the
power of coming together

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.500
as a community.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.930
Hello, I'm David Lee, Provost
of Princeton University.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.630
The Asian community has
a longstanding history

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.670
at Princeton, beginning with
Hikoichi Orita from Japan,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.250
who graduated in 1876.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.130
There are so many individual
stories from all regions.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.540
By sharing our
Princeton experiences,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.750
we further strengthen
our Princeton ties.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.780
Today, Asian and Asian
American students

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.200
make up nearly a quarter
of the student body.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.570
With family roots that
reach all across Asia,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.650
our students pursue
their passions

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.110
in areas such as literature,
sciences, music, and the arts.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.950
Princeton is, and should
be, a place where students

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.480
can discover and celebrate the
richness of diverse cultures,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.720
including their own.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720
YOUNGSUK Y.S. CHI: I grew
up all over the world.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.790
SPEAKER 1: From Hong
Kong originally, but I

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.100
moved to Sydney some 30 years--

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.780
FRANKLIN ODO: So I
grew up in Honolulu.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.530
I was born there in 1939.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.240
SPEAKER 2: Hanoi.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.170
PAULA CHOW: I'm from
Shanghai, China.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.670
REGINA LEE: So I'm
Chinese American.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.790
On my mother's side
of the family--

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.350
RAJ VINNAKOTA: I was actually
born in Lausanne, Switzerland.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.060
CAILIN HONG: Second
generation born here.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.770
CHRIS LOH: I was born in Taiwan.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.520
EVAN KRATZER: I'm
personally half Japanese

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.580
and half a variety of
Western European countries

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.200
mixed together.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.590
KANWAL MATHARU: Born and
raised in New Orleans.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.370
I'm a Cajun baby.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.600
RISHI JAITLY: I
grew up in New York.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.800
SPEAKER 3: China and Hong Kong.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.530
SPEAKER 4: I grew up thinking
I was Italian American.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.860
SPEAKER 5: From the Philippines.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.410
EVA LERNER-LAM: One
day it was November.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.130
It was dusk and it was snowing.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.400
And we were waiting to make
a right onto Nassau Street.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.970
FRANKLIN ODO: The alternative
to working on the farm

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.770
was to find a way to
justify to your parents

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.870
ways you could
avoid being there.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.440
So I did Boy Scouts, 4H Club.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.010
I played every
sport I could find.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.430
EVA LERNER-LAM: I looked up
there, and my mom was driving.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.120
And I said, Mom, what's that?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.880
And she said, that's
Princeton University.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.720
And I said, wow.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.010
I want to go there.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.850
FRANKLIN ODO: I didn't know at
the time, and nobody told me,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.720
this was the way
you craft a resume

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.780
to get invited to join an Ivy.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.040
EVA LERNER-LAM: And my
mom pulled the car over

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.810
to the side.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.720
She put it in park.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.840
She looked at me and she
said, Eva, in this world

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.150
not everything is fair.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.270
You'll never be able
to go to Princeton

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.690
because Princeton
doesn't take girls.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.340
And I looked back in the
window and I looked at my mom,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.730
and I said, I'll
figure out a way.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.330
I have to go there.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.960
FRANKLIN ODO: It
was a great honor.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.790
And it made me a local hero.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.910
EVA LERNER-LAM: And then nine
years later, provost Bill Bowen

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.640
somehow managed to get our fine
university to be coeducational.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.460
And I was able to apply,
and I got in, and I came.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.420
YOUNGSUK Y.S. CHI: I was
a foreign student when

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.220
I came to Princeton from Korea.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.590
And so my identity was
really as a foreigner first.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.550
RAJ VINNAKOTA: So I had
what one would consider

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.830
to be a fairly stereotypical
Asian family upbringing

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.400
when it came to education.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.800
YOUNGSUK Y.S. CHI: My
habits, my way of thinking,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.000
my expectations were shaped by
where I came from, by my mother

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.390
and father and my relatives.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.760
RAJ VINNAKOTA:
Our parents pushed

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600
us to make sure that we
did as much as possible

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.360
in as many ways as possible.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.170
REGINA LEE: We
were few in number.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:01.220
I think my class had about 50
Asian/Asian American students.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.610
TIMOTHY WU: I was a foreign
Asian student coming

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.880
from Singapore, and I spent my
first couple weeks on campus

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.270
walking around going,
what's lacrosse?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.680
What's an a cappella
singing group?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.010
YOUNGSUK Y.S. CHI: We were
also not very much understood

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.980
by the rest, because they
didn't come to Princeton already

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.490
having been exposed to
the variety of students

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.340
that Princeton was
trying to educate.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.050
TEDDY ZHOU: I was the
first undergraduate

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.880
from China, mainland
China, to say, since 1949.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.070
Princeton admission was my
ticket to the free world.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.930
So I'm very, very grateful.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.640
MARY YEE: My own
socioeconomic background

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.510
is very different
from the mainstream

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.370
Princetonian at that time.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.380
DANILO JOA: At the time, we feel
like maybe fish out of water.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.200
Maybe we didn't belong.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.000
Maybe was a big fluke.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.540
But I got in.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.930
And I'm very glad to see
the Princeton of today

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.810
is much more diverse and open
to students of all colors

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.800
and creeds.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.670
SANJEEV KULKARNI:
And I think diversity

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.140
is an important part of the
university mission, that

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.040
is, the teaching and research
mission to really fully carry

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.190
that mission out.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.630
I think we have to be educating
a diverse group of students

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.620
at both the undergraduate
and graduate level.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.230
Second, diversity
actually impacts

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.700
the quality of the research
and teaching that we do.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.830
I think by having a different
diverse set of students,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.270
faculty, staff, we get the
best ideas out on the table

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.960
make the most progress
in those realms.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.860
But third, it actually
impacts the quality

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.810
of the experience, the
educational experience of all

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.040
the students that are here
by giving them an opportunity

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.420
to experience the other.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.850
CAILIN HONG: We really see a
very multicultural, wide range

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.340
of individuals represented
here at Princeton.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.450
And it's really great to be able
to see that mixing pot here.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.330
KANWAL MATHARU: To be
able to say yes, there

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.500
are a lot of Asian students.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.830
Yes, there are communities here.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.110
Yes, we're building, we're
growing, we're moving,

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.080
we're shaping, we're
integrated into the fabric

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.460
of the university.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.800
I think that is useful.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.290
GARY PAI: I feel that if
you follow your passions,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.770
do what you are really
strong and enjoy doing,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.100
you will end up in a
place and in a career

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.370
that you'll find far more
fulfilling than what you

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.580
thought you were going to do.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.420
RAJ VINNAKOTA: I'm a huge
believer in a liberal arts

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.620
education.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.170
I didn't realize
it at that time,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.330
but even more so
today, what you need

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.930
is a grounding in
how to think, in how

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.820
to approach problems, in
how to look at history

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.390
and apply it to the present.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.930
Cary LIU: It turns
out that Princeton

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.580
has one of the
strongest collections

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.030
of Chinese art in the nation.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.200
And one of the things
about Princeton's education

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.520
in the graduate program, and
even in the undergraduate,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.660
is that the students are brought
in to work with the collection.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.950
EUNJEONG CHI: I chose
art history as my major.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.380
And the courses that
mattered to me the most

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.300
were definitely the ones that
I took with my eventual thesis

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.790
advisor.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.500
And he focused on Chinese
art and architecture.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.920
SOOJEONG CHI: I actually think
my Chinese language courses

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.610
were my favorite classes,
just because they're

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.490
really-- I know.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.750
You're laughing because I
probably complained about it

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.830
all the time.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.000
At the time, it's so
rigorous that you're

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.960
kind of just blinded by it.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.740
It's so much work.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.070
it's good, because you're
learning anything more quickly

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.420
than everybody else.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.850
But they're small,
really focused classes.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.550
CHRIS LOH: I felt very
comfortable interacting

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.910
in the mainstream
community, as well as

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.370
in the Asian American community.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.240
YOUNGSUK Y.S. CHI: I
felt very much supported

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.260
by the university.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.510
We had the Office of
International Students,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.650
and the unforgettable
Paula Chow.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.990
I mean, she was our
mother to all of us.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.620
PAULA CHOW: Welcome back.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.570
We are in Beijing,
China, where Gregory

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.120
is giving a few lectures.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.190
We want to send you our
love and our best wishes

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.040
for your continuous success.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.600
GREGORY CHOW: Today
I wouldn't be here

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.030
if I weren't the
husband of Paula Chow.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.350
PAULA CHOW: That is
absolutely not true.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.710
But I do want to say one thing.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.460
Because of my work with
the University League,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.930
I got involved
with Louise Sayen,

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.410
and then we called ourselves
the International Center.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.010
And then it became something
a little bit well-known,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.560
and then slowly well-known
until four years later.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.320
We were invited to move into--

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.440
GREGORY CHOW: Murray-Dodge?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.250
PAULA CHOW: To
Murray-Dodge, yes.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.040
RISHI JAITLY: For me,
Princeton was a place

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.250
to discover my heritage.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.860
I candidly, growing up,
coming into Princeton,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.080
didn't really connect
with my Asian heritage.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.650
I felt very American.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.820
And I said, you know, I ought
to be intentional about this.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.100
So I joined a South
Asian theater group.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.300
I joined Naacho, the
Indian dance group,

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.160
which I think is still around.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.730
And then I created and
produced some of my own events.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.000
So for me, my
journey at Princeton

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.550
was coming in very unaware
of, really, my background.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.880
And I left quite aware.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.390
NICHOLAS WU: Personally, I
consider the United States

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.320
to be my home country.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.550
I mean, I was born,
I was raised here.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.170
I consider myself
to be American.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.010
But it was definitely very
good to have this experience,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.100
to go back and explore the
culture and the language

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.020
of my ancestors.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.640
ELLA CHENG: Luckily, Princeton
has given me, actually,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.390
more opportunities
than even my own family

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.860
to explore my Chinese side and
my Asian American side because

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.710
of the clubs here
and the people here,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.290
but also because I was able to
attend programs like Princeton

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.350
at Beijing, where I went back
to China for the first time,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.530
actually, in my life, and was
able to learn the language

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.450
and really immerse myself
in the culture there

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.410
in a different way.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.030
So yeah, it's been
a great place for me

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.760
to grow my identity as well.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.630
APRIL CHOU: Over the
years, one of the topics

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.140
that I got very
involved with was

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.660
that of Asian American studies.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.120
FRANKLIN ODO: So
I taught a seminar

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.110
on Asian American
History Spring of 1995.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.050
There were 20 kids in the class.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.550
APRIL CHOU: I
remember, at the time,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.350
doing a fair bit
of research just

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.540
to understand the history
and context of these issues

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.110
at that time.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.900
It included admissions,
included ethnic studies,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.610
it included faculty hiring.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.900
FRANKLIN ODO: As we got
towards the end of the semester

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.460
and we were studying what
we called the Asian American

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:33.880
Movement, beginning where I
had participated in 1969, 1970,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.750
in sit-ins, demonstrations,
hunger strikes, and so on.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.230
APRIL CHOU: Ultimately,
after several years of,

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.790
I think, working through
the appropriate channels

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.660
and having a lot
of conversations,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.910
we ultimately decided
to do a sit-in, in part

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.800
in peaceful protest,
but to really

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.340
elevate the level of
attention and commitment

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.660
around these issues.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.230
FRANKLIN ODO: The students
were extremely principled.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.190
They never let on that
they were planning this,

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.090
because they must
have been planning it

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.470
in the course of the semester.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.840
APRIL CHOU: This is
actually inside the sit-in.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.230
We sang a lot of
hymns, a lot of hymns

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.690
from the Civil Rights movement.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.360
FRANKLIN ODO: And you
know, some of them

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.640
were first generation
college students,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.090
and they had a lot to lose,
because if the University

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:30.070
had applied sanctions, including
expulsion, that was insane.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:36.070
APRIL CHOU: This is me the
night after we came out.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:42.140
This was, I think, a moment of
great celebration and relief

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.040
that our voices had been
heard, and that there

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.450
were some changes to come.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.090
I view it all as a
very long-term path,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.760
and that we're really trying
to have an impact on the things

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.130
that are not just for when
we're students or alums here,

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.630
but for the generations to come.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.630
SHERYL WUDUNN: I think
this is really important,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.530
this conference,
because it's not

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.500
to say that we need to
have a solidarity movement.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.740
It's really just that we want
to be-- we feel that we really

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.120
have comrades, friends that we
can feel comfortable sharing

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.960
experiences with, especially
as they relate to Princeton.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.800
I think this conference
is very important

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.700
to instill that sense of
spirit among all of us.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.850
Now I'm a trustee, one
of seven Asian or Asian

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.670
American trustees, out
of about 40 trustees.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.430
That's a really large minority.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.090
That's a significant presence.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.160
And it makes me really proud.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:13:01.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.370
APRIL CHOU: One
of the things that

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:08.250
has been such a blessing
about being involved with A4P

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.690
is really getting to know
and work with Princetonians

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.280
across different generations
that I otherwise, I think,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.220
may not have had an
opportunity to meet.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.710
And I really feel
like today we're

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.700
standing on the shoulders
of several giants

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.160
who were each trailblazers
in their own right.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.660
And in particular, I
had the great privilege

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.150
of working with Kelly Kuwayama,
who was Class of 1940.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.850
And as you can imagine, his
experiences here at Princeton

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.930
were very different from
those that I experienced,

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.260
and those that students today
are probably experiencing.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.240
He had a way of listening
and taking things in.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.590
But when he spoke,
people really listened.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:52.200
I also really wanted to honor
Sue-Jean Lee Suettinger, who

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.970
was Class of '70.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:01.430
She really was such a
powerful and quiet leader.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.490
And yet this conference,
We Flourish, was her dream.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.640
The other person I
really wanted to speak of

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.950
is Dora Lee, who
was Class of '76.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:16.150
She was such a believer in
bringing people back together,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.940
and was one of these people that
held her orange and black so

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.010
closely.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.790
So I really wanted to
honor the three of them,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.090
and to acknowledge
that I think many of us

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.180
wouldn't be here
at this conference,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.680
or working together, had it not
been for their contributions

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.760
and their leadership.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.340
CHRISTOPHER EISGRUBER:
What a pleasure

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.000
it is to welcome
Princeton's Asian and Asian

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.720
American alumni to the
We Flourish Conference.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.990
These alumni conferences have
become a wonderful vehicle

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.640
for this university to reach
out and embrace its alumni

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.870
community, and to
bring back groups that

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.240
are important to
this university,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.240
and allow you to
interact with the campus,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.750
with your classmates, and
with our current students.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.960
We're delighted to have you
here for this conference,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.140
and I look forward to
interacting with all of you

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.710
I hope you have
a wonderful time.
