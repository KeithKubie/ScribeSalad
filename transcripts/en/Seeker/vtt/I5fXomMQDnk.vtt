00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.390
Computers might not be able to mimic human
intelligence, but what about a memcomputer?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.040
Hey guys!

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
Amy with you on DNews today talking super
intelligent computers!

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.130
Well, maybe…

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.890
In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing proposed
the now-famous Turing Test that challenges

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.110
anyone to build a computer that can think
like a human, success coming when a human

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.420
conversing with that computer thinks he or
she is really talking to another person.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.529
So far, no computer has been able to pass
the Turing Test, but a new kind of computer

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.360
might be getting closer.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.650
Universal memcomputing machines or Memcomputers,
developed by Massimiliano Di Ventra, a theoretical

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.460
physicist at the University of California,
San Diego.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.720
They are a class of brain-inspired computers
based on human memory systems, essentially

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.100
mimicking the human brain.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.930
It comes down to the microchip.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.770
In a conventional microchip, the processor
executes computations and the memory stores

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.770
data.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.870
Both are separate components necessitating
a constant relay between processor and memory,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.830
something that consumes enough time and energy
to limit the performance of standard computers.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.199
Memcomputers avoid this pitfall.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.620
Physicists building these new machines are
using memprocessors at the computer’s core,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.701
smaller units that can both process and store
data, removing this relay between the two

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.170
halves of a conventional microchip.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.480
It’s a setup that mimics the way neurons
work in the brain.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.110
In the brain, each neuron processes and stores
information.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.010
So in a computer, these memprocessors save
energy, time, and ultimately improve the computer’s

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.010
performance.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.710
Memprocessors can work together collectively
and simultaneously to attack a complex problem

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.320
from all sides, finding all possible solutions
at once to settle on the best one rather than

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.980
trying each one in turn, which is what a human
would do.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.730
And here’s a really interesting aspect of
this story: working out the details of memcomputing

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.750
could help scientists better understand how
the brain works.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.560
For now memcomputers are in the proof-of-concept
stage, and the way the system encodes data

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.260
makes it vulnerable to fluctuations that can
introduce errors, so this will have to be

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.840
addressed before a large-scale version can
go to work.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.920
Still, this might be the computer that could
one day perform notoriously complex tasks

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.450
like breaking codes.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.520
But there are other breakthrough technologies
that are changing the world and making amazing

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.270
experiences possible.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.740
Intel drives innovation with products like
processors, wearables and IOT devices, and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.740
within data centers.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.740
In the PC and beyond.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.450
Having Intel inside makes for better experiences
outside.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.180
So what do you guys think of the prospect
of a computer that mimics the human brain?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.180
Cool?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.180
Or super creepy?
