00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.985
So last year, I ran for mayor
of my hometown, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.688
And I was the underdog.

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:21.619
I was running against
a two-term incumbent,

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.791
and my opponent ran
the classic partisan playbook.

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:27.809
He publicized his endorsement
of Donald Trump.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.682
He publicized a letter
that he sent to President Obama

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:32.350
protesting Syrian refugees,

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:35.937
even though none of them
were coming to Tulsa.

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.762
(Laughter)

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:42.493
He ran ads on TV that my kids thought
made me look like Voldemort,

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:48.188
and sent out little gems
in the mail, like this.

00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:50.572
[America's most liberal
labor union has endorsed]

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:53.722
Never mind that "America's
most liberal labor union,"

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:58.259
as defined by this ad, was actually
the Tulsa Firefighters Union,

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:00.981
hardly a famed bastion of liberalism.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.576
(Laughter)

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.751
Never mind that while she was
running for president

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.420
and he was serving
in his final year in that office,

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:11.865
Hillary, Barack and I could just
never find the time to get together

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:14.254
and yuck it up about
the Tulsa mayor's race.

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:17.739
(Laughter)

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:21.261
Never mind that I, like my opponent,

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:22.627
am a Republican.

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:25.524
(Laughter)

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:30.937
And so when something like this
hits you in a campaign,

00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.057
you have to decide
how you're going to respond,

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.175
and we had a novel idea.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.103
What if, instead of responding
with partisanship,

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:43.913
we responded with a focus on results?

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.190
What if we ran a campaign

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:50.207
that was not about running
against someone,

00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:53.699
but was about bringing people together
behind a common vision?

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:58.637
And so we decided
to respond not with a negative ad

00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.955
but with something people
find even sexier --

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.154
data points.

00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:05.162
(Laughter)

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:10.835
And so we emphasized things like
increasing per capita income in our city,

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.827
increasing our city's population,

00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:18.509
and we stuck to those relentlessly,
throughout the campaign,

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.915
always bringing it back to those things

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.380
by which our voters could measure,
in a very transparent way,

00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:26.573
how we were doing,

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:28.907
and hold me accountable if I got elected.

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:31.595
And a funny thing happened
when we did that.

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.526
Tulsa is home to one of the most vibrant

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.907
young professional
populations in the country,

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.930
and they took notice of this approach.

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:41.658
We have in our culture in our city,

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:45.230
an ethos where our business leaders
don't just run companies,

00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:49.597
they run philanthropic
institutions and nonprofits,

00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.706
and those folks took notice.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.690
We have parents who are willing
to sacrifice today

00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:57.913
so that their kids
can have a better future,

00:02:57.937 --> 00:02:59.714
and those people took notice, too.

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:02.508
And so on election day,

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:04.429
I, G.T. Bynum,

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:08.010
a guy whose name reminds people
of a circus promoter ...

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:09.898
(Laughter)

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:14.883
a guy with the raw animal magnetism
of a young Orville Redenbacher ...

00:03:14.907 --> 00:03:17.709
(Laughter)

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:21.669
I won the election by 17 points.

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:26.351
(Applause)

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:30.501
And we did it with the support
of Republicans and Democrats.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.073
Now, why is that story
and that approach so novel?

00:03:36.021 --> 00:03:37.986
Why do we always allow ourselves

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.059
to fall back on
philosophical disagreements

00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:43.486
that ultimately lead to division?

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:48.530
I believe it is because politicians

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:51.722
find it easier to throw
the red meat out to the base

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:52.896
than to innovate.

00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.879
The conventional wisdom
is that to win an election,

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.325
you have to dumb it down

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.395
and play to your constituencies'
basest, divisive instincts.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.811
And when somebody
wins an election like that,

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:09.652
they win, that's true,

00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:11.111
but the rest of us lose.

00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:16.953
And so what we need to do is think
about how can we change that dynamic.

00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:20.516
How can we move in a direction

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.478
where partisanship
is replaced with policy?

00:04:23.502 --> 00:04:27.003
And fortunately, there's a growing
bipartisan movement across this country

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:29.067
that is doing just that.

00:04:29.557 --> 00:04:31.882
One of its heroes
is a guy named Mitch Daniels.

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:36.343
Mitch Daniels served
as George W. Bush's budget director,

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:37.645
and during that time,

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.771
he created what was called the PART tool.

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.157
The PART tool allowed people to evaluate
a broad range of federal programs

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:49.126
and apply numerical scoring for them

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.539
on things like program management
and project results.

00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:57.086
And using this, they evaluated
over a thousand federal programs.

00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:01.415
Over 150 programs
had their funding reduced

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.979
because they could not
demonstrate success.

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:09.194
But unfortunately, there wasn't ever
a well-publicized increase in funding

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:11.979
for those programs
that did demonstrate success,

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:15.765
and because of this, the program
was never really popular with Congress,

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.392
and was eventually shuttered.

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:20.067
But the spirit of that program lived on.

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:22.353
Mitch Daniels went home to Indiana,

00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:24.076
ran for governor, got elected,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.878
and applied the same premise
to state programs,

00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:32.482
reducing funding for those programs
that could not demonstrate success,

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:37.816
but this time, he very publicly
increased funding for those programs

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.348
that could demonstrate success,

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.659
things like increasing
the number of state troopers

00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:43.887
that they needed to have,

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:46.309
reducing wait times at the DMV --

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.953
and today, Mitch Daniels
is the president of Purdue University,

00:05:49.977 --> 00:05:52.159
applying yet again the same principles,

00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:53.984
this time at the higher ed level,

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:58.158
and he's done that in order to keep
tuition levels for students there flat

00:05:58.182 --> 00:05:59.396
for half a decade.

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:03.840
Now, while Mitch Daniels
applied this at the federal level,

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.657
the state level, and in higher ed,

00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:08.807
the guy that really cracked
the code for cities

00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:11.467
is a Democrat, Martin O'Malley,

00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:13.419
during his time as Mayor of Baltimore.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:15.890
Now, when Mayor O'Malley took office,

00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:19.374
he was a big fan of what they'd been
able to do in New York City

00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.103
when it came to fighting crime.

00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:24.751
When Rudy Giuliani first became
Mayor of New York,

00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:29.846
crime statistics were collected
on a monthly, even an annual basis,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.744
and then police resources would be
allocated based on those statistics.

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:37.833
Giuliani shrunk that time frame,
so that crime statistics

00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:41.349
would be collected on a daily,
even hourly basis,

00:06:41.373 --> 00:06:44.674
and then police resources
would be allocated

00:06:44.698 --> 00:06:48.628
to those areas quickly where crimes
were occurring today

00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:51.222
rather than where
they were occurring last quarter.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.915
Well, O'Malley loved that approach,
and he applied it in Baltimore.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:01.574
And he applied it to the two areas
that were most problematic for Baltimore

00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:03.217
from a crime-fighting standpoint.

00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:05.582
We call these the kidneys of death.

00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:07.575
[Baltimore homicides and shootings, 1999]

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.209
So there they are, the kidneys.

00:07:09.808 --> 00:07:11.042
Now watch this.

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:14.324
Watch what happens
when you apply data in real time

00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:16.131
and deploy resources quickly.

00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.918
In a decade, they reduced
violent crime in Baltimore

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.521
by almost 50 percent, using this approach,

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:27.085
but the genius of what O'Malley did

00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:29.975
was not that he just did
what some other city was doing.

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:31.713
Lots of us mayors do that.

00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:33.151
(Laughter)

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:37.612
He realized that the same approach
could be used to all of the problems

00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:39.108
that his city faced.

00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:41.800
And so they applied it
to issue after issue in Baltimore,

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:45.974
and today, it's being used
by mayors across the country

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.133
to deal with some
of our greatest challenges.

00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:51.306
And the overall approach
is a very simple one --

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.152
identify the goal
that you want to achieve;

00:07:54.176 --> 00:07:57.528
identify a measurement
by which you can track progress

00:07:57.552 --> 00:07:59.021
toward that goal;

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:05.228
identify a way of testing that measurement
cheaply and quickly;

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:09.665
and then deploy whatever strategies
you think would work,

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.114
test them,

00:08:11.138 --> 00:08:14.154
reduce funding for the strategies
that don't work,

00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:17.450
and put your money
into those strategies that do.

00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:20.887
Today, Atlanta is using this
to address housing issues

00:08:20.911 --> 00:08:22.665
for their homeless population.

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:25.602
Philadelphia has used this
to reduce their crime rates

00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:28.610
to levels not enjoyed since the 1960s.

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:32.010
Louisville has used this
not just for their city

00:08:32.034 --> 00:08:35.973
but in a community-wide effort
bringing resources together

00:08:35.997 --> 00:08:39.251
to address vacant
and abandoned properties.

00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:41.942
And I am using this approach in Tulsa.

00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:45.117
I want Tulsa to be a world-class city,

00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:49.387
and we cannot do that
if we aren't clear in what our goals are

00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:53.760
and we don't use evidence
and evaluation to accomplish them.

00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:58.009
Now, what's interesting,
and we've found in implementing this,

00:08:58.033 --> 00:09:01.574
a lot of people, when you talk about data,

00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:05.313
people think of that
as a contrast to creativity.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.622
What we've found
is actually quite the opposite.

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:10.686
We've found it to be an engine
for creative problem-solving,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.020
because when you're focused on a goal,

00:09:14.044 --> 00:09:16.854
and you can test
different strategies quickly,

00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:20.243
the sky's the limit on the different
things that you can test out.

00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:23.338
You can come up with any strategy
that you can come up with

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.244
and utilize and try and test it

00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:28.554
until you find something that works,
and then you double down on that.

00:09:28.578 --> 00:09:32.711
The other area that we've found
that it lends itself to creativity

00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:35.972
is that it breaks down
those old silos of ownership

00:09:35.996 --> 00:09:38.165
that we run into so often in government.

00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:42.658
It allows you to draw
all the stakeholders in your community

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:47.614
that care about homelessness
or crime-fighting or education

00:09:47.638 --> 00:09:50.266
or vacant and abandoned properties,

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.339
and bring those people to the table

00:09:52.363 --> 00:09:56.633
so you can work together
to address your common goal.

00:09:56.657 --> 00:09:58.315
Now, in Tulsa, we're applying this

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:02.195
to things that are
common city initiatives,

00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:04.473
things like, as you've heard
now repeatedly,

00:10:04.497 --> 00:10:07.013
public safety -- that's an obvious one;

00:10:07.037 --> 00:10:09.712
improving our employee
morale at the city --

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:14.246
we don't think you could do good things
unless you've got happy employees;

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.509
improving the overall street quality
throughout our community.

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:22.763
But we're also applying it
to things that are not so traditional

00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:25.573
when you think about
what cities are responsible for,

00:10:25.597 --> 00:10:28.015
things like increasing per capita income,

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:29.890
increasing our population,

00:10:29.914 --> 00:10:32.496
improving our high school
graduation rates,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.527
and perhaps the greatest challenge
that we face as a city.

00:10:38.937 --> 00:10:40.803
At the dawn of the 1920s,

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:44.525
Tulsa was home to the most vibrant
African American community in the country.

00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:48.774
The Greenwood section of our city
was known as Black Wall Street.

00:10:49.842 --> 00:10:52.478
In 1921, in one night,

00:10:52.502 --> 00:10:55.794
Tulsa experienced the worst race riot
in American history.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:11:00.161
Black Wall Street
was burned to the ground,

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:02.724
and today, a child that is born

00:11:02.748 --> 00:11:05.598
in the most predominantly
African American part of our city

00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:09.438
is expected to live 11 years less
than a kid that's born elsewhere in Tulsa.

00:11:11.555 --> 00:11:15.221
Now, for us, this is a unifying issue.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.397
Four years from now, we will recognize

00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:22.675
the 100th commemoration
of that awful event,

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:27.021
and in Tulsa, we are bringing
every tool that we can

00:11:27.045 --> 00:11:29.652
to address that life-expectancy disparity,

00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:32.034
and we're not checking
party registration cards

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.549
at the door to the meetings.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.766
We don't care who
you voted for for president

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.464
if you want to help restore
the decade of life

00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:41.892
that's being stolen
from these kids right now.

00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:45.987
And so we've got white folks
and black folks,

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.306
Hispanic folks and Native American folks,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.172
we've got members of Congress,
members of the city council,

00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:52.921
business leaders, religious leaders,

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:55.221
Trump people and Hillary people,

00:11:55.245 --> 00:11:58.190
all joined by one common belief,

00:11:58.214 --> 00:12:02.253
and that is that a kid should have
an equal shot at a good life in our city,

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:05.475
regardless of what part of town
they happen to be born in.

00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:09.768
Now, how do we go forward with that?

00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:12.408
Is that easy to accomplish?

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:13.582
Of course not!

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.035
If it were easy to accomplish,

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:18.543
somebody would have already
done it before us.

00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:21.201
But what I love about city government

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:23.290
is that the citizens can create

00:12:23.314 --> 00:12:25.806
whatever kind of city
they're willing to build,

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.267
and in Tulsa, we have decided
to build a city

00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:34.609
where Republicans and Democrats
use evidence, data and evaluation

00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:37.317
to solve our greatest challenges together.

00:12:38.944 --> 00:12:40.221
And if we can do this,

00:12:40.245 --> 00:12:42.895
if we can set partisanship aside

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:47.392
in the only state in the whole country
where Barack Obama never carried

00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:49.146
a single county,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.083
then you can do it in your town, too.

00:12:51.107 --> 00:12:53.210
(Laughter)

00:12:53.234 --> 00:12:56.472
Your cities can be saved or squandered

00:12:56.496 --> 00:12:57.948
in one generation.

00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:05.060
So let's agree to set aside
our philosophical disagreements

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:08.306
and focus on those aspirations
that unite us.

00:13:09.001 --> 00:13:13.121
Let's grasp the opportunity
that is presented by innovation

00:13:13.145 --> 00:13:15.786
to build better communities
for our neighbors.

00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:20.354
Let's replace a focus on partisan division

00:13:20.378 --> 00:13:22.623
with a focus on results.

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:26.684
That is the path
to a better future for us all.

00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:28.476
Thank you for your time.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.596
(Applause)
