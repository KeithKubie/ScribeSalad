Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. I have avoided games on my phone for a very specific reason why I have a problem with games. Like you said, you got hooked on it. Yeah. You have a bad ass gaming rig over there. I saw that gaming rig, game room, the land. But that's all for first person shooters while we're here. Okay. CanNot have a game that I love on my phone. Why not have that? Why? Because I'm a child. Yeah, you get obsessed with it. Yeah. I don't have that kind of control. If I have a fucking awesome game that's on my phone. Yeah, that's my life. My life's gone now. You go get the game on me. Everywhere I go. What apps you have on your phone? What apps, what else keeps you going? I have a bunch of, um, normal apps like Instagram and Twitter, but I have a bunch of cool ones.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Like some star map shit. What do you have never looked for this, but I just found some playing quake on their phone. Oh, ah, yeah. That Xbox controller. It's sorta like that as a controller you can excrete dope shit, but they play, they have quake three port it on there. God Damn it. See why the fuck would you telling me that whenever I looked before it son of a bitch. It looks like it was two dimensional though. Or not two d but it didn't have an up and and down. Yeah. Addiction. Now congratulations on your new addiction. No, I'm not going to do it. I don't have anything on my phone. I don't even have chat. I played chess on my phone for a little while and I didn't even like that. Yeah, cause I was started going, hmm, how do I get better at this?

Speaker 1:          01:17          I'm like shut up. I'm try saying that I had to just shut it off and we put that goddamn thing down. Do you have to pick and choose what you want to devote your time and energy? So, so what are your, what are your top three things that you put time and interest to that aren't your family right now? Well, work stuff. It's mostly work stuff or martial arts, right? So it's like work stuff is a stand up, which is the most time consuming because I have multiple sets tonight and I'm always writing, always tweaking and listening to the pouring. So how do you, how do you do at your standup stuff? So I want to get this shit. You want to get into stand up? Not really. Well that was kind of thinking about how do I get into stand up comedy? People watch my videos.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Like while you're kind of funny, you're funny. You should do stand up. I was like, Shit, I'll trust me. I'm a professional. You're funny guy. You can totally do it. Thank you. All you have to do is go to an open mic night. So yeah. What I suggest, go to an open mic night and see how terrible everybody is. Right. And then you'll be inspired to try to say, you're going to be terrible too. Don't get me wrong. I was terrible when I first started, but you'll probably be better than most. Really? Yeah. And that's all you need. All you need is people. If you say something people ha ha ah, just that's all you need. Just a little chunk. One guy in the front row. Yes. Okay. I gotta remember I got an ember. Yeah. Like I can do this and you'll figure it out and you'll get better at it and you'll work at it and you'll tweak it. And how old are you? 36. You can do it. You still have time still alive when once a cutoff date. 40 Shit. Kill yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:37          I don't mean that. Don't listen to me. You'll never just jokes folks. Just joking. Kidding Jay k. But if you, if you're a person who can make people, uh, and you are willing to dedicate yourself to it, it's not like you have to have certain amount of flexibility or you know, a certain amount of physical strength, right? No, it's just can you make people laugh? Okay. Then you can do it. Are you going to pull it off? Right? That's another question. So how do you get inspiration? How do you see you sit down? Yeah. This is funny. Now write this down. How do you get inspiration for that? I think it's, you have to be what I would call a professional, and this is a, I've gotten this from Steven Pressfield who wrote the war of art, which is a great book. And I'm also got it from reading Stephen King on writing and talking to a lot of different writers about how they handle things, right?

Speaker 1:          03:23          If you just waited to be inspired, and that's the only time you wrote, you wouldn't have half as much shit. Right? Not even close Britain, not even close. Half as much good material as you do if you decide I'm going to write. So I sit down and I write and sometimes I don't know what the fuck to write about. And I just started writing. I just started rambling. Right? And a lot of the, like the first 20 minutes might be total horse shit that doesn't get me anywhere. But then I got an idea. What about that? Well, why the fuck do we do that? And then I'll start writing about that. Well, this and that will make things up. I'll make up a fact and then I'll argue against that fact. Right? And then maybe I'll find out what the real fact is and see if I can argue that way. And then I'll, I'll, I'll, and then I'll, and I'll give up. I'll get to like 1700 words, something like that. I'll shut the laptop.
