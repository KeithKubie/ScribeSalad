00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.840
Time for a question for you. In this question

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.910
I'm asking you, to give a couple of examples, of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.220
how downloading code, mechanism may be used by a library

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.160
operating system. I already, explained to you the concept of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.500
this mechanism. The concept of this mechanism is of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.340
course the fact that a library operating system can say

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.630
well here there's a piece of code. That I want

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.270
you to run on my behalf, and present it to

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.580
exokernel, so that it is now part of exokernel. Sort of increasing the code

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.500
base of exokernel by the downloaded code

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.820
on behalf of that particular guest operating system.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.580
So this question is asking you to give a couple of examples. Of how

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.110
you envision a library operating system may

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.200
use this core downloading facility, provided by Exokernel.
