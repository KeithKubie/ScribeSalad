around with my wife and repeatedly said

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
around with my wife and repeatedly said
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.470

now there's celebrations all over the
 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.600
now there's celebrations all over the
country yeah people always joke that the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610
country yeah people always joke that the
 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.270

were moving from MIT and who were very
 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.140
were moving from MIT and who were very
concerned about their opportunity to

letter of offer I assured them that they
 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.800
letter of offer I assured them that they
not only could pay for parking but if

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810
not only could pay for parking but if
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.449

I am a they claim that that was really

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830
I am a they claim that that was really
 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.830
I am a they claim that that was really
the deeply the the part of the contract

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
the deeply the the part of the contract
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.070
the deeply the the part of the contract
that really filled the deal for them

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
that really filled the deal for them
 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.750
that really filled the deal for them
some unusually it's an unusual incentive

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760
some unusually it's an unusual incentive

to work hard you are credited with doing
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.089
to work hard you are credited with doing
the initial work that took our

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099
the initial work that took our
 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.460
the initial work that took our
understanding of vesicle traffic from a

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470
understanding of vesicle traffic from a

purely descriptive to the beginnings of
 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.430
purely descriptive to the beginnings of
a mechanistic understanding and that

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440
a mechanistic understanding and that
 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.220
a mechanistic understanding and that
understanding has taken a lot of time to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
understanding has taken a lot of time to
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.410
understanding has taken a lot of time to
achieve yeah so um yes well the I think

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420
achieve yeah so um yes well the I think
 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.880

field of cell biology by developing the
 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.369
field of cell biology by developing the
techniques of electron microscopy to

and and it was his genius to realize to
 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.880
and and it was his genius to realize to
appreciate how proteins that are going

in a kind of an assembly line process
 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.150
in a kind of an assembly line process
inside the cell and when I began my

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160
inside the cell and when I began my
 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.089
inside the cell and when I began my
laboratory in 1976 in is really around

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099
laboratory in 1976 in is really around

the same time when Jim Rossum began his

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019
the same time when Jim Rossum began his
 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.940
the same time when Jim Rossum began his
laboratory at Stanford we conceived of

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950
laboratory at Stanford we conceived of
 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.270
laboratory at Stanford we conceived of
two very different approaches to try to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280
two very different approaches to try to
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.580
two very different approaches to try to
identify the machinery responsible for

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590
identify the machinery responsible for
 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.509
identify the machinery responsible for
for this mechanism and I used a

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519
for this mechanism and I used a
 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.309
for this mechanism and I used a
technique of classical genetics to make

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319
technique of classical genetics to make
 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.520
technique of classical genetics to make
mutations in cells that define the

mutations in cells that define the
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.240
mutations in cells that define the
pathway and Crossman used a very

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250
pathway and Crossman used a very
 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.390
pathway and Crossman used a very
complementary biochemical process to

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
complementary biochemical process to
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759
complementary biochemical process to
reconstitute the pathway in vitro and

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769
reconstitute the pathway in vitro and
 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.460
reconstitute the pathway in vitro and

notes sometimes collaboratively
 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.050

sometimes competitively it became clear

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060
sometimes competitively it became clear
 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.789

though that he and I were working on

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
though that he and I were working on
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.550
though that he and I were working on
many of the same proteins that's in many

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560
many of the same proteins that's in many
 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.400
many of the same proteins that's in many
of the same genes and proteins and so

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410
of the same genes and proteins and so
 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.949
of the same genes and proteins and so
that that synthesis between the two sets

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959
that that synthesis between the two sets
 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.900
that that synthesis between the two sets
really convinced us that we were on the

really convinced us that we were on the
 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.909
really convinced us that we were on the
