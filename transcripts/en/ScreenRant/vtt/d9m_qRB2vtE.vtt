00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.430
A film’s plot is typically what makes or
breaks it, and audiences need to be entertained

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.820
or captivated by the basic story if it’s
to find success.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.880
But sometimes there’s more going on than
what’s at face value.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.950
Directors have long incorporated subtext into
their narratives to give movies an extra layer

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.460
to consider.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.010

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.010
any!

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.850
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Secret Meanings
Of Popular Films.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.070
The Dark Knight

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.190
When faced by the Joker’s relentless attacks
on Gotham, Bruce Wayne sees what he must become

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.350
to stop villains like him and pulls out all
the stops.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
The film’s climax is fueled by Batman’s
ability to monitor every cell phone in the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490
city so he can track the Joker’s location.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.969
Some audience members may have been thinking
about the Patriot Act, which allows the US

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.360
government to search a person’s home and
records without consent to combat terrorism.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.149
Some viewers have compared the film to George
W. Bush’s war on terror, as the former US

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.770
president took morally ambiguous means of
his own to fight the nation’s greatest threats.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.770
Toy Story 3

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.470
Pixar’s emotional conclusion to their flagship
franchise could be more than a tale about

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.470
growing up.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.180
Some see it as an allegory for the Holocaust,
with the toys representing the Jewish people

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.910
left behind at the start of WWII.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.149
They go to the “concentration camp” of
Sunnyside Daycare and even end up on a path

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.140
to an incinerator due to the abuse of Sunnyside’s
overlords.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.610
They’re eventually saved and find safe haven
in a new place where many of their kind already

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.820
live: Bonnie’s house.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.170
It’s a tad dark for a family film, but the
parallels certainly are there.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.170
X-Men

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.480
The X-Men films have always dealt with rights
issues, but here’s one you may have not

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480
considered.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.790
As mutant kind fights for their acceptance
in society, it’s easy to see how it relates

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.110
to the gay rights movement.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.610
This point is put front and center in X2,
when Bobby Drake essentially “comes out

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.500
of the closet” and confesses his true nature
to his family, who immediately rejects him.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.560
The angle arguably strengthens the series,
since it grounds the characters in a contemporary

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
real world struggle and makes them relatable
to audience members.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.989
It’s inspiring to see people who are mutant
and proud.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:09.989
The Lego Movie

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.800
Mocked upon its announcement, The LEGO Movie
turned heads and became one of 2014’s best

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.950
when it was released.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.460
Many made note of the film’s deeper themes,
which poked fun at the idea of commercialism

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.720
vs. individualism.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.210
Instead of being another faceless, regular
construction worker who follows the instructions

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.380
of his daily routine, Emmitt has to save the
world by thinking for himself and forming

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.030
his own ideas of what’s awesome.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.080
His actions end up inspiring everyone around
him, even villain President Business.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.950
It’s a great message for youngsters in the
audience, and gives adults substantial food

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.370
for thought as well.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.370
E.T.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
– The Extra Terrestrial

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.490
Spielberg showed with the Indiana Jones franchise
he’s not afraid to tackle religious elements,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.670
and E.T. seems to feature those head on.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.370
The Jewish director joked that it’s not
a Christian parable, but there are a lot of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.330
parallels between ET and Jesus.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.620
ET is “crucified” by scientists who don’t
understand him and is resurrected by Elliot’s

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.620
love.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.070
Universal even made a poster that was reminiscent
of the Creation of Adam painting to make the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.010
film appeal to Christian audiences.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.850
Spielberg can claim that he never intended
the film to be viewed this way, but he provided

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.270
more than enough triggers.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.270
The Matrix

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.280
The Matrix films are no stranger to philosophy,
and the influence could extend to Plato’s

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
cave.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.290
That idea explores the notion of prisoners
in a cave whose only knowledge of the outside

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.760
world are shadows they see on the walls.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.400
When they break free from their bonds, they
learn that what they perceived to be reality

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.410
is merely an illusion and there’s a whole
new world to explore.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.030
One look at Neo’s character arc, it’s
easy to see how this comparison can be made.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.709
Once the hero is unplugged, he learns the
truth about society and the elaborate hoax

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.850
the machines have played on us.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.990
Groundhog Day

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.610
When weatherman Phil Connors is stuck in an
endless time loop during Groundhog Day in

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.820
Punxsutawney, his only way out is to change
his ways and become a more selfless individual.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.630
Some have said that the film is an allegory
for the religious path to enlightenment and

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.270
learning to appreciate the things around you.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.260
In this interpretation, the time loop represents
the state of purgatory, and one can escape

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.680
only when they’ve proven their worth to
a higher power.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.140
Since we never learn the origin of the time
loop, this theory is as good as any for how

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.830
Phil got this way.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.830
Aliens

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.550
The tagline for James Cameron’s beloved
sequel was “This time, it’s war,” and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.160
the director may have meant more than humans
against xenomorphs.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Many, including Cameron, claim that Aliens
can operate as an allegory to the Vietnam

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
War.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.600
Featuring a technologically advanced military
force that underestimates the capabilities

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.100
of the indigenous species on a mission with
questionable motives, it’s easy to see how

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.560
one can draw that comparison.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.150
The space marines in the film even have a
gung-ho attitude that’s similar to conservative

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.350
America during the Vietnam War and think they’re
unstoppable, so there might be more here than

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.840
meets the eye.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840
Spider-Man

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.850
One of the most relatable superheroes, Spider-Man
has always been shown trying to overcome basic

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.320
problems that people face in their normal
lives.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.950
In Sam Raimi’s original film, Peter Parker’s
evolution into the web slinger is seen as

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.460
a metaphor for puberty.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:59.840
Socially awkward and going through some rough
physical changes, Peter learns how to adapt

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.460
and use his newfound abilities to better himself
and society.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.550
He comes into his own and fully matures by
the film’s end, becoming the do-gooder we

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.900
all know and love.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.090
With great power comes great responsibility,
and accepting those responsibilities is a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.400
key step in growing up.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.690
Who Framed Roger Rabbit

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.990
Robert Zemeckis’ technical marvel is more
than a world where humans and cartoons interact.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.910
Some critics have claimed that the setting
is similar to segregated America, as the ‘toons

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.580
live in their own town that’s separated
from the human world.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.500
The main plot could be derived from gentrification,
as Judge Doom looks to force the cartoons

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.400
out of their homes to build a freeway for
the wealthy class.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.450
Finally, the cartoons are mostly seen as performers,
which was one of the accepted professions

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.040
for minorities at the time.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.630
That adds a lot of intriguing context for
what should be a zany family adventure.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:51.980
Those are our picks for hidden meanings in
popular movies.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.730
Are there any we missed?
