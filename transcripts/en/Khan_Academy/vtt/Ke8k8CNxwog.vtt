00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.390
We were able to already answer
some interesting questions

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.580
about the different plans
at the Super Yoga Studio,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.490
using the equations we set up.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.180
But I'm a very visual
guy, and I want

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.820
to make sure that I
analyze the problem fully

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.790
before I spend my
hard earned dollars.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.870
And what I want to
do now is really

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.220
see a visual representation for
the relationship between how

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.400
many sessions I attend, and
how much it's going to cost me.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.360
And I'm going to do it for the
trial plan and the basic plan.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.310
And to do that, down here
on the horizontal axis,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.120
I'm going to plot the number
of sessions that I attend.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.850
So s, that is equal to
the number of sessions

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.320
I attend per month.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.830
And then here on
the vertical axis

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.840
I'm going to plot how much
it's going to cost me,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.070
depending on how many
sessions I attend.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.197
So c is equal to
my monthly cost.

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:52.280
So let's think about these
points right over here.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.613
And then even also think about
how this equation relates

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:56.890
to what we might end up drawing.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.910
So the first point here is
that if I go to no sessions,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.350
it's going to cost me $0.00.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.060
So where would I plot
that right over here?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.630
Well, if I attend no sessions,
and I should have marked off

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.790
a 0 right over here, it's
going to cost me $0.00.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.430
So it's this point,
just like that.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.760
Now let's think about
if I attend one session.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.200
If I attend one session,
it'll be $12.00.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.580
Where would I plot that?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.740
Well, one session is
going to cost me $12.00,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.580
see this is $15.00, so $12.00 is
going to be right around there.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.660
So I'll put it right over there.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.710
And if I attend two sessions,
where would I plot that?

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.550
Well, two sessions are
going to cost me $24.00,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.630
so we get the right about there.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.242
And then what about
three sessions?

00:01:51.242 --> 00:01:53.700
And I could keep going four,
five, six, on, and on, and on.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.074
But let's just
try three, I think

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:57.960
you'll get the general idea.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.617
Three sessions cost $36.00.

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:06.075
And you see that all of these
points seem to sit on a line.

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:10.300
And I can attempt, I'll attempt
my best, to draw that line.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.950
And this line
essentially describes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.100
all of the possible
combinations of cost

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.417
for a given number of sessions.

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.000
So any point here,
especially if we're

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.600
assuming that we allow
fractional sessions.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.370
That's not conventional
practice for most yoga studios,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.870
but this one is a
super yoga studio,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.030
so it allows you to attend four
and one half sessions, or one

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.750
and one half sessions, or
exactly half a session.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.720
So if you attend half a session
it's going to cost you $6.00

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.870
Another way to think about it
is if you attend zero sessions

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.180
it'll be $0.00, but then
as you add a session,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.790
so you go to the right one step,
it's going to cost you $12.00

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.440
more.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.810
So then you're going
to go up $12.00.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.320
So we went to the right
one, we went up 12.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.569
If we go to the right one again,
we're going to go up 12 again.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.110
Because every session
we add is going

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.680
to cost us 12 extra dollars.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.270
We go from 0 to 12 to 24.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.170
If you add another session
you go up 12 again.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.486
If you take away a
session, you'll go down 12.

00:03:09.486 --> 00:03:11.110
And so it's a kind
of a way of thinking

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.720
about how steep this line is.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.790
Every time you go one to the
right, you're going 12 up.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.530
Now let's think about the
same thing for the basic plan,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.080
how we might actually plot that.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.460
So I'll start with this
point right over here.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.570
And the basic plan, when I go
to zero sessions it costs me

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.410
$20.00.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.560
Where would I plot
that on my graph?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.750
So zero sessions are
going to cost me $20.00.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.870
That's that point
right over there.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.700
What about one session.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.850
Well, one session is
going to cost me $28.00.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.210
And another way to think about
it, you pay 20 no matter what,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.730
and as you add one session,
your total cost went up by 8.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.360
This scale and this
scale is not the same.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.010
If I did it to
scale, then you would

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.870
see these lines would
look a lot steeper,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.370
and I would have to make this
axis go a lot, lot taller.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.700
But hopefully you get the idea.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.966
You add one session,
we went up by 8.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:14.140
You add another
session, so that was

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.670
128, that's that point
right over there.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.560
So if you have two sessions,
it's going to cost us $36.00.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.160
Where would we plot that?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.970
Two sessions are
going to cost $36.00.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.510
So that is right over there.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.280
Or another way to think of it.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.390
We were at 28, we
added another session,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.940
so we're going to
add $8 to our cost.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.040
So 28 plus 8 gets us to $36.00

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.851
Now let's do this other point
once again, we can keep going.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.475
Where would we plot
the three sessions.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.710
So if we attend three sessions,
it's going to cost us $44.00.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.800
So that's right about there.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.220
Once again, we added the session
and we added $8.00 to our cost.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.850
And you see these two
seem to sit on a line.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.680
Although I didn't draw
it as well as I can,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.950
so these two seem
to sit on a line.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.110
Now this by itself
is interesting.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.190
But what might be
even more interesting

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.410
is where these two
lines intersect.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.570
We see that they have different
steepnesses, so at some point

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.149
they should intersect.

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:30.065
And what's exciting
about, well, actually I'll

00:05:30.065 --> 00:05:31.023
let you think about it.

00:05:31.023 --> 00:05:34.750
What is exciting about where
these two lines intersect?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.520
What does it tell us
about the sessions,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.572
and the cost at those points?

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:42.030
And I'll leave you
there, and we'll

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.090
explore this more
in the next video.
