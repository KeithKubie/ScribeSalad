00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.560
People tell me I’m slow.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.310
Yeah well, you’re slow.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.390
Everybody’s slow.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.820
We’re all slow.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.630
Yaaaaay!

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.110
If you’ve ever raced a cheetah and you’re
not named Usain Bolt, you probably lost.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.370
Or heck if you even tried racing against your
cat, I bet you still lost.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.660
From horses, to dogs, to birds, it seems the
entire animal kingdom is faster and stronger

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.840
than we are.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.840
Why?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.349
Well we evolved to fit into our own ecological
niche.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.870
But even compared to our nearest relatives,
the chimpanzee and bonobos, we are considerably

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.870
weaker.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.039
We weren’t always this way.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.011
According to Dan Lieberman, a biological anthropologist
at Harvard University, our “chimp-like ancestor

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:49.609
was like a power athlete that was much stronger
and faster than humans, but they had no endurance."

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.559
But we traded our brawn for bigger brains
and the ability to outrun our prey in a long

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.719
distance hunt.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.789
When our ancestors evolved from being mostly
tree dwellers to savannah walkers, they probably

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.250
traded strength and speed for endurance.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.979
This is creatively called the endurance hypothesis.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.860
Some researchers believe that humans evolved
a unique predatory style.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.110
Rather than a fast and furious chase, like
a cheetah or Vin Diesel, humans take the slow

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.899
and steady, wear-down-your-prey-till-it-collapses-from-exhaustion
kind of action.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.460
And this takes very specific types of muscles.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.979
By comparison, cheetahs have muscles that
are tailored to reacting quickly so they can

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.600
reach top speed of around 70 miles per hour.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.189
But the tradeoff is they get exhausted quickly,
they have no endurance.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.079
While we can never run that fast, we can run
for a long time, maybe longer than any other

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.079
animal.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.649
Sure less exciting than a high speed chase,
but incredibly effective.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.520
But you’re also slow because you’re weak!

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.469
Don’t feel bad, we all are, comparatively
speaking.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.570
One of our closest relatives, the chimpanzee
is about twice as strong as a human.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.969
Because they’re arboreal and spend most
of their time in trees, most of their strength

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.899
is concentrated in their arms.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.640
Our ancestors probably had similar muscle
strength to a chimpanzee around six million

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.590
years ago according to a study published in
PLOS One.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
The researchers found that in the few million
years since, human beings evolved dramatically.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.399
Our brains got bigger, specifically in our
prefrontal cortex, the part that deals with

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.860
long term goal planning.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.600
They found that the prefrontal cortex was
RADICALLY different in humans from that in

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.730
chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.040
It seemed to have evolved 4 times faster than
the other parts of the body.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.660
And that’s because in part, humans started
to evolve social structures that allowed us

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.010
to, say, work together as a team to take down
bigger prey.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.970
But there is a downside to a bigger brain.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.530
A bigger brain consumes more energy.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.640
Our brains consume 20% of the energy we use,
which is a lot compared to other animals.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.100
So where did the energy come from?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.300
Maybe from our muscles.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.190
The researchers also found our ancestor’s
MUSCLES changed rapidly too.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.450
Very rapidly, about 8 times faster than the
rest of our body.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.550
So researchers believe that to deal with the
energy demands of a bigger brain, our ancestors

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.970
evolved smaller muscles to compensate.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.650
But more research is needed.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.340
You may think this contradicts the Darwinian
principle of “survival of the fittest,”

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.320
but “fit” in this context doesn’t mean
physical fitness.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.270
It means an organism fits in a niche long
enough to reproduce, so the genetic lineage

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.450
survives.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.480
And it’s not that being a smart wimp is
always better than being a big dumb ox or

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.920
vice versa, it’s a matter of what’s most
beneficial for an organism based on its environment

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.140
and competition.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.260
If coming down from the trees and learning
to make fire means one day your offspring

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.010
will populate the globe, it’s probably worth
giving up looking like a species of Mr. Universes.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.010
That’s evolution.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.280

So you can’t outrun a cheetah but you can

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.790
definitely out-walk it.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:44.200
Julia covers the endurance hypothesis in more
detail here.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.650
If you had the option to be ripped but also
couldn’t form basic sentences, would you

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.650
take it?
