00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.900
Problem three.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.930
Let f of x is equal
to e to the 2x.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.750
Let R be the region in
the first quadrant bounded

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.600
by the graph of f,
the coordinate axes,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.780
and the vertical
line, x is equal to k.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.290
So they drew that
right over here.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.160
And it's in the figure
above in the actual AP exam.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.860
But I put it below
here so I didn't

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.080
have to waste the screen
real estate above that.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.090
And you see right here,
this is our f of x,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.110
this is the line
x is equal to k,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.590
and this region R
is between those,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.960
and it's in the first
quadrant right over here.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.010
So this right over
here is our region R.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.960
So what are they
asking us to do?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.610
So k is greater
than 0, the region R

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.790
shown the figure above.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.030
And this is the figure.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.260
Part a.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.420
Write, but do not evaluate
an expression involving

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.620
an integral that gives the
perimeter of R in terms of k.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.208
So for the perimeter
of R, we're going

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.083
to have to find the
length of the sides of R,

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:57.000
and the hardest of
these is to find

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.610
the length of the actual
curve between this point

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.200
and this point right over here.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.505
And I like to always rederive
the arc length formula,

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.380
although if you're about
to take the AP exam,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050
it probably doesn't hurt
to have it memorized just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.210
so you could save some time.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.668
But you should
always know how it's

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:16.557
derived so that when
you're 35 years old

00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:18.640
and you don't have a
calculus book as a reference,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.015
you can come up
with it yourself.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:22.570
And so you know where
the formula comes from.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.690
So let's rederive it.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.090
So let's say we were to zoom
in on a little bit of the curve

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.860
right over there.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.510
So let's say let's zoom in
on that part of the curve

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.900
right over there.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.770
And what we could do is,
same way we derived an arc

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.260
length when the function
was defined parametrically,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.061
which we did, I think, in
part one of this AP exam.

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:48.810
This time it's not
defined parametrically,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.120
so we can do it in
terms of just x and y.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.340
So if you viewed this
distance right over here,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.140
this is going to be a
very small change in x.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.960
Let's call that dx.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.740
And then this right
over here is going

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.840
to be a very small
change in y, dy.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.330
And we know that dy, the
derivative of y with respect

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.260
to x, or dy/dx, this is
equal to f prime of x.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.290
Or we could say that if we
multiply both sides by dx,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.050
we know that dy is equal
to f prime of x dx.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.170
So this is equal
to f prime of x dx.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.080
And then for a very small change
in x and very small change

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.100
in y, we can approximate
this curve length

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.400
with the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.320
And if we get small enough,
it'll probably directly

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.060
kind of measure
that curve length.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.170
So we use the Pythagorean
theorem right here.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.110
This length is going to be
the square root of dx squared

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.310
plus dy squared.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.364
And if we write dy this
way, that arc length

00:02:50.364 --> 00:02:52.280
right over here, this
little small arc length,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.710
is going to be equal
to, right over here,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.890
the square root of dx squared
plus-- this is dy-- so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.090
plus f prime of x
squared times dx squared.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.200
All I did is I squared
this. dy squared

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.090
is this thing right over here.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.330
And let me expand the
radical sign a little bit.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.030
And just the same
exact way we did it

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.050
when we had the function
defined parametrically,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.150
we can factor out
a dx squared here.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.850
So this is going to be equal
to the square root of-- if you

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.030
factor out a dx squared
of this, you get a 1.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.030
You factor out a dx
squared out of this part,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.535
plus f prime of x squared.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:40.820
And we factor a dx squared
out of the radical sign,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.640
it just becomes a dx.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.224
And so that would be the length
of this little small arc here,

00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:47.598
and it wouldn't
even be this big.

00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:49.630
It would be a super
infinitesimally small piece

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.130
of arc.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.530
We could call it d
arc right over there.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.440
And essentially want to sum up
all of these little segments.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.350
So we want to sum them up from x
is equal to 0, all the way to x

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.070
is equal to k, because we're
integrating with respect to x

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.230
right over here.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.660
So this arc length
right over here-- so

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.130
let me write what they
want us to figure out;

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.850
we're trying to figure
out the perimeter of R--

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.870
is equal to first, this part.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.670
So this is the integral
from 0 to k. x is equal to 0

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.880
to x is equal to k of the
square root of 1 plus--

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.405
and f prime of x.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.500
f of x is e to the 2x.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.660
So f prime of x is equal to the
derivative of this with respect

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.360
to x, which is 2e to the 2x.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.990
The derivative of 2x is 2.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.870
Derivative of e to the 2x with
respect to 2x is e to the 2x.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.800
So 2e to the 2x, we
want to square that,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.400
because this is f
prime of x, but we

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.600
want to square f prime of x.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.650
So that's 4e to the 4x.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.140
And of course, we have a dx.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.400
So this is the length of the
arc, and that's the hard part.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.820
And now we just have to get
the rest of the perimeter.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.990
So you have this little
segment right over here.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.890
That's length 1.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.370
We're going from
1 to 0 or 0 to 1.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.720
So plus 1.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.750
Then you have this part
right along the x-axis.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.360
Well, that's going
to be of length k.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.480
Plus k.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.840
And then finally, you have
this height right over here.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.420
And that's going to be of length
of f of k, or e to the 2k.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.790
Plus e to the 2k.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.510
And we're done.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.700
We found the perimeter of R, and
we don't have to evaluate it.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.300
So we're done with this part.
