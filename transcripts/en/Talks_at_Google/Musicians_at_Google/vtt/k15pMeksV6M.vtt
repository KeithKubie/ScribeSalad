00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:15.934
&gt;&gt; Hey, guys. I just like to
welcome all of you, first of all,

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:19.900
at the start of the
At Google series in 2010.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.967
This is the very first Musicians
at Google we've had.

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:29.800
So if you'd like to go to
go /Google Dublin.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.633
Put in your ideas.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:33.967
We can start contacting people.
Hopefully we'll get people in.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.400
Before we start, I just want
to give a special thanks to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.266
both the admin and facilities
team for helping us out.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.800
I don't think this place would
run without them.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.500
And then, the last thing is, if you'd
like to check underneath your seats,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.133
some of you might have been
lucky to find one of [laughter]

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.667
[audience rustling sounds]

00:00:55.667 --> 00:01:01.667
So you can get them
signed and stuff after the gig.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.767
So, without further ado, I'd like
to introduce, first of all,

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:10.066
our very own Kevin Redmond,
who's going to give a quick Q and A.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.600
And Miss Gemma Hayes.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.233
[Applause and cheering]

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.633
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can everyone
hear me all right?

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.600
We're just going to do
a really short Q and A,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.734
because we're running a little overtime.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.300
I just want to introduce Gemma
for anyone who doesn't know.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.433
Gemma is one of Ireland's
most popular

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:34.533
and critically-acclaimed
singer/songwriters.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.734
She's -- since releasing her debut album,
"Night On My Side," in 2002,

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.633
which was nominated for
the American Music Prize.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.700
She's also released "The Hollow of
Morning" and "Rose, I love you."

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.066
Both take equal critical acclaim.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.233
Gemma: Shucks.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.533
&gt;&gt; Her -- We just embarrass you
for ten minutes.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:55.000
Her songs have been used in smash hit
shows such as Grey's Anatomy and ER,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.900
as well as numerous feature films.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.400
She's won countless awards.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.467
And it's without doubt one of Ireland's
most captivating live performances.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.867
We're also extremely lucky

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:08.900
that we have the equally wonderful Ann
Scott over here in the corner who --

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.133
for anyone who doesn't know --
Ann's debut album I think was voted

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.633
one of the best Irish albums
of all time by HotPress.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.600
So give a round of applause
for Ann Scott.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.600
[Applause]

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.133
&gt;&gt; So, a good place to start
would be where you start.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:30.000
You grew up in Canterbury, in the west
of Ireland, with a very big family.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.233
Gemma: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.100
&gt;&gt; How -- that surely must
have had some influence on

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.767
you even getting into music or the
kind of music you immerse yourself in.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:38.600
Gemma: Absolutely.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.767
I just have to say one thing
really, really quickly --

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:44.500
that was such a Gay Byrne moment
where you had your CDs under the chair.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.200
[Laughter]

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.266
Gemma: It was really impressive.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:50.200
[chuckling]

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.734
But yeah, no, I had
lots of sisters and brothers.

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:56.333
And my father was in a band
called "the Hill Billies."

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:59.133
And I was really embarrassed
by him for years,

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:02.133
because he used to play the keyboards.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:06.600
But what he used to do is, he used
to just program all the beats in.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.800
And this was like way back,
you know, in the '70s.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.333
&gt;&gt; Like bass entertainers?

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:13.667
Gemma: [laughing]

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:18.200
So he'd go to a pub, and he'd just sit
there and drink pints and press play.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.100
[laughter]

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.233
And he used to say
he was a musician.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:26.667
So, I realize now that there's
like an art to that, sort of.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.166
&gt;&gt; Then you came up to
Dublin to go to college.

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:33.233
On your trip up, did you have any
inclination that you'd go into music, or?

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.500
Was that on your horizons
or ambitions?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.567
Gemma: Um, I mean, I loved --
I absolutely loved music

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:40.567
and I had sort of no idea.

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.967
I mean, you know,
when you live in a small town.

00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:48.433
I had no idea how crazy sort of
city life would be and whatever.

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:53.900
But when I went up to Dublin,
I moved into like a place in UCD.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.200
And my flatmate had a guitar,
and she showed me a few chords.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.567
So, I ended up just missing
loads of lectures

00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:05.867
and staying in and writing songs
and then just realized that

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:10.500
there's nothing else that kind of
meant anything to me, you know.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.100
&gt;&gt; So if we started off in that
kind of 'open mic' sort of session

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.567
you know with guys like Pike Casey
and those kind of guys.

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:23.333
But one of the things I often think about your
albums is that there's a real juxtaposition

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:27.100
between kind of that singer/songwriter
kind of-- hate that term -- but like,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.400
you know, that acoustic guitar kind of style
and then this My Bloody Valentiny --

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.000
almost violence --
kind of thing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.467
Is that a conscious thing?

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:38.367
Is that like, sort of something
that you think about music.

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:42.433
This is the kind of esthetic that you want to
create, or is it like a subconscious way

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:46.600
that you almost try to remove yourself
from the singer/songwriter pack?

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:51.533
Gemma: I mean, I definitely wouldn't
sort of change my music

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:54.166
just to kind of stay away
from a certain kind of scene.

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:58.033
Like, I love acoustic music.
I love it.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:01.100
But sometimes, it just bores
the hell out of me. It really does.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.100
I mean, I can enjoy acoustic music,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.266
but then, I just start to
get tired of hearing myself.

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:08.967
And I just love when things
are bigger than me.

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:12.934
You know, and like the first time I heard
"Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine,

00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:16.266
I loved the fact that --
even like Ziggurats as well.

00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:18.266
I have no idea what they're singing about.

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:22.166
But I understand completely --
they don't -- exactly.

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:23.233
But it just makes sense.

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:28.000
And it's so much more than just the kind
of rigid structure of verse/chorus,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.767
verse/chorus, you know.

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:31.734
&gt;&gt; How does the creative
process work for you?

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:35.767
I mean like, someone like Nick Cave
sits down and does office hours.

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.233
He goes into his office at nine.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:39.233
He works till six on his own.

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:40.600
Do you like sit down and work at a song?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.367
Or do you just kind of --

00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:45.500
are you just sitting on the couch
at home pottering away and just?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.734
Gemma: Do you know -- I haven't figured
out like the formula that works every time.

00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:56.333
So, I mean, I love when a song
comes out through inspiration,

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:57.700
but it's rare, you know.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.533
You kind of have to be in
an active mode of working,

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:03.100
and then, that inspiration comes out.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.300
You can't be inactive and hoping
that inspiration hits you.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.367
Your mind has to be thinking lyrics and
thinking all these things -- melodies.

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.433
And then, you'll find a really special song.

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:16.867
But I mean, nine times out of ten,
you just kind of have to work.

00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:18.667
And did somebody said to me --

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:22.633
I don't know -- you probably heard of this
guy around Devon called BP Fallon.

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:24.367
Wonderful guy.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:27.333
And he came over to me only recently.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:31.900
And he said -- he goes, "You'd want to be
very careful about what you sing about."

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.767
And I was like, "Well, why?"

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:36.667
And he was like, "Because every time you
get up on stage and you really go for it

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.133
and you really sing about something,

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:42.734
you're actually kind of willing it to
happen if it hasn't happened already."

00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:44.233
So I was thinking like,

00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:47.433
"Oh, man. I've sung about
like a guy drinking weedkiller.

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:51.700
I've sung about so many things
that actually haven't happened."

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.000
So I'm trying to now turn that around
and sing about really positive things.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.900
&gt;&gt; All right.
Fair enough.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.300
Gemma: Don't know how I
got to talking about that.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.834
&gt;&gt; We get it. Who knows
who's going to go there.

00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:05.834
We're in an internet company,
so I have to ask you.

00:07:05.834 --> 00:07:11.166
I mean, you've got like a Twitter
and you've got a MySpace page blog.

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.266
Your Facebook page.

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:16.066
Is that like -- do you look at it
kind of as a way of promotion now?

00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:19.867
Or is it like more to keep in
touch with your fan base?

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:21.333
Or is it just a combination of both?

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:24.500
I mean, is it something you
take an active kind of role in?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.367
Or would it be more your
marketing side of things?

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:30.033
Gemma: I'm getting to grips
with it more and more.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:33.000
I mean, I have to be sort
of dragged by the hair

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.300
to Twitter and Facebook
and all those things.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.033
Because I'm just not
very computer savvy.

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:39.767
Please God,
I'll make this work today --

00:07:39.767 --> 00:07:44.000
but, so you know a friend
sort of started it up for me,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.300
and then, would constantly kind of,
"C'mon Gemmy, you have to do this.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.433
It's not like the old days.

00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:55.000
You don't go around in a van and try
to reach people person by person.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.967
This is the new way."

00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:57.633
So, I'm getting there.

00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:02.867
But, I have to say, it's very weird
sort of writing stuff to people

00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:04.200
that you've never met.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.834
And for it to be natural
and normal, you know?

00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:13.367
Because it's not normal.
[laughter]

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:16.533
So I haven't found that sort of --

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:18.433
because I look at other people's
Twitter pages, and I'm like,

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:20.767
"Oh, they're so witty and they're so--"

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.033
But yeah.

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:25.433
&gt;&gt; Just -- last question.

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:27.033
This isn't the first time someone
from Google's interviewed you.

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:29.734
You did an interview with two Googlers
who have an excellent website

00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:31.667
called "onemoretune.ie,"

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.266
which is really good.

00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:37.066
You mentioned you were doing a piano
album or plan to do a piano album.

00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:39.066
Is that still in the offing or?

00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:41.166
Gemma: Oh, no.

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.100
&gt;&gt; No?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.467
Gemma: Well, it was. And then,
well, see -- I don't have a piano.

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:49.934
[laughter]

00:08:49.934 --> 00:08:52.300
So I was sort of using
somebody else's piano.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.700
&gt;&gt; There's one under your chair
by the way. It's your prize.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.400
Gemma: Oh, God.
Wouldn't that be great?

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.400
But when I was in L.A. --
I lived in L.A. for the past few years,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.100
and I had a piano over there.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.567
And then, I moved back over here a few
months ago, and I don't have a piano.

00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:09.000
So, I had to kind of put that on hold.
But it's definitely sort of in the pipeline.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.433
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool. Okay.
I recommend we get cracking.

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:15.567
Could I just ask everyone, by the way,
turn off the mobile phones

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:17.467
before we get cracking.

00:09:17.467 --> 00:09:19.867
And I leave it to Gemma Hayes
and Ann Scott.

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:21.266
Gemma: Thank you.
Thank you.

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:26.900
[Applause]

there was a guy in school
that I beat up, basically.

I was just full of rage.

I threw him on the ground.

school books into a puddle.

the consequences of that or the fact

00:29:36.266 --> 00:29:38.500
he got up in the middle of the class,
and he came over,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.000
