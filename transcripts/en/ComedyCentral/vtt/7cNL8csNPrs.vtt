00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.069
There's a new bar
in Washington D.C.

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:05.838
themed after a very special
old friend.

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.774
(with accent):
It's-a me, Mario,

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.342
and I'm a alcoholic-a.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.344
ALL:
Hi, Mario.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.780
-Oh, uh, thank you.
Uh, thank you. -(laughter)

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.983
Uh, Mockingbird Hill is
celebrating cherry blossom

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.951
season in the most logical way
possible--

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.753
by turning itself
into a pop-up bar

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:24.090
about a pixelated
Italian plumber.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.560
(upbeat tune plays
with video game sounds)

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.298
(music playing with video game
sounds, lively chatter)

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.170
(laughter, applause)

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.405
That bartender's like,
"I finally have a reason

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.140
"for this dumb hipster mustache.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.809
-Finally!"
-(laughter)

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:47.547
"And I'm glad I bought
all those Shake Weights."

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.981
-(laughter)
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.584
The bar is open until April 15,
and you can get all sorts

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.519
of Mario-themed stuff in there,
like a drink called

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.922
"What Doesn't Kill You
Makes You Smaller."

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.223
And you can usually
buy some mushrooms

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.825
-from a guy in the bathroom.
-(laughter)

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.760
There is even seating reserved
for King Koopa,

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.562
but Steve Bannon likes
to sit there

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.230
'cause it's close
to the women's bathroom.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.399
-(laughter and groaning)
-Comedians, I want you

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:09.035
to tell the bartender
your problems at the Mario bar.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.636
-Dan.
-(bleep) this.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.705
I'm gonna go to the PAC-MAN bar

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.374
and drink
until my ghosts catch up to me.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.243
-(laughter) -HARDWICK: Yes.
Points. Very good.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.612
-(applause and cheering)
-Very good on that one. Jenna.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.481
This must be a Mario bar

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.283
because I'm getting
 super smashed, brother.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.119
HARDWICK: Yeah, points.
Really good.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.487
(applause and cheering)

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.224
Very... very impressive. Steve.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.825
(imitating Mario): You would-a
drink like this, too,

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.895
if your evil cousin Wario
was a-(bleep) your wife.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.263
-HARDWICK: Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.764
-(bleep). -Points.
-(applause)

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.933
 Principessa.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:44.770
What-a Luigi?
He tape-a the whole thing.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.672
He got a good eye-a

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:48.307
-for the camera. -HARDWICK:
The whole thing, while a gorilla

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.542
jerk off on a ladder.

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:51.043
Why he-a do this to me, eh?

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:54.380
-(applause)
-Why you do this to me?

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:58.317
It's less creepy if it's in
an offensive Italian voice.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.685
-HARDWICK: It's way less creepy.
-It's like...

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.220
(like Mario): "Oh, I want-a
hear you breathe." You know?

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:02.722
HARDWICK (like Mario):
I want to hear you breathe. Eh.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.056
(laughter)

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.026
Somebody flip-a that turtle
on its-a feet.

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:11.964
I can see right up into the...
All right.

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:13.933
ST. GERMAIN:
You...

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:17.470
You pick-a the wrong rest stop
to go into.

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:20.840
You don't see your friends
and family forever now.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.909
I thought this-a glory hole
was a world warp.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.677
I didn't-a know.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.047
I thought it was taking me to...

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.213
How would I know?
