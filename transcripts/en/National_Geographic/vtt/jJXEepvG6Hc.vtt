00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.967
People in developed
countries often take it

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:05.934
for granted that they can eat
whatever delicacy they want

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.800
from anywhere in the world.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.467
But there are some who fear
that this globalization of food

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:14.400
is putting all of us at
risk, and they are now going

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.266
back to living off the land.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.166
Here's correspondent
JJ Kelley in Hawaii.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.667
[music playing]

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.000
KIMI WERNER (VOICEOVER):
When I go spear phishing,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.433
I become an actual
part of the ocean.

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:47.400
I become a part of
my roots, of Hawaii.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:52.767
I become a hunter.

00:00:55.834 --> 00:01:02.166
And more than anything, if
the boats were to stop coming,

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.633
I know how to survive.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:14.100
JJ KELLEY: Hawaii is one of the
most remote places on Earth.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.667
To get here, it was two
flights, 12 hours total.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.667
But it feels like
you're out there.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.266
Like coastal populations
around the world--

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.600
NEIL CAVUTO: All right.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.367
You talk about Irma, you
talk about Puerto Rico--

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:27.767
JJ KELLEY: --Hawaiians
face threats

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.867
unique to their geography.

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:37.266
And when disaster strikes, they
get pushed to the brink fast.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:41.667
Here, some 90% of the food
that's consumed is imported.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:44.567
That means that Hawaii has
about a 10-day supply of food.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:47.467
That didn't always
used to be the case.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.633
Up until the islands
were largely carved up

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.300
by US-backed pineapple
and sugar plantations

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.734
in the early 20th century,
Hawaiians fed themselves.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.166
Now, a growing number
of their descendants

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:03.100
are working to do so again.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.834
So it's 6:00 AM right now.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.533
We're gonna go get a meal.

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.834
We're not going to
the grocery store.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.266
We're going to the ocean.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.967
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
This is Makua

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:19.266
Beach, on the island of Oahu.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.367
I'm going diving on
this overcast day with

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:24.834
Hawaiian native Kimi Werner.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.033
JJ KELLEY: It fits.

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.200
Oh, good.
This is--

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.633
- Weights.
- --your weight belt.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:29.700
All right.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.467
If you need more,
we can give you more.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.800
JJ KELLEY: Kimmie is a champion
spear fisher and freediver,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.200
but she's not here for sport.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:41.734
Our goal today is
to get dinner to eat.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.600
How do you teach yourself
how to do something like that?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.333
KIMI WERNER: Well, I mean,
I learned from my dad.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.367
He was a freediver
and spear fisherman,

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.133
and he just used this to
put food on the table.

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:57.533
That is what gave me my ability,
I think, to relax in the water.

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.166
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
Kimi's weapon of choice

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:01.233
is a trigger-fired spear gun.

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:02.533
This is for you.

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.166
All right.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.767
Little one for me.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.633
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER): She says
mine is for emergency use only.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.600
Just in case a really big,
aggressive fish, like a shark

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.300
comes in, you just
have something

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.633
to put in between you and it.

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.467
This is reassuring.

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:18.000
All right.
I'm in good hands.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.900
KIMI WERNER: [laughs] Yes.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.800
Should we do this?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.633
KIMI WERNER: I think so.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.533
Let's do this.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.000
We kick out to the site of a
sunken ship called the Mahi.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.567
There, Kimi takes a
deep breath of air

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:41.533
and disappears down
into the abyss.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:49.967
She just drops, drops,
drops, and I can't even--

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:52.133
can't even see her anymore.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:56.400
Like, she's 90 feet
underwater with no scuba,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.433
laying on the
ground and waiting.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.266
KIMI WERNER (VOICEOVER):
When I go spear phishing,

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:07.633
I become a predator.

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:18.533
I become a lioness looking for
food in my natural environment.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.200
JJ KELLEY: Look at her fish.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.767
Well done.
- Oh, thanks.

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:25.934
High five.
That's a--

00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:27.100
- Thank you.
- --beautiful fish.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.300
It is.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.600
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
Kimi's caught

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.433
a pualu, a breed of
surgeon fish Hawaiians

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:35.467
have been dining
on for centuries.

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:38.400
Obviously, you know,
this isn't easy work.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.600
No.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.667
Like, diving to 100 feet
to get a fish like this?

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:47.133
There's obviously
easier ways to get food.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.433
KIMI WERNER
(VOICEOVER): But when

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:51.200
you put that work in
yourself, it makes you

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.033
appreciate it that much more.

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.200
I know that I'm
sourcing it responsibly,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.100
and it's evidence that I
can take care of myself.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:04.800
JJ KELLEY: In a place so removed
from the rest of the world,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.367
knowing how to catch a fish
is a handy skill to have.

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:12.066
Yet, we didn't see many
other people out fishing.

00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:13.834
And that has Kimi worried.

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:22.233
KIMI WERNER: If anything were
to ever happen where the boats

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:26.233
were to stop coming, then
people wouldn't know how

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:30.266
to survive because we
aren't designed right

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:32.800
now to take care of ourselves.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.133
That didn't always used
to be the case here, though.

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:36.667
No.

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.400
JJ KELLEY: Up until
the mid-1800s,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.800
Hawaiians had a system of
divvying up land into mountain

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.300
to shore slices.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.734
What you harvested depended
on what part of the slice

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.266
lived on.

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:50.567
And it was called ahupua'a.

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:54.433
And the way it worked is that
if people from the mountains

00:05:54.433 --> 00:05:57.700
needed some fish, they would
come down and they would trade,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.734
whether it's fruits
or vegetable or taro,

00:06:00.734 --> 00:06:03.600
and people were able to
take care of themselves

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.533
in this system that
was 100% sustainable.

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.100
JJ KELLEY: In the era of
Blue Apron and Amazon Go,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.667
many would consider
such a system primitive.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:18.633
Not Kimi.

00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:20.100
KIMI WERNER
(VOICEOVER): If you were

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.967
to look at any other
species of animal--

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:24.900
--it's like the first thing
on their list when they're born.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.533
They're going to be taught how
to get water, how to get food.

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:29.700
KIMI WERNER
(VOICEOVER): And I just

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.667
don't get how having
that knowledge

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:34.400
and having those skills
makes us primitive--

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.700
--and not having any of
them makes us civilized.

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:43.166
JJ KELLEY: She has a
point, especially when

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:44.700
civilization is so fragile.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.467
This is the port of Honolulu.

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:53.300
We're on an island right now.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.200
I live on an island--

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.367
Manhattan.

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:57.533
I remember when
Hurricane Sandy hit,

00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:01.166
and my wife and I lost
power, we lost heat,

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:03.200
we didn't know where we
were gonna get our food,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.667
and it was scary.

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:09.433
And that's on an island
with bridges and tunnels.

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:12.400
Here, this is the
bridge and tunnel.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.867
This is the connection
to the outside world,

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.633
where their food comes in.

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:19.633
And if something goes wrong, the
stakes are just a lot higher.

00:07:23.533 --> 00:07:27.233
When we come back, for plenty
of Hawaiians, self-sufficiency

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:28.300
isn't a fringe fad--

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.667
There's a pig right there.

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:34.233
JJ KELLEY: --it's a dangerous,
heart-pumping reality.

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:35.300
[bow shoots]

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:41.600
[music playing]

00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:45.800
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
I'm JJ Kelley in Hawaii,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.400
a place so reliant on
imported groceries,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.600
it's estimated the islands have
only a 10-day supply of food.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.633
For some locals, the
solution is self-reliance.

00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:03.533
And I'm here to meet a few
of those on the front lines,

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.533
like bow hunter Justin Lee.

00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:08.367
Do you remember a moment in
your life where you decided,

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:10.433
this is how you want
to find your food?

00:08:10.433 --> 00:08:12.266
JUSTIN LEE (VOICEOVER): My
dad passed it down onto me,

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:14.834
and you know, he was my hero.

00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:20.567
Being the man that brought home
dinner via hunting or gathering

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.700
was the kind of man
that I wanted to be.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.533
So what are we
hunting for today?

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:30.000
We're gonna be
hunting for wild boar.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.467
We got some wild goats and
some wild sheep out here.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:36.166
JJ KELLEY: None of these
species are native to Hawaii.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:38.834
They were introduced to
the islands by the West.

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:41.834
But with no natural predators
to keep their populations in

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.533
check, their numbers ballooned.

00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:46.800
Today, feral herds
threaten Hawaii's

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.100
delicate ecosystem,
overgrazing and trampling

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.700
endangered species.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.166
They're a problem.

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.567
They are.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.100
JJ KELLEY: Especially the pigs.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.934
JUSTIN LEE: They
root up everything,

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.500
and they destroy the land.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.333
They're nature's
bulldozer, basically.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.800
JJ KELLEY: They're
so destructive,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.700
the Hawaiian government
encourages their eradication,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.734
which is why Justin and I
are out here this morning.

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:15.633
Is there any limit on the
amount that you can shoot?

00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:18.066
JUSTIN LEE: If you're
hunting on public land,

00:09:18.066 --> 00:09:20.767
you're allowed two pigs a day.

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:22.033
A day.

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:23.266
Yeah, so there's plenty
of food out here.

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:25.533
You could feed your
village, for sure.

00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:30.934
There's a pig right there.

00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:31.767
Pig?

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.967
JUSTIN LEE: Yeah.

00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:35.233
Wow, you got a good eye.

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:44.734
Well go this, this way, and
then we'll come up on him.

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:46.734
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER): As if we
needed more proof of Hawaii's

00:09:46.734 --> 00:09:51.166
ample protein supply,
a flock of feral sheep

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:52.867
appears on the horizon.

00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:53.700
You see 'em?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.967
Yeah.

00:09:54.967 --> 00:09:56.066
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER): Briefly.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:56.934
Oh, no.

00:09:56.934 --> 00:09:57.834
There they go.

00:09:57.834 --> 00:09:58.667
They're gone.

00:09:58.667 --> 00:09:59.367
Yeah, they're gone.

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:00.533
They know we're here.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.700
Let's try and
focus on this boar.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.467
OK.

00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:06.667
JUSTIN LEE: Those are pigs.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.100
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
Startled boars will charge

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.900
their aggressors and
slice them with tusks

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.266
as sharp as razor blades.

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:19.834
It's a dangerous game,
but a well-placed shot

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:23.266
could potentially feed a family
of four for nearly a week.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.567
[boar squeals]

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.633
Wow.

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:31.633
Got him.

00:10:31.633 --> 00:10:32.800
JJ KELLEY: Wow.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.033
Yeah, this is a good
eating boar right here.

00:10:36.033 --> 00:10:37.300
JJ KELLEY: So how
much does he weigh?

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.333
This guy's probably 80 pounds.

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:40.500
He's not that big.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.367
But the younger,
the better they are.

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:45.834
JJ KELLEY: Bubbles emerge
from the wound, a sign

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.000
that the arrow hit the lung.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.233
That means that it
was a quick kill.

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:54.033
So what do you do first?

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:56.834
JUSTIN LEE: You have to pay
our respect to this boar.

00:10:56.834 --> 00:10:59.100
You know, we're not
just killing for fun.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.633
For us to survive,
something has to die.

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:03.367
Thank you very much.

00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:08.233
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
Since he'll be carrying

00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:11.266
the meat out with him,
Justin's selective about what

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.834
he harvests.

00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:15.233
We're gonna take off his front
shoulder, his hindquarters,

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:16.133
and then his back strap.

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.900
That's the tenderloin.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.967
Can you hold this up like this?

00:11:18.967 --> 00:11:19.700
Yeah.

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.333
And this is meat that'll
feed your family.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:27.166
It'll feed my family
a few times, yeah.

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:28.967
My neighbor's family, as well.

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:30.767
You know, it's a community vibe.

00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:39.567
JJ KELLEY: It might
be surprising to think

00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:44.533
that self-sufficiency would
foster a sense of community.

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:49.033
Yet Kimi says that's exactly how
strong, resilient systems are

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:51.133
born.

00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:52.533
KIMI WERNER (VOICEOVER):
Sometimes I'd

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:56.667
have a fish that was so
big, I'd have to share it.

00:11:56.667 --> 00:12:00.200
The beautiful surprise
that came from that

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.300
is that, then, a week later, I'd
have avocados at my doorstep.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.200
You know, I'd have fruit
from people with trees,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.300
eggs from their chickens.

00:12:11.934 --> 00:12:16.700
JJ KELLEY: Kimi calls it
her own modern day ahupua'a.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.734
But in a state that lies 2000
miles away from the mainland,

00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:24.066
it's also common sense.

00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:26.600
And this push, for
self-sufficiency,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.266
is gaining ground.

00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:30.767
The Hawaiian
government has launched

00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:33.767
plans to double the amount
of food grown on the island

00:12:33.767 --> 00:12:35.233
by 2020.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.700
Can I join the party?

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.100
KIMI WERNER: I suppose.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.467
JJ KELLEY (VOICEOVER):
If tonight's potluck

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.567
is any indication, that
goal is within reach.

00:12:42.567 --> 00:12:44.100
Oh, my god.
This is so good.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.300
KIMI WERNER: Well, I know why.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.734
JJ KELLEY: What's
on the table here?

00:12:46.734 --> 00:12:50.266
Well, starting here, we
have the pualu that we shot.

00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:51.834
JJ KELLEY: I recognize him.

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:54.500
KIMI WERNER: And he's stuffed
with local citrus and fruit.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.333
We have our wild pig that one of
my hunter friends dropped off.

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:01.133
It's just a feast
that comes together.

00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:03.467
MAN: It looks amazing.

00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:05.433
And it strikes me,
you're one person

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:07.133
going out and doing this.

00:13:07.133 --> 00:13:08.834
But it creates a community.

00:13:08.834 --> 00:13:10.033
MAN: All right.

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:11.467
Thank you, everybody,
for being here.

00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:14.734
JJ KELLEY: And it
changes a culture.

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:18.200
If doomsday happens, you're
gonna have the upper hand.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.767
KIMI WERNER: Right.

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:22.600
JJ KELLEY: These folks know
that strength and independence

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.000
aren't a reward for
fighting against nature,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.266
but for learning to roll with
whatever it throws your way.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.266
KIMI WERNER: Man likes
to try to conquer nature.

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:38.300
But we don't get to dictate.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.533
Sometimes nature's like, uh-uh.

00:13:40.533 --> 00:13:41.667
Not today.

00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:44.333
And so when you live in
this type of lifestyle,

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:48.600
and you're actually living
off of the land and the ocean,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.166
you are living by
what nature gives you.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.700
Connecting over conquering.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.734
MAN: Absolutely.
