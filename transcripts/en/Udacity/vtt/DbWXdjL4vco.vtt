Still, what automated tools can find and what humans can find, is only correct

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with regard to the specification.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And at this point, we do not have a complete specification on what a remove

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
html markup should really do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One of my PhD students sent me this input.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here is the html markup, and here is the actual text.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If we feed this into the program, what is the output?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What is the result of the remove html markup function when we give it this string?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Over to you.
