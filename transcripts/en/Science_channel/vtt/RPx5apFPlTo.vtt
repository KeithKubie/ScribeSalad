Narrator:
THESE PLATES ARE FOR SWITCHES

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.267
THAT WILL BE INSTALLED
IN HOTEL ROOMS,

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:13.634
AND THEY WILL INCLUDE SOCKETS
FOR THREE-PIN BRITISH PLUGS.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:17.868
THE AUTOMATED TOOLING WRAPS
THE PUNCHED METAL AROUND A FORM

00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:19.968
TO GIVE IT THE DESIRED SHAPE.

00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:22.234
THIS FRAMEWORK WILL ALSO SERVE

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.934
AS AN ELECTRICAL
GROUNDING PLATE,

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:28.400
DISCHARGING ELECTRICAL ENERGY
FROM THE SOCKET

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.901
TO PREVENT SHOCKS.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.033
A WORKER NOW ATTACHES
A MOLDED PLASTIC PART

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.601
TO A GROUNDING PLATE.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.501
HE INSERTS A SCREW
IN A BRASS CONNECTOR

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:41.000
AND INSTALLS IT IN A SLOT
IN THE MOLDED PLASTIC.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
HE INSTALLS A SERIES
OF BRASS TERMINALS.

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:49.667
AT THE NEXT STATION, A WORKER
ASSEMBLES FUSE HOLDERS,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:53.067
CONTACTS, AND SPRINGS
TO THE PLASTIC STRUCTURE.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:54.234
NEXT UP ARE LITTLE

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.400
SPRING-OPERATED
PLASTIC SHUTTERS.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.801
THEY BLOCK THE SOCKETS WHEN
NOTHING IS PLUGGED INTO THEM.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.033
MOVING DOWN THE ASSEMBLY LINE,

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:07.334
A WORKER INSERTS SPRINGS
INTO TWIN ROCKER SWITCHES.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.567
SHE LOWERS A PRESS

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:13.067
TO SQUEEZE ALL THE SWITCH
COMPONENTS TOGETHER.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.901
THEN TRANSFERS THE SWITCHES
TO THE ELECTRICAL UNIT.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:21.067
ANOTHER TECHNICIAN SNAPS A COVER
ONTO IT.

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:23.734
HE PLUGS IT INTO A LIGHT BOX
TO TEST IT,

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.200
AND THE BULBS OF THE BOX
ILLUMINATE.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.300
THIS CONFIRMS THAT THE SWITCHES
AND SOCKETS

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.934
ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL.

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:34.167
A WORKER NOW FITS THE STEEL
GRID PLATE TO IT

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:37.701
WITH THE SWITCHES AND SOCKETS
PROTRUDING THROUGH IT.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.000
THIS PARTICULAR UNIT
IS ALSO EQUIPPED

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.200
WITH A ROUND EUROPEAN PLUG

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.934
AND A USB CHARGING PORT
FOR MOBILE DEVICES.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.968
AT THE NEXT STATION, AN OPERATOR
SERVES UP BRASS FACEPLATES

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:55.234
TO A PRESS THAT BENDS
THE RIMS...

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:59.701
...FORMING A THIN LIP THAT WILL
FIT AROUND THE GRID PLATE.

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.367
A COMPUTERIZED WELDER

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.267
FUSES STUDS TO THE BACK
OF THE FACEPLATES,

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:09.100
PLACING ONE AT EACH CORNER.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.467
THESE STUDS WILL FIX THE
FACEPLATE TO THE GRID PLATE

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.667
AND PROVIDE A SCREWLESS FINISH
ON THE FRONT.

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:20.901
WHEN IT COMES TO SWITCH
AND SOCKET COMBINATIONS,

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:23.067
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF OPTIONS.

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:24.901
AT THIS STATION, A WORKER

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.400
ASSEMBLES A PARTICULARLY LARGE
ONE WITH SWITCHES,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400
CHARGING PORTS, AND SOCKETS.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.634
IT'S ALSO DESIGNED FOR
INSTALLATION IN A HOTEL ROOM.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.901
HE SECURES THE CHARGING PORT
TO THE GRID PLATE

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:43.234
AND IT'S READY
FOR THE FACEPLATE.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.934
HE ATTACHES IT USING
THE WELDED STUDS,

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:54.801
AND WITH THE FOLDED EDGING, IT
ENCASES THE GRID PLATE NEATLY.
