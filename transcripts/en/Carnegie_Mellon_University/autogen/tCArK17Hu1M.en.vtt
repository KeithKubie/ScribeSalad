technology to change communities not by
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:36.990
technology to change communities not by
us changing from the outside but by

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000
us changing from the outside but by
 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.340
us changing from the outside but by
having the communities change themselves

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350
having the communities change themselves
 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.830

and so in talk it's about electric

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840
and so in talk it's about electric
 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.240
and so in talk it's about electric
vehicles and the role that they can have

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250
vehicles and the role that they can have
 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.340
vehicles and the role that they can have
and how we can view the future of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350
and how we can view the future of
 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.530
and how we can view the future of
electric vehicles and imagine it with

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540
electric vehicles and imagine it with
 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.750
electric vehicles and imagine it with
the community centric point of view but

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760
the community centric point of view but
 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.220
the community centric point of view but
I've actually cared about electric cars

doing more recently and so I thought

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550
doing more recently and so I thought
 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.859
doing more recently and so I thought
maybe the personal story is a good one

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869

all the classes and instead working on
 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.260
all the classes and instead working on
the project and we learned a lot there's

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270
the project and we learned a lot there's
 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.820
the project and we learned a lot there's
three major lessons that are took away

you drive an electric car you can do
that and by doing that you're

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569
okay he couldn't stop asking questions
 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.059
okay he couldn't stop asking questions
about this car what kind of batteries do

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069
about this car what kind of batteries do
 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.009
about this car what kind of batteries do
you have in it I was driving tanks and

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:03.019
you have in it I was driving tanks and
 

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.759
you have in it I was driving tanks and
World War two and it was very

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:03.769
World War two and it was very
 

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.979
World War two and it was very
interesting sir because our tanks had

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:05.989
interesting sir because our tanks had
 

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:07.239
interesting sir because our tanks had
really bad lit acid batteries and he

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249
really bad lit acid batteries and he
 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.289
really bad lit acid batteries and he
wouldn't start in the mornings after a

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:08.299
wouldn't start in the mornings after a
 

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:10.539
wouldn't start in the mornings after a
cold cold night but the Germans had

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:10.549
cold cold night but the Germans had
 

00:06:10.549 --> 00:06:12.429
cold cold night but the Germans had
these really nice tanks at Nick nickel

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:12.439
these really nice tanks at Nick nickel
 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.959
these really nice tanks at Nick nickel
batteries and they started no problem

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969
batteries and they started no problem
 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.749
batteries and they started no problem
what do you think of that can I get one

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759
what do you think of that can I get one
 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.149
what do you think of that can I get one
of these cars and these continued to

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159
of these cars and these continued to
 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.399
of these cars and these continued to
this day and it's a cut of society that

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409
this day and it's a cut of society that
 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.409
this day and it's a cut of society that
cuts across socio-economic boundaries

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419
cuts across socio-economic boundaries
 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.329

shadyside and so it's really interesting

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:30.649
shadyside and so it's really interesting
 

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:32.049
shadyside and so it's really interesting
the level of public interest and

00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:32.059
the level of public interest and
 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.309
the level of public interest and
engagement with the idea of electric

done to the car is that replaced the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280
done to the car is that replaced the
 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.230

four tires they wore out the brakes have

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240
four tires they wore out the brakes have
 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.790
four tires they wore out the brakes have
never worn out because guess what it's

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800
never worn out because guess what it's
 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.619
never worn out because guess what it's
got regenerative braking so most of the

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629
got regenerative braking so most of the
 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:00.820
got regenerative braking so most of the
time you're using the motor to slow down

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830
time you're using the motor to slow down
 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.140
time you're using the motor to slow down
so the brakes last a whole lot longer

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150
so the brakes last a whole lot longer
 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.170
so the brakes last a whole lot longer
and I can leave it at that but the

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180
and I can leave it at that but the
 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.700
and I can leave it at that but the
reliability of that car fundamentally

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710
reliability of that car fundamentally
 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.270
reliability of that car fundamentally
it's data point of one but it's a really

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280
it's data point of one but it's a really
 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.649
it's data point of one but it's a really
interesting teaching lesson in the

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:11.659
interesting teaching lesson in the
 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.330
interesting teaching lesson in the
comics of electric cars and actually it

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340
comics of electric cars and actually it
 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.529
comics of electric cars and actually it
relates a little bit to the politics of

with and as we enter the foray of

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:20.659
with and as we enter the foray of
 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.659
with and as we enter the foray of
electric cars you can ask where is the

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669
electric cars you can ask where is the
 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:23.619
electric cars you can ask where is the
state of the art what are people doing

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629
state of the art what are people doing
 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:24.969
state of the art what are people doing
in the world of electric vehicle

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:24.979
in the world of electric vehicle
 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.469
in the world of electric vehicle
technology and there's one picture that

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479
technology and there's one picture that
 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.140
technology and there's one picture that
says it all the battery particularly

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150
says it all the battery particularly
 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.670
says it all the battery particularly
appropriate picture because this is the

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680
appropriate picture because this is the
 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.459
appropriate picture because this is the
e 95 battery that my car has the rav4 EV

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:33.469
e 95 battery that my car has the rav4 EV
 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:37.180
e 95 battery that my car has the rav4 EV
I have 24 of those under the car 24 and

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190
I have 24 of those under the car 24 and
 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.920
I have 24 of those under the car 24 and
a half kilowatt hours of power so enough

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930
a half kilowatt hours of power so enough
 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.209
a half kilowatt hours of power so enough
power to run your house for several days

power to run your house for several days
 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:43.600
power to run your house for several days
now it's a telling picture because this

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:43.610
now it's a telling picture because this
 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.879
now it's a telling picture because this
is also the battery that we can no

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889
is also the battery that we can no
 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:48.279
is also the battery that we can no
longer buy its patent was bought up by a

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:48.289
longer buy its patent was bought up by a
 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.909
longer buy its patent was bought up by a
gas company yes oh yes the battery is

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919
gas company yes oh yes the battery is
 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.909
gas company yes oh yes the battery is
this big and it's about a 1 kilowatt

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919
this big and it's about a 1 kilowatt
 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.820
this big and it's about a 1 kilowatt
hour battery so not too big in fact it

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:57.830
hour battery so not too big in fact it
 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.899
hour battery so not too big in fact it
will show you afterwards in the garage

00:07:58.899 --> 00:07:58.909
will show you afterwards in the garage
 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.490
will show you afterwards in the garage
of that the underside of the car and you

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:00.500
of that the underside of the car and you
 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.260
of that the underside of the car and you
can see the batteries so they still a

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:02.270
can see the batteries so they still a
 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.180
can see the batteries so they still a
little plastic trays under there but

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.190
little plastic trays under there but
 

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.439
little plastic trays under there but
yeah there's a patent dispute with this

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:05.449
yeah there's a patent dispute with this
 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.059
yeah there's a patent dispute with this
batter we can't even buy it today if a

batter we can't even buy it today if a
battery goes bad on my car you have to

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.330
battery goes bad on my car you have to
 

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.850
battery goes bad on my car you have to
reconstruct some kind of 12 volt battery

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:09.860
reconstruct some kind of 12 volt battery
 

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.279
reconstruct some kind of 12 volt battery
you can't replace it with a existing set

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:12.289
you can't replace it with a existing set
 

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:15.189
you can't replace it with a existing set
new but the battery has really been at

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199
new but the battery has really been at
 

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:16.749
new but the battery has really been at
the forefront of research for the

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759
the forefront of research for the
 

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.700
the forefront of research for the
electric vehicle so companies and

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:18.710
electric vehicle so companies and
 

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.990
electric vehicle so companies and
researchers have really worked hard to

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000
researchers have really worked hard to
 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.820
researchers have really worked hard to
make the battery better and the fact

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:21.830
make the battery better and the fact
 

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.350
make the battery better and the fact
that my car just doesn't mean mean we

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360
that my car just doesn't mean mean we
 

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.369
that my car just doesn't mean mean we
don't need to make the battery better of

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:24.379
don't need to make the battery better of
 

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.959
don't need to make the battery better of
course we do there's plenty of room for

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:25.969
course we do there's plenty of room for
 

00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:28.050
course we do there's plenty of room for
improvement and that's being done and

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.060
improvement and that's being done and
 

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.159
improvement and that's being done and
time it again you'll hear about the

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:30.169
time it again you'll hear about the
 

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:32.380
time it again you'll hear about the
battery fundamentally though I want to

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:32.390
battery fundamentally though I want to
 

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.639
battery fundamentally though I want to
talk a little bit about energy store

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:33.649
talk a little bit about energy store
 

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:35.170
talk a little bit about energy store
about the architecture that you can use

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.180
about the architecture that you can use
 

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.430
about the architecture that you can use
to drive these cars and how we could

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.440
to drive these cars and how we could
 

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.769
to drive these cars and how we could
imagine change in architecture now if we

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:38.779
imagine change in architecture now if we
 

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:39.759
imagine change in architecture now if we
look at the cars that are going to come

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:39.769
look at the cars that are going to come
 

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.649
look at the cars that are going to come
out in the next three or so years what

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:41.659
out in the next three or so years what
 

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:42.790
out in the next three or so years what
is their architecture what do they like

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800
is their architecture what do they like
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.769
is their architecture what do they like
and how does the battery relate to them

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:44.779
and how does the battery relate to them
 

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:46.930
and how does the battery relate to them
let's look at a few so this is one of my

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:46.940
let's look at a few so this is one of my
 

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.689
let's look at a few so this is one of my
favorites the Nissan Leaf it's hopefully

00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:49.699
favorites the Nissan Leaf it's hopefully
 

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:50.740
favorites the Nissan Leaf it's hopefully
going to be out in two to three years

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:50.750
going to be out in two to three years
 

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.079
going to be out in two to three years
and when you buy a nissan leaf it's a

00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:53.089
and when you buy a nissan leaf it's a
 

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:54.880
and when you buy a nissan leaf it's a
four-door proper car goes at highway

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:54.890
four-door proper car goes at highway
 

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.230

why is that why would they set it up

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040
why is that why would they set it up
 

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.350
why is that why would they set it up
that way because the batteries are

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360
that way because the batteries are
 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.240
that way because the batteries are
expensive because it's not well defined

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.250

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.190
to 20 miles per gallon difference
 

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.740
to 20 miles per gallon difference
between a gas car and electric car in

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:20.750
between a gas car and electric car in
 

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.710
between a gas car and electric car in
the city why the difference well the

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720
the city why the difference well the
 

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.260
the city why the difference well the
reason is actually pretty clear it's

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:26.270
reason is actually pretty clear it's
 

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.640
reason is actually pretty clear it's
because in the city in that urban

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:27.650
because in the city in that urban
 

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.620

commute setting you doing a whole lot of
 

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.960
commute setting you doing a whole lot of
starting and stopping right and what's

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:31.970
starting and stopping right and what's
 

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.340
starting and stopping right and what's
the gas car not good at well it's

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.350
the gas car not good at well it's
 

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.720
the gas car not good at well it's
burning guess what is idling but that's

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:34.730
burning guess what is idling but that's
 

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.490
burning guess what is idling but that's
not a huge amount of gas more

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:36.500
not a huge amount of gas more
 

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.110

down you push the brake you make heat
 

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.759
down you push the brake you make heat
and you lose all the energy you had when

thing you'll notice is yes it is as it

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820
thing you'll notice is yes it is as it
 

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.160
thing you'll notice is yes it is as it
looks and I'd have to scale it to make

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:31.170
looks and I'd have to scale it to make
 

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.050
looks and I'd have to scale it to make
it equivalent for you but it is a lot

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:33.060
it equivalent for you but it is a lot
 

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.550
it equivalent for you but it is a lot
more variable even than the urban

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:34.560
more variable even than the urban
 

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.410

and the other cool thing to notice is

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580
and the other cool thing to notice is
 

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.460
and the other cool thing to notice is
this is the zero line and if you stand

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:40.470
this is the zero line and if you stand
 

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.600
this is the zero line and if you stand
back and squint you can probably tell

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:41.610
back and squint you can probably tell
 

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.070
back and squint you can probably tell
there's a whole lot more above the zero

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080
there's a whole lot more above the zero
 

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.800

even than in the urban dynamometer case
 

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.300
even than in the urban dynamometer case
so we're on the same analysis on this

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:47.310
so we're on the same analysis on this
 

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.310
so we're on the same analysis on this

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.919
I've talked about makes the urban
commute special because the urban

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:41.929
commute special because the urban
 

00:24:41.929 --> 00:24:44.230
commute special because the urban
commute is noisy and high frequency and

because unlike the gasoline motor they

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.090
because unlike the gasoline motor they
 

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.210
because unlike the gasoline motor they
love to speed up and slow down and they

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:55.220
love to speed up and slow down and they
 

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.529
love to speed up and slow down and they
love to change direction on the current

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:56.539
love to change direction on the current

you could imagine right and so we can
 

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.140
you could imagine right and so we can
ask the question what does that do to

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.150
ask the question what does that do to
 

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.420
ask the question what does that do to

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:54.430
what the battery ceased to the battery
 

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.630
what the battery ceased to the battery
duty and here's what it does we're going

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640

to take a small super capacitor and do

00:29:59.880 --> 00:29:59.890
to take a small super capacitor and do
 

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.530
to take a small super capacitor and do
that and just simulate that forward and

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:01.540
that and just simulate that forward and
 

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.420

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440
result now again before after so what's
 

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.990
result now again before after so what's
exciting about this is you're seeing a

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000
exciting about this is you're seeing a
 

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.820
exciting about this is you're seeing a
huge number of the power demands on the

huge number of the power demands on the
battery disappear now I need to tell you

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:13.990
battery disappear now I need to tell you
 

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.480
battery disappear now I need to tell you
how big the battery is and how big the

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.490
how big the battery is and how big the
 

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.280
how big the battery is and how big the
super capacitor is right so you have a

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.290
super capacitor is right so you have a
 

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.070

like a five hundredth of the size of the
 

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.030
like a five hundredth of the size of the
battery if I did that right and the

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.040
battery if I did that right and the
 

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.740
battery if I did that right and the
statistics get really interesting if you

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:31.750
statistics get really interesting if you
 

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.130
statistics get really interesting if you
vary capacitor sizes so you can ask the

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:35.140
vary capacitor sizes so you can ask the
 

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.270
vary capacitor sizes so you can ask the
question how big does the cash have to

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:36.280
question how big does the cash have to
 

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.410
question how big does the cash have to
be and if we take the cache size and

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:39.420
be and if we take the cache size and
 

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.840
be and if we take the cache size and
very it we get a really nice curve it's

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:42.850
very it we get a really nice curve it's
 

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.360
very it we get a really nice curve it's
a nice curve because at very small cache

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.370
a nice curve because at very small cache
 

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.280
a nice curve because at very small cache
sizes and very small capacitor sizes

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:47.290
sizes and very small capacitor sizes
 

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.230

about altitude right and GPS altitude is

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:05.970
about altitude right and GPS altitude is
 

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.790
about altitude right and GPS altitude is
nowhere near good enough we've done this

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800
nowhere near good enough we've done this
 

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.710
nowhere near good enough we've done this
in sative analysis it doesn't give us

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720
in sative analysis it doesn't give us
 

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.000
in sative analysis it doesn't give us
the altitude measurements such that we

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.010
the altitude measurements such that we
 

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.320
the altitude measurements such that we
could really figure out power in the

about two weeks ago all altitude data

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:17.430
about two weeks ago all altitude data
 

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.490
about two weeks ago all altitude data
for the entire US so now we have that

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500
for the entire US so now we have that

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880
algorithm question here how do you
 

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.900
algorithm question here how do you
manage the energy when do you decide to

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:00.910
manage the energy when do you decide to
 

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.280

they did yesterday and they always stop
 

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.070
they did yesterday and they always stop
there two out of three times they stop

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.080
there two out of three times they stop
 

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.240
there two out of three times they stop
there I'm going to discharge the

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:09.250
there I'm going to discharge the
 

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.160
there I'm going to discharge the
capacitor so it's ready to accept the

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:11.170
capacitor so it's ready to accept the
 

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.690
capacitor so it's ready to accept the
charge and still slow the car down or

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:12.700

nowhere to go but faster so let's charge

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:17.080
nowhere to go but faster so let's charge
 

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.870
nowhere to go but faster so let's charge
the capacitor up gradually so we can

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880
the capacitor up gradually so we can
 

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.340
the capacitor up gradually so we can
discharge it on the green and take off

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:20.350
discharge it on the green and take off
 

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.160
discharge it on the green and take off
and not use the battery at all so in all

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:23.170
and not use the battery at all so in all
 

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.600
and not use the battery at all so in all
of those key situations we're talking

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:24.610
of those key situations we're talking
 

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.910
of those key situations we're talking
about intelligent control and boy that's

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920
about intelligent control and boy that's
 

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.280
about intelligent control and boy that's
a great place for hackers to think

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.290
a great place for hackers to think
 

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.150
a great place for hackers to think
especially since we want to be able to

been thinking how to do this now we're

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:43.660
been thinking how to do this now we're
 

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:45.660
been thinking how to do this now we're
going to i'm sure graduates and master's

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:45.670
going to i'm sure graduates and master's
 

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.610
going to i'm sure graduates and master's
degrees and maybe even a PhD on this

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:47.620

question of intelligent control of the
 

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.840
question of intelligent control of the
car but we'd open this up broadly so the

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:51.850
car but we'd open this up broadly so the
 

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.460
car but we'd open this up broadly so the
second thing we're doing which is a

second thing we're doing which is a
 

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.310
second thing we're doing which is a
little bit unusual especially for me the

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:56.320
little bit unusual especially for me the
 

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.730
