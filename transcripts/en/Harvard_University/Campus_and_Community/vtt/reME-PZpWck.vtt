00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.630
If I think about students 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.010
now, they strike me as very poised and much more,
I don't know, 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.420
much, sappier about

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.300
the world then I was.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.360
Now in

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.380
approaching

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.550
the world

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.190
and in considering how you 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.260
will conduct yourself,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.550
do not be afraid of failure.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.790
Stand up for something.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.530
Explore and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.260
don't expect your future to be linear when
you go from A to B to C to D

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.760
Do

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.510
not be afraid to take something of a gamble
with a piece of your life or your investment.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.900
Particularly while your young. I would hope that
our graduates will be leaving a place like

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.259
Harvard and standing together with people
who are most disempowered and most disenfranchised

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.520
so we can begin to change those dynamics in the world.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.520
I think that you need to stay in the moment.
It is good to meander around and that should be an exciting

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.580
thing and

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.719
not a not a bad thing.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.700
Humor. Humor is the way to get through the adversity of life.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920
Watch for opportunities outside the limits of ordinary experience and discourse. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.000
Be a better listener than a talker, then you are a great communicator.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I hope over their four years here 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.600
at Harvard that they learn

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.099
the importance

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.059
of using

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:16.309
the incredible education on behalf of not
only the powerful, but the powerless

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.800
And that having that power and privilege I think

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.650
requires you, gives you a moral responsibility,
to stand with those who are the least among

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.469
us.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:26.999
Go home.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:33.579
Make itself indispensable to that that community.
Read a daily newspaper. Get to know the problems of their

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.639
community and the people in their community.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.760
We need an

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.579
engaged and informed citizenry
  

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.979
in order for society to work.

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.909
It reminds me of my favorite quotes from Margaret Mead, she said
"Never doubt that a small handful of

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:46.629
citizens

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.280
can change the world. Indeed,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.179
that's the only thing that ever has."

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.889
My over all advice 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.310
is the opposite of the military. March away
from the sound of the guns.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.479
Act as if

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:03.079
you love this practice. Act as if
you love the boss. Act as if 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.569
you want to  get up early and work out. 
Often times being a leader, being a moral leader,

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.189
requires you to deal with, and navigate, that
kind of loneliness.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.789
So you have to like yourself you have to know what your good at and what your not good at

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.449
Itâ€™s those periods of loneliness, of standing
on principle

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:26.449
of staying true to who you are, that are most
rewarding in the long term.

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:31.209
And I know you will succeeded in leading in any of these major fields of endeavor that you undertake.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:38.209
Good Luck
