Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.210
&gt;&gt; Now for what we are really all
here for, Holly Robinson Peete.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm so excited.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.430
She is a force and a
woman of many talents.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.860
Of course, we all know
her as an actress,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.480
a singer, an author, of course.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.980
She has been in the entertainment
industry for most of her life

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.870
and found success in hit movies
and shows like 21 Jump Street,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.450
and of course, my personal
favorites,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.550
Hanging with Mr. Cooper
and For Your Love.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.440
But there are a few other talents
that she touts on her Instagram

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.320
and I think we should, they're
really highly important.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.110
First, mom of four, of course,
she is a resolution seeker,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.410
a philanthropist, and then a few

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.490
that I don't think we
know too much about.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.250
Plumber, Uber driver,
and dog interpreter.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.950
And I guess as a mom of four
you do what must be done.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.980
And she's doing what must be done.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.830
Her philanthropic efforts
through her

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.690
and her husband's organization
Holly Rod Foundation have won,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.140
not only won awards for
compassionate service,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.160 position:56%
but have placed a national spotlight
on two causes very personal

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.080
to the Peete family,
Parkinson's disease and Autism.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.310
Holly Robinson Peete is
an award winning author

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.910
and has won an NAACP Image Award
for her outstanding literary work

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.410
in her children's book entitled
My Brother Charlie about autism

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.040
from the sibling's
perspective co-authored

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.710
by her daughter Ryan
Elizabeth Peete.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.820
Her latest book Same
But Different Teen Life

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.300
on the Autism Express paints an
important story of hope for teens

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.580
and families living with
autism, and lets us all see

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.820
that everybody's unique
rhythm is worth dancing to.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.450
The book was co-written with her
twin children Ryan Elizabeth Peete

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.830
and R.J Tweet Peete
who was diagnosed

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.990
with autism at the age of three.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.480
Holly Robinson Peete continues
to do what must be done and more

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.130 position:56%
to inspire teens and families living
with autism, and we appreciate her

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.430
and her family for being a symbol
of hope and light for us all.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.030
So without further ado, please help
me welcome Holly Robinson Peete.

What a great introduction.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.740
Can you come back home
with me to L.A.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.700
and just introduce me
like that every morning?

&gt;&gt; Can you imagine if
you woke up every morning

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.060
and you were introduced
like that to your kids?

[ Laughter ]

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.660
&gt;&gt; That'd be fabulous.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.340
I am-let me find my clicker.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.600
Wala. I am so excited
to be here today.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.140
What an amazing festival.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.700
It's my first time here
and I absolutely love it.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.100
Thank you to all of you who
came to this presentation today.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.230
As many of you know, if
you didn't know before,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.180
you know I am a mom
first, a mom of four,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.580 position:56%
and I have a son with special needs.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.000
And it's been pretty
much the narrative

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.570
of my life for the last 18 years.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.860
And there's nothing more fulfilling
than when you have a situation

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.740
that happens to you that
can be quite devastating

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.570
and then you're able to
eventually see it as a blessing

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.410 position:56%
because you're able to touch others.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.550
It's a really tremendous feeling.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.880
So, I'm just absolutely
thrilled to be able to be here

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.800
and share my story with you.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.510
Oh, OK. So, it works.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.060
Ya'll, you're listening that's
the first thing you're just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.360
so excited that the clicker works.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.020
&gt;&gt; So, My Brother-we're
going to talk about Same

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.460
But Different, which
is our new book.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.650
My Brother Charlie is a
book I'm super proud of.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.500
I came to Scholastic many years
ago, and I pitched this book.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.990
And I went to several publishers,
and they really didn't get it.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.070
They really didn't get the
pervasive, prevalence of autism

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.420
and they just didn't understand.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.880
And certainly in communities
of color

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.000
where our children our
diagnosed two to five years later

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.320
than other children, it was really
important to have a book like this,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.670
especially from the
sibling's perspective.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.690
And so these are my twins.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.010
Aww, yeah, they're-- they're
18, so the aww factor is gone.

Aww. But back then, it was
aww, so cute, born in '97.

This is my dad.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.270 position:56%
So many of you of a certain age will
remember my dad was the original

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.570
Gordon on Sesame Street.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.870
[ Cheering ]

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.170

He is my inspiration for reading,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.240
for-I mean the man could tell a
story like you couldn't imagine,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.360
and he wrote so many stories
as Gordon on Sesame Street.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.660
He was the original Gordon.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.320
So that was like '69 to '72.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.140
And he was an amazing man, awesome
writer, wrote for everything

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.900

Cosby Show, the Waltons.

I mean he's a guy who really had a
lot to contribute to this television

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.970 position:56%
and entertainment, but was diagnosed
with Parkinson's disease at only 45.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.680
Yeah, it was deep because
it was in the 80's.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.790
And I was just a freshman
in college,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.230 position:56%
and I didn't know what Parkinson's
was, and we didn't have the internet

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.930
and Google yet and
you know Mohammed Ali.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.310
We just didn't have a whole lot
and it was kind of a scary time.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.220
But through him it led
me to a life of service.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.450
And then through our books we
were able to serve even more.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.370
So, here's some more cute
pictures of the twins.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.430
Oh, I love this picture
because you can tell

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.520
when R.J. was just
diagnosed around this time,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.380
Ryan was really there for him.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.690
You know, she always turned
his frown upside down,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.990
like we used to say.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.650
And she's always had his back.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.430
We got our diagnosis in 1999.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.960
We call it the never day because
we were told he was never going

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.670
to be so many things.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.850
This pediatrician just
basically, bless her heart,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.520
decided she was going to
give us a laundry list

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.090
of what he would never
do at three years old.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.200
So, it's very, you know, it comes
with a lot of audacity to be able

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.500
to tell a parent that your
kid will never say I love you,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.250
never do a whole bunch of things
that he eventually ended up doing.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.820
So, I want to quickly play this
little quick video that Ryan,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.460
his twin sister, and his
little brothers made.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.530
So, that's why it's a
little bit, it looks young.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.620
It's not professional.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.510
But it just gives a very good first
person narrative of who R.J. is.

Some people call me R.J.,
but I like Rodney better.

When I was three, the doctor
told my mom and dad I had autism.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.440
Autism means I have a
brain that is different.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.090
I did not really speak
too well until I was six.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.020
I did not really make friends.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.320
I cried a lot.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.900
I felt weird in my body.

People don't understand my world.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.020
It was hard.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.220
Can you imagine feeling something
but not being able to say it.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.860
Mom and dad did everything
for me to get me better.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.640
Thankfully, they could do that.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.780
I wish other kids do some
things I could do now.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.130 position:56%
A lot of families do not have enough
money to help their kids get better.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.460
That makes me sad.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.120
I wish there was a place where you
could go and not pay and get help.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.100
I like the NBA and MLB.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.750
I could tell you all the
players names on every team,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.810
but I really have a hard
time making friends.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.850
The doctor said I would
never play team sports.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.710
&gt;&gt; Wrong. Never give up.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.710

would never make friends.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.270

never say I love you on my own.

But I do all the time.

a book about autism.

So that's R.J. and you
can see he's a sweet kid,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.500
and he didn't have
language for so long.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.060
And we really wanted to use his
example to give other people hope.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.020 position:56%
Because that's really what we didn't
have when we got our diagnosis.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.970
We wrote this book for many
reasons, very obvious reasons being

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.060
that autism is very
prevalent right now,

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.850
and wanted to promote awareness.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.530
But in the end, it
was really about hope.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.830
It was really about peddling
hope, making sure that people

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.270
that were given the diagnosis
that we were given can know

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.470
that our kids can eventually
become part of society

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.380
and be loved and have talents.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.080
And we're always talking
about what they can't do,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.440
but we wanted to show
what they can do.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.990
So, one of the reasons
that we started,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.390
I started becoming an author is
because I went to school one day

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.410 position:56%
and my daughter Ryan said, "No one
knows at school what autism is, Mom.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.870
So, we got to tell them,
because no one knows."

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.870
This was like third
grade or fourth grade.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.810
And so, I said, "Well, Dad and
I we'll go down to the school

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.110
and have a conversation."

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.570
She was like, "That's OK.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.080
We don't need you to

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.670

you have to understand like we need

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.120
to come down there and
have a conversation.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.470
You don't have to be
in the classroom,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.860
but we need to explain it."

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.270 position:56%
And so she gave us the bullet points
on what to say and what not to say.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.440
She said, obviously,
don't embarrass us.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.350
She said, make it a
level playing field

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.840
and accentuate the
positive, a sense of humor.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.000
You know, the first thing
that we said to this group

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.450
of fourth graders was, what do you
do well, what don't you do well?

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.200
And one kid was like, "I
really play football well.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.910
But I don't read good."

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.070
And another kid said you
know, "I'm great at math.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.370
But I don't know how
to play soccer."

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.230
And I said, "Well, R.J.
can tell you the names

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.520
of every single president
and vice president.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.810
He can tell you the name
of every single player

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.810

But he has a hard time
making friends."

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.790
And it was amazing, like this
fog just lifted over them,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.740
and it was pretty awesome.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.190
Autism in America is out
of control quite frankly.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.910
There are so many kids
diagnosed with this disorder.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.210
It's very mysterious.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.410
We didn't know about it
until we were impacted by it.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.920
And the more we talk about it,
the more we write books about it,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.280
the more the stigma goes away.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.730
And that's another goal of ours.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.940
Just, these are-now
R.J. is growing up now.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.390
He's getting hair on his
face, and, yeah mommy's trying

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.010
to cut it while he's sleeping.

I really do try and shave him
while he's sleeping cause.

And he's just been awesome.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.010
So we decided we would do a
reality show because why not?

show to my family, I said,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.590
"It's not going to be like-don't
worry there won't be anybody

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:17.120
But I felt like just like with our
books and going on different shows,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.900
I wanted to continue the narrative.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.930
And I felt like it would be really
helpful for people to see us

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.380
in our lives and how
we rally around R.J.,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.870
and just you know,
we're married 21 years.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.340
We're not a perfect family at all.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.540

interesting to show our journey.

And so we're in our-we're about to
start our second season in February.

we're here at a book fest, this
is not a television convention,

of clips because I wanted you

to see sort of, this is an
extension of our work as authors.

old and he was first diagnosed

with autism, he was having a
lot of trouble communicating.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.730
I'd almost be his voice and I'd
often speak for him at times.

with cameras in tow.

she would be the freshman checking

Where's he going to work?

How's he going to make
his own money?

And everyone had their own input
about what would be best for him.

I wanted him to work
at the bird store,

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.850
the pet store because
he likes pets and birds.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.700

there and tried that.

to work at Wich Wich.

to shadow him.

to a modeling agency.

as these kids grow
up and become adults.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.990
Because we always think of autism
as you know, three year old,

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.810
a two year old, or a five year old.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.570

need to have relationships.

Where are they going to live?

What kind of communities
are they going to have?

to have this extension.

this transition or the transition

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.220
from middle school to high school.

How Ryan advocated for him.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.040
How hard it was for him to navigate
the things like social media,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.940
and girlfriends, and proms,
and just all the high school

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.420
and middle school things that are
difficult for a typical child,

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.110
let alone a kid that's
socially is disconnected.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.590
And so, Same But Different
is a book I'm super proud

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.680
of because we were able
to really tell the story

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.610 position:56%
in such a beautiful way, and I'm so
proud that Andrea, my editor is here

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:57.260
because she was so, it was so
important that we tell it in a way

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.810
that connected with a
families in an authentic way

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.110
because it's a nuanced journey.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.160
It's not something that
is very easy to classify.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.630
And we all say in the autism
community, if you've met one kid

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.950
with autism, you've just
met one kid with autism.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.850
My son went through pretty much all

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.270
of elementary school
with no friends.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.950
He still struggles with this theme.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.180 position:56%
And in that scene, you know, he sort
of still haunted by an experience

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.560
in middle school where these
boys made him do something

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.760
and say inappropriate
things to a girl.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.060
And then they had to
restrain me to keep me

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.360
from going down to the school.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.660
[ Laughter ]

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.890
[laughter] Because I was just-I
needed him to process this

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.700
and walk through this on his own.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.900
But, he learned from it.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.490
He learned the value and
the meaning of friendship.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.450
But he still, at almost 19,
struggles with this theme.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.890
So, that was part of what
we talk about in the book

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.360
in several chapters,
and also what we talk

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.210
about on the show as
he moves forward.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.930
So, here's the spoiler alert.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.230
Because you all came I'm going to
share this information with you,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.450
so act like you didn't
see it in February.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.820
But the cool thing is that because
of a scene in the whole theme

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.160
of finding R.J. a job
in For Peete's Sake,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:25.070 position:56%
someone from the Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball team reached out and saw us

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.740
on the show, because he
saw the show, and he said,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.070
"Does R.J. really need a job

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.420
because I think we have
something here for him."

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.270
And so we were like, "Yeah.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.640
I mean, it was real.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.940
He really is looking for a gig."

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.440
And so they said, "Bring him
down to the Dodgers Stadium."

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.870
So me and Rodney bought him

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.040
down like it was his
first day of kindergarten.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.420
And we bought him down there

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.960
and we literally thought we
were just having a meeting,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.990 position:56%
and they sent him down to the
equipment room, they dressed him up,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.610
and now he works at the
clubhouse at the Dodgers.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.910
And so now-

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.210
[ Applause ]

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.510
-- he is-

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.810
[ Applause ]

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.110
-- got this great gig.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.410
[ Applause ]

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.700
It is unbelievable this job for
him and what it has done for him.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.700
I get the chills just
thinking about it.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.340
And the best part of that picture-I
can't zoom in with this clicker,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.360
is the look on his twin
sister's face in the background.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.170
She is so proud of him, and was so
concerned about her leaving going

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.310
to New York from L.A., leaving him
alone, and now he has something.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.280
Because I have to tell you when she
got the whole process of college,

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.000
it really sort of is that reminder
that, oh yeah, he is different,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.850
he's not going to college
like she is.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.310
And so for him to have
something cool for himself.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.230
But this job has given him such
a sense of, I mean he walks

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.600
out with his hands on his hips
and he swaggers, he just swagger.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.940
And so last night at the
Dodgers I just tweeted something

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.330
about the Dodgers, like
it was the end of the,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.160
it's the end of the regular season,
and I said, you know thank you

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.940
to the Dodgers for embracing
our family, ya da da da da.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:20:00.740 position:56%
And one of the Dodgers subtweeted
me and he wrote, "Thank you for R.J.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.100
because he makes the clubhouse,
like he gives us energy.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.690
He's better for us than
I think we are for him."

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.990
Yeah it was pretty awesome.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:13.230
So, that's-listen, he comes
in at midnight after working

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.560
because he gets there
three hours before the team

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.140
and he leaves two hours,
two or three hours after.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.260
I mean, it is a job.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.440
And he comes home, I mean, the
only thing he doesn't do is go

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.040
to the fridge for a beer.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.340
He comes in with his lunch box.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.640
[ Laughter ]

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.980
Like, you know, he's like
[laughter]-and he wants to talk.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.730
You know he wants to talk
about his experience.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.080
And so you know if
it's midnight or 1:00,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.500 position:56%
you know when you're sleeping you
can feel somebody standing over you,

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.800
you're just like, I'm like-

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.100
[ Laughter ]

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.400
"Yes, R.J."

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.700
He goes, "Mom, can you wake up."

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.000
Now, this is a kid who couldn't
talk before, so I am obliged

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.300
to wake up and talk to him.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.600
[ Laughter ]

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.900
[laughter] So.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.200
[ Applause ]

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.500
Yeah. So, I mean I
can't what can you say?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.950
No, I don't want to talk?

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.380
So-but he shares so much more.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.070
He's connected so much more.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.600
And this is a blessing for us, OK?

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.470
We are a privileged family.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.620
Listen, the elf in the room,
you know Rodney played football.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.260
I've been on t.v. all these
years, and we have fought for him.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.150
We are very resourceful.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.250
But what-the Dodgers hiring him
means to me and the bigger picture,

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.000
not just for my kid, is
these kids are hirable.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.470
That they can work
in big corporations,

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.160
and that everyone needs
to make room for them

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.290
because they have amazing skills.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.700
So-oh, what is that?

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.010
OK, well-that slipped in there.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.410
[ Laughter ]

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:30.710
That's from my 50th birthday party.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.010
How'd that get in there?

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.310
[ Laughter ]

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.610
OK. All right.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.910
Bobby, was that you?

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.210
No, you did a great job.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.510
Thank you so much.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.650
So, I wanted to rush through
this because I wanted to get

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.440
through to a Q and A. I
really-it's really important

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:49.680 position:56%
for me-I actually get more from
you-like the Dodgers with R.J.-I get

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.090
so much from hearing from you and
the things you're experiencing,

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.880
so please if you have any
questions, I would love to hear

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.170
from you, comments, anything.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.510
I think-how much time do we have?

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.810
Ten minutes?

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.440
So, if you would like to come up
and the microphones are right here.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.740
Please feel free.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.060
And you can ask any questions.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.510
You can ask about 21
Jump Street and-

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.200
[ Laughter ]

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.500
-- anything you want.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.800
Yes, mahm?

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.340
&gt;&gt; I'm a teacher in a high school

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.910
and I run a program
for kids with autism.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:28.110
So many of my parents find it
hard to accept them as they are

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.590
and think all my kids
are going to college.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.920
Not all the kids I teach
are going to college,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.050
are going to go to college.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:40.320
How did you come to accept
R.J. for who he is and not say,

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.200
he's going to college
like everybody else.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.500
How did you do that?

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.330
&gt;&gt; Well, you know I'll use
the example of my husband

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.460
because he was deeply, deeply
steeped in denial for many years

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.270
to the point where I really, really
had to say to him, you know what,

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.120
you can go, because I have
to get this kid going,

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.700 position:56%
and you are holding me back because
you're not able to accept who he is.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.140 position:56%
There's a moment in everyone's life
where you realize you can't control,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.290
you can't control things,
and things that are

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.430
out of control you have
to make the best of.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:19.600
I think with R.J. and with any
kid who is-who has a difficulty

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:26.200
in experiencing life, I always say
I can't-I wouldn't change my kid

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.590
for the world, but I would
change the world for my kid,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.990
or I would try to change the world.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.430
So, how about we just
allow them to be different

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.760 position:56%
and think outside the box and try to
give them something that, you know,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.710
stop trying to squeeze them
and put them in our narrative.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:45.910
So, the conversation of his
twin sister going to college

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.170
and he's not going to college
that was a sobering moment

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:52.210
because in my mind I knew it,
but I never really admitted it.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.500 position:56%
So, I think it's just allowing them
to be who they are and understanding

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.010
who they are and coming
into their world.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.080
Thank you so much for the
work that you're doing.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.380
Yes, mahm.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.680
&gt;&gt; Yes, hi.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.980
I'd just like to first of all say,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.470
hi to you because I had-my
father had Parkinson's,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.240
and I also have a 20
year old son with autism.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.540
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.070
&gt;&gt; So I think I've gone through a
lot of what you've gone through.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.370
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.010
&gt;&gt; My son actually did
make it to college,

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.240
but I worry about him
all the time, believe me.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.000
But, I just want to ask you do you
think Parkinson's, not Parkinson's,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.550
autism, they keep saying it gets
diagnosed more and more every year,

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:34.730
do you think we're just diagnosing
it more, or do that many kids just,

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.650
is it really that more
than it used to be?

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.980
&gt;&gt; I mean my personal feeling, and
everyone has an opinion I'm sure,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.220
but my personal feeling is that
there's some kind of environmental,

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.240
there's some kind of
genetic predisposition

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.430
that we haven't identified,
and that it's triggered

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.440 position:56%
by some kind of environmental thing.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.470
I do think we're diagnosing it
better but the prevalence is flying

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.760
up so high I think
there's some piece of this

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.930
that we're not looking
at for some reason.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.980
So yeah, that's just my opinion.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I
have an older sister

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.650
who they didn't say she had autism

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.420
because that was back
in the 50's and 60's.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.720
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.020
&gt;&gt; They told my parents she was,

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.580
and the termed they used
back then, mentally retarded.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.880
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.180
&gt;&gt; Which [inaudible].

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.480
Well, thank you.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.780
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.080
Good luck to your son.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.380
Hi.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a middle school special
educator and I want to say thank you

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.690 position:56%
because our general population needs
to see more books like this to know

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.500
that everybody's an individual,

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.730
and it just gives me
goosebumps, so thank you.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.700
&gt;&gt; Aww, thank you so much.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.000
Thank you.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.300
I really appreciate that.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.600
Yes.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.900
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.200
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.500
&gt;&gt; Just FYI, you and I are
besties in my head because-

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.800
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.100
[ Laughter ]

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.400
&gt;&gt;-- because we have
so much in common.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt;Well, we can talk later and maybe-

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.300
&gt;&gt;-- and make it real.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.600
[ Laughter ]

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My son is 18, diagnosed at three.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.200
I've been married for 19 years.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.500
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.800
&gt;&gt; You know, lots of things.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.100
So in my head, we know each other.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.400
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.700
[ Laughter ]

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; With that being said, my question
is around sort of what's going

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.830
on in the world with being a
black male in this country.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.130
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.430
&gt;&gt; My son's 18.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.730
He's autistic.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.030
He's not very verbal.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.310
And so I have to send him
out into the world every day

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.210
without those skills, verbal
skills, social skills,

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:18.030 position:56%
and how to handle stimulus and other
people, and how they perceive him.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.330
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You know, how do you, how do you
approach that with your son in terms

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.620
of preparing him to be a black
man in this country right now,

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.080
and then also have special needs?

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.870
&gt;&gt; Well, we did an episode on that
for For Peete's Sake very early

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:37.200
on when we talked about
how do we send our son

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.520
out without understanding-and
see you

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.820
in the room probably already know

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.160
that our kids don't
process social cues

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.930
in the same way as
a typical kid would.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.600
So, the idea of put your hands
up or do this or do that.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.690
So we ran him through drills.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.430
I mean like drills.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.500
You know, over and over again.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.830
And he was awesome with it.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.190
You know? He was like, "OK, Mom.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.560
OK, Mom, I got it."

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.440
Because we'd been doing this
with him for many years.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.810
The problem is when he comes back
and he says, "OK, I just watched

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.060
that video and he complied like you
told me, but he still got shot."

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.660
&gt;&gt; So, that's rough.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.960
I'm like, "Hold on.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.260
Go talk to your dad."

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.560
[ Laughter ]

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.200
So, these are issues
that we're dealing with,

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.660
not just with our special kids but
with all kids, all of our kids.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.870 position:56%
And so we just keep talking to them.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.170
We keep the dialogue open.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.470
We keep talking them.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.160
What I don't want are my
kids to become cynical..

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.460
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.860
&gt;&gt; I want them to feel like
they can call the police.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.160
They can connect with the police.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.000
You know I don't want them to have
this us against them mentality.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.150
So I really try to bridge that
gap, but I want to keep it real

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.450
with them at the same time.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.750
And they need to understand.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.860
And I think on the clip, I wish
I had thought I had that clip,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.810
but on the clip where I talk
to my son about his interaction

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.240
with police, I said, what do
you do if they come to you.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.540
And he said, "Reach into my pocket,

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.840
and get my phone, and
call my mommy."

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.140
I was like, "No, no, no, no, no."

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.440
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.740
[ Laughter ]

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.040
&gt;&gt; That's not what you do.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.340
So, but these are the
things that we get

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.110
from having conversations
and continuing.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.620
Now my son has verbal
abilities but he still stumbles

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.760
and he still-a little bit.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.340
If you have a nonverbal child

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.310
or a verbally challenged
child it is really difficult.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.070
It's hard to relax.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.340
So I understand, but just
keep having the conversations.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.640
OK, that's [inaudible].

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.420
&gt;&gt;[laughter] Nice meeting you.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.720
Yes, mahm.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.020
&gt;&gt; That's actually my friend too.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.320
[laughter]

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, OK.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.920
[ Laughter ]

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.220
&gt;&gt; So, we're all in the same club.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.580
&gt;&gt; But I actually have three kids
and two, my two boys have autism.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.880
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.190
&gt;&gt; So, I have a 10 year old,
who's moderate to severe.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.970
He's not really-he will say words.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.030
He has echolalia, repeating words.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.450
And he has his little ACC device.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.750
He's learning that.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:49.110
And then my 12, soon to be
13 year old has Aspergers.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.410
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.710
&gt;&gt; So he talks as much as R.J. now.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.010
[laughter]

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And my thing is-because I have a
slew of questions, but the one thing

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.200
for me is how do I stop apologizing

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.040
for the youngest one
you know outburst

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.490
in church and things like that.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:07.370
Or how do I stop being like when
people are looking at my kids

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.340
as if they're having a fit
and they're terrible kids,

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.720
and I want to look at
them and be like, what?

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.020
[laughter]

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.320
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.620
&gt;&gt; What are you looking at?

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.920
&gt;&gt; Well that just comes
from advocating because,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.130
and that's literally one of the
reasons why we wrote these books.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.500
We want the world to be a
little bit more tolerant

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.610
of special kids, right?

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.880
So when I'm in the supermarket
or my kid's acting out, you know,

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.670
I mean your first, the
first thought is, oh,

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.560
that kid needs to be
disciplined more.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.440
How come you let-can't
you control your child?

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.300 position:56%
If I had a nickel for every time I
heard, can't you control your child,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.950
especially on an airplane
because R.J. used

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.010
to just push the flight
attendant button.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.310
[ Laughter ]

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.610
Ding, ding, ding.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.910
Over and over again.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.210
Kicking the seat.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.940
But more than your regular
child that would kick the seat.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.790
I mean, and at first I was
angry about the judgment, right?

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.130
But then I realized, you know, not
everybody knows what's happening.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.540
And they don't-I didn't know
what autism was before I was

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.840
diagnosed-had the diagnosis,

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.820
so I needed to be more
compassionate towards people

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.120
that don't understand.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.290
And I find that you get a lot
more, "Oh, I didn't know."

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.240
So when he was kicking the
seat, "My son has autism

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.740
and he kind of can't help it."

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.040
"I'll move over here.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.340
I'll try to hold his legs."

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.470
Or I try to book a seat
that has a bulk head

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.690
so that there's no, you know?

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.900
But, it's a tough world out there.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.000
And you know, your son that is
dealing with, your youngest son

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.740
who with the outburst
at church whatever,

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.870 position:56%
we have to just keep enlightening
the community, and letting them know

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.370
that he's special and
that's what he does.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.160
Now your older child, the
Asperger thing is very interesting

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.460
because these are kids that
quote u unquote don't look

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.690
like they have autism, and
they're actually quite brilliant,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.480
and they're super verbal, but
they're socially disconnected.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.350
They can't look you in
the eye and make a friend.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.020 position:56%
So, it's hard, and those are
difficult things to try and explain.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.320
But the more we talk about it,

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.420
the more conversations we have
the more people will understand.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.290
Good luck with you babies.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.890
&gt;&gt; OK. Hi.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:04.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a part of an organization
called Best Buddies and we work

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.410 position:56%
with pairing children with different
abilities with other children.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.640
And so I was just wondering if
you had any advice on like how

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.780
to explain autism to someone who
doesn't have experience with it?

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.950
&gt;&gt; That's a really good
question and I love Best Buddies.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.290
I love doing work with them.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:20.910
Such a great organization.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.000
And especially when they start
working with kids with autism.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.810
It's just a great organization.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:32.560
You know I just explain autism
as you know being just different.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.290
And you know, not to push the
book, the same but different.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.760 position:56%
You know, it's just, there's a world
that they have and we just have

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.800
to stop and come into that world.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.170
And I think that kids with
autism can teach you so much

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.230
about who you are, and
teach you patience.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:53.030
But, as I said earlier, if
you've met one kid with autism,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.220 position:56%
you've only met one kid with autism.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.810
I would just say, just
you know, stop,

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.730
be patient, try to learn about it.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.010
And also try to give back

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.450
to a family that's experiencing
something like autism.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.800
So, for instance, it maybe
that they just need you

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.200
to babysit their other
kids for a day.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.780
It maybe they need something.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.830
It's hard to put in words because
autism is such a wide spectrum,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.460
but the fact that you're working
with Best-how old are you?

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.190
&gt;&gt; I'm 15.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.930
&gt;&gt; And you work with Best Buddies?

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My high school
has a chapter.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's awesome.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.010
Well, we need more 15
year olds like you.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.310
[ Applause ]

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.610
&gt;&gt; -- to work with-

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.910
[ Applause ]

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.300
-- to get the word out because
that's really what it is.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.150
It's getting the word out,
especially with younger kids.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.010
I think we have one more question.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.310
Time for one more question.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.290
By the way, if you all are in line

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.650
and I see there are some great
people in line, please feel free

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.960
to either find me on
my HollyRod website.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.330
I answer all the questions.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.140
Or, on social media,
I'm at HollyRPeete

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.000
on all social media channels.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.780
And today if you hashtag
National Book Fest,

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.080
I will respond directly to you.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.870
Yes, mahm.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:07.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to say I have three
kids, two twins, a boy and girl,

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.000
but my daughter is the
one who has autism.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.530
And so, one of the questions,
or I think one of the things

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.710
that is not always
addressed or looked

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.090
at is the impact on
the other children.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.730
&gt;&gt; And how you deal with
not letting it be always

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.900
about the child with the autism.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.200
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.110
&gt;&gt; I wanted to know in your
family how you dealt with that.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.200
&gt;&gt; Really go out of our
way to schedule time one

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.610
on one with the other kids.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.150
I mean, just we have to
have that one on one time

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.090
where it's just you and them.

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.520
And so your child with
autism is not present.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.950
You have that relationship.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.350
There's that special thing
that you do with that other,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.940
with that sibling so that they
don't feel-I mean my daughter,

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.870
my youngest kids used to say,
"Boy, I wish I had autism,

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.880
you'd pay more attention to me."

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.990
You know. I mean, those are
the things that you hear.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.330
That's real.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.390
You know, but the reality is
you have to make that connection

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.180
and make that, carve that
time out in any way you can,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.990
even if it's just going to the park
or just taking a quick field trip.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.920
And just one more question
because we have a-

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.090
&gt;&gt; It's not a question, we
just wanted to say hello.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.390
We follow you.

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.640
This is my Robert, my R.J.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh, R.J. Wait Robert is his name?

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.620
&gt;&gt; Robert.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.920
&gt;&gt; Hi, Robert.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.220
&gt;&gt; He just wanted to say hello.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.910
We follow you on social media.

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.660
We love the show.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.770
&gt;&gt; Just come a little closer.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.070
We can't hear you.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.520
&gt;&gt; So much from watching the show.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.810
So much of our lives mirror yours.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.370
&gt;&gt; Do you all live here locally?

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.670
&gt;&gt; No.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.970
&gt;&gt; We're in North Carolina.

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.270
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.570
&gt;&gt; We're in North Carolina, but
we just want to say thank you

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.950
for the inspiration,
you, and R.J., and Ryan,

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.490
because he has a sister
Kendall, back-

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.800
&gt;&gt; Just a little closer,
we want to hear.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.410
&gt;&gt; 10 year old Kendall back
there who is his protector.

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:48.710
She's his-

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.010
&gt;&gt; Are they twins?

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.310
&gt;&gt; -- best friend.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.610
They're not.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.910
They're two years apart.

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:55.210
He's 16. But he absolutely
was so excited to get

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.510
in here and see you today.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.810
So, thank you.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.110

&gt;&gt; I'm signing books at 4:30,
so I hope to see you all there.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:08.210
Thank you.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:09.510
This has been awesome.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:10.810
What's that?

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.110
Oh.

I don't know what that
means, but line three.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.610
Ya'll you know.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.910
I don't need to know.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.210
Someone will take me there.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.510
But, thank you so much.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.810
This just was a great-I tell
you I get more from you,

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.110
and I appreciate just the
energy that you give me,

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.410
and I appreciate it so much.
