so that's I think that's a case where if
you turned that the cities are where the

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:18.980
you turned that the cities are where the
 

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.310
you turned that the cities are where the
action is on that one and that's one

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:21.320
action is on that one and that's one
 

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.860
action is on that one and that's one
that I think we get we've sub optimized

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:23.870
that I think we get we've sub optimized
 

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.330
that I think we get we've sub optimized
by thinking about it too much on a

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:25.340
by thinking about it too much on a
 

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.020
by thinking about it too much on a
national basis to politicizing well

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:29.030
national basis to politicizing well
 

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.860
national basis to politicizing well
definitely that yeah right lemme poses a

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:32.870
definitely that yeah right lemme poses a
 

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.810
definitely that yeah right lemme poses a
second question which rolls into that

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:34.820
second question which rolls into that
 

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.410
second question which rolls into that
particular question you're known for

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:38.420
particular question you're known for
 

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.950
particular question you're known for
putting in programs and strategies that

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960
putting in programs and strategies that
 

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.070
putting in programs and strategies that
actually get executed on the ground as

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:45.080
actually get executed on the ground as
 

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.300
actually get executed on the ground as
you're moving forward and you're putting

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:49.310
you're moving forward and you're putting
 

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:52.600
you're moving forward and you're putting
in programs and plans and strategies now

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:52.610
in programs and plans and strategies now
 

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.240
in programs and plans and strategies now
that will be executed in two three four

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:55.250
that will be executed in two three four
 

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:58.180
