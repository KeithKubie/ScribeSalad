00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.260
How to care for introverts.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.000
According to brain scans studies,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.860
introverts process information differently than other people

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.580
and are more likely to be misunderstood

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.900
as individuals who are too serious or too aloof,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.800
or too arrogant and rude.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.980
Therefore, it is crucial not only to understand introverts,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.540
but also to care for them.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.400
And here are five ways to do so.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.600
One, make them feel accepted for who they are.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.780
Introverts accept themsleves as who they are.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.520
But at times, they wish they were more social like other people.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.060
Nevertheless, introversion is not something that people need to outgrow,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.160
but something they have to learn to accept and grow into.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.060
So extroverts should help introverts cherish who they are

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.920
by accepting their unique traits.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.420
Two, acknowledge them for their goodness.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.240
As introverts are generally caring and helping people,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.000
they expect to be appreciated for their kindness,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.560
thoughtfulness, and willingness to help others

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100
whether it's a social cause for someone unknown

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.500
or for family and friends.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.860
Though they do not expect the recipient to be grateful or thankful to them,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.560
they seek acknowledgement from those close to them.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.760
Introverts help others not to get recognition for their good works,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.960
but because it gives them a sense of satisfaction.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.600
Make them feel good for their good deeds.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.720
Three, do not push an introvert.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.240
Sometimes extroverts tend to push introverts to get out in the world.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120
This really doesn't work.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.600
An introvert may feel uncomfortable and unsuitable in a social situation,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.060
or hesitate to try new experiences and take more risks.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.960
Hence, it would not be wise to push an introvert.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.520
Until they are ready to challenge themselves or test their limits,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.040
They won't want to be pushed or rushed.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.740
Pushing introverts doesn't mean getting them to try new things or mingling with people,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.160
but also includes asking them to do stuff that they are not mentally comfortable with.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.960
Give them their time and space.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.400
Four, be ready to give back.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.700
Introverts are good listeners who are slow to speak but quick to listen.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.460
Whereas extroverts are good communicators who are quick to speak but slow to listen.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.260
But this doesn't mean that introverts don't want to be listened to aswell,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.660
even they need people whom they can share their thoughts with aswell.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.140
As introverts are good listeners,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.800
be considerate and give back by listening to them when they need you to.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.580
Five, accomodate introverts differences.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.200
The way introverts and extroverts think,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.720
feel, perceive and make decisions are varied.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.080
For instance,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.880
extroverts who are full of energy like to expend their energy by actively engaging in social activities.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.700
Hanging out with friends and seeking happiness.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.420
They can make statements like:

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.440
"live in the present" and "don't worry, be happy"

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.900
On the other hand,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.080
introverts expend their energy by living inside and spending time alone.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.820
This does not mean they don't enjoy going out.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.060
But they tend to do it in the company of their loved ones or close circle of friends.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.540
For them, the meaning of seeking happiness may be very different from what extroverts think it means.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.500
To introverts, being happy may include helping others,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
making others happy,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.320
or achieving a sense of satisfaction.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.120
So what do you think about these tips?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.200
If you consider yourself an introvert,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.560
do these help you?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.780
If you consider yourself an extrovert,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.320
do you find yourself doing these for your more introverted friends?
