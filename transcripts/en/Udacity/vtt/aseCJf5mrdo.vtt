Here's one final piece of advice before we dive into the code of

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.880
data visualizations.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.780
Be careful with color.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.520
Color can be a tricky component of data visualizations, but it can also encode

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.900
data and help you viewer understand what's most important about the graphic.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.960
Stephen has written an excellent article on practical tips on using color.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.640
I've included a link to it in the instructor notes.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.290
I'd like you to read this article and then answer this next question.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.620
Which of these statements is true about color?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.920
I want you to select any of the statements that apply.
