00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.210
So there are plenty of things we can do with big

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.630
data, but first we need to be able to store the data

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.240
in a cost effective way, and then process it efficiently. And it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.640
turns out, that's not easy to do, when we're talking about massive

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.240
amounts of data. Luckily, some smart people at Google were working on

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.930
this in the late 90s. They published some research papers, in 2003

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.570
and 2004. To learn more about that, let's talk to Doug Cutting,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.390
one of the founders of Hadoop, and the Chief Architect at Cloudera.
