00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.790
- [Announcer] This program is presented by

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.240
University of California Television.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.793
(mellow music)

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.540
- My name is Vince Resh.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.840
I'm professor of the graduate
school in the Department of

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.560
Environmental Science
Policy and Management,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.200
and I'm chair of the
Hitchcock Lecture Committee.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.060
We're pleased, along with
the graduate counsel,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.530
to present Dr. Ralph Cicerone,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.210
this year's speaker as the Charles M.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.883
and Martha Hitchcock lecture speaker.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.080
As a condition of the original bequest,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.780
we're obliged and happy to tell you about

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.310
how this endowment came to Berkeley

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.050
because it's a story that exemplifies

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.500
the many ways this campus is linked

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.620
both to the history of
California and to the Bay Area.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.500
Dr. Charles Hitchcock was
a physician for the US Army

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.620
who came to San Francisco
during the gold rush

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.560
and set up a private practice

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010
that was actually quite thriving.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.050
In 1885, he established a
professorship here at Berkeley

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.770
as an expression of his
long-held interest in education.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.770
His daughter, a very familiar
name, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.950
still treasured in San Francisco
for a colorful personality,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.730
as well as their generosity,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.400
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.900
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.140
making it possible for us to present

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.183
a series of annual lectures.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.410
The Hitchcock Fund has become

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.080
one of the most cherished
endowments of the university,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.980
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.970
of scholarly thought and achievement,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.200
and we really want to thank

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.920
both Lillie and Charles Hitchcock

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.520
for making this possible
for so many decades.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.930
And now, let me give you a few words

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.710
about our speaker, Dr. Cicerone.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.640
Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.180
of the National Academy of Sciences

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.810
and chair of the National
Research Council.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.930
His research is focused
on atmospheric chemistry,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.130
the radiative forcing of climate
change due to trace gases

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.770
and the sources of atmosphere
methane, nitrous oxide

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.160
and methyl halide gases.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.310
Cicerone has been credited
with shaping science

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.370
and environmental policy

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.370
both nationally and internationally.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.470
He received the 1990 Bauer award and prize

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.080
for achievement in science
from the Franklin Institute

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.570
for his fundamental contributions
to the understanding

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.950
of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.410
and for his public policy leadership

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.790
in protecting the global environment.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.230
In 2001, he led a National
Academy of Science study

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.010
on the current state of climate change

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.570
requested by President Bush.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.680
Dr. Cicerone notes that
in today's lecture,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.150
he'll use up-to-date data to illustrate

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.830
the driving forces of greenhouse gases

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.080
and contemporary climate change.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.780
Tomorrow, we'll hear the second
lecture in the same place

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.210
where he will compare
successful initiatives

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.640
to protect the ozone layer

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.890
with the to-date unsuccessful initiative

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.963
to stabilize global climate.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.950
A prolific author, Dr.
Cicerone has co-authored

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.450
scores of publications,
including the article

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.210
Trends of Extreme
Precipitation in Eastern China

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.830
and their Possible Causes.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.600
He's also contributed to a
wide variety of other articles,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.870
including Physiological,
Biochemical Controls

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.680
over Methyl Halide
Emissions from Rice Plants,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.330
and Biogeochemical Aspects
of Atmospheric Methane,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.670
a wide variety of topics.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.460
Our speaker holds a BS
in Electrical Engineering

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.370
from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.050
and a PhD from the University of Illinois.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.200
In 1970, he began his research career

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.680
at the University of Michigan

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.210
where the Ralph J. Cicerone

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.310
Distinguished University Professorship

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.420
of atmospheric sciences
was established in 2007.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.810
He performed further research

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.580
at Scripps Institute of Oceanography

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.000
at the University of California San Diego

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.410
and the National Center
for Atmospheric Research

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.170
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.670
In 1989, he joined the
University of California

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.810
Irvine faculty, where he
served as the founding chair

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230
of the Department of Earth System Science

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.950
and the Daniel G. Aldrich
professor of Earth System Science.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.420
He was also dean of the
School of Physical Science

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.720
and chancellor of the university.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.830
In 2005, he was elected the president

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.750
of the Academy of Sciences.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.903
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Cicerone to Berkeley.

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.153
(clapping)

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.490
- Well, thank you for
the kind introduction

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.770
and also the opportunity to
be here in the first place.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.950
I've already had a very stimulating day

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.090
meeting with some Berkeley students

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.910
and faculty members in research,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.290
and that it's really a fun
place as it always has been.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.330
I enjoyed hearing that brief history

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
of the Hitchcock influence here so,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.670
that was really endearing in a way

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.783
and shows the value of support, I hope.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.940
What I want to do today,
as Dr. Resh just mentioned,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.333
tomorrow, I'm going to give a second talk,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.210
focused much more on how
the world is responding

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.760
to these physically identified
and measured challenges

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.610
to the the physical
environment that supports us.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.020
Today, I'm going to focus more

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.420
on the science behind climate change,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.270
largely showing data
of some key variables,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.200
what's actually being measured,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.340
and what do we know
and what we don't know,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.640
and then I'll end with a few comments

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.323
on how to advance that science.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.060
So, let me show you an outline
of what I want to do here.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.990
This is an outline of
what I'd like to cover.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.200
First of all, a concept that I think

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.230
is a really good organizing concept

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.630
for trying to understand the
climate of this entire planet.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.810
It's largely a global scale argument

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.120
but it's physically sound.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.570
Then I'll get right into the data,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.430
things that are being measured,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.450
the observed changes in recent decades

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.250
in important variables,
the temperature of air

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.893
the temperature of water,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.180
the budget of the ice masses hung up

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.430
on the continents of
Greenland on Antarctica,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.990
a little bit about sea ice,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.990
sea-level rise, Arctic sea
ice, and then a reminder

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.380
of what one of the
major driving forces is,

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.880
human use of energy from fossil fuels,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.933
and then some comments about
moving the science forward,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.220
because an ultimate goal of this science

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.510
is not only to understand and to measure

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.990
what's happening and detect the changes,

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.050
but to try to anticipate what's coming

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.340
so that human adaptation as
well as mitigation efforts

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.733
can come into play more effectively,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.930
and then, of course, try
to predict those changes

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.480
at the same time.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.970
So, the first concept is simply that

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.120
the energy balance of the planet

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.940
controls the Earth's climate.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.990
This is not an astounding observation,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.260
but it's an organizing framework

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.920
that really allows us to
focus on important variables

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.720
and to measure just how far away

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.200
from a static situation
we are, for example.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.410
So, this is more or less a
cartoon looking at the Earth

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.850
with the Sun not to scale,

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.160
but to a very good first approximation,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.330
very good approximation.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.550
The energy budget of the Earth is balanced

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.210
by incoming sunlight,
largely visible sunlight,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.260
some infrared, that's important,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.040
and outgoing radiation from the planet,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.563
which is planetary infrared radiation.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.250
So, the balance is, these
quantities have been measured

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.250
fairly well to within 1% of
almost everything I show here.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.180
Coming in from the Sun on average

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.990
is 341 watts per meter squared

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.230
so it's energy per unit
time per meter squared

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.389
and about a little bit less than 1/3,

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:39.040
30% of that energy, 102
watts per square meter

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.410
is reflected back out to space

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.040
before it's ever received
by the Earth's surface

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.620
by white things, by light-colored objects,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.210
whether it's clothing or whether it's ice

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.920
and reflective water.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.810
So the net, 341 minus 102
watts per square meter,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.630
is the net incoming radiation from the Sun

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.630
and the outgoing is, as
I said, infrared light

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.190
at 239 watts per square meter.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.430
And these two quantities
are remarkably well-balanced

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.130
from all the measurements
that have been made

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.410
largely by Earth-orbiting satellites.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.180
The shuffling around of that energy,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.950
once it's absorbed by the
dark surfaces on the Earth

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.540
and re-emitted and in the form of either

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.110
measurable or infrared radiation,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.970
bounces around here and
it maintains a temperature

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.780
where the Earth's surface is higher than

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.090
that of the atmosphere and so forth,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.230
and the numbers are fairly
well-known on average.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.760
So, to a first approximation,
that's the budget

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.060
and anything that can be
done to perturb that budget

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.760
is capable of changing the
climate, either towards,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.960
let's say, a planetary
average lower temperature

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.283
or a higher temperature.

00:10:01.013 --> 00:10:05.040
This picture, this graph,
was created in 1972

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.941
from one of the first
Earth-orbiting satellites

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:12.560
that was looking down at
the Earth in the infrared.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.533
And what it shows is, as
a function of wavelength,

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.810
10 micrometers and so forth,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.010
how much radiation was seen

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.660
by the satellite looking
down on the Earth,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.710
and if the Earth were radiating

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.700
just as a blackbody radiator,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.880
you would have these curve, dashed curve

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.830
if the temperature were 300 Kelvin

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.010
or 27 degrees centigrade,

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.400
or if the Earth were very, very cold,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.750
you would get this curve,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.080
but what was actually
measured has structure in it

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.200
and they indicate the
presence of greenhouse gases

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.920
in the atmosphere, that is,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.830
chemicals that float around
in the air in gaseous form

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.050
that have the ability
to intercept outgoing

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.630
infrared radiation, this
energy that I referred to.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.623
So, this absorption is
mostly by atmospheric ozone.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.600
This absorption is due
to mostly carbon dioxide.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.830
In between, there's a lot
of water vapor absorption

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.830
so the point is, there's no mystery here.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.710
One can go into the laboratory and measure

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.460
the wavelength dependence of the way

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.340
these gases interact with
infrared light, for example,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.270
and do quantitative calculations,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.770
and you can calculate that
this is what you should see

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.340
looking down on the
Earth, things like that.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.170
So, just to do a rough calculation.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.010
This idea was pointed
out probably 40 years ago

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.810
that we can calculate the temperature

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.280
of different planets,
Earth, Venus and Mars,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.020
the ones that we know the best.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.243
So, for example, if you do
this calculation for Mars,

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.610
this equation applies in a steady state,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.420
that is, nothing's changing with time.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.810
We now know that things
are changing with time,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.860
but just to a first approximation,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.510
if you know the total amount
of sunlight energy coming in

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.260
and the fraction 30% is reflected,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.370
that means that 70%,
one minus point three,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.650
is absorbed by the
Earth and the atmosphere

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.510
that should be equal to
the outgoing radiation,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.030
which, in equilibrium, would be

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.260
the Sigma T to the fourth law,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.560
so, S is measured, alpha is measured,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.340
Sigma is a constant, you
can calculate temperature

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.310
just by taking the fourth
root of the equation

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.030
and you get, for Mars,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.690
that the temperature is something like

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.910
minus 28 degrees centigrade,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.430
and it's the right answer
within a few degrees

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.410
if you averaged over day and night.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.680
If you do the same calculation for Earth,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.330
you don't calculate the right number,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.520
you calculate that Earth

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.590
is freezing everywhere all the time.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.350
And what's missing here
is the greenhouse effect

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.440
of the gases that I just mentioned.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.490
Mars has a very thin
low pressure atmosphere.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.210
There's not much in the atmosphere

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.300
that interferes with the light coming in

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.720
or the infrared going out,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.300
so you can calculate
Mars in this simple way,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.730
the temperature very accurately.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.820
With Earth, as I said, you miss by

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.110
about 50 degrees centigrade.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.700
And for Venus, you really miss

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.180
because the atmosphere
of Venus is very thick,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.700
pressure, 100 times that of Earth

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.230
loaded with carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.720
So this calculation illustrates that

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.110
right away, you're pretty
close to the right answer

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.200
just by including greenhouse
effect and clouds.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.470
Well, why is all this important?

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.900
Because we know now that
the chemical composition

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.170
of Earth's atmosphere is changing.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.080
This is the iconic series of data

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.130
taken mostly by people

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.850
at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.740
David Keeling, who's now deceased,

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.460
and his son who's a professor there,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.410
Ralph Keeling has
continued the measurements.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.080
Every black dot, if you can see it,

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.590
represents the average of measurements

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.790
of carbon dioxide in air

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.890
up the slopes of Mauna Loa

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.890
on the Big Island of Hawaii,

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.010
sampled every one hour.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.120
So every black data point, as
I said, is the monthly average

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.240
of measurements made every hour.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.390
And what you see is the
underlying trend has gone up

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.910
starting from 312 parts
per million in 1957

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.380
up to about 400 last year.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.330
Although this graph
was updated in January,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.300
the red curve is the
same kind of measurements

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.650
from the South Pole.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.240
So there's a few months
lag time when they ship

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.663
these little containers
of gas back-and-forth.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.010
On top of that underlying rise

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.460
is this annual cycle wiggling

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.100
of the carbon dioxide amounts,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.600
which is really quite beautiful

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.750
and it's telling us something

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.400
about the Earth as a living planet.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.040
In the summer and spring, for example,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.120
the northern hemisphere months,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.350
when photosynthesis is
happening in green plants

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.580
and algae and water bodies

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.830
are sucking in carbon
dioxide for photosynthesis,

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.690
the carbon dioxide amount is drawn down

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.653
and then in the fall and winter,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.130
subsequent respiration and decay of that,

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.500
some of that new organic
matter takes place.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.180
So every year, there's an annual cycle,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.790
drawing down CO2, reintroducing CO2

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.800
into the atmosphere, on and on and on.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.590
There's an offset from the South Pole

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.460
for other explainable technical reasons

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.260
and there's not much land
surrounding the South Pole

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.030
so the air that one samples doesn't show

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.100
this kind of seasonal wiggles.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.350
There isn't much
photosynthesis there at all

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.963
even in the surrounding waters.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.410
Okay, let's now get down to variables

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.900
that are being observed that tell us

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.890
something about climate change.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.733
First of all, air temperatures.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.120
In another slide, I'll show you the names

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.610
of some Berkeley people who've done

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.510
some similar analysis, but first of all,

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.990
this temperature scale, zero
does not mean zero degrees.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.160
It means a reference point,
and that reference point

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.400
is the average of all
the temperatures measured

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.400
between 1950 and 1980, so
it's a 30-year data set

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.150
which is used to establish an average

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.200
and in this case, the
average was 1950 to 1980,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.040
so zero corresponds to the
average of this 30-year period.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.660
Anything that's negative from that zero

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.480
represents times when the
Earth's temperature on average

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.940
averaged over all
latitudes and longitudes,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.030
day and night, was lower than the zero

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.260
and of course, in later
years, beginning about 1975,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.280
the measurements of these air temperatures

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.030
have gone up more or less monotonically.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.310
There are a few hundred million
data points in this data set

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.730
and the statistics are pretty good.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.290
You'll see that the record year of 2015

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.810
really was high compared
to all previous years.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.970
A previous El Nino year

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.960
when the eastern tropical
Pacific waters are warm

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.100
was 1998, which was also a high year

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.360
but the underlying trend again

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.670
is increasing air temperatures
all over the world.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.070
There are several other laboratories.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.700
These data happen to come
from a NASA laboratory

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.860
in New York City, or the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.310
which is the reference here, which you can

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.010
pull these off of their website any time.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.410
Very well-documented,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.490
all the changes in the
record are explained.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.680
Any so-called corrections to the data,

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.480
adjustments to the data stream,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.920
are explained in great
detail, very well-documented.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.220
And there are three or
four labs around the world

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.400
who do similar work with
slightly different approaches

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.150
and different data sets, and
I'll mention that in a minute.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.620
Just to show you the kind
of detail that's available

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.080
to start to break this down,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.803
because a global average temperature,

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.720
in the words of someone one time long ago,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.170
he said, "That doesn't
make my knuckles white."

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.590
He didn't know how to respond to that.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.850
So, a global average
temperature is relevant

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.840
because of the framework that I mentioned,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.950
the concept of a planetary energy balance,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.750
but it doesn't really tell
us a lot about what's coming.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.840
The Berkeley Earth temperature
project which I mentioned

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.310
examined the same kind of
data over a period of years,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.880
and overlaid over the previous
data of the NASA data,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.680
you'll see that they obtained
very, very similar results

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.010
but with very different approaches.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.410
They used different data sets.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.020
They tried to introduce
different ways of correction

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.810
for things like the
urban heat island effect.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.800
In many of the places, for example,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.800
in developed countries
like the United States

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.250
where temperature recording
instruments have been put out,

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.990
cities have grown around them

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.600
and surrounded the place with black top,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.930
and you can see the
urban heat island effect

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.390
all over the world.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.750
And this Berkeley project
led by Rich Muller

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.360
but also the other people listed here,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.670
not all of whom were from Berkeley,

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.170
they tried to see what the
sensitivity of the record is

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.280
if they cut the data up
into different pieces,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.670
removed individual
stations from the record

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.413
of which they were suspicious,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.830
gave more weighting to the ones

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.910
that looked like they were
well-maintained and so forth,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.490
and on this scale, the
results are the same,

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.150
at least on the global
average temperature.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.070
This is a very valuable
project that was performed here

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.090
that I think answered a lot of
serious questions very well.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.110
Now let's break the data down a little bit

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:06.930
into all land and ocean
areas north of the equator,

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.930
northern hemisphere, annual
mean versus southern hemisphere.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.350
And you'll see that the
northern hemisphere in the red

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:20.350
has warmed up more than the
southern hemisphere in blue.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.610
Now, that's logical because
the southern hemisphere

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.913
has more ocean area in it

00:20:27.913 --> 00:20:29.840
than the northern hemisphere does,

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.210
so the heat capacity near
the surface is greater.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.010
And if, for example, this is being forced,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.370
these changes are being forced

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.740
by the physical imposition of new energy

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.290
like this greenhouse
effect that's growing,

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.340
you would expect to see a lag

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.520
that the southern hemisphere
would warm more slowly.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.670
So not only are these data real

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.180
but they seem to be consistent

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.770
with the underlying premise here.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.040
If you break those data down further

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.410
and these are now surface temperatures

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.570
measured at different
places around the world,

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.820
so here's an outline of South America,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.940
North America, Africa, and so forth,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.170
you can see the outlines
with false color codings

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.080
showing three of the warmest winters

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.690
in this 135-year record.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.030
The 2015 was the warmest at all

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:25.550
and you'll see the preponderance
of really hot areas

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.530
where the temperature is four
or five degrees centigrade

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.190
warmer than the average
period over an entire year

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.730
and a little bit of cooling,

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.860
and part of the Antarctic sector.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.430
Most parts of the world though are showing

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.913
excess warmth, higher temperatures.

00:21:43.626 --> 00:21:45.690
When you plot 10 or 20 years together,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.710
you find that there's
virtually no place on the Earth

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.590
that has remained at its average

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.670
or as below average, everything is up.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.460
So 2015 looked like this,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.360
2010 was like this,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.990
even more pronounced warming

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.550
over this part of the
Arctic, and so forth.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.430
There's a month-by-month
record of this anomaly.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.920
Again, that is the amount
over the 30-year average

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.880
and it shows the hottest years.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.400
So, for example, 2014 in green

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.760
shows the global average
temperature month-by-month,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.700
September, October, November,
December and so forth,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.270
and some ups and downs during the year.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:30.270
2015, the record for any month before 2015

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.770
as this black line, and then in 2015,

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.770
records were set over the
135-year period of observations

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.500
for the months of October,
November, December

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.420
and they continued into
January of this year.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.670
So this is now a plot of
January mean surface temperature

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.060
over these parts of the world

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.610
where now this pink is the hottest of all.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.120
Parts of the Arctic are 10
and 12 degrees centigrade

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.700
above the 30-year average.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.680
This turns out to be a puzzle.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.280
It's hard to say why
the Arctic is warming up

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.623
maybe twice as fast as
anybody expected it to.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.950
So the point is these data are available

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.540
pretty much on a monthly basis.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.730
You can track these things
and in even more detail

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.350
because most of the
significance of climate change

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.650
impact on humans and
ecosystems and so forth

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.410
will be regional in individual locations,

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.690
but this globally averaged picture

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:35.340
and the geographical projection,

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.440
different parts of the world,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.010
is still interesting to understand.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.610
So here's January of 2016

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.880
compared to all previous hot Januarys.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.203
It's way out there.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.600
Now, temperatures of ocean.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.750
It's harder to get really tight data

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.050
on ocean water temperatures

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.790
because they're not as well-sampled.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.690
The sampling is much coarser
geographically and in time,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.483
but over the last few years,

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.640
due to some very careful work,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.160
this graph happens to be
from somebody named Levitus

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.250
who's recently retired
from our National Oceanic

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.290
and Atmospheric Administration,

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.270
they have plotted the
change in the heat content

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.660
of water bodies around the world.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.150
This is a little bit
complicated, but zero would be

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.010
if there were no change
in the heat content.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.310
So, here is a graph of the
world ocean heat content

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.250
broken down, versus altitude
below the surface of the ocean

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:40.130
so the thermocline,
the body of ocean water

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.053
which is pretty well-mixed
above 700 meters,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.580
below that point, 700
meters below the surface,

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.370
has increased by a few hundredths

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:57.370
of 10 to the 22 joules per year

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.460
but you can see that
it's as if a heat pulse

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.920
is sinking now into the ocean.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.450
And it is seen first

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.583
at the lower depths, a few hundred,

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.390
the more shallow depths,

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.810
and it's propagating now
down into the deeper depths,

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.250
the greater depths, with time.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.630
And when you do the numbers
and add it up globally,

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.550
this amount of extra heat
that's being observed

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.160
by real measurements in the ocean

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.320
is compatible with the budget figures

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.620
that I'm showing you on
Earth's energy budget.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.600
This kind of data is now
becoming much more available

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.030
due to the invention of some
automated floating devices

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.700
which go around the world's oceans

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.740
and measure several things
about the ocean waters

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.820
and that they can bob up
and down under control

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.600
and sample great depths
and they do it repeatedly.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.880
It's a fantastic set of instruments,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.920
so these data sets are growing.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.370
These are some of the first
patterns that are emerging.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.800
These graphs may be a
little easier to see.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.240
It shows what's observed

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.200
in the zero to two kilometers depth,

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.150
so the increasing heat content,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.770
which is essentially temperature

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.120
with time at all depths.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.370
Again, the data are still coarse.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.460
There are some undersampled regions.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.250
In fact, this bar gives you a measure

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:28.250
of whether or not the
layers are being based

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.340
and what fraction of the
waters around the world

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.070
are being measured at various steps,

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.150
so these data are increasing.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.720
They also show a warming,
especially over the last 30

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.173
or 40 years, or 50 years,
all around the world.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.050
It's clear that the rate at which

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.860
the heat is being sucked
into the world's oceans

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.520
is not very predictable at this time.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.340
It happens somewhat sporadically
at different latitudes

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.890
but on average, the numbers
are looking pretty consistent

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.710
with all this other picture.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.130
You've probably seen photographs
or some kinds of measures

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:11.120
of the amount of ice
floating on the Arctic Ocean.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.120
Now that floating ice is not
serious in terms of sea level

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.410
because it's already floating.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.150
It changes from solid to liquid,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.080
it doesn't change the sea level,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.740
but from a point of view of navigation,

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.770
mineral exploration,
commerce, military security,

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.940
the amount of sea ice is important

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.909
and it's an interesting variable,

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:40.190
so these data are reported almost daily

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.930
from a remote sensing device

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.660
that has been operating since about 1980.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.900
So the gray plot here, the shadowed plot,

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.170
represents the amount of
sea ice measured in extent

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.550
millions of square
kilometers on the Arctic sea

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.830
plus or minus two standard
deviations of the average,

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.020
so if you take this 35-year
average of these measurements,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.820
they all fall within this gray band.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.310
2015-2016 is scraping the very bottom.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.390
It's down two standard
deviations or so from the average

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.820
and this is pretty much
typical of the last few years.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.260
2012 was also very low, a little
bit of recovery in between

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.260
but the new norm is the
Arctic sea ice disappearing.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.690
One of the plots that's
a little bit more telling

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.690
is take just the month of
January every year since 1979

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.890
and ask, how has the average
amount of ice in January

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.400
and the Arctic Ocean changed?

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.680
And it's going down monotonically.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.330
In fact, because of those
very high temperatures

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.750
seen in the Arctic that
I pointed out earlier,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:58.050
in the air temperatures
this January of 2016,

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.460
it's pretty low.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.080
There are similar plots for June

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.470
and they showed similar patterns,

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.099
that the amount of ice
floating in the Arctic

00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:10.000
is decreasing pretty well monotonically

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.950
over the entire period of measurements.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.030
There are other measurements

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.370
which I'm not going to show here

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.273
of the thickness of the sea ice,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.200
the ice that a submarine
would have to penetrate

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.340
to get out of the ocean.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.227
And due to some military
data from the U.S.

00:29:28.227 --> 00:29:31.720
and the former Soviet Union
that's been declassified,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.280
we can see about a 60% decrease

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.370
in the Arctic sea ice thickness

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.380
over the last 40 or 50 years.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.730
So these data are also consistent.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.570
The Antarctic is a little more complicated

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.060
and the data are not so clear

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.410
and I won't show them here.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.990
One of the most stunning measurements,

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.190
which I can explain a little
later but it takes more time,

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.790
is how the mass of ice on
Greenland and Antarctica

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.270
is being measured.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.670
It's done by remote
sensing with an instrument

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.630
that actually measures small perturbations

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:07.630
in the Earth's otherwise
spherical gravitational force.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.360
It's a very neat technical
setup and what they have shown,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.100
these data only go up to about 2014,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.700
is that there are seasonal changes

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.660
in the amount of ice on Greenland

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.980
but generally speaking, the
annual average has decreased

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.480
and it's decreased by, on average,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.260
260 gigatons of ice per year

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.130
that it is falling off
the Greenland continent

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.470
or melting directly into seawater.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.520
And if you'll notice,
that's an inverted parabola.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.260
It's not a straight line.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.770
It shows an acceleration
of the rate of loss

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.933
of about 30, I think it is,

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.723
yeah, 28 gigatons per year
per year as an acceleration.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.710
And these data are not only
really high-tech and well-done,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.810
but they're confirmed by other
measurements of the height

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.920
of the ice extending over
the Greenland continent.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.200
Similarly for Antarctica,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.610
this was just a huge drop in one year

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.870
but there were some recovery after that.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.130
These data are from Isabella
Velicogna and her colleagues.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.460
She's a physicist in my home department,

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.800
Earth System Science at Irvine.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.900
Her senior colleague,
John Warren, unfortunately

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.420
died a couple of about
eight months ago now,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.810
but this data set continues.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.990
Okay, when they look at Antarctica,

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.010
they find a similar picture
with more variability.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.120
Again, over the 12, 11-year period,

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.260
there's been a loss of the
ice mass on Antarctica.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.880
It's been not as strong, a
lot more annual variability.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.880
In fact, they can now
focus the instrument better

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.060
on sectors of Antarctica where they find

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.370
that there is one sector of Antarctica

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.380
which is not gaining ice,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.400
and that a major part of
Antarctica is losing ice

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.910
but it's more messy data.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.240
But they also find an accelerated loss

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.967
of mass and ice on Antarctica.

00:32:17.967 --> 00:32:20.560
Now the reason this is important is

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.270
when you lose ice from a continent

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.340
and put it in the ocean, sea-level rises.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.150
So if you add the
contribution to sea-level rise

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.270
of Greenland and Antarctica,

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.220
you've got numbers that
I'm getting to now,

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.933
which is pretty well explaining
the observed sea-level rise.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:42.180
This graph is a record of
rather old measurements

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.070
of sea-level over the
beginning of the 20th century

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.980
all the way through the 21st century.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.270
And most of these data in the black curve

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:55.133
were obtained by basically tide gauges,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.370
stakes and poles pounded
into the coastal environment,

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.913
fairly primitive instruments,

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.940
but very, very careful record-keeping

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.600
has allowed a reconstruction of sea-level

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.600
over the 20th century, about
110-year period up to 1992.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.200
If you average all of
these tide gauge records

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.080
from all over the world,
you see this indicator

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.230
of global sea-level rise.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:24.620
And there are certainly some spots

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.250
which are geologically
active, tectonically active,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:33.163
where the rise has been
less or more over time.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.180
The statistics of these measurements

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.870
are a little bit scattered,

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.950
but beginning in the year 1992,

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.480
Earth-orbiting satellites
with radar ranging devices

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.300
and some interferometry added to it

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.320
have shown the red part of the data,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.520
which is a somewhat
faster rise in sea-level,

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.410
which is a better global average,

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.083
much more precise, better sampling.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.043
It shows,

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.170
since 1992, here's what
that record looks like.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.140
The observed sea-level rise,

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.920
the best fit to the data, is about double

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.590
what I showed from the
old tide gauge record.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.580
It's three point three
millimeters per year

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.200
over this modern record of altimetry

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.810
from remote sensing satellites.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:28.000
So the question arises, has
sea-level rise accelerated

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.850
because the earlier result was about

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.720
one point six centimeters over 100 years,

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.660
or about one point six
millimeters per year

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.130
compared to this three point three double.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:47.320
Well, recently,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.540
a couple of people have analyzed

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.950
these old records and they think that

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.430
the statistics are a better fit

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:57.220
to a slower rate of sea-level rise here,

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:02.000
increasing more to match
the red modern observations.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.930
So it's a minor refinement,

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.310
but it adds evidence to the idea

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.053
that sea-level rise is accelerating.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:15.500
The budget now of where
the water is coming from

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.900
gives a pretty good first approximation

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.510
to this observed rate of sea-level rise.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.470
These data are also updated
every three or four months

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.390
by a group at University of Colorado

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:31.900
who are in charge of this
remote sounding instrument.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.630
And you can see that the last
few months have been higher

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.730
but the best fit to the
data will probably be

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.700
still about three point four,

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.763
three point five millimeters per year.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.320
Now, where does that come from?

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.980
The very fact that sea
surface temperatures

00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:51.280
are being warmed, the temperatures rising,

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.090
causes a thermal expansion
of layers of ocean

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.530
and that accounts for
maybe a third or a half

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.280
of this observed sea-level rise

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.450
over the last 30 to 40 years.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.550
The rest of the rise in sea-level

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.350
is coming from new water being dumped in

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.527
from melting ice in
Greenland and Antarctica

00:36:11.527 --> 00:36:14.010
and some inland glaciers.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.670
There's also a drawdown which
can actually be measured

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.500
in some of these wiggles.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.700
When there are huge dumps of rain

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.650
as there was in Australia in 2010, 11,

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.970
there was enough water dumped in Australia

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.660
that did not make its
way off of the continent

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.400
into the oceans, to cause
a decrease in sea-level.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.350
So, these instruments
are quite capable now,

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.800
but that's the rough picture.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:43.790
So, going back to the
carbon dioxide record,

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.190
I want to make the point now

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.960
of something being unusual here,

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.670
namely, we now have
observations from ice cores

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:56.170
in Greenland and Antarctica
that have been dated.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.600
That is, you can drill down

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.030
and take a vertical core out of the ice

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.470
and put dates on it.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.970
This was from 100 years ago,

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.260
a little bit deeper
was from 200 years ago,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.560
a thousand years ago, and so forth.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.780
One of the most important sets of data

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.900
came from an international
collaboration led by French

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.020
who drilled a very deep
ice core at the Vostok

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.720
area of Antarctica.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.580
And it's so deep that it
went back 450,000 years

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.670
from the present, before present,

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.357
200,000 years before present,

00:37:30.357 --> 00:37:34.010
300,000 years before
present, and so forth.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.370
And what they found was

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:40.650
by slicing up the ice at different depths,

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.740
and crushing the ice,
they could extract the gas

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.990
that was trapped in that old ice,

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.190
for example, carbon dioxide.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.530
So this is a physical measurement

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.680
of how much carbon dioxide was in the air

00:37:56.052 --> 00:38:00.450
100,000 years ago, 150,000
years ago and so forth.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.070
It's a direct measurement.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.430
So this is a major accomplishment

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.540
and what it shows is

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.840
that there have been different ice ages.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.840
There was an ice age about
20,000 years ago that hit,

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.640
and then 140,000 years
ago, another ice age,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.283
about 250,000 years ago, and so forth.

00:38:22.283 --> 00:38:27.080
When it was cold, the carbon
dioxide amounts in the air

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.330
were not 400 parts per
million like it is now

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.500
but 180 parts per million,

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.190
and when it was warm in between ice ages,

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:39.390
it was about 270 or 280 parts per million.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.140
So going back one ice age, I just did,

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.880
going back two ice ages, also low,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.510
in between ice ages, high,
namely 280 parts per million,

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.960
in between ice ages and so forth.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.860
So whatever is causing this,

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.550
it shows that the chemical composition

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.320
of the air today is unprecedented.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.300
The last four global ice ages,

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.120
and the last four in
between warmer periods,

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.570
had carbon dioxide bracketed

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.580
at concentrations down here

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.040
and where we are now is
completely out of that range.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.010
So there are many ways to prove

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.270
that the excess carbon dioxide today

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.773
is due to fossil fuel burning.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.910
And I won't go into them now.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:24.750
I could illustrate it later,

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:29.040
but whatever the cause is,
we can prove definitely

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.820
that the carbon dioxide content

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.250
of Earth's atmosphere today

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.010
is above where it's ever been

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.530
in this kind of recorded history.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.340
We think that 50 million years
ago, Carboniferous period,

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.950
100 million years ago, there
was more carbon dioxide

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.700
but it's, of course, hard to be sure.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.740
The same is true of another
greenhouse gas, methane,

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.650
where the blue curve here
is a proxy measurement

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.223
of what the temperature was,

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.040
inferred from ice amounts

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.370
and the isotopic content of the ice cores,

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.570
but when it was cold, methane amounts

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.120
were about 1/3 of a part per million,

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.490
and when it was warm in between ice ages,

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.930
methane amounts were about
2/3 of a part per million.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.930
Methane amounts in today's atmosphere

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.620
about one point nine parts per million,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.860
so two to five times what
has ever been seen before.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.130
So this set of ice cores from the French,

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.470
the Danes, the Russians,

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:30.380
with some contribution from Americans,

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.270
is really very important.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:34.520
It tells something
about where we are today

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.200
being unprecedented in
terms of climate history,

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.690
at least back 800,000 years,

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.973
that the data have now been
extended back 800,000 years.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.360
This is just an example to show

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.750
what we see in nitrous oxide measurements,

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.690
another greenhouse gas
whose origin is not as clear

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.600
but it seems to be involved

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.220
with a number of human activities,

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.030
including artificial nitrogen produced

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.843
for fixed nitrogen for fertilizers.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.090
So, what does that have to do

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.480
with the energy budget of the planet?

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.480
Now we can take and have taken
over the last 35 years or so

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.000
laboratory measurements that
tell how these gases interact

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.540
with outgoing planetary radiation

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.910
that would otherwise escape to space.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.580
We can do quantitative calculations then,

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:29.700
knowing the amounts of these
chemicals added to the air

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.980
since the Industrial Revolution,

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.160
determined by measurements
of recent ice cores

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.030
in the same way, compared
to what's measured now

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.760
and when you do that,
you can then calculate

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.120
what is the change to
the Earth's energy budget

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.330
at the surface.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.100
So just the carbon dioxide added amount

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.940
gives you almost two
watts per square meter

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.160
extra energy per unit time

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.510
trapped in the Earth's
lower surface areas.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.760
Methane gives this
contribution, nitrous oxide,

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.300
some fluorocarbon replacement chemicals,

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.010
hydrofluorocarbons, some
perfluorinated chemicals,

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.920
CFCs, and then ozone
in the lower atmosphere

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.850
and the answer comes up to be about,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:15.100
if you add all these together,

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.060
almost three watts per square meter.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.870
We call it radiative forcing

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.620
but it means forcing
that will directly affect

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.693
the Earth's climate.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.050
There are most complications
in this radiative forcing

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.020
which I'll mention also later,

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.240
but that's the simple side of it.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.290
So there's something else that's different

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.460
about these last 30 or
40 years in addition to

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.300
what I've just showed you
of the actual measurements

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.300
of air and water temperatures,
ice amounts, sea-level rise,

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.320
and that is it's the first
time in human history

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.490
that we've been able to
measure the output of the Sun

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.200
with enough stability
and precision to say,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.370
well, maybe the Sun's
energy reaching the Earth

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.340
has just increased at the same time,

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.210
maybe these warming phenomena

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.340
are simply due to extra
energy coming from the Sun.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.713
Well, the answer is no.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.220
These results were published about 2005

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.440
by Judith Lean, who's a scientist

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.880
with the US Naval Research Lab,

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.880
and a colleague, Klaus
Froehlich, in Switzerland

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:25.390
that shows that over this period

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:30.100
of satellite observations of
the Sun with some precision,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.160
there was no change in
the amount of energy

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.200
coming out of the Sun

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.700
except for a little
bit of an 11-year cycle

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.350
that correlates with sunspots

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.710
which we've known about for a long time.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.800
And, in fact, this whole change

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.470
is about point one percent
from top to bottom.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.050
Well, the number I just showed you,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.940
the radiative forcing
due to greenhouse gases,

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.520
are about one and a half percent

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.980
and the change due to solar irradiance

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:06.980
is about 1/10th or 1/20th of that amount.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.610
The difference here is you have to get,

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.650
there's a geometrical
factor, the amount of energy

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.920
actually being intercepted by the Earth

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.260
is this number divided by four.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.090
Some of you who are arithmetic freaks

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.290
may have already realized

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.630
that if you divide this number by four,

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.080
you get 341 watts per square meter,

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.700
which was on my first cartoon slide.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.423
That's the geometrical factor.

00:44:32.951 --> 00:44:36.270
Now that record has been
difficult for Froehlich and Lean

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:40.160
to put together because it
required stringing together

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.890
satellite observations with high precision

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.930
that weren't meant to be used that way

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.167
but they've continued the work

00:44:46.167 --> 00:44:49.190
and this is Klaus
Froehlich's recent update

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:52.200
showing now three or three
and a half solar cycles,

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.200
four solar cycles, again, with a cycle.

00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:00.530
So the radiative forcing
due to the greenhouse gases

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.790
is not a cycle.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.590
It's a sustained elevation

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.240
in the energy budget of the Earth

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.440
whereas these cycles are just that.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.740
They're imposed by solar activity changes

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.770
and they're smaller, so
the greenhouse gas forcing

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.540
is about, at the surface, about
three watts per square meter

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.400
and this one is point 25
watts per square meter

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.070
wiggling around.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.700
So, those of us who thought and hoped

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.870
that maybe the Sun's output
was causing these changes,

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.460
when we were thinking of
this back in the early 80s,

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.603
we no longer have a leg to stand on.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.390
The evidence is really clear

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:44.470
that these physical changes
that are being observed

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.630
are very strongly linked
with human activity.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.390
The numbers add up, the processes add up,

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.963
the mechanics, the underlying premise.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.390
Well, I'm gonna close in a few minutes

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.780
but, you know, why do we care?

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.980
And is this likely to continue?

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.790
Well, if you just look at
one of the greenhouse gases,

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:06.960
carbon dioxide, where it's coming from,

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.970
of course, you all know about
the burning of fossil fuels,

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:15.680
that is, burning of
substances like natural gas,

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.820
coal, wood, that contains carbon,

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:23.040
the very act of burning this stuff in air

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.300
creates carbon dioxide.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.650
And the thermodynamics
is that the heat released

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:32.650
in that oxidation of carbon
to release carbon dioxide

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:35.720
is what gives us the heat and the energy.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.150
So it's very valuable right now.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.450
However, if you look at
the carbon part of it

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.280
and how much carbon
dioxide is being released,

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.150
there's this figure called global.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.940
This is from a woman
named Corinne Le Quere

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.990
with a paper that was just
released a month or two ago

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.203
where they've gone back
over all the carbon budgets.

00:46:56.504 --> 00:46:57.600
They didn't do this alone.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.820
There were many, many, many
assessments before they did this

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.570
but this is in a peer-reviewed journal

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:08.550
showing that if you just
look at the fossil fuels

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.770
being consumed around the Earth

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.840
and ask how much carbon is being released

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.950
in the form of carbon dioxide,

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:20.350
the number today, 2012 or 14,

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:24.130
is about 10 billion
tons of carbon per year.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:27.070
So obviously, carbon dioxide is

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.930
44 divided by 12 times as much

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.780
but just look at the carbon
released as carbon dioxide,

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.790
it's 10 or a little bit
more than 10 gigatons,

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.060
10 billion tons.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.880
A breakdown is that on
the lower graph here,

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.990
about 40% of that carbon is being released

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:47.580
from coal combustion,

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.200
about 30% from oil combustion,

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.690
and you see gas and cement manufacture,

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.660
which also releases
carbon as carbon dioxide.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:01.030
Well, this source of
energy for human activities

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.440
is about 80% of all the energy

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.910
that humans use on the planet,

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.950
that is, for manufacturing,
for transportation,

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:12.643
for production of
electricity, you name it.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:18.113
The remaining 20% is from
hydropower, nuclear power,

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.930
solar and wind power,
which of course are gaining

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.050
but they all add up to only 20%.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.760
So, for the foreseeable future,

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.440
there will be continued large emissions

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.530
of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.750
And I can give you more
evidence on why we know

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.760
that this is from humans
and got the numbers right.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.170
It's pretty compelling evidence,

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.590
but even as the world
tries to conserve energy,

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:47.560
to be more efficient, and
to use renewable energy,

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.810
it's very hard to escape
that there will be

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:53.610
continued large emissions
of carbon dioxide.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.260
For one thing, just for transportation,

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.380
when you burn gasoline or diesel

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.530
to drive a car or a truck,

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.460
it's actually a pretty well-suited fuel

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.820
because you don't have to carry

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.400
the oxidizer around with you.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.650
You've got the oxidizer
oxygen out of air for free

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.130
and you don't have to transport
it while you're going.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:17.900
You're carrying only the minimum
load of fuel that you need.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.850
You don't have to carry
the oxygen with you.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.440
It's not like a spaceship where you have

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.540
to carry the oxidizer with you.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.610
So hydrocarbon fuels have a big advantage

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.520
and they're not gonna be displaced easily.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.750
It costs virtually nothing to extract them

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.770
from the ground, and so forth.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.640
On the other hand, the progress

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.060
in providing energy for industry

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.160
and residents and everything else,

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.420
electricity from renewable power

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.500
and from progressively
better nuclear power,

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.860
it's non-trivial but it can't
handle much of the load.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.070
This is a further breakdown
of Le Quere's data,

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.730
nation-by-nation for a few nations

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:02.233
showing the fabulous
economic growth in China.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.320
China is now the world's
number one CO2 emitter.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.360
It's not only due to their economic growth

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.900
but the displacement of heavy industry

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.010
from the United States and
other countries to China.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.750
So there's been a structural
change in their economy.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.280
They're doing more of
the heavy manufacturing,

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.330
which has also led them
to release more CO2.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.410
India's growing fast, but per capita,

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.900
you can see that the per capita emissions,

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.660
that is, tons of carbon
per person per year,

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.603
the U.S. is still the
most at about almost,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:42.460
what does that say, about
five tons per person per year.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.830
The global total, the
global average is less

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.970
because India and China
and the European Union

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.280
and so forth, emit less per person.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.980
So, no matter how you slice it,

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.650
these global data tell you that

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:58.560
there's gonna be very
hard to change this trend.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.073
So that means that whatever
is happening with climate,

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.590
we really have to get
better at making predictions

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.420
and assessing it, so
just a few observations

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.810
on how we can move the science forward,

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.160
and some of you here are doing

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.950
some very important work in this regard,

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:19.260
but to make the science
more understandable,

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.683
more definite, to refine the trends,

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.330
and to make better estimates

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:26.740
of what's gonna happen in the future,

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.300
let alone predictions,

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.410
we clearly have to extend and improve

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.370
the observational record, for example,

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.100
the ocean measurements
and the ice measurements.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.420
We have to create longer records

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.120
and deduce the trends and
patterns more carefully.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:44.090
For example, sea-level rise,
extreme weather events,

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:46.920
is really where a lot of the action is.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.950
It's not just average temperatures

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.400
that we're concerned about.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.640
It's precipitation events,

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.670
how many big rain dumps and
big snow dumps do people get,

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.270
how long are the heat waves,

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.080
how long are the droughts,

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.860
what is the odds of floods happening.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.870
Some of the world leaders
in these questions

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.560
are insurance companies,

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.713
and the reinsurance
industry largely in Europe.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:15.400
They probably have the best
statistics on what's happening

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.640
and they break it down
into physical events

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.260
as well as financial claims
that they have to pay.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.700
But the physical predictions
are pretty difficult,

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.090
and yet they're incredibly important.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.150
It's not just the averages,
it's what are the extremes

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.840
that are happening, and I'll
give you example of this.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.490
Then we also want to know whether

00:52:38.158 --> 00:52:40.080
the changes that we are observing

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.700
in the frequency of these extreme events,

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.230
what does it mean in terms of attributing?

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:49.140
Has a particular storm happened
because of climate change,

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.940
or has it just happened randomly?

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.910
And what are the return times?

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.100
You hear these stories about
one in 500-year floods,

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.140
one in 100-year floods,

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.390
do we really know that
that's a typical return time?

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.160
And how can we do a better job

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.670
at estimating those return times

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:08.550
for better public planning,

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.020
for insurance applications and so forth.

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.920
Let me go to the next slide
and show you something.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.780
If you take the same temperature data

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.940
that I showed you earlier,

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.800
this happens to be again
the NASA (mumbles) data,

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.830
and you go decade-by-decade,

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.990
in the reference period, the
30-year reference period,

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.670
this is now northern hemisphere land

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.520
in June, July and August,

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.110
you could divide up what looks like

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:36.960
a normal distribution of
temperatures into three parts:

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.890
the lowest 1/3 of temperatures on average

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:44.670
in that northern hemisphere summer period,

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.730
the middle part which also contains

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.680
a third of the observations,

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.460
and the upper part, the
highest temperatures.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.750
Now march that forward to the
actual data in the next decade

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.770
and you'll see things
shifting to the right.

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:02.620
Although this is 1983 to
1993, in that lower third,

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.640
you now only have 23% of the data,

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.910
in the middle third, you
have whatever that number is,

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:12.380
and 47, 48% in the upper right.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:17.380
If you go now into the
latest decade, 2005 to 2015,

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.700
look what's happened to that distribution.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.200
It has shifted to the right.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.470
These are actual data, and you see

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.710
that what used to be the population

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:28.688
in the lower 1/3 of the data,

00:54:28.688 --> 00:54:31.650
it's now only about, I think it's 12%,

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:33.380
I can't quite read it.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.580
In what used to be the normal distribution

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.850
is now characterized by
these higher temperatures

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:44.230
that used to be a couple of
standard deviations to the right

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.630
now showing up 67% of the time,

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:49.850
and places way to the right,

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:52.800
like four standard
deviations above normal,

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.353
are now happening 15% of the time.

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:58.860
So a slight shift to the right

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.400
gives you a much larger frequency
of high temperature events

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.700
and a much lower frequency
of low temperature events,

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.400
but this is now averaged
over a big piece of land,

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.630
the northern hemisphere over the summer.

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:12.770
If you do the same thing,

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.510
northern hemisphere in the winter,

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.690
you get similar results.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:19.050
So this is one kind of low-level reason

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:23.310
to expect the frequency of
extreme events to change.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:26.460
Hotter temperatures in
the summer over land,

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.860
and warmer temperatures
in the winter over land,

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.893
with less real freezing events.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.800
I mentioned radiative forcing before.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.500
There are complications to
those numbers I showed you.

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.400
Floating aerosol materials,

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.490
some of them have ability
to reflect sunlight

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:47.920
back out to space, visible sunlight,

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.490
especially sulfur-containing particles,

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:54.030
so trying to do these
calculations in a reliable way

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:58.310
is difficult because we don't
actually know at any one time

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:01.020
how much of this floating
aerosol material there is

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.240
in the air from
sulfur-containing fossil fuels

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.763
that when burnt, creates sulfur pollution.

00:56:08.624 --> 00:56:12.040
This input is probably
being reduced worldwide now,

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.740
but when you try to add that

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.280
to the radiative forcing
numbers I showed you,

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.440
we got big uncertainties of about a watt

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.560
per square meter, that could be negative.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.480
We also don't know the
geographical distribution

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.990
and temporal changes in
that aerosol material,

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.653
so it's a measurement challenge.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.060
Ice losses and sea-level rise
are particularly important

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.970
because of all the climate changes

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.180
that you want to talk about,

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.970
the most dangerous kinds, the worst risks

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.340
are changes that are irreversible,

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.260
such as sea-level rise,

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.390
or irreversible, for
example, biodiversity loss.

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:52.003
You can't replace species.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.760
At least, those are two examples.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.040
So with sea-level rise, the good news is

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.410
so much has been learned in
the last six or seven years

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:05.120
about where the ice is plunging off

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.930
of Greenland and Antarctica.

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:08.980
There are specific sites

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.210
where the ice mass loss is happening

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:16.410
due to ice sliding down
the sloping continent

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:19.450
that is being held up by an ice shelf

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:22.730
and as the shelf gets
undercut by warm water

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.260
and gets dissolved,

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:27.700
then you get an
acceleration of the ice mass

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.840
sliding down the slope.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.180
These sites have now been
mapped out pretty well

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.220
and there are a lot of
unknowns but at least,

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.540
people know where to do the measuring now,

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.800
where to measure the water temperatures

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.290
and how much the melting of the shelf

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:45.060
is being undercut and
the ice can slide off.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.610
So that's progress and it will represent

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.740
a better predictive capability.

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.480
There's still some argument
whether ice shelf melting

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.060
that I just illustrated with my hands

00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.670
is the dominant mechanism

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:00.120
or is it simply ice fracturing.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.940
It's probably more ice shelf melting

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.283
undercutting the ice shelf.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.230
But then, as this accelerates

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:11.390
and more of this cold
water comes running off

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:12.860
of Greenland and Antarctica,

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.740
it's going to affect ocean circulation.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.950
There is a very strong new,

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:21.570
somewhat speculative
paper published last week

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:25.140
by Jim Hansen's group with 15 co-authors

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:28.520
on what happens as the ice melts

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.010
and it's like you're hosing the ocean

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:33.730
with a hose of cold water being sprayed

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:35.380
around Greenland and Antarctica,

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.940
which will somewhat change
the ocean circulation there,

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.760
causing more or less deep water formation

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.810
and saltiness that will
change the circulation.

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:48.270
So, for example, one prediction
out of this new paper

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:53.270
is we will see cooling of
surface waters around Antarctica

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.800
in the coming several decades.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.503
So instead of seeing a
warming due to global warming,

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:00.990
the feedback there will be

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.800
to cool the ocean waters somewhat.

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.480
So it's a big prediction,
we'll see if it happens.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.490
Then the whole issue of the
oceanic uptake of energy

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.510
is a major one, because
this so-called hiatus

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.420
that happened in global
warming in the last 15 years

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.820
until the last two years was,

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.270
assuming the measurements
are all accurate,

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.760
probably due to increased uptake of heat

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.540
by the world's oceans,
that can happen again,

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:29.783
or it could shut off.

00:59:31.608 --> 00:59:33.360
You got an additional stability

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.370
as you warm the ocean surface waters.

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:37.630
It's harder to move things vertically

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:39.610
if hot water is on top,

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:40.960
but there are many other forces

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.340
at play in ocean circulation.

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:47.010
My last slide is simply to
say a couple more things.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:48.310
Whether we like it or not,

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:51.310
this mathematical modeling
of climate is essential

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:55.850
so the people doing this
work are some of the hottest

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.100
young scientists around the world.

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.830
The solving leaves this
interlocking system

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.400
of partial differential equations

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.830
that try to go from first
principles explaining

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.420
the energy budget of the Earth's surface,

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.380
the energy being moved
between phase changes

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.473
in solid, liquid and vapor water,

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:23.230
how you transport all that stuff

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:26.226
through a rotating global atmosphere,

01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:28.260
so some of the key questions are

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.540
how to continue to improve this,

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.440
the geographical
resolution of these models

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.830
so that, for example, Iowa and Minnesota

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:40.040
are represented individually in pieces

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.000
rather than being lumped
together in one big piece,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.410
or regions that have
mountains versus plains

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:48.860
can be separated, and
then the cloud formations,

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.950
and the rainfall events can be broken down

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.606
much more mechanistically.

01:00:54.606 --> 01:00:58.770
A couple of major questions are
in these mathematical models

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:03.050
which turn out to be
numerically solved on computers.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:07.040
Can we trigger and exit ice
ages over long periods of time?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.190
Can someone actually explain
to scientific satisfaction

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.640
what causes ice ages?

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.040
What triggers it?

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.240
What kinds of feedback
mechanisms are in play?

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.300
And how in the world
we get out of ice ages?

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.730
We know that we do.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:23.360
There are geological
and ice records of this,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.900
but it's been very hard
for people to model

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.520
the mathematics of this
in a dependable way.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.420
That's a major challenge.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.160
One of the really serious ones

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.453
is the acidification
of the world's oceans.

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:37.870
It'll take a long, long time

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:41.780
before we actually reach a pH of below 7

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.970
but the pH has dropped
in a measurable way,

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:49.160
and the sensitivity of marine biology

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.410
to these patterns of
acidification around the world

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:56.180
where basically carbon dioxide
is taken into the water

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.080
and you tend towards acidity that way.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.600
What are the impacts going to be

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.600
on individual species and on ecosystems,

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.270
such as shell-making creatures

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:09.493
that depend a lot on the
carbonate and ocean water?

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.890
Then the land surface is
involved in all of this

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:15.970
so climate science, as
it gets more important,

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:19.320
is involving understanding
of all of these things.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.900
Are the rates of future wildfires

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.780
going to increase as
much as is now projected

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.663
due to increased dryness,
increased temperatures,

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:33.393
longer periods with low
soil moisture and so forth?

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:38.570
Measuring how carbon dioxide is released

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.910
from soil organic matter
as climate changes,

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.250
so that what up till now has been

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.840
a measurable greening,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.080
a fertilization of the Earth's biota

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.370
due to more carbon dioxide being in air,

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.650
how sensitive is that going to be?

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.220
And will these other measured increases

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.680
in the rate at which
carbon dioxide is released

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.880
by the world's biota back into the air,

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.120
is that speeding up faster
than the extra uptake

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.250
due to photosynthesis?

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:14.820
And then, of course, the
potential for storing more carbon.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.030
So all of these things
have to be investigated

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.863
and many more.

01:03:17.863 --> 01:03:19.990
It's an exciting field of science.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:23.250
The implications are great
and probably happening

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.810
faster than any of us expected,

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:27.750
so the stakes are very high.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.380
And fortunately, some
progress is being made

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.090
but I think the story is pretty compelling

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.143
about the measured increases
being due to human activity.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.780
In all realms, it's very hard to find

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.150
any set of measurements
that fly in the face

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:45.430
of that original premise.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.800
So with that, I think
I'll stop at thank you

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.180
and I think we have some
time for some Q and A.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.083
Alan, yes?

01:03:53.326 --> 01:03:55.576
(clapping)

01:03:57.497 --> 01:03:59.610
- [Peter] Thank you very much
for this very fine lecture.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:01.000
My name is Peter Joseph.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.310
I'm with Citizens Climate Lobby.

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:07.500
I want to ask you how
you deal with the people

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.360
who think that it's a vast conspiracy,

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.920
and don't believe the science,

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.193
and think there's nothing wrong?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.283
- Let me try just to answer your question.

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:23.420
How I deal with them is to point out

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.083
somewhat how science works.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.860
Scientists don't become rich and famous

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:33.210
by agreeing with what
other people have said.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.490
Scientists make their claim

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:37.880
and a lot of their ambition
is based on showing

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.953
what everybody else is saying is wrong.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.540
Now, of course, that statement
gets some disagreement

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.003
but I think it's mostly true.

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:50.077
I wake up many mornings saying,

01:04:50.077 --> 01:04:52.150
"What the hell could be
wrong with this picture?"

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:55.290
I would love to undercut it but I can't,

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:57.030
and people a lot smarter than I

01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:58.770
who spend more time on it than I do

01:04:58.770 --> 01:04:59.903
have also failed.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.570
The basic theory was proposed
well over 100 years ago

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.940
by (mumbles) in Sweden,

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.690
and even before that in Great Britain

01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:12.630
and calendar in the US,

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.600
so people have had a long time to shoot.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.160
Just at the National Academy of Sciences,

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.620
we've produced, I don't
know, 30, 40, 50 reports

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.620
on this general subject
in the last 40 years

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.170
and the numbers are remarkably
consistent on what we expect,

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.270
let's say, the global
average temperature to be.

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:35.840
So I think the solidity of
the science is pretty good

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.857
and I tell people that, "You talk to me

01:05:38.857 --> 01:05:41.970
"about a conspiracy, it's impossible."

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:44.460
It's absolutely, I think, impossible

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.110
for any one of us to have
convinced everybody else

01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:53.370
in this general field,
of a phony proposition.

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:57.090
There could be errors,
but it's not a conspiracy.

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:58.390
That's what I tell people.

01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:02.200
I have met with resistance
for that statement,

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.150
people saying that I'm wrong
but that's what I tell people.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.773
- Oh hi, Larry (mumbles),
Revolution Newspaper, revcom.us.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.640
There was one point in your type,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.500
first, I appreciated your deconstructing

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.530
of every possible, at
least as I understood it,

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:30.530
objection to this inexorable
rise of climate change

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:37.510
but at one point in your
talk, you made the point

01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:42.510
that we had to basically
get used to the fact

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:46.560
that fossil fuels were going to

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.140
be with us for a very long time

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.410
and this in producing the vast, vast bulk

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.283
of the energy that this planet uses,

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:05.400
I agree with you on further
developing the science.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.360
You were making that point at the end

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.360
but I just find that prospect

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.810
intolerable and frightening.

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:17.620
In the New York Times today,

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.900
they were talking about sea-level rising

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.450
three to four feet, and then ultimately

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.750
the seas going even a hundred miles,

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:31.210
and so my view is that

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:34.950
this is a political and economic problem

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.680
and everything that you have said

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:42.630
calls upon us to do what I would consider

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:47.300
have a radically new
economic and political system

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:51.380
that capitalism isn't capable of resolving

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.650
this issue that we need a revolution

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.840
and this new (mumbles) all stop.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.230
- I can't disagree with you,

01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:58.722
but whatever this solution is--

01:07:58.722 --> 01:07:59.672
- If I could just invite people--

01:07:59.672 --> 01:08:02.540
- It has to release a lot
of energy, physically.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.650
That's all I'm saying.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:05.540
- And I just wanted to invite people

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.640
to come to the Tilden room Friday at six

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.360
to talk about, I know we can't tonight.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.193
Thank you.

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:19.310
- Hi, something I didn't
hear you talk much about

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.850
and I'd love to hear you talk
about is feedback effects.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.720
So the possibility of
positive feedback effects

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.400
and the possibility of
negative feedback effects

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.450
and which are apt to dominate

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:33.130
and over what temperature range,

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:35.963
and in the end, will we be extinct?

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:37.645
(laughing)

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:39.480
- Do you have a particular feedback effect

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.991
that you're interested in?

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.574
- Well, actually...

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:49.400
Well, moisture is one that
I've heard a lot about

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.821
so there's a physicist at
Princeton, for example,

01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:55.463
who, you know, points out that, Harper,

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.240
that moisture is one of
the biggest warming gases

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.067
and maybe he creates more (mumbling).

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.163
- Okay.

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:11.923
Well, Will Harper should know better.

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:18.670
The fundamental that I think
makes you have to take--

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.640
Okay, the numbers I just showed you,

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.093
this radiative forcing,

01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:26.880
those things happen in an
active atmosphere in an ocean

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.710
and when you warm a body of water,

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.130
you release more water into the gas phase.

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.080
That's what results.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.730
The current thinking is
it's a positive feedback,

01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:41.180
that is, as there's a warming,

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.120
the warming will accelerate

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.900
due to lofting more water
vapor into the atmosphere

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.360
which then becomes
another greenhouse effect.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.360
What Harper is claiming, and
he's right in one respect,

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.430
if you simply evaluate
carbon dioxide itself,

01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:59.750
you've got a fraction of these numbers

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:02.690
for a change in carbon dioxide,

01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:05.570
and you got about double
that fraction of warming

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:08.980
if you include the increased water vapor

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:12.300
that you assume is going
to accompany the warming,

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.540
but the reason that assumption is good

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.860
is something that in
physics or engineering

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:20.100
is called the vapor pressure

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.000
of a liquid at a various temperature,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.880
in this case, the
Clausius-Clapeyron equation,

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.930
which describes the equilibrium of a gas

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.910
above a warming liquid,

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:32.960
and it's a strong function of temperature.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.010
It's not a smooth rise.

01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:38.700
It's a parabolically-shaped
curve that goes like that

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.320
so there's a lot of
potential for feedback.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.730
So as you warm the planet,
the bodies of water warm

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:49.650
and the equilibrium water
vapor above in the air

01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:52.100
increases more strongly

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.720
than the rate of temperature increase.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.610
It's called the Clausius-Clapeyron effect,

01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:00.410
and there has been one notable scientist

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.650
who said that he doesn't believe

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:05.040
that this feedback effect
will be so positive

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.800
and he's tried to find ways

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.350
that the atmosphere will become drier

01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:12.300
as you warm up bodies of water beneath it,

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.860
and he hasn't been successful,
and he won't be successful.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.070
This Clausius-Clapeyron effect,

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.980
any of you know the details yourself,

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.130
you know that it's pretty fundamental

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.430
so that's one feedback.

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:26.530
Now, there's an
interesting aspect of that.

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:29.190
If you put more water vapor in the air,

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.833
which is going to happen
as it gets warmer,

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.040
you'll probably create more clouds,

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.140
and this is a really interesting feedback.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.580
Will the clouds cover the sky more

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.340
in terms of cloud cover,

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.200
so there will be less fraction of the sky

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.370
where you see it's blue

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.370
because it's covered by clouds,

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:54.930
or will the clouds
instead grow vertically,

01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:57.160
let's say, with the same cover

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.500
but they grow deeper vertically?

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.990
In the latter case,
it's a positive feedback

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:03.340
on climate warming,

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:06.440
and the previous case where
you get more cloud cover,

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.680
you actually then can
reflect more sunlight

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.913
back out to space and
you can get a cooling.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.410
The current understanding
of cloud physics is that

01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:18.720
the positive feedback
is going to dominate,

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.130
so in all of the mathematical calculations

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.393
that have attempted to
understand that feedback,

01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:27.090
it comes out positive.

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:29.300
But it's not necessarily definitely true.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.150
It probably is.

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:33.593
Looking at data sets from satellites,

01:12:35.348 --> 01:12:37.760
you get supporting evidence
for the positive feedback

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.510
and there are many other
interesting feedbacks

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:40.750
in this system.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:43.720
For example, there's a
lot of organic material

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.820
stored in peat lands,

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.420
and clathrate deposits in ocean margins

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.420
where a little bit of warming

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.720
can make those release carbon dioxide

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.970
and methane explosively.

01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:00.640
So you can get sudden
injections of greenhouse gases

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.770
with just a little bit of warming.

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:04.780
There's other ones about snow ice.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.400
As the sea ice disappears on the Arctic,

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.330
sunlight now sees dark
water instead of white ice

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:16.190
so the sunlight itself is
absorbed more by the water.

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:17.803
That's a positive feedback.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.810
And there's just feedbacks
all over this system.

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:25.200
And are we modeling them all perfectly?

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.073
I doubt it,

01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:29.900
but the other tendency that's showing up

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:33.020
as a positive or a strong feedback

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:36.140
is the intensity of rainfall events.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.590
I think it's now been
shown on five continents,

01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:43.590
if not six, that the frequency
of heavy rainfall effects

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:47.890
has increased, in observations.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:48.840
This is due to the fact

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.170
that there's more moisture in the air

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.290
so that when it rains,

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:55.240
it's more likely that it's a heavy rain

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.670
but it can still be dry in between,

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.890
so all kinds of feedbacks here

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.960
and they're tremendously important.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.210
And we don't have all
of them nailed down yet

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.530
but the water vapor one,
I think, is pretty solid

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:10.853
because of the Clausius-Clapeyron effect.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:13.300
Yes, sir.
- Dr. Cicerone,

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.140
thank you very much for
a fine presentation.

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.870
I'm also interested in your views about

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:23.330
the feedback effects
from the stored carbon

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:25.580
in the permafrost in the Arctic.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:28.030
You showed that the average temperature

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.150
of the Arctic in certain regions

01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:33.870
increased by more than
10 degrees centigrade.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:37.960
I'm wondering, are you
very worried that perhaps

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.290
an uncontrollable feedback effect

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:45.080
could be induced in the Arctic

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.143
where trillion and a half
tons of carbon are stored.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.380
- Yes, but again, I don't think

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.400
we have very good predictive capabilities.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.980
The current thinking is it's going to take

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.770
hundreds of years to really
release a lot of carbon

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:05.140
that's now in old
vegetation and permafrost

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.380
and buried deep as methane gas

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.803
or even coming out as carbon dioxide.

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:15.950
If the permafrost melts and dries up,

01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:18.310
we will get carbon dioxide release.

01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:21.360
If the permafrost melts
and leaves a pool of water,

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.010
we'll get methane release.

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:25.670
But the question is how soon?

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:28.660
This warming of the Arctic
is more than anybody expected

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:32.090
and faster, but there are still lag times

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:35.300
built into the system that
I think will stabilize it.

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.280
The difficulty in conducting heat

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.720
down even five meters,
it takes a long time

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.480
for the thermal conductivity to work,

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.660
to conduct the heat down,

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:48.743
so most of what's happening
now is on the surface.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.900
I'm not aware of any indications

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.830
that methane releases are
increasing from the Arctic.

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:58.720
There is more carbon dioxide
that's being released

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.070
but it's a pretty small amount
compared to other, so far,

01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:06.570
compared to all the other
releases of carbon dioxide.

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:08.143
But in principle, yes.

01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:11.730
- Hi, Jim (mumbles).

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:14.070
I want ask you on the maps you showed us

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.680
of the temperature record
in recent hot years.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.190
There tended to be one cold
spot in the North Atlantic,

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:26.863
around Iceland, and is that
kind of well-understood?

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:29.400
- I don't think so.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.443
I don't think so.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:34.020
There are some very good meteorologists

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:37.160
and physical oceanographers
who are arguing about it.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.570
For example, if you look at
the geographical patterns

01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:42.840
of the winters in the northern hemisphere

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.750
in the last few years,

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:47.170
we've had some cold eastern
United States winters

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.220
and there's a lot of
argument going on now.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.440
How that's connected with
the loss of Arctic sea ice,

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.343
with mechanistic understanding,

01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:57.520
there are some oscillations that observed

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.920
in the North Atlantic.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.200
Water flows the last 30 or 40 years each,

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.610
one of them 70 years each,

01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:05.790
so we don't have enough data record

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:08.040
to know exactly where it's coming from.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.523
Or the mechanisms of it,
I think, is a puzzle.

01:17:15.651 --> 01:17:17.550
One of the gross indications

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.970
that this is an unprecedented
kind of climate change,

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:23.160
not only that the forcing conforms

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.970
to what humans are doing
and the numbers are right,

01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:29.120
but the fact that the
warming is pretty ubiquitous.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.540
If you average over a
period of a few years,

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:37.530
you cannot find a place on
the Earth that's cooling.

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:39.530
That's more than a micro site

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.390
and in previous climate
changes that have been observed

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:45.900
like the European warm period

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.470
in the 15th or 16th century and so forth,

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:52.040
there've been regional
patches of warming or cooling

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.270
but nothing this global before.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.490
But you're right, there is
that fairly persistent pool

01:17:57.490 --> 01:17:59.260
of cool water above the north,

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.960
and some of these temperature records

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.783
that I told you that people work on,

01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.880
somewhat in competition with each other,

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.887
they have different methods
of sampling the Arctic

01:18:07.887 --> 01:18:09.720
and some of them, the British record,

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.110
undersamples the Arctic,

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:15.410
so they tend not even
to see that cold period.

01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:18.410
And in turn, they get lower measurements

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:20.640
of global average temperature rise

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.100
because they're ignoring
the hot spots in the Arctic,

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.890
not completely but relatively,

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:28.203
so there are a lot of details like that

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:30.903
that could be important
that are not clear yet.

01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:34.930
- [Woman] Thank you very much.

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:36.303
- Thanks a lot.

01:18:36.303 --> 01:18:41.136
