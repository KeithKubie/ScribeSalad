00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:05.063 align:start position:0% line:85%
BISHOP'S REPORT.

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:08.234 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THEY TALK ABOUT THE BABY
JESUS BEING A REFUGE FROM

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.034 align:start position:0% line:85%
VIOLENCE AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:10.569 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND THEY TELL IT-- .

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:13.305 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE DIDN'T ASK TO
BE A CITIZEN IN EGYPT.

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:15.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE DIDN'T ASK TO BE ABLE TO
VOTE FOR THE PHAROAH

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:18.477 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE WENT BACK TO THE HOLY
LAND EVENTUALLY.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE
PHAROAH IN THOSE DAYS.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:21.547 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.916 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BUT THE FACT IS-- .

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.951 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT.

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:27.853 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT A DEMOCRATIC
SYSTEM.

00:06:27.886 --> 00:06:32.358 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO-- THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN
CRISIS.

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:36.162 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND IT NEEDS A HUMANITARIAN
RESPONSE, AND IT ALSO NEEDS

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:40.566 size:84% position:42% line:91%
A RESPONSE THAT SAYS IF YOU
HAVE A LEGITIMATE CLAIM FOR

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.036 align:start position:0% line:91%
REFUGEE STATUS OR ASYLUM,
THAT'S ONE THING.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.337 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF NOT YOU'RE GOING BACK
HOME.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT LET'S DO THAT
EXPEDITIOUSLY AND LET'S DO

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.509 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
DIGNITY OF EACH OF THESE

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
PEOPLE.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.311 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU LAUNCHED MIDDLE
CLASS JUMP-START,.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.850 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MIDDLE CLASS JUMP-START.

00:06:57.883 --> 00:07:01.420 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LAST WEEK WHEN
WILL IT BE LAW.

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:04.824 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOW LET ME SAY THIS WHILE WE
WERE ANNOUNCING ON THE STEPS OF

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.859 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE CAPITOL WAVING THE
AMERICAN FLAG ABOUT THE

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:09.995 size:84% position:42% line:91%
MIDDLE CLASS AND ALL THAT,
THE REPUBLICANS WERE INSIDE

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:12.832 size:78% position:39% line:91%
WITH A HEARING TO SUE THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0% line:91%
STATES FOR ENFORCING THE
LAW.

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:17.303 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY SHOULDN'T
YOU DO THAT?

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:20.539 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THEY WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO
ROLL OUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:25.077 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ACT, YOU KNOW, SWIFTLY, AS
THEY ALWAYS HAVE WANTED.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; NO WHAT THEY WANTED WAS

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:30.783 align:start position:0% line:91%
50 TIMES THEY VOTED TO
REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:31.417 align:start position:0% line:85%
ACT.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.153 size:88% position:44% line:85%

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.357 align:start position:0% line:85%
TALKING LAWSUITS.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF THE PRESIDENT
IS BEING A TYRANT WHAT

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.529 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHOICE DO THEY HAVE BUT TO
TAKE HIM TO COURT.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.164 size:88% position:44% line:85%
OBAMA CAN ALWAYS COUNTERSUE.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:47.199 size:81% position:41% line:91%
EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON CAN
GET MOBBED UP WITH LAWYERS

00:07:47.232 --> 00:07:50.703 size:75% position:38% line:91%
AND WE'LL LET JUDGE JUDY
