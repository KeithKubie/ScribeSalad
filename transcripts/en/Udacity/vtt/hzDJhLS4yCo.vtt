00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now that we can build an index, we'll want to use it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We'll want to use it to respond to queries.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you understood how the add to index code works,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think you'll be able to write the query code yourself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So the lookup procedure takes 2 inputs.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The first is an index, and that's the data structure we've been working with.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a list where each element

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of the list is a list containing a keyword

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a list as its second element,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and that list is a list of URLs

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
where that keyword appears.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The second input is the keyword to lookup.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's what we're searching for.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So the output of lookup should be a list

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of all the URLs associated with the input keyword.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So as an example,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we constructed the index here

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where we've added 2 URLs

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with the keyword udacity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The result from doing a lookup on the keyword udacity

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
should be a list containing those 2 URLs.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We should be concerned what happens if

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the keyword does not exists.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If the keyword doesn't exists, well there are no

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
URLs associated with that keyword.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So we would just return an empty list.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So see if you can define the lookup procedure.
