00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.900
Hi!  I'm Anna Akana, and I have 4 cats.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.220
And they're going to review costumes!

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.620
They're probably going to hate it.  But it's going to be sups-(super) adorbs!

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.380
All right, so I'm going to put Congress in this Pikachu outfit and see how he likes it!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.040
I'll put it here.  (Talking to Congress)  And, okay--good!

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.500
I'll roll you over.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.120
Congo!  Do you like it?  Do you enjoy it?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.480
(Giggling)

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.020
Oh God.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.760
Oh!  Oh! *gasps*

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.080
Oh GOD!

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.760
*Window shattering sound* Slo-Mo "OH GOD!"

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.840
Honey!  Oh God.  Oh God.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.060
Ok!  This is cute but not safe.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.440
Did you see him fall?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.900
Brad:  (off camera) Mhmm!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.420
No!  I don't want to show that--that's so sad!

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.460
Ok so he had a lot of trouble with that, so I'm not going to put him back in this.  Anytime soon.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.820
Maybe never.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.280
We got...Lillian a Kimino!

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920
She feels sensual.  *giggling*

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.640
Lilly is wearing a Kimono because she is sophisticated and the oldest of the cats.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.440
She hates it, I think, but will tolerate it because she's pretty chill.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.520
All right, Congress has a lot of trouble with Pikachu so lets see if he enjoys being a spider!

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.120
No? He's already ready to walk away.  He has had enough.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.680
*Laughing*

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600
He looks like a super hero!

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.560
*tsk tsk tsk* (Cat calling noises)

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200
Yea you deserve it!  You deserve it!  You fell.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.840
You fell for our Youtube video.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.980
Abby spider cat now!  Oh!  There she goes!

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.860
Spider cat!  (tune of original Spider Man song)

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.640
*In The Hall of The Mountain King Plays*

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.740
She's actually a spider crawling up!

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.520
So Jimmy has noticed everyone in costumes and has run away each time I've tried to grab him.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.380
I got him a tuxedo, because he's a fancy boy!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.860
(To Jimmy) Here we go!  Oh, you're ready to get married!

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.580
Here you go!  Stand at the altar.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.840
To greet your bride!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.280
Oh my God look at that GQ!  GQ!  Yasss (yes) work it Jimmy! Yasss work it!  You look so handsome!

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.540
I think this is a sign that he's next.  I'm going to have Grandchildren soon.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.620
*gasps* Why are you hiding?!

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.500
Where are you going? *velcro being undone* This is in preparation for Halloween!

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.340
Be the bird!  *sighs* what a Diva!  Is this what having children is like?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.880
*Old time Saloon music playing*

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.520
Hah!

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.460
*Giggling*

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080
He's just backing up.  "How do I get out of this!?"

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.260
Oh my God!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.340
She doesn't like it, but she's tolerating it because she's nice.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.580
So many of these costumes are too small...except for Congress.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.120
Oh!  You are a fan favorite today!  Oh!

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.460
Roar!

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:34.360
This costume was even too small for Congo.  So I don't know exactly what kind of tiny animal is supposed to fit this.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.320
What do you think is going on through his head?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.360
Uh, I can't even begin to fathom what Congress is thinking.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.580
He's probably just uncomfortable and afraid to move.  Either that he's just thinking about life and whether or not he could potentially actually be a dinosaur.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.700
This!  I really want to get Jim in.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.780
Jim only did one costume and I want to get him in more.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.240
Oh he's taking a shit.  Haha.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.720
He's in the litter box!  Get him in the litter box!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.960
*humming melody*

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.260
*Laughing*

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.400
It looks like a Varsity Jacket for a cat because it's a fish!

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.780
(To Jimmy) Well you can pull it off on your own, you know you can.  Go ahead.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.340
I'm afraid he's going to get Crazy Town

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.320
Well he's mad!

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.720
(Jimmy) *low grumbling*

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.500
See?  Gosh!

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.100
I saw this pirate costume on a cat online, and I was like "I must have this!" But this is like, tiny!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:49.420
Like I can--my finger--and it's got elastic but it's like damn!  They should make this a little bigger.  You know cats are fat--so what are you doing?!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.840
Oh my God!  He looks so cute!  The illusion of him walking is so funny!

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.260
Walk a little bit!  Go ahead!

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.620
I've got one last costume left!  In a human.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.980
No!  That's it!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:20.000
That's all!  They don't like it.  I thought they'd like this one because it's not like you're in a costume.  You're just in my belly.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.080
Here!

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:31.680
Now this is my version of pregnancy.  Just a whole litter of kittens popping out of here!

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.280
She likes it!  I like this costume.  It keeps them close.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.120
So that kind of went exactly how I thought it would go--lots of anger all around--but they looked adorable.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.360
I wish more of the costumes were bigger.  We could only fit Congress into a bunch of them--and even then some of them were too small.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.640
But anyway!  I have been really enjoying this.  Let me know what my cats should review next!

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.720
And if you dress up your animals, what kind of costumes have you done?  Have you found any success?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.400
Or do cats just freeze all the time instantly?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.740
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
