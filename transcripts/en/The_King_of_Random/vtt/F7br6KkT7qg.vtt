00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.869
Oh there it goes oh

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:02.980
Wow

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.240
You know when it comes to experimenting often the devil is in the details

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.250
And there's a little small minute detail to make all the difference in the kind of results you get so for this video

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.220
We're back in the lab with our vacuum chamber and a bunch of water balloons to see if this time we can actually make them

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.469
Explode now the last time I tried putting water balloons in a vacuum chamber

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.340
I fully expected that once we drew a vacuum those water balloons would start boiling and expand to the point where they'd ruptured but in

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.539
Fact that didn't happen at all the balloons just sat there and was really anti-climatic

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.619
It was really surprising to me that the water didn't boil and the balloon didn't change shape at all

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.370
But I'm pretty sure the results in this

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.669
Experiment are going to be a little bit different because shortly after I put out that video our friends is the action lab reached out

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:48.299
With a suggestion. They suggested that the problem was we had our balloons filled with cold water if we use hot water it probably would have worked

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.499
So here's the premise of our experiment were going to start off the very first test with a cold water balloon

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.459
And we're going to position the neck of the water balloons facing upward so we can push all the air out

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.949
Before we tie it off. We don't want to have any air inside these balloons whatsoever now based on our last experiment

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.079
I'm expecting cold water will have no effect the balloon will basically just sit there at the same time

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.709
We're going to fill up another water balloon with hot water straight from the tap and place them side-by-side

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.549
And what do you predict is going to happen are the balloons going to stay the same well?

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.350
They both inflate well one infalte

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.100
And the other doesn't put your predictions in the comments below let's see if you're right

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.249
the other question on my mind is doesn't matter how hot the water is like can we use hot water right from the tap or

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.119
Do we need to boil it on the stove?

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.359
Obviously hot water from the tap isn't going to be nearly as hot as near boiling water, but will it still work?

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.699
Let's go put that to the test right now by now

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.850
We got cold water first

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.239
Now it's important to note neither of these balloons actually have any air in them

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.879
We held them up right we squirted all the air out so any

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.079
Growing any bubbling anything that happens inside these balloons will actually be because of the difference in the vapor pressure inside the balloon itself

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.000
This one is cold this one is hot let's see if our friends the action lab are right and see if it makes any kind

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
of difference at all in they go

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.970
perfect Lid goes on vacuum pump begins

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640
You can actually see the pink one growing a little bit

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.200
Oh, there it goes. Oh wow

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.480
sweet

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.910
Alright cool. Let's turn that off and talk about what just happened

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.899
Did you see that did you see the difference the blue water balloon?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.940
Did absolutely nothing it just stayed there in place kept its shape but the pink water balloon on the other hand

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.020
Started growing and then boom hit this point of no return where it expanded tremendously

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.660
hung out for a few seconds and then

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.459
Exploded and as soon as it did you can see all the water in the bottom was boiling profusely now

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.300
I still got this under vacuum

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.289
You can see there's a lot of mist in there, so if we go ahead and release the pressure let's see what happens

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.049
There's water everywhere, but it essentially clears the cloud and our cold water balloon is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.350
Exactly as we put it in so yes

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.879
I think that lends credibility to the idea that hot water balloons will explode in a vacuum and not only that

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.689
They explode with power and prestes knew what this makes you want to do

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.239
Blow it up. A whole bunch more if you can you do it again

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.110
clean up

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.870
All right here we go with round two

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.519
I got three more hot water balloons

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.319
And I made these ones different sizes just so we can find out whether size makes a difference. Let's drop them in and find out

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.750
Alright, Lid is on vacuum engaged

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.020
crazy crazy, okay let me talk about that first a second so observing this thing from a distance

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.660
I noticed the orange balloon did start to grow first

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.459
And then very quickly was followed by the yellow balloon now there was a short burst where the yellow balloon and started to grow a little

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.200
Bit faster, but they eventually caught up

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.239
and then when the green one started to filling up they all got jammed in the container together and then everything seemed to stop for

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.590
A second until the orange balloon popped suddenly and did you notice what happened when it did?

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.650
As soon as the orange balloon popped in all the water rushed out the other balloons began to shrink back down. That's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.560
interesting the reason I think that happened is because the vapor pressure of the water now in the container was less than that in the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.709
Balloon and so the vacuum was sucking that vapor first so theoretically if we dump the excess water out of this container and turn it

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.680
Back on we should be able to get that yellow and green balloon to pop as well

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.410
Let's see if that's really the case here we go

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.489
Yeah, so you look at all that water in there right now all that water just floating around free is the reason those other balloons

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.510
Won't expand if we get rid of that. I'm pretty confident. We can get the other ones to explode

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.179
So I've just dumped out the water these balloons. Aren't nearly as warm as they used to be however. They are still warm enough

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.180
I think let's find out

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.040
They're going to stop it right there for a second because obviously there's still a little water in there

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.219
And it's fighting against that water vaporizing off the bottom and the water in the balloon

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.019
So I'm actually gonna dry it with the paper towel make sure it's Crystal clean to see if that makes a difference

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.280
Love the way that shrink back down

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.949
boom

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.000
Okay, you know what it is these balloons

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.040
Have actually cooled down so much that they're not

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.659
Expanding as quickly as we wanted to hear so I'm going to start a fresh batch with warmer balloons

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.819
So you get that pop reaction we're looking for

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.790
Yeah, if I feel these balloons now they've cooled down quite a bit I

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.560
Mean this one's really like just room temperature this one's slightly warm

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.389
We are seeing them expanding but these aren't hot balloons anymore. It's cooled down quite a bit

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.839
I'm going to make up two new balloons with nice hot water same sizes

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.560
We'll see how they do all right back to new balloons this time warm water

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.820
Relatively warm makes my cheeks tingle, so let's put them in watch them grow

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.250
Cool very cool

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.210
All right guys well

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:32.450
I think that pretty much proves that hot water balloons in a vacuum chamber behaves much differently than cold water in a vacuum chamber here's

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.029
Why I think that happens the elastic resistance of the water balloons creates its own pressure and almost acts like its own atmosphere

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.589
Inside the balloon now the vapor pressure of water in Standard atmosphere has to overcome

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.489
14.7 PsI at sea level for it to actually vaporize

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.750
That's why if we create a vacuum and reduce that pressure it'll boil at much lower temperatures

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.029
But the opposite is true when inside a balloon

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.220
it's almost like putting a balloon over the whole Earth and

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.560
Compressing the atmosphere which means the temperature would have to be much higher to get it to boil and once the balloon

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:07.579
Begins to Expand the pressure inside is already less which accelerates the reaction rapidly until the balloon is so enormous the skin ruptures

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.890
So guys we learn something new we learned a bit more about

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.960
Atmospheric pressure vapor pressure of water itself and some of the difference of how cold water reacts VS

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.760
The hot water to stuff and of course a big thanks to our friends at the action lab for reaching out with this solution

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.380
You go ahead and check your youtube inbox. I'm sending in 25 bucks. Thanks for joining us for this experiment today

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.380
We'll be looking for the next one. Talk to you then oh

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.300
Wow

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.450
Apparently putting balloons with water in the microwave makes them explode as well

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.909
Oh, yeah, look how fast that goes that's amazing

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.499
Dang, I was only like five seconds the whole thing went from nothing to eruption

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.399
Hey guys, there is an event called CVx live that. I'm going to be at august 3rd through 5th stage presentations meet and greets

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:50.159
There's even a special superfan experience where we can hang out one-on-one

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.880
So click the link in the description and I'll be looking for you at CVX live
