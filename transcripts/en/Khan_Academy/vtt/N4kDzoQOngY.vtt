00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.050
100 is what percent of 80?

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.080
These problems tend to kill
people because on some level

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.260
they're kind of simple, they're
just 100 and an 80

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.130
there, and they're asking
what percent.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.530
But then people get confused.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.210
They say, do I divide
the 100 by the 80?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.080
The 80 by 100?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.570
Or is it something
else going on?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.630
And you really just have to
think through what the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.660
language is saying.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.410
They're saying that this value
right here, this 100, is some

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.480
percentage of 80, and that some
percentage is what we

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.310
have to figure out.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.020
What percent?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.370
So if we multiply 80 by this
what percent, we will get 100.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.720
So let's view it this way.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.200
We have 80.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.510
If we multiply it by something,
let's call this

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.700
something x.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.900
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.350
If we multiply 80 by
something, we are

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.180
going to get 100.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.960
And we need to figure out
what we need to multiply

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.510
80 by to get 100.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.040
And if we just solve this
equation as it is, we're going

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.920
to get a value for x.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.459
And what we need to do is then
convert it to a percent.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.540
Another way you could have
viewed this is 100 is what you

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.670
get when you multiply
what by 80?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.750
And then you would have gotten
this number, and then you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.800
could convert it to a percent.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.540
So this is essentially
the equation and now

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.520
we can solve it.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.280
If we divide both sides of this
equation by 80, so you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.210
divide the left-hand side by
80, the right-hand side

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.615
by 80, you get x.

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:30.950
x is equal to 100/80.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.150
They both share a common factor
of 20, so 100 divided

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.010
by 20 is 5, and 80 divided
by 20 is 4.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.180
So in simplest form, x is equal
to 5/4, but I've only

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.210
expressed it as a fraction.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.290
But they want to know
what percent of 80.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.720
If they just said 100
is what fraction of

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.680
80, we would be done.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.570
We could say 100 is 5/4
of 80, and we would

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.470
be absolutely correct.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.130
But they want to say
what percent?

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.080
So we have to convert this to
a percent, and the easiest

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.570
thing to do is to first convert
it into a decimal, so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.199
let's do that.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:16.700
5/4 is literally the same thing
as 5 divided by 4, so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.560
let's figure out what that is.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.010
Let me do it in magenta.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.950
So 5 divided by 4.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190
You want to have all the
decimals there, so let's put

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.860
some zeroes out here.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200
4 goes into 5 one time.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.370
Let me switch up the colors.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.200
1 times 4 is 4.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.410
You subtract.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.690
You get 5 minus 4 is 1.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.290
Bring down the next zero.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.350
And of course, the decimal is
sitting right here, so we want

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.880
to put it right over there.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.950
So you bring down
the next zero.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.170
4 goes into 10 two times.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.450
2 times 4 is 8.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.610
You subtract.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.690
10 minus 8 is 2.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.875
Bring down the next zero.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.700
4 goes into 20 five times.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.920
5 times 4 is 20.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.670
Subtract.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.820
No remainder.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.090
So this is equal to 1.25.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.820
5/4 is the same thing
as 5 divided by 4,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.050
which is equal to 1.25.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:28.220
So far, we could say, 100 is
1.25 times 80, or 1.25 of 80,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.170
you could even say, But we still
haven't expressed it as

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.770
a percentage.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.650
This is really just
as a number.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.900
I guess you could call it a
decimal, but it's a whole

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.680
number and a decimal.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.750
It would be a mixed number if we
didn't do it as a decimal.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.670
It's 1 and 1/4, or 1 and 25
hundredths, however you want

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.580
to read it.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.500
So to write it as a percent,
you literally just have to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.450
multiply this times 100, or
shift the decimal over twice.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.530
So this is going to be equal to,
as a percent, if you just

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:11.930
shift the decimal over twice,
this is equal to 125%.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.980
And that makes complete sense.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.470
100 is 125% of 80.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.890
80 is 100% of 80.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.779
100% percent is more than 80.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.660
It's actually 1 and 1/4 of 80,
and you see that right over

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.510
there, so it makes sense.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.470
It's 125%.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.810
It's more than 100%.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.740
But we are done.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.950
We've solved the problem.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.850
It is a 125% of 80.
