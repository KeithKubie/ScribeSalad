00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.630
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.510
In this video we'd like to do
another optimization problem.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.610
This one's a little bit harder
than the distance problem.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.750
So the question
is the following:

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.810
consider triangles formed by
lines passing through the point

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.390
x-- (8, 4), sorry, the
x-axis and the y-axis.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.469
Find the dimensions
that minimize area.

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.010
So what does this
fist sentence mean?

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.290
It really means use
this point to draw

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.537
a line through this point--
I'll give you an example,

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:37.120
it's kind of a wiggly line, but
hopefully it looks like a line

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.850
to you-- and it makes a triangle
with this line, the x-axis,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.980
and the y-axis.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.130
We can certainly calculate
the area of that triangle.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.680
So the problem is
asking you to find

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.360
the dimensions of
the triangle that

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.720
minimize the area
with the constraint

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.802
that the line, the hypotenuse
goes through the point (8, 4).

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.010
I'm going to give you a
couple minutes to work on it.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.480
Why don't you pause video here
and then when you're ready,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.970
restart the video,
I'll come back,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.469
and I'll help you
solve the problem.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.460
Welcome back.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.860
So again, we're doing
an optimization problem.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.840
And we want to optimize--
because it says minimize area,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.270
we know the optimizing
equation is area.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.580
So let's be very clear.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.320
Always, when you're
doing these problems,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.430
you have, again, as
we've said previously,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.420
you have a constraint
equation and you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.140
have an optimizing equation.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.860
The optimizing equation now,
we've already said, is area.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.740
And area, the easiest way
to write area in this form

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.710
is-- notice that this distance,
we could write it as base times

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.980
height or we could
write it as x times y--

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.250
so the base here is x
and the height here is y.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.230
So the area of the triangle
is 1/2 base times height.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.490
So the area is 1/2 x times y.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.140
That's the thing we
want to optimize.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.600
The problem is that we know when
we're doing these optimization

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.670
problems we want to take
a derivative of area

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.030
with respect to a variable, but
right now we have two variables

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.590
and so that's where the
constraint equation comes in.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.880
So now we have to figure out how
we're going to use a constraint

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.780
equation here.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.120
The constraint is that it has to
go through this point, (8, 4).

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.880
So what does our line
have to look like?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.670
Well, our line has to look like,
ultimately-- let's do, maybe,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.550
the point-slope form.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.240
y is equal-- or sorry.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.320
I said point-slope form.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.590
y minus 4 is equal
to m times x minus 8.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.090
Right?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.840
Notice I couldn't
pick what m was.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.394
Because the m completely
determines the line.

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:53.560
So hopefully that make
sense, that you can see that.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.960
Now, in fact, let's look at
how this problem will work.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.550
The m is going to
determine this point

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.720
and it's going to
determine this point.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.360
If you can't see that,
well, let's look back here.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.145
This point is when y equals 0.

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:12.670
Right?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.620
So I can put in y equals 0
and I get x in terms of m.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.620
If I come back over here
and look at this point,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.900
this is when x equals 0.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.590
So if I put in 0 for x, I
can find y in terms of m.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.870
So these two values, the
x-value and the y-value,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.870
completely determined on
the slope of this line.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.661
That hopefully makes
sense just even if you

00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.610
look at the geometric picture.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.010
When I turn about this point
at (8, 4) these values change.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.820
So the x and y
values are completely

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.470
determined by the
slope of the line.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.270
In fact, the area,
then, is completely

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.494
determined by the
slope of the line.

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:51.910
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.390
going to use the
constraint equation

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.890
to find x and y values,
all in terms of the slope.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.430
So let's do that.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.710
I said when y is 0,
what do we get for x?

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:14.100
We get negative 4 over
m plus 8 is equal to x.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.100
Let me double check my math so
I don't have to re-shoot this.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.420
When y is 0 I divide
by m, I add 8, I get x.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.780
So that is the x-value I'm
interested in down here.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.230
When x is 0-- let's see
what I get-- when x is 0

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.485
I get negative 8m plus 4 is y.

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:35.985
Right?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.354
x is 0, negative 8m plus 4.

00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:47.520
So now what I'm going to
do is plug these two things

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.620
into the area equation.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.680
Area is now equal
to 1/2 of x times y.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.920
So 1/2 of 8 minus
4 over m times--

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.170
you know what I'm going to do?

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.900
I'm going to take this 1/2
and kill off terms in there

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.910
so I don't have to
worry about it anymore--

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.920
negative 4m plus 2.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.430
So this is x and
this is half of y.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.630
So just to make it simpler I'm
not carrying through the 1/2--

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.080
I'm killing off
half of the things,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.391
dividing every term in y by 2.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.890
And again, what are
we trying to do?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.110
We're trying to optimize.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.430
So now we want to take
the derivative of area

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.680
with respect to the slope.

00:05:34.524 --> 00:05:38.520
So this is-- maybe to simplify
first, let's multiply through.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.260
So this is just a little
bit of algebra really quick.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.130
8 times 4 is 32, so I
get negative 32m plus 16.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.630
And then here, negative
times negative is a positive.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.980
4 times 4 is 16.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.330
m divided by m, I just get 16.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.155
And then here I get negative 8m.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.030
So I had to do a little
bit of algebra first,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.970
but this is much easier
to take a derivative

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.140
and not make mistakes
than this one.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.790
Because you'd have a
product rule and then

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.520
you'd still have to multiply.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.130
So we might as well
multiply out first.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.080
So now let me just take
the derivative of this.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.690
And again, I'm taking the
derivative with respect to m.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.340
So here I just get
negative 32, 0,

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.300
0, and then what's the
derivative of-- this

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.730
is a minus 8m-- well, the
derivative of 1 over m,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.269
if you remember, is
negative 1 over m squared.

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:39.185
I have another negative
here, so this is going

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:40.460
to be plus 8 over m squared.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.960
Right?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.250
Optimizing, we want to set
the derivative equal to 0.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.900
So if I set the
derivative equal to 0

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.180
and solve I get 32 m squared
equals 8, or m squared

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:03.580
is equal to 8 over 32, which
is 1/4, or m is equal to 1/2.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.600
Or I should say,
plus or minus 1/2.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.580
We need to be aware.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.790
I would run into problems
if I didn't put the minus.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.910
So solving this problem, I see
that-- again, what did I do?

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.370
I set area prime equal to 0,
move the 32 over, multiply

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.720
by m squared, do
some algebra, and I

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.710
get m is equal to
plus or minus 1/2.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.690
And now we need to see which
of these things make sense

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.240
and then we just need to
think about what happens as m

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.070
goes to its extreme values.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.130
So let's come back and
look at the picture

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.210
and from there we can probably
tell which of these answers

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.720
we need.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.200
So it's m equals 1/2 or
m equals minus 1/2 that

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.680
we want to know which
of these do we need.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.120
So I'm going to use some
different colored chalk

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.080
to draw what's happening here.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.830
Notice the slope of
this line is negative.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.210
Right?

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.900
If I were going to do a
positive sloping line, which

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.230
would be the case where
m is equal to 1/2,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.410
I would get something that's
headed in this direction.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.770
And notice that that's not going
to make a triangle with the x-

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.050
and y-axis.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.660
And so immediately m equals
1/2 isn't even in this problem,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.830
isn't allowed to work.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.680
OK, now where did it come from?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120
It came because somewhere
I was multiplying m

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.830
by itself, which maybe isn't
actually in the original part.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.295
I was introducing a new
thing happening, there,

00:08:27.295 --> 00:08:29.420
so I'm not going to get
into it too much because we

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.500
can immediately see
that we don't have

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.300
to worry about m equals 1/2.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.670
m equals minus 1/2 looks good.

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.540
That's sloping in
this direction.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.860
And in fact, that would
give us a nice triangle.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.690
The extreme values in
this case are obviously

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.340
when m is sloping all the
way up to being vertical,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.240
or when m is sloping
to being horizontal.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.190
And in both of those cases you
notice that the area is getting

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.320
arbitrarily large, it's headed
towards infinity in both cases.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.197
So I don't need to worry about
looking at the extreme values.

00:09:01.197 --> 00:09:03.030
There aren't end points
really in this case.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.529
But the extreme
values, they're both

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:07.540
going to positive
infinity, the areas.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.780
Which convinces me
even more that where

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.492
m is equal to minus 1/2
is going to be a minimum.

00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:15.200
You could also take
the second derivative

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.250
and run the second derivative
test, but even geometrically,

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.770
we can see in the picture
that at m equals negative 1/2

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.550
we actually get a
negative sign for the--

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.770
or, sorry-- a
minimizer for the area.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.100
And now the question asks
to find the dimensions.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.935
How do I go back and
find the dimensions?

00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:33.810
I'm not going to do any
more on this problem,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.350
but you can do it
to finish it off.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.950
Finding the dimensions,
I know what m is.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.400
I also know what
x is in terms of m

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.870
and what y is in terms of m.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.130
So I just evaluate x at the
m and evaluate y at that m.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.410
That gives me the dimensions
that will complete the problem.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.091
But I think I'll stop there.
