1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,730
Before launching into a pension today.

2
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:08,270
I thought I would just take a few moments
to look back over the books that we've

3
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:13,271
read and talk about the
visions of language that
they have offered us and also

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:19,460
just to reflect for a
moment on the relationship.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,970
Imagine between those visions of
language and what is happening outside of

6
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,510
fiction in in what we
might call the real world.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,170
We started this course talking about black
boy and the way that a whole world of

8
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,230
pressure,
political pressure,

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,440
racial tension pushed on the borders of
that work and actually changed it's very

10
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:48,800
material form.

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,020
After that I began a series of readings
of novels that emphasized more what you

12
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:02,630
might call the history of literature,

13
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,620
the history of literature,

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,670
forms and ambitions and so beginning that
series we had O'Connor embodying a new

15
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:18,731
critical craft of fiction that comes
out of modernism imagining nevertheless

16
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:26,171
that that craft is reflective of a
transcendental order in the world or

17
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,170
religious order.

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,543
Okay.

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,080
When we moved on to Nebach off,

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,110
we had an author trying
to imagine a work of art,

21
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:45,361
so autonomous from the world that it
could be something like an autonomous form

22
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,024
of life.

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,530
That of course I argued in those lectures,

24
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,310
opened it up for the threat of mortality.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,700
If you imagine your artwork
is living at can also die.

26
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,560
It's a kind of haunted Agnus
that surrounds Nepal, coughs,

27
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:09,280
vision of aesthetic bliss.
Um,

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,460
as one's response to
that autonomous artwork,

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,910
Kira whack represents a
whole group of writers.

30
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:23,911
The beats who reject the formalism
embodied by both O'Connor and Novaka off.

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:27,680
Okay.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,680
They reject that formalism
as an impediment to languages
access to the real and

33
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:40,670
to our access to the
real through language.

34
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,910
They dream of an unmediated relationship
between experience and the word.

35
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,400
They don't think so much of
language as a mediating force,

36
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,470
as an expressive force.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,233
Yeah.

38
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,880
I argued in my lecture second lecture on,

39
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,881
on the road that in the end that dream
looks quite deflated when Dean can't even

40
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:15,421
speak in a coherent sentence and
he has to be rejected by sal.

41
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,130
As Sal drives off to the jazz concert.
At Carnegie Hall.

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,850
Nevertheless,
that dream is spiritualized.

43
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,250
It's a way of becoming, not
just, uh, close to the real,

44
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,740
but also part of some mystical unity.

45
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,550
That thread of the mystical quality of
language at its extreme of literary power

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,060
is what I drew out of Franny and Zooey.

47
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,420
So Salinger two has the dream that
the artifice of literature of Literary

48
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,380
language,

49
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,380
the performance of language and the
style of his novels can somehow be the

50
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:10,630
essence of the human soul.
That it can somehow,

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,320
uh,

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,320
communicate the truth of the
universe just through its form,

53
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,740
its human distinctive form.

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,390
It's a way of thinking about form
that has more to do with, uh,

55
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,150
individuality than it
does with convention.

56
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Remember that way that Franny can identify
the Tambour of her brother's voice,

57
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,420
very specifically,
it's like no other.

58
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,013
Okay,

59
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,010
so sound,

60
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,010
you're imagines that the literary art
imitates that kind of voice and in that

61
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,960
way it is a sacred practice,
a sacred art.

62
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,423
Okay.

63
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Barth rejects the idea that language
is an unmediated form of access to the

64
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:05,250
real, absolutely impossible for
Barth to countenance that idea.

65
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,510
He sees life as continually,

66
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,440
always already mediated by language.

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,140
Now I should say as as,
um,

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,380
someone from the class who came up to
me after lecture asked me about this,

69
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,710
that Barthes understanding of language
as preceding human understanding

70
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:30,621
proceeding any sense of ourselves in a
sense always slipping out of our control

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,560
is very much in concert with what was
going on at very high level language

72
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:38,790
theory at that time.

73
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,300
So the work of Jacques Lacan in
France in the 1950s and sixties,

74
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,380
and of Jacques Derrida who
brought deconstruction to
the United States actually

75
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,760
to Johns Hopkins,

76
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,630
first of all in the 1960s
where Barth was teaching,

77
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,600
he presented that work
in a famous lecture, um,

78
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,100
in the late sixties.

79
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,880
This is all part of a way of thinking
about language that became very powerful

80
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,430
through the next decade and a half.

81
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,510
And we're going to see it
some too next week. Uh,

82
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:17,270
when we read Morrison
and Maxine Hong Kingston.

83
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,810
So this is part of a larger
intellectual trajectory.

84
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,290
Barth is not alone in thinking
these things about language.

85
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I argued that Barth tried to counter that
sense of helplessness at the hands of

86
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:36,011
language by imagining that the human
effort at connecting with another person

87
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,450
through the mechanisms of love and
desire always renewed the possibility for

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,910
language to do new kinds
of work in the world.

89
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,160
So if language seems exhausted
because it's always preceding you,

90
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,200
everything has always already been said,
there's no new plot to be had.

91
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,560
The world is full of stock phrases.

92
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,620
How do you use them to embody and
experience that seems fresh to you.

93
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,880
How do those stock phrases alienate you
from the very experience you hope that

94
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:14,930
they can describe?

95
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,590
He thinks that following out desire can
renew language and mentally ad I think

96
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,030
is his attempt at doing that.

97
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,920
So now we arrive at pension and I want
to suggest that Barth was still dreaming

98
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:41,150
of a pretty autonomous
version of the literary art,

99
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,570
even though in his 1987 preface
to loft lost in the fun house.

100
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:50,450
I don't know if any of
you read it. Um, he,

101
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,990
he says about these stories which
were published throughout the 60s.

102
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,180
The high sixties, like the roaring
twenties was a time of more than unusual,

103
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,520
more than usual ferment
in American social,

104
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,510
political and artistic life are unpopular.
War in Vietnam,

105
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:10,280
political assassinations, race riots,
the hippy, counterculture, pop art,

106
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,020
mass poetry,
reading street theater,

107
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,700
vigorous avant garde ism in all the arts
together with dire predictions not only

108
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,650
of the depth of,
of the novel,

109
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,090
but of the more abundant t of the print
medium in the electronic global village.

110
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,490
Those flavored the air we breathe.

111
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,720
Then along with occasional tear
gas and other contaminants,

112
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,190
one may sniff traces of
that air in the funhouse.

113
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,090
I myself found it more
invigorating than disturbing me.

114
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,880
The reader find these stories.
Likewise,

115
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,080
it's a very interesting little
comparison he makes at the end.

116
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,950
He takes that whole foment of
1960s politics and counterculture.

117
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,510
And essentially he says,

118
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,990
I found that invigorating as I hope you
will find these stories invigorating as

119
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:04,971
if the stories in this very
almost seemingly hermetically
sealed literary world

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that he offers us are somehow meant to
have the effects of a whole decade of

121
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,400
foment social foment.

122
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:16,790
Okay.

123
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,770
If Barth only gestures towards that world,

124
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,470
the politics of that decade
pension actually lets us,

125
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,970
uh,
see it.

126
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,050
And if you look on page 83,
uh,

127
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,350
this is just one of many,
many examples,

128
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,650
but I choose this one just
because it's so obvious.

129
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,733
Yeah.

130
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,290
Add a pie is going to Berkeley
looking for Emery boards

131
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,560
and she comes a on a summer,
weekday in the midafternoon.

132
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,120
No time for any campus at a new have
to be jumping yet. This one was,

133
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,440
she came down slope from Wheeler Hall
through Sather Gate into the plaza,

134
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:09,670
teaming with Corduroy Denim, bare
legs, blonde hair, horn rims,

135
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,140
bicycle spokes in the sun,
bookbags swing card tables,

136
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:19,141
long paper petitions dangling to
earth posters for undecipherable,

137
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,480
f. F. S. Ms y a. N. S. Y v.

138
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:26,950
D sees suds in the fountain,
students nose to nose and dialogue.

139
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,610
She moved through it, carrying
her fat book attracted, unsure,

140
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:32,980
a stranger wanting to feel relevant,

141
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:37,360
but knowing how much of a search among
alternative universes it would take.

142
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,830
Four, she had undergone her own
educating at a time of nerves,

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,550
blandness and retreat not only
among her fellow students,

144
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,230
but also most of the visible
structure around and ahead of them.

145
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,930
That whole world of government and,

146
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,990
and social life at a Pi is an a different
generation of a different generation,

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,330
but we can see the social foment just
in that little snapshot of the Berkeley

148
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,000
campus. Those, I don't
know all of the acronyms.

149
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,790
I don't know what the fsms are,

150
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,160
but the why ETFs are the
young Americans for freedom.

151
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,050
The vcs are the Vietnam Day committees.
Um,

152
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,300
the Vietnam Day Committee
organized a 24 hour teach in,

153
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,820
in 1965 against the Vietnam war.

154
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,580
Hmm.

155
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,580
There's a little anecdote from that teach
him that I want to share with you that

156
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,860
I think embodies some of
the tensions in this knob.

157
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,763
Cool.

158
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,670
They invited Ken Keasy to come and
speak at the convention at the teaching.

159
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,550
Now, Ken Keasy, uh,

160
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,110
some of you probably know was
a sort of performer, writer,

161
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,770
not really an activist.
Um,

162
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,130
he was a purveyor of street theater and
most famously the advocate of LSD and he

163
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:06,391
and his merry pranksters would a ride
around the country doing street theater

164
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:10,720
advert advocating the use
of LSD and marijuana. Um,

165
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,520
who in 1964 do you think drove their bus,
which was called further.

166
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,000
Who Do you think drove their boss?
Neal Cassady.

167
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Neal Cassady drove their bus when they
came to the Vietnam Day at the Berkeley

168
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:31,060
campus. Keasy addressed the
assembled people saying,

169
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,420
turn your back on the war.
Look at the war.

170
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,050
Turn your back on the war and say,
fuck it.

171
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,460
Yeah.

172
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,460
This is a group of people
he was addressing who were
intent on doing something

173
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:49,100
to stop the war.
And this was keasy his response.

174
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,400
That moment for me embodies these,

175
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,550
this tension right at
the senator of the 1960s,

176
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,390
attention between countercultural
self development and an ethos of play

177
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,310
drop out, uh, tune in.

178
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:16,180
I can't remember. Keys, these
little hole, a little motto. Um,

179
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,850
essentially leave the
institutional life of America.

180
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:25,450
That means schools, government, politics,

181
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,680
all those traditional sources
of water and create disorder.

182
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,310
And do that as a way of finding
what's true about yourself.

183
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,050
Do it in the company of others.
It had this communal aspect for sure.

184
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,420
On the other side,

185
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,490
you have a growing political
movement among young people.

186
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,940
And of course it's legendary.
By 1964,

187
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:54,270
the civil rights movement had
accomplished amazing things.

188
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,500
So as a result of the freedom rides,

189
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:03,501
they had integrated interstate
transportation at great
cost to the volunteers

190
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:07,830
who wrote those buses. They were
beaten. Uh, some were killed,

191
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,810
civil rights workers were
murdered in various states. Um,

192
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,740
it had come to a kind of crescendo with
voter registration drives and the voting

193
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:24,270
right act rights act of 1964.
At the same time,

194
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,970
uh, Lyndon B Johnson was
ratcheting up of the Vietnam War.

195
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,140
So the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was
passed in 1964 which authorized bombing

196
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:38,460
raids on Cambodia.

197
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,470
This was a new turn in the war
and it promised to escalate it.

198
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,240
And this really galvanized,
especially student resistance.

199
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,710
So this was a time of major political
stakes and young people at universities,

200
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:01,760
primarily at universities, but also
people out doing the march on Washington,

201
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,910
uh, in the south, in small towns,

202
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,090
we're really changing the face of
America and its role in the world.

203
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,590
So can keasy on the one hand is looking
for that internally directed playful

204
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,250
response to the oppressive
order of the world.

205
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:30,251
And then there's this very
political response pension
let's us see both and he's

206
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:35,810
parodying both kinds of
response in this novel.

207
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:39,380
So in that sense,
the novel is very much of its time.

208
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,530
Now I want to, uh, pause for a
moment there and asks you a question.

209
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,360
I want you to think about what kind of
protagonist pension sends out into this

210
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,710
world.
What do you think of [inaudible]?

211
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,950
How does she strike you as a character?
How would you describe her?

212
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,180
Yeah,
that's true.

213
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,040
Desperate. Okay. How else?
Yeah, powerless. Powerless.

214
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,580
[inaudible]. Confused. Confused.

215
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,983
What else?

216
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,250
Those are all pretty, um,
pretty negative adjectives.

217
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,850
Does she bring any resources?
Yes.

218
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,180
She's attractive. Yes, she is. What else?
What other resources does she bring?

219
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,340
Yeah, she's curious. She's curious.
Yeah. What else? Anything else

220
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,070
determined [inaudible]

221
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,600
when this book first came out,

222
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,190
critics called her a lightweight.

223
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,000
Was that a word that ever occurred to you?

224
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,890
Did anyone think this is
just a fluff character?

225
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:03,980
Okay.

226
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,980
I would suggest to you that the difference
in your response and the critics is a

227
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:13,670
difference. The difference that
feminism in the 70s made, um,

228
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,780
in the 1960s to have a protagonist
go into the world and discover this

229
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:25,710
incredibly complex set of patterns.
Uh,

230
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,850
and to have that protagonists to be a
housewife was very much playing against

231
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,351
type.

232
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:35,870
So pinch and took a certain kind of risk
by choosing to make his protagonist to

233
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:39,770
housewife.
So the question is why did he do that?

234
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,530
I want to suggest to you
that he did that because

235
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,150
a woman is to occupy certain conventional
roles at this moment and we see her in

236
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,730
one at the very beginning of the novel.
She is,

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,350
has just come back from a Tupperware party
where the waitress or the hostess put

238
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,520
too much cure in the punch.
So she's a little drunk.

239
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,060
So you get this image of her as this
stereotypical 50s housewife going to

240
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:19,110
Tupperware parties and then she
makes salad. She does the shopping,

241
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:22,230
she picks her herbs from the garden,
she makes Lasagna,

242
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,060
she mixes drinks so that they'll
be ready when mucho comes home,

243
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,640
when her husband comes home.
Very typical.

244
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,830
So this is the moment in
which she discovers that
she's been chosen or named as

245
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,260
the executor tricks of Pierce's will.

246
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,850
Okay.

247
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,850
It's that conventionality that then
allows her to occupy multiple roles.

248
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,480
And let me just, um, detail some of those.

249
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,420
You see it almost in language of a side.

250
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,060
Um,
this is when she first meets Gangas Cohen.

251
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,960
Yes.
Now the names in here,

252
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:07,480
we have to think about them at some point.
Um,

253
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,760
one thing you can say about
them is that they are funny.

254
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,100
A second thing you can say about them
is that they seem redolent of meaning.

255
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,160
I can't tell you how many scholars have
come up with different readings of what

256
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:25,920
Ed oppose name means.
That's just ed a.

257
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,670
And then there were so many hundreds of
others. Um, they are redolent of meaning.

258
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,630
What are we to do with that fact?
That's a question for you. Three,

259
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,270
they declare that language
is always mediated,

260
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,960
always mediating that your experience
of people is never clear of some set of

261
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,510
meanings that someone
else has assigned to it.

262
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,080
Your encounter with the
world is always mediated.

263
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,320
So these names drag associations with
them and one question you want to ask is

264
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:01,640
what to do with those,

265
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,410
but I'm going to set that question
aside for a moment and note that at at

266
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:10,340
meeting Gangas at a puff
felt at once motherly.

267
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:11,970
Yeah.

268
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,490
Now this may seem like a small aside,

269
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,270
but if we look also on 73

270
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,600
when she meets Mr Thought,

271
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,320
she says on the, on the very top topic
he's telling at OPA her dream, his dream,

272
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,690
and she sees in it clues to
the third and taxes mystery,

273
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,250
Oedipus sensitized,

274
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,550
thinking of the bronze marker smiled at
him as granddaughter Lee as she knew how

275
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:48,190
and asked did he ever have to fight
off desperadoes. And then of course,

276
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:53,191
she gets a major clue for figuring out
what the whole story is behind the truth

277
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,550
stereo and the post
torn granddaughter Lee.

278
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,710
It's a role she can occupy,
uh, with great ease.

279
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,400
A last example on one 22

280
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,940
this is when she's going
to meet, uh, Emery boards

281
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,280
at upper showered,
put on a sweater skirt and sneakers,

282
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,470
wrapped her hair in a student like twist,
went easy on the makeup.

283
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,230
These are her resources,
makeup,

284
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,010
clothes,
hair with them.

285
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,690
She can occupy all these different roles.

286
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,830
And in doing so, she has access
to certain kinds of knowledge.

287
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,110
Her roles are s fluid in some ways,

288
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,690
as Pierce's were.
Remember that when Pierce calls her,

289
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,700
he's always impersonating someone.

290
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,100
So he was speaking with his
Lamant Cranston voice the
last time that she spoke

291
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:05,934
to him.

292
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,340
The difference between the way at Hipaa
occupies these various roles and pierce

293
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:12,174
did it,

294
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,420
is that adipose roles have a kind of
traction in the world with other people

295
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,103
that,

296
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,730
that pierces voices or even Dr Hilarious.

297
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:28,731
His voices simply don't have
these male versions of it are all.

298
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,650
So apparently performances
that they can't, uh,

299
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,820
they can't get much out of them
except to a noise at a pub.

300
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,490
But at OPA jumps right into
these conventional roles.

301
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,700
And in that act comes to know more
about the world in a way that these men

302
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,194
cannot

303
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,360
add a Pi is even from,

304
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,380
from the time she was a child,
a reader.

305
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:06,381
And we find that out on page 14
when she has her religious instant.

306
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:12,960
And I hope you remembered
that scene of um,

307
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:16,200
sal looking down on Salt Lake City,
the birthplace of,

308
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,670
of Dean from on the road.
Very similar structure.

309
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,780
He looks down and he sees the
little city laid out, uh, below him.

310
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,360
So this is at OPA.

311
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,080
In one of the first instances
of her becoming a reader,

312
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,880
she looked down a slope needing
to squint for the sunlight.

313
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:41,150
This is when she first sees
San Nurses sent, I'm sorry,

314
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:45,710
San Narcisso onto a vast sprawl of
houses which had grown up together like a

315
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,900
well tended crop from
the dull brown earth.

316
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,460
And she thought of the time she'd opened
a transistor radio to replace a battery

317
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,100
and seeing her first printed circuit.

318
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,230
The ordered swirl of houses and streets
from this high angle sprang at her.

319
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:05,231
Now with the same unexpected astonishing
clarity as the circuit card had,

320
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,940
though she knew even less about radios
than about southern Californians.

321
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,380
There were two both outward patterns,

322
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:17,030
a hieroglyphic sense of concealed
meaning of an intent to communicate.

323
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,200
There'd seemed no limit to what the
printed circuit could have told her if she

324
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:25,730
had tried to find out.
So in her first minute of San Narcisso,

325
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,920
a revelation also trembled,

326
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:30,950
just passed the threshold
of her understanding.

327
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,130
Smog hung all round the horizon.

328
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,280
The Sun on the bright beige
countryside was painful.

329
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:42,320
She and the Chevy seemed park at the
center of an odd religious instant,

330
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,470
as if on some other
frequency or out of the,

331
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:49,160
I have some world wind rotating
too slow for her heated skin,

332
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,630
even to feel the centrifical
coolness of words were being spoken.

333
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,790
She suspected that much.

334
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,780
She thought of Mucho her husband
trying to believe in his job.

335
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,100
Was it something like this?

336
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:05,090
He felt looking through the soundproof
glass at one of his colleagues with a

337
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:09,560
headset clamped on and queuing the next
record with movements stylized as the

338
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:14,030
handling of Chrism Sensor
Chalice might be for a holy man,

339
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,210
yet really tuned in to the voice voices,
the music.

340
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:21,800
It's messaged surrounded by digging it
as were all the faithful at went out to,

341
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:24,740
did Mucho stand outside
studio a looking in,

342
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,920
knowing that even if he could hear it,
he couldn't believe in it.

343
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,940
She gave up presently as if a cloud had
approached the son or the smog thickened

344
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,410
and so broken the religious instant,
whatever it might have been.

345
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,780
Yeah.

346
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Here the cloud becomes the obscuring of
this sense of intent to communicate or a

347
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,890
sense of meanings pattern,

348
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,840
but it still retains as it
did in Flannery O'Connor.

349
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,960
That spiritual sense that the
divine is always shrouded round.

350
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:08,360
Bye.
Some cloud of unknowing

351
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,581
here.

352
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:15,581
We see her with the desire to know and
the difference between her as a child and

353
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:20,621
her in this moment is that she had not
bothered to find out if she had tried to

354
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:25,010
find out about the radio circuit,
she would've learned something.

355
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:28,220
She did not try this time she will try.

356
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,740
So she's a reader who notices patterns
even from a young age and at this moment

357
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,860
she has called upon and she rises to the
occasion to figure out what the pattern

358
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,573
will mean.

359
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,230
And of course she progresses through
a kind of education as a reader.

360
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,490
She goes from being a reader
who can listen. For example,

361
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:53,460
to the ambiguity's in the war finger play.

362
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,210
She can hear when the ambiguity creeps
in between the words and that tells her

363
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,080
that she needs to find something out.

364
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,550
That's what causes her to have
the curiosity to go backstage.

365
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,740
She becomes a critic.
She moves from interpretation

366
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,390
to actually finding the history and the
intertextuality and the variations of

367
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:21,910
these additions of the play.

368
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,140
She learns history of the u s and
of Europe about the mail systems.

369
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,580
She learns the history of
[inaudible] enterprises.

370
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,280
So she becomes a scholar in a
certain way in amateur scholar.

371
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,960
She's not just a reader. She is
someone who actually performs research.

372
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,720
Where does all this get
her? Well, I think, uh,

373
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:54,721
what we're led to believe is precisely
nowhere in terms of revelation.

374
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,010
Does a revelation ever happen?
Of course,

375
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,840
the book ends with her waiting for the
anonymous bitter to reveal himself.

376
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,520
Whether that would ever happen if
pension had decided to let us in on the

377
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,930
secret,
I don't know.

378
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,600
Pension instead chooses to end
the novel before that moment.

379
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,750
Yeah,

380
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,610
and so we're left with a
kind of emptiness. We're left
with the multiple options

381
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,353
that

382
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:35,230
she laments.
If you look on one 46 one 47,

383
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,010
she rehearses all the possibilities

384
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,703
of meaning

385
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,830
and her conclusion.
Finally.

386
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,403
Okay,

387
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,320
is this San Narcisso,

388
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:02,410
was the name an incident among our
climatic records of dreams and what dreams

389
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,390
became among our accumulated daylight,

390
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,680
a moment's squall line or tornadoes
touchdown among the higher,

391
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,800
more continental solemnities storm
systems of group suffering and need

392
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,210
prevailing winds of affluence.
There was the true continuity.

393
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:25,040
San Narcisso had no boundaries,
no one knew yet how to draw them.

394
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:30,190
She had dedicated herself weeks ago to
making sense of what in virality had left

395
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,010
behind.

396
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,210
Never suspecting that
the legacy was America

397
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,270
and then I'm going to
skip down a little bit

398
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,220
so she could never again call back any
image of the dead man to dress up, pose,

399
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,020
talk to and make answer.

400
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,860
Neither would she lose a new
compassion for the CULDESAC.

401
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,980
He tried to find a way out of for
the enigma has efforts had created.

402
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,520
What we don't get here is
a sense of whether there
really is an alternate secret

403
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,040
postal system that serves a sort
of underground of private networks.

404
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,760
We don't ever get a sense of whether
these stamps and the signs that she sees

405
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:18,970
everywhere in San Francisco when she
travels through the city in the night,

406
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,630
whether these things
are a coherent meaning

407
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,573
or

408
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,730
whether they are her fabrication,

409
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:35,030
we don't really know and she never really
can say all she has is the sense that

410
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,790
there is this pattern.

411
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,950
Now there are two things that
she's left with in the passage.

412
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:48,951
I just read that sense of sooner so
being all of America and moreover of it

413
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:57,141
being constituted of storm systems of
group suffering and need to remember all

414
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:06,531
the little sub communities that she
interacts with have some sort of pain or a

415
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:10,140
loss associated with them.

416
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,190
The inner Morati anonymous for example,

417
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,620
people who don't want to love,
it's all comedy,

418
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,890
but then there is a heart,
a colonel,

419
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,920
and if we look on page one oh one one oh
two we can begin to see what that heart

420
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:29,820
or kernel is

421
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,730
that recuperates what I
would call the sentimental.

422
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,450
So this is when she's in San
Francisco looking around the city.

423
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,961
She's come,

424
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:53,880
they're hoping to escape the network of
symbols that she has seen all those post

425
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:58,881
warrens and instead she's immersed
with a new network of them.

426
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,003
Okay.

427
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,930
We're told just before
the morning rush hour,

428
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:08,430
she got out of a Jitney who's ancient
driver ended the day in the red ended each

429
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,810
day in the red downtown on Howard Street,
began to walk toward the Embarcadero.

430
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:13,921
She knew.

431
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:17,760
She looked terrible knuckles black with
eyeliner and Mascara from where she'd

432
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:22,761
rubbed mouth tasting of old booze and
coffee through an open doorway on the

433
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:26,760
steer leading up into the disinfectant
smelling twilight of a rooming house.

434
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,240
She saw an old man huddled,
shaking with grief.

435
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,330
She couldn't hear both hands smoke white
covered his face on the back of the

436
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:39,170
left hand. She made out the
post torn, tattooed and old ink.

437
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:42,080
Now beginning to blur
and spread fascinated.

438
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,490
She came into the shadows and ascended
creaking steps hesitating on each one.

439
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,200
When she was three steps from him,

440
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:52,640
the hands flew apart in his wrecked face
and the terror of eyes gloried in burst.

441
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,320
Veins stopped her. Can I
help? She was shaking tired.

442
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,280
My wife's in Fresno. He said he
wore an old double breasted suit.

443
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,260
Fred Gray shirt wide tie. No hat. I
left her so long ago. I don't remember.

444
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,250
This is for her.

445
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,080
He gave out a letter that looked like she
had been carrying around for years and

446
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:16,700
he tells her to drop it in the,
in the w a s t e lady.

447
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,230
Um, can waste. We're not
allowed to see waste. Remember?

448
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,120
Uh,
and then she is gripped with,

449
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,090
as she says,
uh,

450
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,100
overcome all at once by a need to touch
him as if she could not believe in him

451
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,570
or would not remember him.

452
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,720
And she reflects just above that on
the mattress that he must sleep in.

453
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:45,920
And this is one of those
great pension, uh, sentences.

454
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,330
This is a question,

455
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,630
but it comes in the declarative form
to what voices over heard Flinders of

456
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:58,190
luminescent God's glimpse to among
the wallpapers. Stained foliage,

457
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,400
candle stubs lit to rotate
in the air over him.

458
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:05,730
Prefiguring the cigarette he or a friend
must fall asleep someday. Smoking.

459
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,520
Thus to end among the flaming secrets
salts held all those years by the

460
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:15,050
insatiable stuffing of a mattress that
could keep vestiges of every nightmare.

461
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:18,530
Sweat,
helpless over flowing bladder viciously.

462
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:23,531
Tearfully Kunz consummated wet dream
like the memory bank to a computer of the

463
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,850
lost. It's assertive. Um,

464
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Aria of description and pension can
string those clauses together like no one

465
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:37,190
else. Uh, there are even longer examples
in the book and I'm sure you notice them

466
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,410
at our pod needs to
actually touch the man.

467
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:46,040
And when she finally sort
of takes him in her arms,

468
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:51,220
the position she assumes looks like that
of a mother with her broken sun and the

469
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:56,780
image is much more specifically
of Michelangelo's Pieta.

470
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:02,350
And remember the Lago DPA tough figures
prominently in the novel both as the

471
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,410
site of the,
um,

472
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,560
the route of Gis in Italy and the lake,

473
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,370
uh,

474
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:18,140
from which their bones are taken to
make charcoal filters for cigarettes.

475
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,980
So the PA ta the image of Mary with Jesus'
body broken from the cross on her lap

476
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,880
is repeated and here at a puck
comes to inhabit that position.

477
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,240
It's not a social role in the
that she could be granddaughter,

478
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:41,970
Lee or motherly.
On those other occasions,

479
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,190
it's a religious image.
It's also a,

480
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:48,390
a gendered religious image.

481
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,600
It's also an aesthetic image.

482
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,040
But here it's infused with her
compassionate approach to this man.

483
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,260
And remember in the passage that
I read about in varieties, estate,

484
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,230
what she sort of left with
as her final understanding.

485
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:13,310
She has a kind of compassion for peers
and the way that he had surrounded

486
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:19,611
himself with this network of holdings
that he had tried to escape from in some

487
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,194
way.

488
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,640
So if you cannot finally

489
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,140
have a pattern resolve into a
clarity of truth or meaning,

490
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,100
what you can do instead is in habit a
role where you will be in contact with the

491
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:46,170
very material of social life.

492
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,740
And that's what that mattress is totally
imbued with the bodily detritus of a

493
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:56,550
human life actually have many human lives.

494
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,620
She reflects later on the set of all
men who had slept on that mattress.

495
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,500
Okay?

496
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Pension wants to imagine a very
physical repository for the social

497
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,070
and especially for the human
aspect of dimensions of the social.

498
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,520
That's why Adam [inaudible] has all
these men stripped away from her.

499
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:28,080
Remember she says it as she's growing
more and more desperate at the end that

500
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,930
her men were being stripped
away from her one by one.

501
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,950
And so when she comes to
be isolated in this way,

502
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:39,840
she can finally see and
meditate upon in a new way.

503
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,740
All those systems of communication.

504
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:46,350
And she has that vision of the telephone
wires and she looks up at them as she's

505
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:50,630
just doubted all the possibilities for
making sense of the post torn in the true

506
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:55,350
Stero. She looks up at the telephone wires
and she thinks about all the messages

507
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,530
unintelligible full of human longing
going back and forth across those wires.

508
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,830
So if pension gives us,
uh,

509
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,810
the pattern of meaning rather
than meaning itself in this novel,

510
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,520
he also gives us a vision of what
it means to embody that pattern.

511
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,890
This is very different from Nabar coughs,

512
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:24,891
idea of embodiment as a kind of
alternate or rival creativity.

513
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:27,091
Remember,

514
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:32,091
I argued that Lolita has a dead child
and she dies in childbirth in a way

515
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,750
because it's a kind of creativity that
novakof wants to cancel or that Humbert

516
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:42,940
wants to cancel.

517
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,480
Okay.

518
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,810
In this novel, it's not
arrival. Creativity,

519
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,390
it's what creativity has to
be in the literary sense.

520
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,770
Now pension was a student of Nobach
offs for a couple of years at Cornell

521
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:03,070
university in the early sixties so he
took, he took courses with Nabokov.

522
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,060
I don't know how close they were.
Um,

523
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,570
but he certainly learned a
few things from to back off.

524
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,720
This is something he revises
from that old teacher.

525
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:22,610
He is imagining a literary form that
is soaked in the stuff of social life.

526
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:31,610
So if you only get a sniff of
the tear gas in Barth here,

527
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:33,990
you get a whole draft full of it.

528
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,410
And what I think he is rejecting,

529
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,470
if you look on page 95

530
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,410
oops,
that's not the one I want.

531
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,933
Okay.

532
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:50,951
Yes,

533
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:55,951
it is 95 if you look on page 95 here's
a different vision of what the artwork

534
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,770
could look like that I think we're meant
to put next to that vision of at a Po

535
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:04,360
with the suffering sailor.

536
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,850
Yeah.

537
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,680
This is when it first occurs to her
that the whole world is being organized

538
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:12,514
around her.

539
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,850
Nothing of the nights could touch her.
Nothing did.

540
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,590
The repetition of symbols was to
be enough without trauma as well,

541
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:26,880
perhaps to attenuate it or even jar
it altogether loose from her memory.

542
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,220
She was meant to remember.

543
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,470
She faced that possibility as she might
the toy street from a high balcony

544
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,120
roller coaster ride feeding time
among the beasts at the zoo in a zoo.

545
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,140
Any death wish that can be
consummated by some minimum gesture.

546
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:48,660
She touched the edge of its voluptuous
field knowing it would be lovely beyond

547
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:53,661
dreams simply to submit to it that not
gravity's pull laws of ballistics feral

548
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:59,010
ravening promised more delight.
She tested it. Shivering.

549
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,460
I meant to remember each clue that comes
is supposed to have its own clarity.

550
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,130
It's fine chances for permanence,

551
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,050
but then she wondered if the gem like
clues were only some kind of compensation

552
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:18,000
to make up for her.
Having lost the direct epileptic word,

553
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,330
the cry that might abolish the night.

554
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah.

555
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,480
This is a meditation on both the joy and
the loss of literary substitution for

556
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:33,200
the real or for the truth,

557
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,180
the substitution of abstract pattern for
something like comprehensible meaning.

558
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,200
So here she's kind of enthralled with
the idea that these gem like clues,

559
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:46,790
that's a very new Nabokovian moment.

560
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,820
The gem like clues that are gathering
around her would be a compensation for the

561
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,900
loss of that real access to revelation.

562
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,830
And this has this religious sense to it.

563
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:04,190
It's not just the religious instant
of looking down at San Narcisso,

564
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,310
it's the religious sense
of the capitalized word
that comes back a couple of

565
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:13,340
times towards the end of the novel,
the epileptic word,

566
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,950
the word capitalized always refers back
to the beginning of the gospel of John,

567
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:24,460
where John Describes Christ
as the word made flesh.

568
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,980
The word was with God
and the word was God.

569
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,060
And the word was made flesh
and came to dwell among us.

570
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,140
So pension is using that
religious vocabulary,

571
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:39,690
not just the religious
imagery of the PA ta,

572
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,230
but the religious vocabulary
of the capitalized word.

573
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:49,430
So you can have a kind of
system of symbols that's
gem like and pleasurable and

574
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:54,270
that calls you to submit to
it as it does here for at OPA.

575
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,210
But in the end there is something
more that her search will produce.

576
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:05,070
And that is the moment of compassion.
And I would submit to you that,

577
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,500
um, tears are just all over this novel.
I don't know if you noticed it, but,

578
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,150
um, there are many, many examples.
I'll just give you a few. Um,

579
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,290
first of all,

580
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,700
there the tears that accumulate in
her bubble shades when she's in Mexico

581
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,800
looking at the Remedios Varo painting of
the women in the tower embroidering the

582
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:28,020
long tapestries that become the world.

583
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:33,650
So that sense of isolation in the
tower makes her weep on one 17.

584
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,400
Can see another example.

585
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,953
Yeah.

586
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,550
Um, this is, uh, mucho
talking about the Muzak, um,

587
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,100
at up of the human voice. You
know, it's a flipping miracle.

588
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,670
His eyes brimming reflecting
the color of beer.

589
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,530
One 13.

590
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,993
Yeah,

591
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,080
this is doctor hilarious crying.
Tears Sprang to hilarious. His eyes,

592
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,950
you aren't going to shoot. He says, um,

593
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,990
one 46 in her moment of desperation
when she loses her connection to the MRI

594
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:19,830
motto and anonymous,
um,

595
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,780
or when she's about to talk to him,
she waited in explicable,

596
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:28,980
tears beginning to build up
pressure around her eyes.

597
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,780
Um, back on one. Oh,

598
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,710
this is the nurse, uh, who has just
escaped from doctor. Hilarious.

599
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,000
He thinks someone's after him.

600
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:44,940
Tear streaks had meandered down
over the nurses cheekbones.

601
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,100
It's not just that we could explain
any of these moments of tears.

602
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,330
It's that pension describes them,
all notes them all.

603
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,130
So this is a novel that's
full of people crying,

604
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,730
which is an odd thing to think about when
you think back to pensions reputation

605
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,550
as a metaphor actional novelist,

606
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:16,551
as someone preeminently preoccupied
with the formal aspects of fiction,

607
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,010
what you find when you actually open up
pensions novels is an incredibly rich

608
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:31,191
world of human detritus of
history in gravity's rainbow.

609
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,660
He did enormous amounts of
research in newspapers, um,

610
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:41,690
from the Second World War in London where
some of this is some of the novel is

611
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:47,271
set so that you can go to newspapers and
find the ads that he talks about in the

612
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,184
novels.

613
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,990
So he combines this very
attentive set of details,

614
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,140
which are not always and often are not
at all the aesthetic details with which

615
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:05,180
Novaka filled Lolita.

616
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:10,210
I remember when I asked you about the
specificity of America and on the road and

617
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:15,501
asked you to think about whether there
was anything there at all in on the road.

618
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:20,490
There isn't anything
in the back off there is,

619
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,840
but it's usually aesthetic how
things look. The look of a hotel,

620
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:29,370
the look of a field, the look of a
child, the look of a woman in pension.

621
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:35,090
Often these are somehow social details
about people talking to other people,

622
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,340
political things,
um,

623
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,060
places and how houses are arranged.

624
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,480
But there is a sense that
these are social worlds,

625
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:50,940
not just patterns,

626
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:56,030
even though at the beginning that's how
adipose sees them as she goes further

627
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,310
and further into her search for knowledge.

628
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:03,020
And finally her abandonment of
that search of knowledge. Um,

629
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,450
she sees more and more that
this is not just pattern,

630
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,860
that it's these storm systems
of suffering and need.

631
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:17,230
So I think this is what pension brings
to the string of meditations on what

632
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:22,440
language can do and what
the novel is for that.

633
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:25,770
I began my lecture today
with just recapping for you.

634
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
He's trying to imagine a novel that
meditates both on these structures of

635
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:36,160
meaning that imbue the real world,

636
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,300
such that there's no name that isn't
already saturated with associations

637
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,280
and that within such a world,

638
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,650
if you enter into it,

639
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,670
you can come to encounter the real and
the real is that sense of suffering and

640
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:03,220
that the novel can make you feel things,
both

641
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:08,500
the pleasure of humor or
the pleasure of beauty,

642
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,600
but also that sense of compassion.
And I don't know about you,

643
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,880
but I feel compassion for at OPA.

644
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,060
I feel like she's a real character.

645
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,840
I think she is a character that you can
if not identify with at least you can

646
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,120
understand and be interested in.

647
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,770
So pension offers us that and in our
next reading when we start with Toni

648
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,130
Morrison and also in Maxine Hong Kingston,

649
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,250
what you're going to
see is a kind of shift.

650
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,000
So all these meditations on language,

651
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,170
these different ways of thinking about
how language interacts with the real and

652
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:54,970
what you can do by messing with
language are almost, I would say,

653
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:56,410
taken as read,

654
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,220
taken as the starting point from which
a writer like Morrison or Kingston will

655
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:07,501
begin to rethink how those things can
be used in relation to the real world.

656
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:13,710
So that's where we'll start when we
think about Morrison next week. Um,

657
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,400
let me just also say there are a thousand
things to talk about in this novel.

658
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,940
So I hope you'll get to
some of them in section.

659
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,590
And if you want to write about this,

660
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:26,350
it's a very rich novel
for writing your papers.
