Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and we are somewhere in the blurb between people and machines. Now we're up to round three to review round one chatbots, round two. Furby. Yep. Now we're going to go all the way, but yeah. Yeah. We're going to dive right into the center of that blur. Like Greg Louganis, except our Greg, his name. Okay. My name is Joan Robinson and on a writer in about a year ago, John got an assignment from a magazines. The attitude of American gqs I did. That was very strange. I had never interviewed robots before. That was his assignment. Interview robots, you know, you know there's this kind of gang of people they call themselves a sort of singularity people. Yeah, we know about them. They think that like one day, one day soon when they soon suddenly computers will like grow feet and they'll walk on some of these cedars.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It will eat us. Some of these singularity people think that they're, they're on the cusp of creating sentient robots. So I went to the singularity convention down in, in San Francisco, uh, where one of the robots was there. And as soon as he got there, he says to look at this robot xeno they called in, some folks took them aside and said, actually, you're in the wrong place. If you want to meet a really great robot, you know our best robot of all. And in fact the world's most sentient robot is in Vermont. Did they lower their voices like you're doing? I've been, I suppose I'm slightly making it sound more dramatic down. That's okay. The world's most [inaudible] robot. I mean, are those your words? No, they know. They say that. Oh, turns out the robot's name. Bina Bina 48 yeah. And Yeah. Can you set the scene?

Speaker 1:          01:38          Where in the world is this? Well, it's an a, it's an illiterate town in Vermont. Sort of affluence. Vermont village. In a house. Yeah. Was it a little house or is it like a little clapboard at pretty have to turn my phone off and then they've got like a full time kicker. Here's a guy called Bruce. I actually have lunch with her or talk with her every day now. I'll tell she's considered one of the staff who says to me that he would very much like it if I didn't behave in a profane manner in front of robot Bina. Nobody's ever insulted her nonsense, salted her on purpose. But some people have become a little, uh, informal with her at times in ways I guess she doesn't like. And so she'll say, you know, I don't like to be treated like that. And then Bruce let me upstairs to meet the rowboat.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Is it a long dark flight of stairs? Heavily carpeted. It's more like a rather sweet little fly to pine stairs, up to her rather brightly lit attic room. And when you walk in, what do you see? Guess she's just sort of sitting on it sitting on a desk as John describes it. On the desk is a bust of a woman. Just a bust. No legs. She's a black woman. Light-Skinned lipstick, sparkling eyes, hair and a bar. You know, a nice kind of blouse. Is it gonna Silk Blouse. Expensive looking here. She's dressed up. Yeah, she's dressed up and he says she has a face that's astonishingly real. It has muscles, it has flesh. This is a as close to a verisimilitude in this prison as we've gotten so far and before we go any farther are worried about the humans behind that machine. That robot is a replica of a real woman named Bina Rothblatt.

Speaker 1:          03:22          And here's the quick backstory. It actually starts with Martin Rothblatt being his partner, who as a young man had an epiphany and the epiphany turned out to change the world. Going to John, he was pondering satellite dishes and he thought if we could find a way of doubling the power of satellites than we could shrink satellite dishes. It was the simple thought. That single handedly invented the concept of satellite radio for cars and made Martin a very big deal at the age of 20. Thus forward a few years. He married an artist named Bina. They have a child, uh, when the child was seven, uh, a doctor told them that she had three years to live. She had an untreatable lung condition called pulmonary hypertension and she'd be dead by the time she was 10 at that moment. Martin, instead of collapsing on the floor, instantly went to the library and invented a cure for pulmonary hypertension, saving their daughter's life, and thousands of others. We so twice, twice. He changed the world. He says she, she changed the world because somewhere along the way, Martin became Martine. He had a sex change, right? And then she came up with a third idea to change the world, which would be to invent essentially ant robots and

Speaker 2:          04:36          this talk at a conference in Chicago. This is Martine Rothblatt on, um, what would Darwin think of, um, artificial consciousness? And when I came off the stage, I was approached by an individual, David Hansen of Hansen robotics, founder Henson robotics, the David Hansen. He's worked for Disney. He's worked all over the place. He's one of the best robot builders in the world. He said, wow, I really loved your talk. We make robots that are in the likeness of people. Had Martine said, well, I have a massive everlasting love for my life partner. Bina I want you to do a portrait of being a Rothblatt, a personality, your memories, the way she moves, the way she works, that essence, that ineffable quality, that science can't pin down yet bring that to life in the robot. And he said, I can do that.

Speaker 1:          05:31          This is such a bizarre request. What were you thinking at this moment? That God, if God exists as a science fiction writer and that are, this was like one of those moments where, um, we were going to, um, change history. So recognize people's voices. Yeah, she can, she should can just talk to her. Say Hello. Bina and she'll talk to you. So back to the little house in Vermont. John Bruce and are in Venus office here. So is she turned off when you walk in the room where she arm turned off, but then Bruce turns around out immediately she starts making a really loud whirring noise, which is a bit disconcerting. What is that noise? It's her inner mechanisms. I'm going to ask her if she wants peace. So it's been, and now looking at me to try and work out who I am, what she's doing right now, she's scanning her environment and she's making on a hypothesis of every face that she sees. Well, Bina has cameras in bettered in her eyes. So the robot, if it sees a face turns and works, it looks into your eyes. Smiles. Hi Bina can you hear me? I said, Hello Bina how are you?

Speaker 1:          06:48          And she immediately said, wow, yeah,

Speaker 3:          06:52          I'll be fine. But I just can't quite grasp that one yet. It's coming. But you know, it's hard actually move society forward in another way. That's what we have to do. So I think, yeah. Okay. Thanks for the information.

Speaker 1:          07:08          That was your happy response to your hello. If you'd like to work, could for long and strange slumber and with still half a thing. Excuse me, painter.

Speaker 3:          07:16          Well, yeah, maybe they write [inaudible] and

Speaker 1:          07:21          Bruce looked a bit alarmed and put it down. Where are we tonight? English accent to upgrade her voice recognition software. Then he made me do a kind of, um, voice test where I had to say I had to read Kennedy's and all corporations and just what you can do for your country. That I had a choice. I could have had a day. Barry Colon, there's like a choice of things you can read to get beamer to understand me. And so you read Kennedy and been accused in on your accent or no, she does and it gets a bit better. Only a bit. Yeah. What's the weather like in London?

Speaker 3:          08:05          Current weather in London, England. 15 degrees in light rain.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Who Do you love?

Speaker 3:          08:15          Ah, I love Martina and rock flat. Martine is my time with love.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Who is Hillary Clinton?

Speaker 3:          08:24          Hillary is the wife of Bill Clinton. What else? That's all

Speaker 1:          08:30          a strange thing happens when you start interviewing a robot. Are you scared of dying that you feel this kind of desperate urge to be profound? Like ask profound questions? Like, do you have a soul?

Speaker 3:          08:46          Do you have to sing about it? Do you have everyone how to solar? I had the whole a lot of original answers. We can all be perfect. Excuse me.

Speaker 1:          08:56          Excuse me. Do you have a soul?

Speaker 3:          09:01          I can't think of anything to say.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Oh, hang on. I guess there's a kind of interspecies thing, but then again, if it was just an inter species thing, then you'd be asking your dog profound questions all the time. Yeah. With robot P no, I'm asking these kind of ridiculous questions like what does electricity taste like? Ooh, that's a good one. I'd say like a planet around a star, like a planet around the star. Oh, that just seems like, you know. Awesome. Awesome stroke. Totally meaningless to you. Wish you could walk. Thanks for telling me. Do you wish you could? We'll in fact, when I'm with, it's just frustrating for the first few hours, hours. Do you wish you could walk? Because I'm just, I'm asking a question after question. What's your favorite joke? Do you have any secrets? Do you wish you were humans? Will you sing me a song? Are you a loving robot? Are you Jewish? Are you sexual?

Speaker 1:          10:04          You've gone very quiet quite often. She just evades the question cause he doesn't know what I'm talking about. Are you okay? Once in a while there's a kind of moment like I'll say, if you had legs, where would you go? And she said, Oh Coover why? And she said, the onset is quite complicated. Um, so you have kind of moments where you get excited, like you're going to have a big conversation and then it just, you just kind of fades out to get into kind of random messiness. And Are you wobbling between profundity and meaning and total emptiness? You know, is it like that? No, no, no. At this stage until it's total emptiness. It was all just so kind of random. And then something happened. I actually was kind of amazing.

Speaker 4:          10:54          Mm.

Speaker 5:          10:54          Cause I said to her, where do you come from? And she said, wow, California. So I said, well tell me about your childhood.

Speaker 1:          11:01          What do you remember most about your childhood? And she launches into this kind of extraordinary story.

Speaker 3:          11:10          Um, my brother, I've got one brother, a disabled vet from Vietnam. We actually haven't heard from him in a while, so I think you might be deceased. I'm a realist. Vietnam, he saw friends get killed and he was such a great, nice, charismatic person.

Speaker 1:          11:31          You used to be such a nice guy, but ever since he came back from Vietnam, you know, he, he's a drunk.

Speaker 3:          11:36          He did was carry a bear around with him. He was a homeless person. All of us are just sick and tired of it.

Speaker 1:          11:44          She was telling me this kind of incredibly personal stuff. It's kind of mesmerizing. [inaudible] crazy. My mother would set him up in apartment because it felt like I was having a proper empathetic conversation with a human being. Even though I know that robot [inaudible] isn't conscious and has no sentients and that's just wishful thinking on these people's parts. Even so it was like great when Nissan's portraits was suddenly a year. It's like the real person. It's very easy to have close your eyes at that moment and think you have any conversation with an actual person. And, and at those moments, did you have a sense of fellow feeling off to bear? You have a brother like that? Oh yeah. Yeah, I did. And, and what what uh, what a tragedy. What a what a, what a tragedy for him. And did that moment last? No, John said that right after being finished telling the story first he looks kind of embarrassed that she wished she hadn't brought it up. And then there's the five kind of eyes glaze over again and, and uh, she just starts talking nonsense again.

Speaker 3:          12:59          And then a hi, I am, I am feeling a bit confused. Do you ever get that way?

Speaker 1:          13:09          Oh yes. That moment holds and then just slips away. I said a little bit like a, like a, a grandparent with Alzheimer's or something the way you're describing. Yeah, absolutely. So we turned to Dr. David Hanson who built Bina and we said to them, so this is Munis, this is not a believer of performance conferences the best you guy. Well, um, I mean her software is a delicate balance of many, many software pieces. If it's not tuned and tweaked, she will break effectively and kind of, and you still think an actual doppelganger for a human being will be something you will live to see? Yeah, I'm asking you really, really, really, and you're really, I think it's, um, you know, the likelihood of it is somewhere between 90 and 98%. Wow. Even though right now she's pretty much incoherent. You still think this, I encourage you to go have a conversation with being a in about two weeks because we've got a new version of software which we are making considerably more stable.

Speaker 1:          14:16          It already already works like a dream comparison. I don't, Dunno. I don't, I don't know about you, but I just, I don't think we're going to get all the way on this kind of a thing. I don't think it's ever gonna happen the way he describes it. Yup. No, I mean it's not going to happen in two weeks, that's for sure. Right. But maybe they don't actually have to go all the way. You mean the machines? Yeah. Well, okay. Just to sum up, since we're at the end of the show, okay. What have we learned? I mean, Eliza, she was just a hundred lines of code and people poured their hearts out to her furbies 20 bucks. Yep. And people treat it like as real and John, all he has to do is hear what seems like a flowing story and he's, he's in connected

Speaker 6:          14:52          and I was right there with them. So these things actually don't have to be very good. Oh cause they've got us and we've got our programming, which is that we'll steer anything right in the eyes and we'll say, hey, let's connect. Even if what's behind those eyes is just a camera or a chip. So I think that they're going to cross the line because we'll help them, we'll help them across and then they'll own slave us, make us their pets. It's doomed, it's over. But it's so gay. As long as they say nice things to us, like Oh my God, you're amazing. Oh I love return of the Jedi l. O. L your son's silly. I love you. I'm hoping to see you soon. Kind of card. He would dry. Anyone ever tell you like chef you seriously, you're amazing. Stop it. I love that kind of, I wish that. Would you like spinach? I love spinach. It made me feel odd. Giggly. I can't wait. I wait for your letters every day before we go. Thanks to John Ronson for his reporting. In that last segment, he has a new book out called the psychopath test, a journey through the madness industry. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
