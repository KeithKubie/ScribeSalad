00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Did you know that astronauts in space

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.200
have a hard time communicating without words

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.100
because their weightless bodily fluids make

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
their faces all puffy and hard to read?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.000
Have you heard that Botox can actually

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
improve your mood, and not by smoothing wrinkles but 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.500
actually by easing depression?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.600
Or that this "come here" gesture is

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.200
common in the US but is considered so rude in the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.500
Philippines that it could actually get you arrested.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Yeah. All true!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Emotions and the ways we express them

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.500
are strange and powerful things.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
And emotions aren't just ephemeral psychological 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
phenomena, they affect our bodies and our health.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Because so many emotions have a certain

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500
contagious quality, our feelings and the behaviors

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500
they drive also affect the minds, and bodies,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
and health of those around us.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.500
This is true whether your emotions of the moment

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.171
are of the feel-good variety.

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:43.500
Or not.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.400
The powers of both positivity and negativity are

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:47.000
stronger than you may know.

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:48.500
Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.500
than their mean and grumpy neighbors.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
and how we handle them are pretty closely

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
related to this thing called stress.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.500
And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.000
in any number of ways, given the right opportunity.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
swirling around like leaves on the winds of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
these feelings, we first have to understand them. 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.300
[Intro]

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.000
What do you think this person is feeling? 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
How about him?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.800
And her?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.500
What about this one?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.000
It's not really hard to tell, is it?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.500
Most of us are better than we think at

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
reading non-verbal cues and subtle expressions.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500
The understanding among some, but not all, 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500
is that facial expressions are culturally universal.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
would all be able to discern the same basic emotions;

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.500
happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500
just by looking at your face.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
And our expressions don't just communicate emotions.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
According to the Facial Feedback Hypothesis,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000
they can help regulate our emotions, too.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320
The act of smiling broadly, even if you aren't happy,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.500
can actually lift your mood just as scowling can lower it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
This is how, bizarrely enough, a recent randomized 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
injection in the forehead might actually lessen

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.800
depression.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500
'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.000
frowny muscles are frozen.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.500
people are better at reading your emotions than others.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
For example, introverts are usually better at interpreting

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.500
people's feelings, while extroverts are often better at

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500
expressing them.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
And you've probably heard embarrassing stories or even

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.000
experienced first-hand how different cultures express 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.500
emotions through particular gestures that are far from universal.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.000
For example, in the United States, this is a peace sign,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but you don't want to flip it around in the UK.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.500
And the iconic thumbs up gesture means "good job" in

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.000
friends.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.695
But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:54.695
and hand gestures, they're also about our

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.500
conscious experience of what we're feeling.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.000
So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
many different emotions are there?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.500
identified ten distinct basic human emotions present

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.000
from infancy on. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They are: joy, surprise, sadness,  anger, disgust, 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Others have since suggested that "pride" should be

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500
added to that list, and still others believe that love should 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.000
be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
argued that these and other emotions are just familiar

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
combinations of the classic ten.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Today, some psychologists describe our emotional 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.400
experience as using a 2-dimensional model.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.500
The idea there is that any of the emotions you might feel

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500
while, like, reading Harry Potter or something are 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.500
expressed on a spectrum, and as a combination of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500
valence, roughly speaking "good" or "bad", and 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.500
arousal--excited or not excited, basically.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.000
So if you're feeling both really excited and super 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.500
positive when Harry finally bested Voldemort, 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
you could say you were elated. On the other hand,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
if you're at that part in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.000
and Hermoine are just sort of wandering around on the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.500
lam in a heavy mood, maybe your emotions fell more on

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
the opposite side of the spectrum.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In this instance, feeling depressed might be a 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.500
So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.000
2-dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.500
more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.500
enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.000
being mad. These polarities--positive versus negative, 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
high arousal versus low arousal--affect our psychological 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
remember that what is psychological is ultimately 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.500
depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.800
with health and well-being. The good news is that if

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.000
we're angry or sad, we often over-estimate the duration

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.500
of our bad moods and under-estimate our capacity

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500
to adapt and bounce back from traumas, 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500
even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.200
in the thick of it.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.000
And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy, 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
stress can slowly build and simmer, or it can

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
strike suddenly and with great intensity.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And yeah, stress, certainly the chronic or extreme type

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.500
can be bad for your health, but defining stress

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.000
is trickier than you might think.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.500
Psychologists would define stress as the process by

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.500
which we perceive and respond to certain events, or

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500
stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.500
In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.000
more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.500
about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.000
strange thump in the house. These external stressors

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.500
unpredictable large scale events like war, natural

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.000
things like moving, having a child,  losing or getting a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
late, or feuding with your roommates.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.500
Any of these stressful events, big or small, even the 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
good things, can fire up your sympathetic nervous

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.000
system and trigger that old fight or flight response.

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:03.048
In this way, it's important to understand that stress

00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:06.000
is ultimately natural. You experience it for a reason

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.500
and a bit of short-lived stress can actually be a good

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.000
thing. It can make you active and alert when you need to 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.500
be, like an upcoming chemistry test might be stressing

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.000
you out, but that might help you find focus so you can

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.400
dominate that thing. And in your body, moderate stress

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.500
can kick the immune system into action to do things

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.300
like heal wounds, and fight infections. It does this by

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.500
triggering the release of stress hormones like

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.000
adrenaline and cortisol. These chemical messengers 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
are what get your organ systems to respond the way

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you need them to when you're getting charged by a

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.500
can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.000
that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.500
and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.000
PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
negative connections between your body's systems

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.500
have to do with the fact that many of its most basic

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.000
functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.500
temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.000
regulated by the autonomic nervous system.

00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:08.000
We've talked before about how the sympathetic side

00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:11.000
of that system cranks you up, and the parasympathetic

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
arm calms you down, but both those systems also

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.500
interact with the so-called "brain-in-the-gut", the enteric

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.000
nervous system, which helps regulate gastrointestional

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
functioning. And it's this brain-gut connection that

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
explains how stress causes digestive problems,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.500
because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.500
and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500
wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.000
muscles so that you can react quickly.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Which is good, right?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
or decreasing the amount of digestive secretions

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and making your colon spasm; an anxious mind can

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
lead to an anxious gut. Stress is an even bigger risk

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
factor in North America's leading cause of death:

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
heart disease, because it contributes to increased blood

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.500
pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels in a number

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.000
of different ways. Essentially, when your stressed out

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
other organs. And one of those organs is the liver,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.500
whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500
from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.000
can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol 

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.500
ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500
around the heart.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.000
Don't believe me?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.500
One study monitored the blood cholesterol and clotting

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.000
speed of 40 male tax accountants throughout the year,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and it found that their cholesterol and clotting rates, and

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.500
thus risk of heart attacks, increased dramatically during

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.580
the weeks before tax day as they stressed out about

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.500
finishing their work.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.500
And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.000
some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.500
effects on the body, are pessimism and depression, 

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.000
which also have been linked to stress and heart

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
disease. Many types of studies have found that people

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
positive feelings often live significantly longer than their

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
states influence health, but it may be some combination

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.500
health, or not taking your heart meds when you're

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.000
feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
system in response to stress and sadness. 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So in the end, while stress may not directly cause 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
disease, you could say that the two walk hand-in-hand.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.500
In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.000
can kill, so go ahead

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.500
take a deep breath, 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.500
feel your emotions,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.000
appreciate them,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.500
but don't let them run your life.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Today, we talked more about how our emotions work

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.500
and how we use facial expressions to help us

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.000
communicate. We also looked at the 2-dimensional

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
model of emotional experience and how anger, 

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
happiness, and depression can affect our health. 

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
We also discussed what stress does to your nervous

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
system and how chronic stress can damage the

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.500
functioning of your biological systems.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.000
