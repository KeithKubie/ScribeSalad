00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:09.502
We live in an age of protest.

00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:11.210
On campuses and public squares,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.807
on streets and social media,

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:17.028
protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo.

00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:21.060
Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.621
it can force out tyrants,

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.846
it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life.

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.787
While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient?

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:33.375
Consider the Arab Spring.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.241
All across the Middle East,

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.524
citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators.

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.098
Afterwards, though,

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:45.685
the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:48.244
Protest can generate 
lasting positive change

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:50.929
when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.592
to mobilize voters,

00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:53.481
to cast ballots,

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.188
to understand government,

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:58.555
and to make it more inclusive.

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:02.877
So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action

00:01:02.877 --> 00:01:06.960
and protest into durable political power.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.717
First, expand the frame of the possible,

00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:12.314
second, choose a defining fight,

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:16.592
and third, find an early win.

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:19.878
Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible.

00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:22.776
How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea,

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:25.530
"That's just never going to happen"?

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.180
When you hear someone say that,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.504
they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination.

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:35.024
The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward,

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:36.712
to ask what if -

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:38.274
what if it were possible?

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:39.933
What if enough forms of power -

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.341
people power, ideas, money, social norms -

00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:46.401
were aligned to make it happen?

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.154
Simply asking that question

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:51.960
and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.279
is the first step in converting
protest to power.

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:59.872
But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say,

00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:02.775
a radically smaller national government,

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:07.209
or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system,

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.307
a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds,

00:02:10.307 --> 00:02:15.311
or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations.

00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:20.245
This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.928
All politics is about contrasts.

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:25.597
Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract.

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:30.492
We think about things in relief
compared to something else.

00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:33.871
Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast.

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:35.992
This doesn't mean being uncivil.

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:40.460
It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.711
over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want.

00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:49.870
This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.963
They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality,

00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:56.586
but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal,

00:02:56.586 --> 00:03:00.281
which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond,

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:05.755
they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity.

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:08.936
They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one,

00:03:08.936 --> 00:03:13.807
and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two.

00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:18.024
The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win.

00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:22.063
An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal,

00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:23.465
creates momentum,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.210
which changes 
what people think is possible.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.781
The solidarity movement,

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:32.658
which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way,

00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:37.210
first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.846
then, over the next decade,

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:41.491
a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple

00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:44.460
Poland's communist government.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.718
Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop,

00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:51.369
a contagion, a belief, a motivation.

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.899
It requires pressuring policymakers,

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.654
using the media to change narrative,

00:03:56.654 --> 00:03:58.214
making arguments in public,

00:03:58.214 --> 00:04:02.459
persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.881
None of this is as sexy as a protest,

00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:07.964
but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement,

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:09.783
of Indian Independence,

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:12.308
of Czech self-determination.

00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:14.250
Not the single sudden triumph,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.568
but the long, slow slog.

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:21.057
You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind,

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:23.021
to expand the frame of the possible,

00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.254
to pick a defining fight,

00:04:25.254 --> 00:04:27.776
or to secure an early win.

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:31.933
You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen.

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:34.209
The spirit of protest is powerful.

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:37.224
So is showing up after the protest.

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:40.211
You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.
