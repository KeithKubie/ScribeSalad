00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's take a look at the forces acting on this car. Well, we know there's the normal force.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And we know there's gravity but we don't want to write that as a downwards arrow.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But rather as a perpendicular arrow and a parallel one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And in the last video, we showed that the parallel force is equal to

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the weight of the car in mg times the sin of α.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now the steepest angle hill, well that occurs when friction force is totally maxed out.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When it is at exactly its maximum value, which is 80% of the car's weight

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or put in another way Ff = 0.8 mg.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well in this situation where the car is just barely holding on, we know the friction force

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is balancing the parallel force so we can set these two equal to each other.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Notice something amazing that happens. The m's and g's, the whole weight cancels out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This doesn't depend at all on the mass of your vehicle. Amazing!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well now, I have to take the inverse sine of 0.8 to solve for the sin of α.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But still, I take this inverse sine of 0.8 and I get an answer of 53°.

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'm very impress if you're able to get this on your first try or even your second or third.
