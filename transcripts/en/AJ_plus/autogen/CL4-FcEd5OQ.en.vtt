00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.091
Luzwin Madrid has traveled thousands of miles from Honduras

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.552
escaping poverty and violence.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.556
She's spent most of the 7-week journey 

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.891
walking with her 4-year-old daughter

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.727
and 15-year-old sister.  

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.566
Her dream is to reach the U.S. to provide a better life for her family. 

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:29.362
But now, she is one of thousands of migrants and refugees

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.072
stuck here in Tijuana,

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.701
camping just a few feet away from the fence that 

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.704
divides Mexico and the United States. 

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:14.282
Luzwin's brother was a 21-year-old cadet when he was hit and killed by a car.

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:19.537
Luzwin told us that the driver had previously threatened her brother for being in the military

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.498
and supporting the government.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:26.211
She also says that anti-government groups have threatened her mother.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:30.673
While on the road, Luzwin calls home a few times a week

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.009
to check on her family.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:02:00.120
Luzwin sleeps in a tent on what is left of the Benito Juarez migrant camp.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.997
After heavy rains flooded the area

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:07.001
Mexican authorities relocated most of its occupants.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:11.089
But like many others, Luzwin has decided to stay. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.427
Despite the harsher conditions, here she feels closer to the border, 

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.639
to lawyers, to local organizations, 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.474
and closer to her goal: 

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:24.227
getting asylum in the U.S. 

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:29.691
She and thousands like her are waiting for their turn to be processed at the port of entry.

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:34.237
But the U.S. government only accepts a few dozen a day.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:25.246
The city of Tijuana is cutting support in an attempt to shut down the camp. 

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:31.085
Volunteers are not allowed to distribute clothes or food to the migrants inside the camp.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:36.633
They must do it from the outside or find creative ways to sneak in supplies.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.971
This is an improvised kitchen at a local shop.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.891
Luzwin's sister, Elda, helps with the meals.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.800
It rains again. Temperatures drop to the 30s at night.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:24.973
Having a cold, fever and a cough is becoming the new norm in this part of Tijuana.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.768
Luzwin's priority is to stay healthy and warm.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.252
But not everyone manages to stay dry.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:17.710
After a cold night, Luzwin gets ready to head to the Mexican immigration headquarters 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.129
to apply for a temporary work permit.

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:51.846
After the death of her brother and threats against her family,

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:56.017
Luzwin weighed her options and decided to embark on this journey. 

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.770
Her dream is not only to get there,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.566
but also to reunite with her daughters in the U.S.
