Because the number e is so common in nature, such as with population growth and

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:10.340
decay for example. Log base e, as I mentioned earlier, gets a special notation.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.520
Instead of writing log base e of x, we would write this. This is called the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.480
natural log of x. Thinking about this definition of natural log or ln, what is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.489
its inverse?
