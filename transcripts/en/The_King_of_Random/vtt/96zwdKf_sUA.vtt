Hey Guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.200
Not long ago we had a video where we showed you how to make your own tornado tube using a couple of 2-liter soda bottles.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.059
My favorite part of that video was the look of when we had the wirling glow-in-the-dark water next to a blacklight.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
I thought that the glowing swirls really resembled the look of the Northern Lights,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.700
But in that vortex all of it drained out and stopped working very quickly.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.560
So the purpose of today's video is to see if we can build a lamp

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.480
that gives us that continuous glowing swirl, that I think looks like the Northern Lights.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.829
Here are the supplies that we're gonna be using for this build:

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.400
I have a clear plastic jar with a lid that screws on water tight,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.300
A simple backlight keychain,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.300
A low-volume submersible water pump,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.540
Some extra wire,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.080
Some heat shrink,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.800
A couple of on-off switches,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.600
The top of a bendy straw,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.900
And some glow in the dark paint.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.200
To help with the build I also have soldering iron equipment, some wire strippers and a heat gun.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.820
I've also got a glue gun for attaching some small pieces together and making sure everything is watertight.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.600
As a first step let's drill a small hole in the bottom of the container where the cord to the pump will come out of our hole lamp

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.100
*drilling noises*

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.780
Now we need to cut off the cord so we can fit it through the hole.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.119
Now with our cord split we need to run one end through the hole in the bottom of our container.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.310
In a video where I showed how to build a desktop vortex fountain some people pointed out that my cord-

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.410
splicing technique was pretty poor so I've tried to upgrade that and improve it so it's a little more safe.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.440
So instead of just twisting the ends of this cord together, I'm going to twist them then solder them then heat shrink them together.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.600
There we go; those pieces are now nicely soldered together.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.360
Slip our heat shrink over the soldered parts,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.900
Now just to keep the two wires from coming apart, I am going to wrap a little bit of electrical tape around the joint

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.980
Now some of you may be wondering why I didn't add a switch in since I already had the cord spliced,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.600
Well I am planning to add an on/off switch,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.889
But it isn't the type of switch that requires a cord to be cut like that.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.740
So I had to cut it just to fit it through the edge of the jar

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.549
But now I need to add the switch in a little bit farther up the cord.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.020
So here's how this type of switch works with our wires;

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.649
We'll take our electric cord and split it down the middle a little bit,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.940
We won't cut it across, so we'll still be intact . While we're splitting our cord

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.820
We want to make sure that we don't cut into any of the wire itself, just through the plastic housings.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.279
Now let's clip in the middle, and just to make sure that it will fit and line up nicely without the wire ever touching;

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.040
Let's clip off just about eighth of an inch.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.199
So that we now have a gap even if we lined it back up

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.560
One side of our wire goes around to the side, and the other side has a split in the middle at the plastic partition.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.649
Now we should be able to take the other side of our switch, fit it back on and have those spikes

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780
stab down into our split wire

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.600
And just like that we've installed a switch in the middle of the cord.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.959
With the cord cut pass through the wall of the plastic container spliced together and with the switch added in the middle of the line

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.500
Now let's attach our pump to the bottom of our plastic container permanently.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.889
We want to make sure we have our pump lined up where we know we want it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.570
We'll gently pull it out

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.079
And then let's add some hot glue to the bottom both on the suction cups and on the main body itself. After that's applied

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.510
We'll lower it back down into place and hold it firmly there until the glue has begun to cool

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.340
With the pump where we want it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.600
We can pull the cord back out so it's as tight as it can get and then seal up the hole around the cord using more hot glue.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.669
With the pump in place let's take the cut section of our bendy straw and fit it down into the nozzle in our pump

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.319
Now I've got the straw pointed back in the same direction that the cord is going

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.140
That's because we're going to be adding a small light

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.860
Into the side of the container and we want the flow of the straw to be aimed

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.990
Almost directly at that light this way

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.200
We can keep the light and the wires coming out of it pointed in the same direction as our power cord.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.100
Now this little backlight keychain is an extremely simple mechanism. It does have a small switch

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.259
you can turn or it can be activated just by squeezing it. on the inside of this one of the wires coming out of the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.090
Light bulb is being held up at an angle

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.169
So it's not making contact with the power source which is a couple of button cell batteries

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.189
We want to remove the light bulb, but still use the casing and the power source

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.380
Because of that we have to add in our own switch somewhere else in the line

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.600
We're going to remove the small LED light bulb and that will end up being installed in the side of the plastic container up here.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.700
We'll then use some extra wire to connect the power source to the light bulb through the switch

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.049
And see we've got our button cell batteries

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.840
It says three volts which means that the two of them together is giving us six volts to power our LED

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.710
Let's take a length of four or five inches from our red and black wire and cut that off

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.900
Separate the wire

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.220
These are wire strippers and take off just a small bit at the end of our wire less than half an inch about one centimeter

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.939
Now we want to fit this wire back into the casing one on top of the batteries and one on the bottom of the batteries

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.140
There you go, I think we've got the wires in contact with the battery so now let's put the screws back in place

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.990
We also aren't going to need these keyring pieces, so let's get rid of those

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.609
Let's actually split this wire all the way down, so we've got two separate wires coming out of our battery pack

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.279
Let's pull off the ends of these wires and see if touching the ends of our LED will get it to light up

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.350
And go

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.350
We have light

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.130
Just what we want to see

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.840
Now before we start

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.979
Permanently attaching wires together we need to get some good measurements

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.780
So let's drill a hole in the side of our container where we can attach our LED light bulb.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.900
There we go now let's use a drill bit the same size as the body of our LED and drill a small hole through the side of our  plastic container

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.780
Our LED now fits very smoothly into the side of our plastic container

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.989
Which is just what we want so now we can have one wire

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.070
Go straight from our battery pack up to the bulb and the other wire

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.149
We'll take a small detour through our switch before it goes to the bulb as well

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.100
(finally a break for the subtitlers thank god)

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.350
Those Solders and heat-shrink should do a pretty good job of making sure that our bulb is well attached to the wires and that it's

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.829
Not in any danger of shorting from any wires touching each other however

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.170
It just to be sure because is going to be near liquid

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.420
Let's use a little bit of hot glue and make sure that the leads on the back of the LED are completely covered

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.760
And we have it. I think every bit of exposed metal is now covered with our hot glue

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.160
at this point we just need to connect the other end of the on/off switch to the other end of the battery pack and we

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.730
Should have a complete circuit

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.200
Before I solder these together just holding it together as soon as I turn the switch

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.699
Perfect that's exactly what we want to see. on. off.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.400
There we go at this point we have our complete circuit our switch is working our light bulb is working everything is working

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.149
Perfectly just what we want to see now the light bulb will go right here

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.329
Battery pack will go right here and our wires

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:41.859
Will all run together like this, so I just want to tape these all together so we have one consistent cord

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:56.399
One more step to make this nice and permanently attached is to use some hot glue to go all the way around this light bulb

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:59.339
So no water or liquid can leak out of that gap

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.000
(note to self: never subtitle long videos again.)

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.919
At this point I think we've got all the electronics sucked up, so it's time to make our glow in the dark fluid and fill

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.990
Our lamp we don't want to necessarily mix up our glow in the dark fluid inside the lamp container itself

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.220
I'll show you why in a minute

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.779
So we're going to be using a separate larger container to mix it up in and then we'll transfer it once

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:25.319
We're ready to make sure we have the right amount but not too much

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:30.779
Let's fill our container all the way up pour it into this container and then add a little bit more to the pitcher

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.690
This is also gonna work as a test to see how well our two holes filled with hot glue are doing so far

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.740
perfect

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.250
It's all the way to the very very top

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.200
Now let's pour that into our pictcher

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.489
And now let's add mmm, maybe another cup or so

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.929
It's not very important. We want to make sure we have enough

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.590
But not so much that we're going to end up with a ton of extra liquid in the pitcher

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.020
Now we want to take our bottle of glow-in-the-dark acrylic paint and pour about half of it into this water now

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.010
Let's stir that up until it's all dissolved into the water

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.900
At this point if we use our

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:25.289
Blacklight and hold up against the water turned on we should be able to see it picking up the glow from the paint

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.229
There you go. It's pretty faint right there, but I'm in a well-lit studio, so it's not gonna show up, too

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.510
well
But you can still see it swirling away

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.739
to increase the contrast between the glowing portion of our liquid and the non glowing portion

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:44.039
Let's also add several drops of blue food coloring this will darken the liquid overall but it will still shine brightly when it's glowing

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.410
We're not trying to make squid ink here

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.540
We're just going for a little bit darker of a shade

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.280
There we go we have our glow in the dark liquid and we now want to transfer it back into the smaller container

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.929
but we are going to go back to the sink to do that because we're going to fill it so much that it's on the

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.940
Brink of overflowing now, let's start adding the liquid and as I said we're going to fill it up to the very very top

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.430
It'll be so full that when we put the lid on the jar that should actually cause more of the liquid to spill out over

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.700
the container

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.700
here goes

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.800
Combination of the glow in that art paint and

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.580
The blue food coloring you can't even really see any of the internal components the pump is now invisible

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.890
Fill and let it overflow even a little bit to try and get rid of some of those bubbles

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:31.170
There we go now as I'm filling

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.080
It's just running down the sides of the container, which means it is very full

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.609
Which is just how we want it so now while it's still overflowing like that

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.640
let's carefully put our lid on and screw it down tight as

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.409
You can see as I'm screwing it on. It's actually squishing some extra liquid out

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.530
perfect

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:56.539
There we go nice and tight and by doing that we minimize the amount of bubbles that show up

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.160
There's still a couple of them, but for the most part

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.459
They'll just be hidden up inside the cap and we'll never see any of the bubbling

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.560
We have our glow-in-the-dark liquid our pump and our blacklight in the jar so at this point

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.459
We should be able to plug it in turn on those switches and have a swirling glowing liquid

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.170
All right

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.790
light on

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.790
pump on

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.859
I think we're getting a good effect now. We are still in a very well lit Studios

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.080
So you can't see almost anything of this, but let's turn out the lights and see how this is looking

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.029
So while we are trying to get some shots of this aurora borealis lamp?

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.350
We're having a hard time picking up some of the contrast that we can see with the naked. Eye

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.320
It looked best on camera right where the pump was

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.770
Pointing all of the glow in that arc liquid right at the LED light bulb

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.210
But the LED light itself gave off so much light that was pretty distracting

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.789
so to add to the decor effect what I did was take some opaque black tape and

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.010
Cut it in the profile of a mountain range

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:06.109
So now it looks like we're kind of seeing a moon rising behind a mountain with some Northern Lights flowing around the sky as well

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.659
I'm actually really happy with the look

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.779
So there you have it. I think we have fairly successfully built a Northern Lights lamp. It looks pretty cool

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.470
There's a lot of good swirling motion going along and that's what I really wanted

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.790
I really wish that our camera could capture. How it shows up to the naked

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:29.420
Eye, because the contrast between where the LED is and the green swirling lights is not quite so exaggerated

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.989
So it really looks like this slight blue glow behind a mountain

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.359
