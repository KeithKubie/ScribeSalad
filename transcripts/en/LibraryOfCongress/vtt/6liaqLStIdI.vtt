00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.550
&gt;&gt; Jesse Erickson:
So welcome everyone.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.010
Thank you all for coming on
a pleasant D.C. afternoon

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.310
and during the holiday season.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.920
I know it's a busy
time for us all.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.870
It's sort of become a tradition

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.000
for the American Printing
History Association

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.100
to hold its annual lecture in
the location that the next,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.600
next year's conference
will be held.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.690
We hope to be able to make
an informal announcement

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.990
on that front soon.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150
But for now let us just
say that we can expect

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.570
that we'll be coming back
to the Chesapeake Bay area

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.240
for the conference in 2019.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.900
I'd like to take a moment
to thank Mark [inaudible]

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.500
and the Library of
Congress staff

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.670
for hosting this year's
Lieberman Lecture.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.060
I'd especially like to extend
my sincere appreciation

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.270
to Dr. Stephanie [inaudible]
for all the work she's done

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420
to help make this
event possible.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.110
Additionally I need to
thank President [inaudible]

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.410
and George Barnum

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.610
of the American Printing History
Associates National Board.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.660
And also the Chesapeake
Bay Chapter.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.490
For providing further support
in putting this all together.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.300
The Annual Lieberman Lecture
commemorates J. Ben Lieberman,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.660
founder and first president

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.300
of the American Printing
History Association.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.800
And I'll just plug
my own institution.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.210
His papers are actually held
at the University of Delaware

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.740
which I just found out
a couple of days ago.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.360
[Laughter] So that's
really exciting.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.970
I'm going to dig in,
into his history more.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420
We are extremely fortunate

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.290
to have Dr. Sarah Werner deliver
this year's Annual Lieberman,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.590
Lieberman Lecture.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.040
Dr. Werner is well
known among members

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100
of the bibliophilic community.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.440
I first became aware of
her work through her blog,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.930
Wynken de Worde which
is really one

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.790
of the finest blogs of its kind.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780
And given that threads are
currently in vogue now.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.540
But I'd have to say that
her Twitter account,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.280
wynkenhimself is a
must-follow [laughter].

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.650
But [inaudible] her,
her content,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.950
online content really speaks

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.200
to her erudition
and, and brilliance.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.520
Dr. Werner is a book historian.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600
And a digital scholar based
here in Washington, D.C. area.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.570
Usually describes
herself as an independent,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.450
an independent librarian.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.410
She taught Early
Modern Printing History

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.880
at the Folger Shakespeare
Library for nearly a decade.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.830
And is the author of
Studying Early Printed Books:

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.390
1450 to 1800.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.110
A practical guide, coming
out from Wylie this year.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.240
Or this winter.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.670
She's also the author
of Shakespeare

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.800
and Feminist Performance:
Ideology on stage.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.060
And numerous articles on
theater practice, book history,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.930
and digital practices.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.970
Last year, she gave
the Pforzheimer Lecture

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.560
at the Harry Ransom Center on
"Early Digital Facsimiles."

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.150
And she's been a plenary
speaker at RBMS and part

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.450
of the Rare Book
School lecture series.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.730
Her current project
is a technological

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.900
and cultural study
of facsimiles.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.450
Her talk today, Working
Towards a Feminist History

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.250
of Printing fits right in
with the conference theme

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.160
for next year which is that
of Celebrating Diversity

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.100
in the History of
American Printing.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.300
So without further
delay, please help me

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.510
in welcoming Dr. Sarah Werner.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Werner:
Hello, and thank you.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.640
Thank you all for coming.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.660
And I want to say thank you
to Jesse for the invitation.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.560
And to the Chesapeake Chapter
and the Library of Congress

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.860
for making all of this possible.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.330
I'm really looking forward
to this conversation.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.770
I should warn you that kind

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.400
of like what my scholarly
career has been.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.490
This is less of a
straight-forward here I am.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.790
Here's my argument.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.090
We're just going to shoot
down towards the end.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.640
It's a following of
thoughts that we're going

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.940
to sort of explore together.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.360
So I want to talk today

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.240
about what a feminist
history of printing could be.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.540
And what we lose by thinking
of it primarily in terms

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.690
of the history of
women printing.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.590
But first, I need to share some
context for these questions.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.020
Let's see if I can do this.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.240
Okay. A few years ago, I began
writing in earnest a guide

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.410
to how books were made
in the first centuries

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.710
of the printing press.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.860
Studying early printed books,
the one that Jesse mentioned.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.850
And there are fliers
on the back table.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.230
I had been teaching bibliography
and early modern book culture

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.360
to undergraduates
for a decade by then.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.770
And the whole time
I was teaching,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.040
I struggled to find
a suitable text

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.790
to help them understand
the common press.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.830
Some guides were
entirely too brief.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.690
They would touch on imposition
and stop press changes.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.990
And then that was it.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.530
And then there was
Philip Gaskell

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.910
who wrote a wonderful book
full of details about printing.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.180
So many details that
it is unfair

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.110
to call it an introduction
by today's 'standards.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.840
For true beginners, the
book shares its knowledge

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.680
so authoritatively.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.890
And densely that it's
hard to take hold of

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.820
and find a purchase on it.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.810
You have to understand
the full run

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.340
of press work before you
can really appreciate the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.690
significance of format,
for instance.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.080
And yet there was no
helpful navigation system

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.450
to let you move around the
book as you might need.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.390
I do love it, but.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.450
And so you follow
Gaskell's lead.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.820
And if you read it enough times,
or if you have a patient teacher

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.530
to guide you through it,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.760
you might absorb
enough of its subject.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.880
To return to it on
more equal footing.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.080
So I set out to write what I
refer to as "Baby Gaskell,"

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.630
a beginners' level exploration
of how the hand press worked.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.740
And why it might be
good to know that.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.670
Another piece of context.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.170
My classes were overwhelmingly
taken by women.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.010
They looked kind
of like this row.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.590
I don't know about your
classes, if you teach.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.990
But I would wager that
like classes in the English

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.140
or Library Science or History,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.010
indeed like many
Liberal Arts courses,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.860
the student population
is more female than male.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.790
Perhaps because of that and
perhaps because I am who I am.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.780
Which is someone who is never
not thinking about gender.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.710
Our seminar discussions
often turned to speculations

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.540
about gendered reading habits.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.660
Or how print genders authorship.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.700
And so as I was writing my
book, I started to worry

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.560
about how it was unthinkingly
replicating a gendered printing.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.520
My first book was on Shakespeare
feminist performance.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.430
Was I inadvertently
writing a book

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.510
that was printing in
[inaudible] press?

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.100
But since I was writing
about printing, not printers,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.050
where were my opportunities
to intervene?

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.920
Mine wasn't a work about
books or about the book trade.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.390
So there was to focus
on authors or printers

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.340
or booksellers per se.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.440
Just a lot of information
about machines and processes

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.180
and discussions of
why it matters.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.130
So how could I bring my
investment in feminists' theory

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.080
and practice to the
forefront of this work?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.520
Twenty years ago, Leslie
Howsam published a brief

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.320
but pointed call to
arms in sharp news.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.950
In my view women and book
history is her advocacy

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.340
for an explicitly
feminist approach

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.620
to studying book history.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.470
But Howsam isn't interested in
excavating women's histories.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.080
And she deliberately
sets that approach aside.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.940
"Most of the women whose work
in the book's cycle has been

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.060
so painstakingly
discovered by researchers.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.160
Has been, oop, has been
atypical individuals.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.570
Outstanding anomalies

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.860
in a cultural field
dominated by men," she says.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.550
I think she might be
overstating the assumption

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.370
that such women were
entirely atypical.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.210
There's evidence that
in the first centuries

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.510
of the printing press.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.240
Women were an integral part of
the daily work of bookmaking

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.420
and bookselling, if
in small numbers.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.720
Although there's also evidence

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.990
that their numbers dropped
off in later centuries.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.220
But her larger point I
think is still germane.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.820
Adding to the scant
list of women known

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.470
to have been involved
in the book trades.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.130
Only makes it slightly
less scant.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.840
And such recovery work doesn't
necessarily help us confront.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.280
The social and political forces
that shape women's lives.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.680
There is, I sometimes find it
necessary to say, a difference

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.880
between women and book history.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.990
And feminist approaches
to book history.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.250
A catalogue of women
is not the same thing

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.390
as enabling a critical
examination

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.240
of the history of books.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.690
Or the methodologies we've
used to study that history.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.540
Returning to Leslie Howsam.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.740
Instead of fleshing
out the list of women

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.120
in the book trades, she writes.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.260
"I want to suggest that
book historians think

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.200
about how the book
has been implicated.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.340
In those structures of
masculine power and authority.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.540
Known to feminist
scholarship as patriarchy."

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.480
For her, in other
words, the possibilities

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.170
for feminist book history lie
in working not with women.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.680
Necessarily, but with gender.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.130
The questions to ask are
not who made these books?

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.830
But how are books
conceived of as gendered?

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.530
As an illustration of this
avenue of investigation.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.070
Howsam points to the language
of conquest and courting used

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.610
by collectors as one
potential avenue.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.570
Such as this from
Richard Corell in 1930.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.980
"Books without points are
like women without beauty.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.200
They pass unnoticed
in the crowd.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.150
But books with points
excite immediate interest

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.530
in everybody, so to speak.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.530
Turns to gaze at them."

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.300
As Howsam suggests in response,
"Perhaps we can also think

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.350
about the gendered possessive
not altogether unsexualized way

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.300
that book collectors have fixed
their gaze upon the object

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.630
of desire."

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.770
Some of you might want to
pat yourselves on the back,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.160
thinking that 1930
was a long time ago.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.680
But his attitude still shows
up in catalogues today.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.490
Rebecca Romney has
been compiling examples

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.860
like this one.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.780
"perfect companion to curls.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.700
Prettier copies are out there.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.620
And even though I live in L.A.,
or maybe because I live in L.A.,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.450
I'll take the girl
with depth of soul.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.700
Over the ubiquitous,
superficially attractive ones."

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.000
And that's from a catalogue-- .

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.300
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.780
Just from a catalogue just
a couple of years ago.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.430
And this isn't the only one

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.850
that shows how much the
male gaze is so with us.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.980
Rebecca has a whole
file of them.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.950
I'm really grateful to her for
sharing some examples with me.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.280
And if you happen to
come across examples

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.580
of these things in your work.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.100
I'm sure Rebecca would really
love to know about them.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.870
So. The tool Howsam uses

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.790
to outside this gaze is
Jane Marcus' Theorization

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.090
of Feminist Aesthetics.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.870
As Marcus works through it,
a feminist aesthetic is one

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.920
that values process
over product.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.550
One that avoids hierarchies
and exclusions.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.230
For Howsam, this suggests a
feminist praxis of book study

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.390
that downplays possession
in favor of utility.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.020
Instead of favoring first
editions and famous authors,

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.620
it might instead think in
terms of less visible books.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.670
That gain meaning through
their social circulation.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.880
Perhaps, she suggests,
wryly, the way large numbers

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.920
of readers, both men and
women make use of books.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.120
Maybe just as interesting in
the ways in which small numbers

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.140
of authors, publishers,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.600
and collectors work
together to create fashion.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.560
And preserve books.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.800
Howsam's desire to focus on the
utility and social circulation

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.610
of books aligns closely
with my own practice

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.670
and preference of
studying books.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.480
One that tends to focus on
things like [inaudible].

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.090
Very popular multi-lingual
phrase books

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.090
and dictionaries
published across Europe.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:33.540
In editions too many to count.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.820
And many of you will
already know this about me.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.650
To express frustration
is what I do with things

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.950
like the obsessive tracking
of Shakespeare's first folio.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.030
And the [inaudible]
goes, "Oh, my gosh, yes."

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.290
[Laughter] It's not a
novel approach to the study

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.340
of books, by any means.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.790
Although it's still not
something that is often put

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.890
through an explicitly
feminist lens.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.920
But I want to look
a bit more closely

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.200
at how Howsam incorporates
Marcus' theory

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.350
of feminist aesthetics
into her own speculations.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.510
Much of the work Howsam
does draws on this excerpt

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:14.400
from Marcus' 1988 book, Art and
Anger: Reading Like a Woman.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.530
"This model of art," Howsam
quotes, "with repetition

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.010
and dailiness at
the heart of it.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.190
With the teaching of
other women the patient

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.630
of one's cultural heritage
as the object of it.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.950
Is a female poetic which
women live and accept.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.350
Transformation rather
than permanence is

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.750
at the heart of this aesthetic.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.710
As it is at the heart
of most women's lives.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.070
History is preserved not in the
art object, but in the tradition

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.590
of making the art object."

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.340
It's this account of daily
making that leads Howsam

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.060
to the observation that feminist
book history could attend

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.640
to how books are used and
attend to books that are part

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.740
of the everyday and ordinary.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.430
What catches my attention
however is how much this

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.590
scenario reminds me of
the act of printing.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.290
The repetition and
dailiness and patience

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.030
of working the printing press.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.690
And setting the type.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.130
This is the unavoidable
nature of the actions

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.210
without which printing
wouldn't happen.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.700
And Marcus' emphasis on making
the art object resonates

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.680
strongly for me with
analytical bibliography.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.210
Especially as I've spent
the last years writing

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.510
about how books are made.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.230
And teaching students how
to recover that process

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.580
through the physical evidence
left behind in material texts.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.850
So where does Marcus get
this model of art from?

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.540
Here's the full passage
taken from Still Practice:

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.510
A rested Alphabet Toward
a Feminist Aesthetic.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.940
The 1984 article that is one

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.950
of the three pieces forming
the basis of her book.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.580
As an aside, I should note
that throughout this talk,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.480
I tend to quote from articles
that books were based on.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.190
Largely because as an
independent scholar,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.640
articles are a lot easier
for me to access than books

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.470
and that I think
is also something.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.770
That's part of thinking

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.650
about what a feminist
history might be.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.080
Lipking, you would
know, in this quote,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.220
refers to Lawrence Lipking's
piece Aristotle's Sister.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.610
In which he argues for a
feminine poetics of abandonment.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:28.860
An important foil for Marcus in
this I know, lengthy, passage.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.540
"We could imagine another
aesthetic, call it Penelope's,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.180
which grew out of
a female culture.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.190
Lipking says that
Arimneste, Aristotle's sister,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.830
'cannot compete, of course,
with her brother's tradition.'

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.380
Penelope's aesthetic
does not wish to compete.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.120
This anti-hierarchical,
anti-theoretical,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.980
not aggressively exclusionary.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.340
A real woman's poetics is
a poetics of commitment.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.510
Not the poetics of abandonment."

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:05.800
Above all, it does not separate
art from work in daily life.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.110
Penelope weaves her
tapestry by day.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.800
And takes it apart by night.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.080
Could Aristotle destroy
his lectures

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.120
and start over again each day?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.310
This model of art
with repetition

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.690
and dailiness at
the heart of it.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.750
With the teaching of other
women the patient craft

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.490
of one's cultural heritage.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.210
As the object of it
is a female poetic

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.870
which women live and accept.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.420
Penelope's art is work.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.050
As women cook food
that is eaten.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.340
Weave cloth that is worn.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.390
Clean houses that are dirtied.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.300
Transformation rather than
permanence is at the heart

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.060
of this aesthetic as
it is at the heart

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.310
of most women's lives."

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.280
The ellipses in Howsam,
all the bits of the weaving

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.280
that she has unpicked from
this argument are all the parts

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.700
that are about Penelope.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.410
I can see why she would
worry in her brief piece

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.250
that it would be a distraction.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.080
That it would take
too much explanation

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.800
to give it proper context.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.600
But that this passage is

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.870
about Penelope undoing her
weaving every night makes it

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:24.470
for me all the more
about printing.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.420
As an aesthetic about printing,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.250
Marcus' account here
works shockingly well,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.110
even better than
with the emissions.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.010
If you've ever done even
the smallest bit of work

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.680
on common presses, you know
that it is entirely a process.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.970
Not only of repetition, but of
breaking down and starting over.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.240
Dab ink on the balls, work
the ink, dabbing on the form.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.010
Dab, work, work, dab.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.710
And at the end of the say, take
the stuffing out of the balls.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.390
Soak the leather
and next morning,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.430
reassemble and start again.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.730
Pick the piece of type up.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.030
Place it in the stick.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.430
Place another, place another,
put the line on the stone.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.660
Put another, put
another, tie it up.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.960
Tie up another page.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.260
Tie up another.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.560
Lock it up, print it off,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.640
distribute the type
back into its boxes.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.620
Start all over again.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.110
Place the paper on the tin
pan, fold the frisket down.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.410
Fold the whole thing down.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.710
Roll it under the [inaudible]
and pull the bar [inaudible].

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.010
And once more, pull again.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.310
Roll it out.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.610
Open the frisket,
take the paper off.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.910
Put the paper on.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.210
Fold it down, fold it down,
roll, pull, roll, pull.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.510
Roll, pull, open,
hang the paper.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:32.590
Go home. Come back the next
morning and do it all again.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.060
Penelope's weaving
disappears each night.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.900
And a printer's work does not.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.160
Since the printed paper
remains and heats in gatherings.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.530
But the unmaking of the press's
parts are a key components

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.050
to keeping the work going
and the debtors at bay.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.490
And if you are as I am,
committed to the belief

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.460
that every single copy
of a text is unique,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.900
thanks to inevitable
printing variance.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.340
And the vagaries of
its individual life.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.080
Then an awareness of repetition

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.070
and variation makes
an aesthetic based

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.360
on Penelope's weaving
all the more compelling.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.940
So let's talk about actual hand
press printing for a moment.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.710
If I'm only interested in
the mechanics of printing

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.030
as the only thing
really my book was about.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.660
Need I think about
gender at all?

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.640
Well, yes.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.490
Always yes.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.700
But especially yes in
Renaissance England.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.230
Where the word press was term
that could be used both to refer

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.990
to printing but also
to a physical pressing

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.230
of a man into a woman.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:53.030
That is an act of sexual
penetration and deflowering.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.370
The author might
be a man in print,

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.040
but he is not pressed
as a lady is pressed.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.060
It is the book that is
pressed, and the author

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.920
who does the pressing.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.000
An ambiguity, an anxiety
that Wendy Wall works

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.030
with in her 1993 book,
The Imprint of Gender.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.790
But there need not be
winks and nudges for sex

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.860
to be brought into the topic.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.950
Lisa Maruca's 1993 Bodies
of Type is the rare piece

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.970
of scholarship that
reads printers manuals.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.090
Not as transparent
printing lessons.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.290
But for their rhetorical
and ideological practices.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.120
In her hands, we are
brought to see the gendered

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.360
and sexualized language
that is repeatedly drawn

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.410
on in these manuals.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.050
Take for instance this passage

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.640
from Joseph Moxon's
1683 Mechanic Exercises

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.900
on the Whole Art of Printing.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.190
In which he describes
the component parts

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.520
of a letter mold.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.340
"When his stick of
letters is thus transferred

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.030
to the male block,
he claps the middle

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.410
of the male block
into his left hand.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.120
Tilting the feet of the
letter a little upwards

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.090
so that the face might
rest upon the tongue.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.450
And then takes about the middle

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.870
of the female block
in his right hand.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.960
And lays it so upon the
male block that the tongue

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.090
of the male block may fall into
the tongue of the female block.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.420
[Laughter] So that when the knot

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.410
of the male block is lightly
drawn towards the knot

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.710
of the female block.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.000
Or the knot of the female block
lightly thrusts toward the knot

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.300
of the male block.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:34.040
Both knots shall squeeze the
letter close between them."

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.280
We are so habituated to
the description of plugs

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.330
and other objects being
described as female or male.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.570
That it might not occur to
you to note this passage

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.890
when reading through Moxon.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.220
I don't think I did until I
started reading Lisa's work.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.860
And of course, the language

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.640
of the human body
is used throughout.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.130
Pieces of type have feet,
shoulders, heads, bodies.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.730
But Maruca points out that such
language emerges in this period.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.650
The OED traces the use of
male and female as adjectives

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.760
for objects with
projecting of hollow ends.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.250
To the late 16th century.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.080
The first entry for male gauges
is Moxon's passage earlier

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.510
in this section about
male gauges falling

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.870
into female gauges.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:27.130
These are not just bodies, but
bodies that are being sexed.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:31.220
And John Smith, 1755,
The Printer's Grammar.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.030
The laboring bodies
have disappeared

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.770
as Maruca points out.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.880
But a rigid gender
hierarchy remains

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.920
to govern appropriate
typeface choices.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.120
The strong upright Roman face
should be used for the main text

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.290
with a delicate flowing
italic, used only to decorate

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.590
within the Roman context.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.460
Maruca's project in the
work of print, the 2007 book

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.730
into which her article
is incorporated is

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.350
to consider the many ways
in which the acts and agents

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.270
of bookmaking create an
ideology of authorship

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.850
that is gendered
and politicized.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.440
But what I want to
call attention

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.800
to is how effectively she puts
down the wishful thinking.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.860
That we can treat printer's
manuals as transparent windows

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.110
onto early modern
acts of printing.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:24.810
So much of what we know
about how books were made

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.810
in the hand-pressed period.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.910
Are based on Moxon and Smith.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.470
And the [inaudible].

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.230
Bibliographers draw on their
work to produce the works

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.550
that become the basis
of our study.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.330
Works like those of
McCarrow and Gaskell.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:46.130
How do we escape the masculinist
underpinnings of our knowledge?

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.300
Is it useful here to think
about Dianna Taylor's notions

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.210
of archive and repertoire?

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.510
To deal with the tensions

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.300
between reading ideological
texts and the desire

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.840
to recover acts of printing?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.040
Taylor's concepts fleshed out
in her 2003 book are based

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.610
in performance studies.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.020
And geared towards
recovering Latin American

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.680
cultural histories.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.260
And while I sometimes get
impatient with her dichotomy.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.650
I also find it generative.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:17.820
Here's a quick and superficial
description of her concepts.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.130
Cultural memory is contained
both in written archives

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.860
and in bodily repertoire.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.040
When the dominant history of
conquest has been preserved

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.250
in archival documents.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.390
Where can you find
indigenous culture

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.400
in history in its own voice?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.990
In the embodied history
of experience passed

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.210
down from one generation of
survivors to the next, she says.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.400
Theater, dance, gesture, all
can be valid forms of knowledge

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.790
and history and capture what
written documents cannot.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.820
So if printers' manuals are part

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.860
of the written archive
of printing history.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.930
And if they have an
ideological slant.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.920
As Maruca's readings says
they do and as all things do.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.600
Can we counter that bias in the
physical repertoire of printing?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.570
Is a feminist praxis
of printing history one

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.980
that emphasizes doing
over reading?

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:17.670
Although printing practices
have changed over the centuries,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.410
scholar/printers have
long been interested

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.700
in early techniques
of bookmaking.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.340
Debating finer points.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.810
Rebuilding presses.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.040
And relearning what
was once known.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.810
There might not be an embodied
repertoire that's been handed

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.950
down to us in a direct line

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.070
from London's printers
in the 17th century.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.730
But there is an active
repertoire living in bodies,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.200
printing on wooden
hand presses today.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.650
Bodies or people who are often
eager to share what they know.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.610
It isn't only muscle memory
involved in being able

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.520
to pull the bar, lower the
[inaudible] just smoothly

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.950
and hard enough.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.970
But a physical knowledge
that is expressed

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.780
by doing rather than writing.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.460
And that repertoire of
knowledge through doing.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.610
Is a central part of exploring
how hand press printing worked.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.910
On the other hand.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.470
And this is no small
point when we're thinking

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.240
about equity and inclusion.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.490
Books can be significantly
more accessible

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.680
than bodies and printing
presses.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.180
There are only so many
printers and so many presses.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.520
Printers deserve to be
paid for their time.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.990
Replica presses are much
too heavy to travel.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.920
How many educators work
at a place where printing

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.870
on a common press can
easily be incorporated

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.370
into your classroom practice?

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:45.360
How many educators are active
printers or have access to funds

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.150
to pay printers a decent fee
for working with their students?

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.310
But books can be
priced affordably.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.430
I know they are not
always, but they can be.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.210
They can be resold
for even less.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.100
They could often
exist in digital form.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.140
Maybe accessible to a wide range
of abled and disabled users.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.850
You can take them home and
revisit them on your own time

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.600
if you didn't understand what
happened in the classroom.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.350
And you can keep them until
you've used them to pieces.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.750
Not that any of us would be
so careless with our books.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.310
There are good reasons why we
teach history from the archive

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.990
and not through repertoire.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.080
And among them the
documents are more conducive

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.240
to how universities are set up.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.910
And we should never forget
the material conditions

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.170
that inform what we do.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.770
If we're historians and
bibliographers in fact.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.030
Our training should mean that
we always keep those material

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.970
conditions at the
forefront of our thoughts.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.500
Let's go back to
where this started.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.580
What is a Feminist
History of Printing?

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.400
And what do we lose by
thinking of it primarily

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.650
as the history of
women printing?

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.450
I've had to think about my
own feminist praxis outside

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.240
of recovering women's history.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.420
Because of my recent focus
on explicating the workings

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.900
of presses and libraries.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.490
But maybe that's
only my problem.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.570
Why not look in the
archives to recover

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.570
who the early women
printing in France were?

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.890
Why not compile a
catalogue of books printed

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.090
by women in early America?

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:24.560
How is that not a feminist
practice of book history?

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.730
It can be.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.140
I can think of plenty of
works of printing history

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.500
that I would say are
doing feminist work.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.590
And I can absolutely
think of works

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.320
about equivalent
modern technologies.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.190
Like Marie Hick's recent
Programmed Inequality

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.740
that are field changing and
profoundly feminist ways.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.020
And that are consistent with
this sort of work that we do

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.740
in the history of printing.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.930
So I'm not saying that
such work isn't valuable.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.140
But it can't be the
only feminist work

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.620
that print historians are doing.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.670
Let's talk about recovery
history for a moment.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.150
Why we do it and
what we're missing.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.570
Today's drive to
recover the history

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.000
of women's activities
comes primarily

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.440
out of the feminist
movement of the early 1970s.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.400
We need to tell her story, not
his-story, urged Robin Morgan.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.870
And it's no coincidence that
the word her story first appears

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.830
in print as part of the byline

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.750
for Morgan's [inaudible]
Good-bye to All That.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.690
The editorial she published
in the January 1970 issue

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.030
or Rat Subterranean News.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.900
Which was taken over
by women in protest

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.970
of the male editorial
staff misogyny.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.260
If Morgan was a woman
inspired to commit "herstory,"

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.760
as she signed herself.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.920
Her readers were ready for it.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.910
Ready to stop believing the
stories they'd been told

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.760
about what was good
behavior and what was bad.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.120
What counted and what didn't.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.160
Let it all hang out,
Let it seem bitchy,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.920
catty, dike-y, [inaudible].

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.220
Frustrated, crazy, nutty,
frigid, ridiculous, bitter,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.970
embarrassing, man-hating,
libelist, pure, unfair, envious,

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:16.160
intuitive, low-down,
stupid, petty, liberating.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.310
We are the women that
men have warned up about.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.050
[Laughter]

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.540
That drive to look back

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.990
at the stories we've been
told and to see the gaps.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.760
Where we've been
removed is powerful.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.400
Honest to god, every
time I read through that.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.620
I get the, I get
the shivers, right?

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.680
We were all these, all along.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.780
That witch in the corner
of your eye is the widow

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.320
who won't marry.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.860
That scandalous behavior is
running a profitable business

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.350
on her own.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.410
We are the women that
men have warned us about.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.130
And we have always
been part of history.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.790
It's powerful to feel that
rush of connection to the past.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:05.330
Recovering the history of women
printing does that for us.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.880
And what about the history

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.930
of enslaved women
in the book trades?

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.450
Or the history of indigenous
people and the printing press?

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.830
Where's the queer
history of printing?

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.490
The trans history?

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.320
You tell me you've
recovered the history

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.810
of a previously hidden
group in the book trades.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.260
And I will ask you
about another group.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:33.380
Where are they and what's
the connection between them?

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.560
If we are recovering history
in order to make it all

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.310
of our history, we are
faced with the choice

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:44.430
between either ignoring who
is excluded from that all.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.950
Or searching for
more and more firsts.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.890
And more and more histories to
make the past more equitable.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.320
But you cannot simply keep
adding recovered histories

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.710
and think that it will
take care of the problems.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:02.970
Of our overwhelmingly white
male field faces today.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.690
It's an odd thing, isn't it?

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.080
That I started off by talking

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.830
about how largely
female my classroom.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.120
Yet here we are nearing
the end, and I'm talking

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.760
about how male the field is?

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.980
But in this book history
follows the pyramid of academia.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.060
And libraries and book dealing.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.900
In which there are large
numbers of women studying.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.440
And working at the
lower levels of a field.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:35.350
But the higher the status of the
job, the fewer women there are.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:40.730
How does recovering history
level today's playing field?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.410
Here's another question
to think about.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:47.070
What do you want the future of
printing history to look like?

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.020
Who do you want to be printing?

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.930
Who do you want to
be studying it?

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.540
Who are writing the stories?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.770
What sort of technology
is part of this process?

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.460
When I suggested our field
is facing problems today

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.330
because it is white and male.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.130
What I want to focus on
is how much knowledge

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.650
and experience we are missing.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:11.400
And how unsustainable
this pattern is.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.670
Think about Dorothy
Porter at Howard University

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:19.110
and how she saw what the white
librarians in her era did not.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.820
That the Dewey classification
system collapsed any possibility

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.920
of blacks being seen
through the lens.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.500
Wait, classes the
possibility of them being said,

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:33.630
seen outside the frame of
either slavery or colonization.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.220
[Inaudible] What about
Paula McDowell's revelations

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.530
about women's participation
in public print

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.270
and debate in the 18th century?

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.650
How could we even begin to
think about book history

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:50.230
as a discipline without
Elizabeth Eisenstein?

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:54.450
Our world would be immeasurably
poorer without them.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.820
But when I look at my shelves of
books about hand press printing.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.110
They are overwhelmingly
authored by men.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.530
When I look at the
companions and readers we used

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.830
to teach book history.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.000
The sections that touch

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.350
on technologies,
those about printing.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.730
And those about digital books
are overwhelmingly authored

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.230
by men.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.580
When I look at my own citation
practice in my own book.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.120
A book in which I was
consciously trying not

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.360
to repeat this bias.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.150
They are overwhelmingly male.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.740
This is the part where I
shame myself thoroughly

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.920
and profoundly.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.220
I was really horrified
when I counted.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:44.340
I realized, look at those cards.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:51.810
The future of printing
isn't going to be books

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:57.440
on wooden presses written
by and about white dudes.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.320
The future of printing
and the future

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.330
of printing history is going
to be machines and computers

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.950
and technologies that
haven't been invented yet.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:14.710
And they'll be used to make
texts and to circulate them

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.500
and to circulate the texts.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.970
That are about the
making of the texts.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.690
And they're going to
need to be written

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.850
by a much broader
range of people.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:27.750
If our field is going to not
only be relevant and exciting.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.350
But if it is going to exist.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.060
Bibliographers are a
small group of scholars,

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.210
heavily indebted to the past.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.370
The past when women could barely
squeeze through the entrance

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.880
into [inaudible]
and Bowers' classes.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.200
And I really wish Barbara Mower
were here to tell us about that.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.790
And it's a past of male
scholars and female typists

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:55.030
that still determines how we
understand and describe books.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:59.050
So why do we need a feminist
praxis of printing history?

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.280
We need it so we can thrive.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.480
We need it to expose
why we do what we do.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.120
And to invite more people in to
help us understand the field.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.760
Let's turn back one
more time to weaving.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.580
What does thinking about
weaving get us in striving

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.190
for a feminist praxis?

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.710
The key part of the
Penelope story is not simply

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.490
that she weaves.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.790
But that she takes apart
her weaving every night

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.630
and then starts again
the next morning.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.710
It's the willingness to
dismantle paradoxically.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.140
That makes her art an aesthetic

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.380
of commitment and
not abandonment.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.980
Abandonment would
be walking away.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.350
Commitment is sticking it out.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:50.150
The problems, the errors, the
suitors who try to control you.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.150
You fix the turned
letters, the dropped lines,

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.460
the last minute insertions.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.340
Commitment is also dealing with
the harassment of the suitors

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.640
and we call them suitors.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.510
But let's make no mistake,
they aren't courting her.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.720
They're courting
Odysseus'' wealth.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.720
Penelope is using the
strategy at her disposal

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.700
to delay an impossible situation

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.060
until she can assert
her own will.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.110
Weaving is an art and
an everyday activity,

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.680
but it is also a protest.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.570
A scholarly practice
based on weaving means not

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.460
that we erase our writing.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.870
You know, which we already do.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:37.600
It means that we keep our minds
open up to error and revision.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.600
That we lead with a willingness

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.600
to relearn what we
thought we knew.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.390
That we decenter
ourselves as experts.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.880
And situate ourselves in a
community of questioners.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.260
And it means too that
we make ourselves

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.220
and our knowledge accessible.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.850
Are we publishing in
locked away spaces?

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.790
Or are we participating in the
open commons of conversation?

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.480
Are we willing to learn
and respond to changes

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.510
in the world around us?

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:13.280
If we insist that printing
history is one thing only.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.670
That bibliography
is one thing only.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:21.370
That a book is words on paper,
we are locking ourselves

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.820
out of the conversation.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.830
Remember too that weaving
is grounded in the ordinary.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:32.690
We are all at this moment
wearing something woven

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.550
or knitted or produced
through another textile form.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.850
I'm hoping there might be people

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.100
who might actually be
knitting right now.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.110
[Laughter] There is nothing
to be ashamed up in writing

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:47.520
in straight forward language
in unpopular platforms

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.910
that invite in people.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.060
From outside our field.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:55.650
The everyday can be
powerful and compelling.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.470
For all of my fears
about whether,

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:59.770
I'm not sure I have
that slide yet.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.070
For all of my fears

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.290
about whether my book was
reproducing a masculine

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.590
printing history.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.360
I think I was worried
about the wrong thing.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.260
It's not the subject of
my book that is the key.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.030
But it's methodology.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.460
My feminist praxis
lies in opening

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.860
up the gates to a
field of study.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.170
In making complicated
abstract ideas understandable

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.900
and compelling, in
inviting those

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.410
who have been outside the field.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.030
To move into its center.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.820
And unraveling and
remaking the warp

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.160
and weft of my own knowledge.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.800
I'm so grateful to you
all for this opportunity

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.050
to rethink my own
scholarly practices.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:42.390
I hope this process of working
through what a feminist praxis

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.810
of print history
might look like.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.040
Leads us all to think
about how we share

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.510
and open our field Thank you.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:40:00.840
[ Applause ]

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.730
&gt;&gt; So we have some time
for questions and answers.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.220
So I will open up the
floor to questions.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.830
&gt;&gt; I can't promise answers.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.130
I said I would take questions.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.770
I didn't promise-- I'll try for
answers, if anybody had any.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.080
&gt;&gt; Well, I have sort of a
comment question [inaudible].

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.900
Alright? But I just was thinking
so much about all the threads

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.090
that you're weaving
for us today.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:33.170
And thinking about the
book and printed word.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.470
And how those are reproduced.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:39.630
And how even today we are
continue to reproduce even

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.930
in new fields or research.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.990
Certain areas of
digital [inaudible].

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:47.820
So I'm wondering if you had
a couple of thoughts on that.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.390
And, and sort of ways of
pushing against some of that,

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.280
the embodiment of book history.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:01.470
As it's reproduced and
reanalyzed in new ways?

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.040
So [inaudible].

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.810
&gt;&gt; So you know it's, it's.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.780
I'm never quite sure
what to do with books

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.960
and digital humanities.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.260
[Laughter] Right?

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.560
And the other handful of
people I know who are in that,

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.150
you know interlocking space.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.930
Because on the one
hand there is a large

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.630
and important body
of work being done.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:26.370
On texts in digital humanities.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.720
In which you, you
know, you OCR on text.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.020
And you strip it out.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.320
Then you do all sorts
of fun stuff

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.620
with it and it's important.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.830
And not my thing.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.990
But there is lots of interesting
work that can be done there.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:42.490
So on the one hand, the,
the body of the book drops

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.380
out altogether, right?

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.960
And there's a, another
group of people

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.380
who are very book-focused.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.550
Who are interested in digital
tools, but are very skeptical

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.850
of digital tools being
able to reproduce

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:03.540
or make available the
physical materiality of books.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.510
And I love, I love
digitization of books, right?

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.000
Like this is, this is my thing.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.120
I get lost in looking
at, at them.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.420
All the time.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.170
I think that we are just,
we are so in the baby years

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.620
of this sort of technology.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.200
And you know honestly, what
do most people do with books?

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.500
They read them.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.120
I mean, like I can't like, I
can't fault people who think

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.810
that like books are words.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.460
Right? Like probably up until
about a decade ago, I would,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.760
just thought of books as words.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.690
I wasn't thinking of all
the stuff that went into it.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.380
So I'm not super
happy at the moment

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.680
that there is this
weird tension.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.130
Between like the body

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.010
of the book is important
and can't be digital.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.250
And text is always
inherently digital.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.490
Like obviously if
you're a bibliographer,

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:49.790
you know, duh, no.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.110
You can't separate the
text from the book.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.860
And we haven't yet in
digital [inaudible] I think

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.360
with the exception of a
small group of people.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.300
Really started to push at that
and, and think about that.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.680
I hope that answers the.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.900
I don't what to do with
gendering about that.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.000
Although there is gendering
to do with about that.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.200
In part because the,
because now is the, the text,

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.750
the text world is
heavily dominated by men.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.530
I'm looking at Jen to be like,
"How should I phrase this?"

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:20.720
The text mining version of it
is heavily, it's heavily male.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.710
And it's male in ways that
often discourage women

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.010
from participating in the field.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.750
So it's often exclusionarily
male.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.730
I don't know if exclusionarily
is a word.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.460
But so there's something
going on in there, too.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.760
Jenn?

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.950
&gt;&gt; How does the book
arts community sort

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.280
of fit within that?

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.730
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.030
I don't know.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.810
And I really, I don't, I don't.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.370
I was thinking about
the book arts community

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.670
when I was doing this.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.330
Because I wanted to find
interesting examples.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.630
And then I just sort of
said, "You know what?

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:50.930
Like I really-- I'm already.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.890
I'm already mucking around
in stuff that I don't know."

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:55.800
Like I really don't know
the book arts community.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.310
And it's so rich.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.610
And it's so important.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.910
And there's so much
happening there.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.880
That I was like I have
to come back to that.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.100
Later. I, I, you know it's.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.390
I have so many "next
books" at this point.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.220
I have a slight suspicion

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.660
that that community might
be more female than male?

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.470
How do I think--
is that, is that,

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.120
is that seem like
an accurate-- ?

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.420
And there is again
something about.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.650
I think going back to the ways
in which Leslie Howsam was.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.340
Like think about how
the book is gendered.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.830
I don't know.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.250
It, and, and stuff
that Wendy Wall does.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.140
I keep coming back to this
sense that the perception is

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.420
that authorship is
gendered male.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.790
But books are gendered female.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:44.160
Is the whole pressing thing and
I didn't talk about the emblems

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:50.120
from [inaudible] that I dropped
in here in a couple of times.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.420
You know it's a book of emblems.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.060
So you get an emblems, and they
get a little thing about, oh!

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.400
Printing. And you get
this woman who appears.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.020
From the early, when printing
first start to appear,

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.480
there's that woodcut
that was at the beginning

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.780
of the talk of the woman.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.630
And then she keeps reappearing
and she gets turned into.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.400
Then it's a horrible
picture, isn't it?

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.760
Like it's, she looks
like she's in pain.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.060
And I don't know what--

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.360
her head's sort of
falling off her head.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.660
Like it's just.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.260
But it makes so much sense to
me that she's, she's a woman.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.560
Because it's all
about the press.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.860
And it's all about
the materiality.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.510
It's all about being, going back
to that being pressed thing.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.880
[Inaudible]

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.450
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sarah,
that was amazing.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.350
&gt;&gt; And incredibly timely
too at least for me.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:36.100
I was listening before
coming into the building.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.980
I was messaging with a friend.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.970
And I was using [inaudible]
function on my phone

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.830
to say over and over again.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:45.310
People can be famous for
things besides being first.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.860
[Laughter] People can be famous
for things besides being first

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:53.190
and that's occasioned
by a, a recent death.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:58.950
The passing of a very remarkable
woman named [inaudible].

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.850
Who has been widely and
somewhat incorrectly imported

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:06.880
as having invented
the word processor.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.760
And she had an amazing career.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.070
She did lots of things
that are worthy

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.100
of memory and celebration.

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.030
Literally inventing the word
processor was not quite one

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.330
of them.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:25.000
And so just this
sort of conundrum.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.220
Of how do we frame histories,
especially when they're sort

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.730
of moved into the
popular sphere.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.740
When we're talking about
New York Times headlines

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.400
and that sort of thing?

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.780
Obituaries in the
New York Times.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.140
How do you sort of find
ways to frame histories

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.560
that are not about [inaudible].

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.860
About being first?

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:50.250
And if you know I mean I
think obviously that's sort

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.670
of something that
you're addressing.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.910
But I'm wondering if you have
any thoughts in particular

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.820
on why we're so obsessed
with firsts

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.140
in various technological
histories.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.090
&gt;&gt; I don't know, but you know.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.690
It's not only technological
histories.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.670
I think about like what was
the first sonnet sequence?

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.630
And who was the first
woman writer to imprint?

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.670
And who was I mean
all of the, there's.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:11.970
We, I don't know why.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.430
Apparently we must be wired.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.940
I mean like human brains
have some sort of way

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.740
to say like it's a race.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.200
First is, first is the best.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.250
But first is so deeply,
so deeply problematic.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.550
Because I don't know.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:28.970
Second is just as
interesting as first.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:31.550
And 500th is just as
important as first.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:35.180
And then when you talk
about printing back in,

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.480
I almost called it, "my day."

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.280
Printing back in my day, as
if I'm like 500 years old.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.160
We don't-- .

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.330
&gt;&gt; You look good.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:45.630
[Laughter]

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.430
&gt;&gt; I really, I try, you know?

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.150
It's there are so
many lost records.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:55.170
And one of the big
problems with studying,

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.740
recovering women's printing
history in the Renaissance.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.460
Is that there's all
these anonymous printers.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.760
Like we don't know who they are.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.060
They have initials.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.320
Or there's, they continue
publishing, widows.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.970
They continue publishing
under their husband's name.

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:11.970
Like how do you actually
find them?

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.360
And then if you start
getting into sort

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.480
of other archival histories.

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.720
Dispossessed Lives is
written by-- [inaudible].

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.020
Yes, Marissa Fuentes.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.930
Yes, I mean so you get into
other interesting questions

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.790
about how do archival documents.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:30.160
Represent histories
that aren't-- .

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.740
It's like what I was saying
about the indigenous stuff.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.440
You know, histories that
can't speak for themselves

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.760
because they have been silenced

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.190
by whoever's creating
the document.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.790
All of those get in
the way of firsts.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.420
I, I'm, I don't know, I'm not
really interested in firsts.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.070
And one of the big problems
is like the New York Times.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:46.650
I feel like they're saying
is like, if you think ahead

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.600
to like next generation
scholars.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.980
If it wasn't for the work
that like you've done.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.870
Or work like Marie
Hicks has been doing.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.770
We can see like somebody has
taken the time at the moment.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:00.700
To sort of excavate is the
word that's coming to mind.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:04.470
To take apart the New
York Times obit and say.

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:05.770
Here are the biases in there.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.540
The New York Times
always talks about the,

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.080
those future historians, right?

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.380
They would do what I do.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.960
Which is you look up the wills.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.260
You look up the probate records.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.560
I mean, they do the
equivalent of that.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.860
And they go, "oh, look!

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.320
She invented the-- ."

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.120
That's not-- .

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.520
I am actually the oldest child
so I'm not sure I believe that.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.770
But. [Laughter] My sister
would, would be happy.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:34.380
To me, you're kind of
describing the moment in fall

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.160
when you know the
trees are prettiest.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.240
Not the first leaf
that's beautiful,

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.290
but there's a moment
when [inaudible].

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:48.270
And I'm wondering when
people look back at our time.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:51.680
Will they see a moment
[inaudible]?

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.980
Or are we just [inaudible]?

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.280
&gt;&gt; I, I-- .

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.580
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.930
No, you know it.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.790
That's a super good question.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.090
I don't have an answer.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.950
And all I can say is
I had a conversation

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:08.090
with Fletcher [inaudible]
recently about binding in this.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.260
And he was on a, if
you know Fletcher.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.120
If any of you Fletcher, you
can follow him on Twitter.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.160
He's actually also
lovely on Twitter.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.940
He gets a bee in his bonnet,
and then he just goes off at it.

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.240
And he's a conservator.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.540
He's like this is a world
I don't' really know.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.840
So I learn a lot from him.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.140
I don't always agree with him.

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.230
But like we were talking about
the tendency for books today,

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:30.530
when they have to be rebound.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.850
If it's a book from,
you know 1300.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:38.200
That oftentimes conservation
will want to re bind it

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.930
in a style that emulates that
is appropriate to that period.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.820
And I was like well yeah, duh.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.940
What else would you do?

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.470
Right? Like this is, we are
so used to thinking about it.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:50.770
And he was like think
about what is,

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.370
like where's the
21st century binding?

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:53.900
Like where, where is our art?

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.200
Where have we lost that?

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.700
Because we were so interested
in only recreating that.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.200
And I don't know.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.660
Really it's not 21st
century books.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.770
But why can't it be
like we value those 19th

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.350
century bindings.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.860
But we're not taking,
we're not stripping.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.630
I know value's not necessarily
the right word because some

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.930
of them are really hideous.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.760
And there are so many of
those red and gold things.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.960
And we don't strip them off.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.710
I want to sort of look around
like what have we got here?

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.460
[Laughter] We've got a lot of
this with the library bindings.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.760
[Inaudible] Yeah, yeah.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.700
But there's a, I mean,
just, just this sort of-- .

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.820
I just don't like well, I don't
know what I would do with this

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.040
in 21st century and
21st century books.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.990
But the pause, what he did was
he opened up this moment for me

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.300
that I hadn't thought about.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.980
And I love it when, when
people can do that for me.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.520
And that was one of the things
I was struggling with newspaper.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.010
Looking at something
totally differently

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:46.310
than how I look at it.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.610
And seeing what comes out of it.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:48.910
And sometimes what comes
out of it is like, "Yep!

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.210
I was right."

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.910
And sometimes what comes
out of it is like, "Oh.

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.230
I need to go back and
revisit everything I did

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.180
because my [inaudible]
cards are embarrassing."

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.580
But that was not
really an answer.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.880
But it's a really good question.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.180
&gt;&gt; That was great.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.940
It's going forward,
and I appreciate that.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.550
&gt;&gt; Mark, and then I
don't know your name.

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:09.850
I'm sorry.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:11.150
&gt;&gt; This is a great talk.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.750
&gt;&gt; Thought-provoking

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.210
and I really appreciate
your discussions struggling

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:19.430
when you're trying to teach
to incorporate aspects

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:24.040
of this beyond the,
the object moment made.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.510
And then going on
to something else.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.990
Although it is very
hard at times.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:31.600
But one of the things I find
myself maybe sloppily dumping

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.920
into is women as market.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:39.530
Which seems to bring in more
of a broader interpretation.

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.010
And it's really a
19th century subject.

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:45.000
And we can do, we can talk only
about women for quite a while

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.740
in terms of what's [inaudible]
and what it appeals to and.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.680
Do you have thoughts about that?

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.380
&gt;&gt; I think that, I'm
thinking about women as users

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:59.350
of books is very
compelling and very,

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.610
and potentially really powerful.

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.860
In part because it gets at,

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.070
it gets at questions
of anonymity again.

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:10.350
And it can certainly
turn upside down.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:13.190
If people always want to believe

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:16.790
that any marketing book was
written by a famous person.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.560
Because I used to do this
assignment with my students.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.360
There's like you know
you had to study books',

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.880
books' usage through history.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.180
As they would look
at inscriptions.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.480
And you're like.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.080
And I would just be like
is it possible to figure

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.060
out who you know Jay
Doolittle is on it?

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.360
I don't know.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.660
Sort of like E. Dickinson.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.480
And they were like, "Wow,
this is Emily Dickinson."

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.230
No, weirdly there are a lot

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:40.140
of other E. Dickinsons
in the world."

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.350
[Laughter] Than that one.

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:47.130
But the ways in which
so it, it sort of.

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:50.280
I do think that it can
start to get at lives

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.090
that we don't necessarily see

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.520
when we're only looking
at the firsts.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.910
And the select fews.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:02.750
And I also opens up
categories of books

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:06.910
that we might not otherwise
be focusing on, right?

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.400
So we'll see books,
recipe books.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.520
Those are huge focus right now.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.990
Those are really interesting.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.780
And if we were still
only focused

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.750
on the high literary
canon, we'd be missing

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.670
that whole body of,
of knowledge.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:21.970
And it's, it's fun.

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.370
And that's part of
the direction that,

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.590
that Howsam goes
in in her piece.

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.550
From 20 years ago.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:28.850
Which I still find sort

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.450
of shocking how relevant
it is, right?

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:33.870
Right now still.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.170
You have a?

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.910
&gt;&gt; My question is kind of big.

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:45.370
But I wanted to bring it
back around to teaching.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:55.780
And how we can inflect these
kinds of feminist practices

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.900
into the classroom, you know.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.790
And we introduce these
ideas to [inaudible].

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.190
And I was just curious about
your essential thoughts

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.490
on implementing this
kind of approach

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:05.790
to book history with students.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.090
&gt;&gt; So one of the,
one of the things

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:08.390
that happened is I started
asking these questions.

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:09.690
I was like, "Oh, I actually kind
of have been teaching like this.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.280
So maybe that's it was
sort of reassuring to me."

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.980
Part of the context is this
course that I was teaching

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.200
on book history drew students
from different universities.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.500
So it was based at the Folger,

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.640
and there's no college
associated locally

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.940
with the Folger.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.300
So they come in from
different places.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.830
And they came in from
different fields.

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.150
Like some of them would be
like, "I'm majoring in German."

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.270
And it'd be like,
"I'm a biology major."

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.570
And, "I'm a classics major."

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:35.050
And then I would set them loose
and have them choose books.

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:38.710
And if you're 21 years
old and you've never been

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.380
in a rare books library.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.040
How, like what's
interesting to you?

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.550
We have random stuff!

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:44.850
Like some of them would be like,

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.150
"I've been reading
the Fairy Queen.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.450
So now I'm going to work
on this early edition

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:48.750
of the Fairy Queen."

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.050
I'd go, "Oh, god, okay."

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.290
It's a great poem, but
the book's like, you know,

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:53.700
that's a lot of pages.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.150
[Laughter] And other ones
would be like, "Here,

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:58.790
I pulled up this weird
treatise about math that's half

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.280
in Latin and half in English."

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.560
And I'd be like,
"I don't know what

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.920
that is and that's awesome!"

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.520
People would pull up almanacs.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.960
And so my, my point is
that for a lot of the books

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.130
that they chose that they wanted
to work on, I didn't know.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.140
I could not be the center of
knowledge in that classroom.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.160
What I could be is the
person who opens up the door.

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.670
And says, "Here's
questions to ask.

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:22.240
Here are places to go.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.970
Here are people who might
have the answers about this.

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.820
Here's how you can find
out what you're doing."

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.810
What is important to
know when you teach

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.970
like that is it's terrifying.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.810
Right? If you've been
trained to be the professor

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:41.290
at the front of the classroom.

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:43.230
You have been taught
in graduate school

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:44.690
that you are supposed
to be the expert.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.560
Right? And you walk in, you're
like, "I know everything.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.920
You are just going to sit there

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.220
and you're going
to listen to me."

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.520
And even if you've been
taught to sort of like,

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.820
"I'm going to run a seminar."

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.120
It's totally a fake seminar.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.870
In which you are guiding
the discussion, to an answer

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:58.210
that you already know that
you want them to believe.

00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:00.500
And this is a situation
where you can't do that.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.800
And they will ask.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.100
They would ask me
questions in class.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.950
I'd be like, I'm
sorry, I don't know!

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:10.000
We're going to have to look at
that and come back next week.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.490
And talk about it again
because I just-- .

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:14.810
And that's, I love it.

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:19.800
But it's, it's hard
to, it's hard to do.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.430
It's really, it's
super regarding.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:22.730
It's super rewarding.

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.150
It's way more fun because
what's the, what's the fun

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:25.610
in like getting people
to get to the answer

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.060
that you already know?

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:29.820
I think like after, you
know, after ten years,

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.560
it can be sort of boring.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.170
But there's all these
moments when they come

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:34.470
up with something unexpected.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:35.770
And you go, "Oh!

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:37.070
I never thought of
Tempest that way!"

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:40.590
But to, but to let them grow
as learners in front of you.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:44.260
And to teach you a new
things, super cool!

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:51.340
&gt;&gt; So I read somewhere when Ruth
Bader Ginsburg was asked what

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.300
would be the optimum number
of women on the Supreme Court,

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.130
she said, of course nine.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:59.440
So I wanted to hear
a little bit more

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.190
about your thing
about the hierarchy.

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.150
And that most women
are at the bottom.

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:06.450
Which I agree.

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:07.800
The more women study
but fewer people are

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.980
in positions of responsibility.

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:15.250
But do you see any change in
that in the last 25 years?

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:16.550
Or?

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:17.850
&gt;&gt; I have not tracked it.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.820
It's funny, just on the
Metro ride coming in,

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.360
Lady Science is the
name of the-- .

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.660
I don't know if you
guys know this.

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:25.960
Is the name of a,
it's like a blog.

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.710
It's an online magazine.

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.050
And they're really focused
on sort of like questions

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.930
about like science and gender.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.470
But they're having a
series at the moment

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:35.000
about libraries and gender.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.680
So they had just done
a post today sort

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:41.250
of about salary discreption
in libraries.

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.790
And they're saying it's not,

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:45.880
it's not about the,
it is still there.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.400
It doesn't seem to have
really gotten better.

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.970
In the last 20 years in that
it's, it's not about tech.

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:54.190
It's not just because
it's like men do the tech

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.960
and there are all these new
tech jobs in the library.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.640
That's why there's
a discrepancy.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.900
The author's conclusion
was it's baked

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.500
into the hierarchy of libraries.

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.160
It's a, I was like I
can't remember more.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.040
I don't know, google Lady
Science, maybe it'll come up?

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.180
It was not a good
reference librarian moment.

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.070
I just did right there.

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:16.410
Jenn just found it, yes!

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:19.090
The Pink Collar Library,
technology

00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:21.370
and the gender wage gap.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:25.340
From yes. December
13, that's today.

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:26.640
They just published it today.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.520
I, I did not hallucinate.

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.880
Jenn is the master of finding
links while you are talking.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.300
&gt;&gt; I really just
googled [inaudible].

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, so it worked!

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.260
That was a good reference
librarian moment!

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.560
So google it.

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.380
But it was interesting to think
about, especially in terms

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:45.160
of sort of like how-- that
question of how many is enough.

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.460
I just think to start with
that question is always going

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.680
to be limiting the
number of whoever it is

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.270
that we're talking about.

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.140
&gt;&gt; I think, I think Ruth
Bader Ginsburg's point was is

00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:00.100
that it was accepted it would be
nine men for you know 200 years.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.950
Why wouldn't we accept it
because it could be nine women?

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.290
&gt;&gt; Right. And part of the,
and then that, that has right,

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.110
like that's another
profession which is.

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:13.900
There are way more women in
law school than there are men.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.200
And that's been true
for a while now.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.770
Like it's, it's really turning
into, at least the student body.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.500
It's sort of like female.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.830
But look who our
partners is at law firms.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:25.870
Not that law firms are
necessarily the be-all

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:27.180
and end-all of of life.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.480
It's a structural problem
in lots of, lots of places.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.890
But the, that pink collar,

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.430
the lady science
article's interesting

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.430
for libraries to think about.

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:36.730
What is it that we're doing?

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.230
We're so well-intentioned.

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:43.330
How is it that library
conferences

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:45.830
and book history conferences
keep having conversations

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.500
about diversity?

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.730
How can we recognize that we
are not a very diverse field?

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.030
How can we get to
be more diverse?

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:53.810
We keep having the conversations
over and over and over again.

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:55.180
And yet look.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.480
The numbers aren't shifting.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.750
Last year RBMS.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.740
Last, last year our,
this past year.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.350
RBMS, some lecture gave a talk
where she showed the numbers.

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.580
We were like, oh well that's
great because we've worked

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.880
at it for like 20 years.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.180
And it move up one percent.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.940
I mean she really,
she just showed it.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.050
The whole room gasped.

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:16.570
There's something structural
that we need to sort of revisit.

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:22.480
How, what we are
imagining libraries do.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.740
Or history departments,
or whatever field it is

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.990
that we might be
coming from to this.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.290
Yeah.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.380
&gt;&gt; I won't ask the
last question.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.780
We have time for one more.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:43.100
So how do you, how do
you encounter the ways

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.090
in which sort of pick?

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.480
Pitch our whole presence

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.990
within the printing history
has suppressed our imagination

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:56.940
around how we engage
with books and texts?

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.510
And I'm thinking here of sort
of analogous relationship

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.390
between medicine and
midwifery, right?

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.600
I'm thinking the
ways in which gender,

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.990
sort of [inaudible] practice as
I've found in my own research,

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.450
has been very gendered.

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:15.460
I'm always seeing the image of a
fortune-teller as a, as a woman.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.140
And often a woman of color.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.270
So how do you think
that sort of plays in?

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.140
Not just in, in the
form of exclusion.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.440
But active suppression

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.330
around what we conceptualize
the book to be?

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:28.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's such
a good question.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:40.430
Well, where I, where I see it.

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:42.790
This in part goes
back a little bit to,

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.620
to Matt's question earlier.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:54.290
Is the ways in which
scholars describe

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:59.430
and acknowledged the work of
librarians and archivists.

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.220
Around what they do.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.080
So it happened again recently.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.880
It happens, you know with
pretty regularly, somebody.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.300
There's some article somewhere.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.620
And it says, "So-and-so
discovered this new thing!"

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.560
And you look into it you're
like well yeah, he discovered it

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.020
because the archivist
produced a finding aid,

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.320
and then you looked it up.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.650
Like that's not really
discovery.

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:20.270
That's following a path.

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:25.570
And good for you that you know
how to walk in a straight line.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:29.170
[Laughter] But I think
that there is something,

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.670
there is something
gendered about that.

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.090
The ways in which librarians

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:36.390
and archivists don't
get acknowledged.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:38.900
So if the, the standard
thing, if you, right?

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.960
Like I came, I got my
PhD a long time ago.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.200
I trained to be a
theater professor.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.890
Like, like I've spent
a lot of time waiting

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.590
for acknowledgements
in books right?

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.850
Probably a lot of us have
and you do the sort of,

01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:52.030
"Thank you to the Folger
Shakespeare Library

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.340
for funding me.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.600
And thank you to the Huntington,
thank you to whoever."

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.650
And you might name
Richard [inaudible].

01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:01.820
That was so many, that
was so, so long ago.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.780
You might name like
the head librarian.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.590
You might name you know for
sort of like helping you.

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:09.080
You might name the curator

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.780
for helping you understand
your things.

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.030
But do you, and then there might
be a time that's sort of like,

01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:16.370
"And the registrar was
always so friendly to me.

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:18.270
The person who welcomed
me in every day."

01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, now that
you mention it, yeah.

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.700
&gt;&gt; But do, but do
people thank the-- never!

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.770
&gt;&gt; I thank you by
name in my book.

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.770
&gt;&gt; You and all the, all
the central library staff

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:31.070
in the Folger.

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.370
Look it up.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.670
It says right there.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:34.970
Because I was, because
this is, it's a thing.

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:38.600
We can't find those book if they
haven't been bought by the folks

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.490
at acquisitions, if
they haven't been worked

01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:41.790
with by the curators.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:43.760
If they haven't been
catalogued by the cataloguers.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.110
We can't do that.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:48.780
And whether those people
are male or female,

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.110
the profession is
gendered female.

01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:53.300
It's that where I see--

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.600
and I see the same
thing happening with,

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.300
with digitization.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:00.250
In which we think of that
as being a male field.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.550
But nobody, nobody.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:04.570
You look, you look to
see digital images,

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.030
digital facsimiles of books.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.680
We're going to talk about this
later this summer when Dustin

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.980
and I do our panel together.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:14.140
Who's, who took the pictures?

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.400
Who the -- knows?

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.550
If it was outsourced
to [inaudible] people,

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.850
you might see some [inaudible].

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:26.040
But you don't see names.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.340
Even if it's inhouse.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.070
Even if it's, I just
talked with the Folger

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:30.370
because I know it so well.

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:34.800
Even if it's at the Folger which
has this very, for a long time.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.820
Super careful photography
and imaging lab.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.960
Very, like super-carefully
professionally carefully

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.410
slowly done.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:49.300
You might know the name
of the head of that lab.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.610
But you don't know
[inaudible] included in that.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:51.910
And definitely the people

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:54.080
who are taking the pictures
aren't included in that.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:58.410
So there's also suppression
there, that kind of labor.

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.930
&gt;&gt; Turn that around and
explain why they should be.

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:04.230
&gt;&gt; Why they should be there?

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:05.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:06.830
&gt;&gt; Well, so that we know
who printed the books

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:10.780
in early modern France
or early modern London.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.310
&gt;&gt; We know the publisher
or the print owner,

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:16.160
but we don't know
the names necessarily

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.360
of the type setters
and the, you know.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.750
&gt;&gt; So in, in the
stationers' company,

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.120
if it's in London,
you can go back.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.110
I mean, you can find who's
been apprentice to him.

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:29.580
You can, you can maybe
have a hope of recreating.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.040
You're right that we don't
always know the names

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.340
underneath it.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.000
But is the process sort
of tracing that through.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.340
Just like those, so
I've got two answers.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.350
Just like any compositor.

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:42.890
Or you know like
this is compositor E

01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:44.690
who was always drunk and
didn't know what he was doing.

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:47.330
And he misspelled
everything in the first folio

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:50.130
because he was an idiot.

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.760
What they so has an impact
on what we [inaudible].

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.060
And so maybe we want
to have a part of that.

01:06:56.060 --> 01:07:00.610
But I would also say that.

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:08.960
Libraries like to imagine
that they are bastions of-- .

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:13.590
Good, ethical decisions.

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:16.480
I can't think of what the
word is that I'm looking for.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.000
Like, like what, libraries and
librarians are magically good!

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.300
Is the thing that
drives me nuts.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.540
They're just inherently
fabulous people who understand,

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.040
who are always on the
right side of history.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.390
Which is of course idiotic.

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:29.580
Because we're just people.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.130
But there is part of
a way in which I think

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:35.700
if we are tasking
people to do that work.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.320
That their work should
be acknowledged.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.800
And it can either
be acknowledged

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.180
through decent money.

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.530
Or you can get credit
to your name.

01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:46.970
We don't have the money.

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:53.480
And I would also, what does it,
what does it cost us to sort

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.130
of like add that information?

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:59.240
We're not talking pages
and pages of paper

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.540
that we have to pay for.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.610
And the cost of paper
today is going up.

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:05.740
And it's a huge problem for
people who are publishing today.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.840
It's like, it adds nothing
to the file size of an image.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.760
I guess is what I'm
going to go with.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.540
So why not?

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.510
