00:00:00.672 --> 00:00:01.658
Ugh.

00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:03.953
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:06.756
&gt;&gt; Come on, nothing.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.334
Ugh, come on!

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:09.194
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:11.826
&gt;&gt; Nothing, you know what,
I just can't deal with this,

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:13.118
the buttons are too small.

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:15.512
So you know what,
I'm not going to buy these shoes,

00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:19.294
I just can't deal with typing my address
in one more time on this small screen.

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:22.092
&gt;&gt; Yeah
&gt;&gt; What website is it.

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:24.020
Yikes, they should do better.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.398
&gt;&gt; I know, okay, so
my phone isn't actually on.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:30.021
But this scene isn't all
that uncommon online.

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:31.880
It's hard to type on a small screen.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.686
So if it's hard to type the form
doesn't go through, and

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:36.328
then the user abandons the form.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:39.372
This is particularly sad,
if you're an online retailer and

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.575
you just missed a sale.

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:44.220
&gt;&gt; Right, we could leverage
to autocomplete attribute.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.134
It tells the browsers to automatically
fill the user's saved information into

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:49.654
a form.

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:51.454
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds pretty useful.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:53.810
&gt;&gt; It is, here let me show you how.
