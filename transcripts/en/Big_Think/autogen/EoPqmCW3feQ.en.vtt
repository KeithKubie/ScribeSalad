but valuing what you do I think it's so
 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.830
but valuing what you do I think it's so
easy to diminish what you can do

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840
easy to diminish what you can do
 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.059

themselves a leader and I think host is
such an interesting word because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
such an interesting word because
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.280
such an interesting word because
inherent in that word is the work right

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290
inherent in that word is the work right
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.160
inherent in that word is the work right
