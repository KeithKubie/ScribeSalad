guns no guns it doesn't matter you have

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870
guns no guns it doesn't matter you have
 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.019
guns no guns it doesn't matter you have
people that are mentally ill and they're

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029
people that are mentally ill and they're
 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.400
people that are mentally ill and they're
going to come through the cracks and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
going to come through the cracks and
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.379
going to come through the cracks and
they're going to do things that people

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
they're going to do things that people
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:21.310
they're going to do things that people
will not even believe are possible

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320
 
 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.840
 
many of these shootings we have people

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
many of these shootings we have people
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.080
many of these shootings we have people
who have mental disturbances we know

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
who have mental disturbances we know
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.460
who have mental disturbances we know
that most of these people are mentally

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
that most of these people are mentally
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.529
that most of these people are mentally
deranged so do we need to do a better

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
deranged so do we need to do a better
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:46.420
deranged so do we need to do a better
job in mental health you bet we do

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430
 
 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.010
 
mental people are far likely to be the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
mental people are far likely to be the
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.050
mental people are far likely to be the
victims of violence rather than the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060
victims of violence rather than the
 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.720
victims of violence rather than the
perpetrators so the fact we tend to only

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
perpetrators so the fact we tend to only
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160
perpetrators so the fact we tend to only
discuss mental health in a mass shooting

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
discuss mental health in a mass shooting
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:09.970
discuss mental health in a mass shooting
context is deeply misleading

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980
 
 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.130
 
we are not the only country on Earth

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
we are not the only country on Earth
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.460
we are not the only country on Earth
that has people with mental illnesses or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
that has people with mental illnesses or
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.980
that has people with mental illnesses or
want to do harm to other people we are

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
want to do harm to other people we are
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660
want to do harm to other people we are
the only advanced country on Earth that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
the only advanced country on Earth that
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.470
the only advanced country on Earth that
sees these kinds of mass shootings every

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480
sees these kinds of mass shootings every
 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:33.590
sees these kinds of mass shootings every
few months

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
