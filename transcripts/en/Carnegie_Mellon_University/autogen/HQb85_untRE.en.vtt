00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.370
the school of design at Carnegie Mellon

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380
the school of design at Carnegie Mellon
 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.100
the school of design at Carnegie Mellon
is very humanistic design program how do

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110
is very humanistic design program how do
 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.630
is very humanistic design program how do
we make people's lives better when

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640
we make people's lives better when

and they learn kind of that rich
 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.460
and they learn kind of that rich
tradition of design I really wanted to

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470
tradition of design I really wanted to
 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.810
tradition of design I really wanted to
get a feel for what it would be like and

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820
get a feel for what it would be like and
 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.850
get a feel for what it would be like and
also I think it's different because it's

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860
also I think it's different because it's
 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.249
also I think it's different because it's
not a it's not an art school you know

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259
not a it's not an art school you know
 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.650
not a it's not an art school you know
and so you get a little bit more of a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660
and so you get a little bit more of a
 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.319
and so you get a little bit more of a
technical feel that was so cool because

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329
technical feel that was so cool because
 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.990
technical feel that was so cool because
it was like it you even in the first

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000
it was like it you even in the first
 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.150
it was like it you even in the first
