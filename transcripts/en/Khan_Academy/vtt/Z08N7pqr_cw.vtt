00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.262
- [Voiceover] Hey, Becca.

00:00:01.262 --> 00:00:02.293
- [Voiceover] Hi, Kim.

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:03.745
- [Voiceover] Alright, so
we're here to talk about

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:05.316
Uncle Tom's Cabin, and I think this is

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:08.508
such an interesting book
because when Abraham Lincoln

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.291
met Harriet Beecher Stowe, he said to her,

00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:14.735
"So you're the little lady
that started this great war."

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:18.220
He said Uncle Tom's Cabin
actually started the Civil War.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.425
So how does a book start a war?

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:22.731
- [Voiceover] I think that's
a really good question, Kim,

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.472
and these next two
videos are gonna help us

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:27.194
understand a little bit
more why Lincoln said that.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.477
How does a little book start a war?

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:31.744
So this book was written
by Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:33.327
here she is, Stowe,

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:35.657
and Harriet Beecher Stowe was born

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:38.652
in Litchfield, Connecticut to this kind of

00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:40.552
great abolitionist family.

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:42.379
So what's abolitionism, Kim?

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.192
- [Voiceover] Well
abolitionism was the belief

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:47.832
in mostly in the early 19th century

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:51.187
that slavery should be ended immediately.

00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:53.914
So there were varieties of beliefs

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:57.143
about the institution of
slavery in early America.

00:00:57.143 --> 00:00:59.365
Some people obviously
were very pro-slavery

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:02.434
believe that it was a natural institution

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:04.201
sanctioned by the Bible.

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.472
Some people, like Abraham Lincoln,

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:08.408
at least early in his political career,

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:10.604
just wanted slavery to stay where it was,

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:13.593
and those were what we
would call free-soilers,

00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:16.148
or anti-slavery advocates.

00:01:16.148 --> 00:01:17.826
They said, "Alright, we
can't get rid of slavery

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.082
"in the South.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.401
"It's too entrenched
there as an institution,

00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:25.020
"but we can make sure
that it does not spread

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.124
"to any of the Western territories

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:29.411
"that we might settle in the future."

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:34.272
But abolitionists were these
strongest opponents of slavery.

00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:38.590
They said that slavery
should be ended today

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.876
everywhere in the United
States and the world,

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:46.043
and that it is an immoral,
un-Christian institution.

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:50.552
So these Western territories
were a really big part

00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:54.117
of the increasing tension
over the institution

00:01:54.117 --> 00:01:56.344
of slavery in the 1850s.

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:59.272
So in 1848, the United States won

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:02.603
the Mexican-American War
and they got a whole bunch

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:05.861
of new territory that
had once been Mexico,

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:09.151
and these will become the states of Texas,

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:12.132
and Oklahoma, and many of the sort of

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.743
Midwestern states we have today,

00:02:14.743 --> 00:02:18.029
but this now threatened
the balance of power

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.706
between those slave-holding
states in US Congress

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:24.036
and those that were free states,

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:26.702
so now everyone is wondering is slavery

00:02:26.702 --> 00:02:28.436
going to spread to the West?

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:30.525
Should slavery spread to the West?

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.781
- [Voiceover] And this
kind of anxiety about

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.256
the Western expansion of
slavery was more tense

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.476
and became more sectionally divided

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:41.508
after the Compromise of 1850.

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:45.894
So the Compromise of 1850
happened right here in 1850,

00:02:45.894 --> 00:02:47.227
(laughter)

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:50.324
and the Compromise of
1850, I like to think of it

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.892
kind of like a band-aid
over this sectional tension,

00:02:53.892 --> 00:02:55.407
so I'll draw you guys a little band-aid.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.981
- [Voiceover] This is like
a gaping wound, right,

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.382
and the Compromise of 1850 is just like

00:03:00.382 --> 00:03:02.135
this tiny, little band-aid that's kind of

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:05.359
holding this dam together
to mix my metaphors.

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.536
- [Voiceover] The Compromise of 1850

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:09.588
actually admitted
California as a free state,

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.349
which was a really big win
for the North, obviously.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.212
- [Voiceover] Right, lots of gold.

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:15.428
- [Voiceover] But it
also had a really strong

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.821
Fugitive Slave Act, so this was a really

00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:21.645
kind of critical part of
the Compromise of 1850,

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:24.093
and this was a big win for the South.

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:26.127
So why was it a big win?

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:27.895
- [Voiceover] Well the Fugitive Slave Act

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:31.139
said that if a marshal was in your town

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.893
requesting your help in
rounding up an escaped slave,

00:03:34.893 --> 00:03:38.904
you had to help that marshal
or face charges yourself.

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:41.684
So this meant that any time that someone

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:45.525
who was enslaved in the South
made a run for the North,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.927
a run for Canada as many
of the enslaved people did,

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:52.186
anyone in the North might be drafted

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:54.883
to help return that person to the South.

00:03:54.883 --> 00:03:55.813
- [Voiceover] And if they didn't,

00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:58.332
they were oftentimes
fined, and this really made

00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:01.300
all Northerners participatory in slavery,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.786
even if they weren't
slaveholders themselves

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:05.871
or living on a plantation in the South,

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.466
Northerners were participating in the way

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:12.134
that slavery was held
together by disallowing

00:04:12.134 --> 00:04:14.752
runaway slaves from continuing their lives

00:04:14.752 --> 00:04:16.443
in free territories.

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:17.875
- [Voiceover] So you could imagine how

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:21.068
this might really galvanize
a Northern audience

00:04:21.068 --> 00:04:23.673
into action about slavery because before,

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:26.649
you might think, "Well,
I don't like slavery,

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.418
"but what does it have
to do with me, right?

00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:32.755
"I'm just a grain miller
living in Pennsylvania.

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:33.970
"None of my business.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.554
"I don't like it, but I
can't do anything about it,

00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:38.296
"and it's not my fault."

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:41.431
Now all of a sudden, if an escaped slave

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:46.117
comes past your house and a
marshal follows him or her,

00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:49.323
now you've got to be a person
to round that person up,

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:51.871
and so that means you have to participate

00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:54.190
in slavery directly, and so you might find

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.638
yourself thinking, "You know
what, I refuse to do that,

00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:59.337
"and that means that I
really do hate slavery."

00:04:59.337 --> 00:05:01.092
- [Voiceover] And this was
definitely the sentiment

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:05.074
that Stowe and her family had
on the Underground Railroad.

00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:08.246
So Stowe lived on a stop in
the Underground Railroad,

00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:11.199
and that was this passageway
for Southern slaves

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.259
to get to the North, and
Stowe and her husband

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.187
actually helped a lot of runaway slaves.

00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:17.488
- [Voiceover] So the Underground Railroad

00:05:17.488 --> 00:05:19.419
wasn't like a literal railroad, right?

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.896
I mean that would be pretty sweet

00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:24.298
if there were a railroad
that went under the ground

00:05:24.298 --> 00:05:26.107
all the way up to Canada,
but it was more like

00:05:26.107 --> 00:05:29.405
a sort of an informal network of people

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:32.140
who might help escaped slaves, direct them

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.378
to food and shelter, and
just kind of send them

00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:38.026
along to the next waypost on their trip,

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:39.764
either to the North or to Canada.

00:05:39.764 --> 00:05:41.659
- [Voiceover] And so when
the Fugitive Slave Act

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.012
was passed with the Compromise of 1850,

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:47.356
the band-aid, this really
upset Harriet Beecher Stowe

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:49.435
and really was one of the main catalysts

00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:51.389
for her writing this book.

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.073
She also witnessed a slave auction,

00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:55.376
and this Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote about

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:58.587
as just this terrible kind of scene

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:00.774
of a family being just torn apart,

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:03.486
and this was a really common
practice within slavery,

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:06.181
that the unit of the
family was not respected

00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:09.327
as slaveholders wanted
to sell their slaves

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.147
to different plantations
throughout the South,

00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:15.213
and the slave auction
really became the basis

00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:17.661
for the plot of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.794
- [Voiceover] Slave auctions
were absolutely terrible.

00:06:20.794 --> 00:06:24.044
In fact, not long before the Civil War,

00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:29.016
the main slave auction
site in Washington, D.C.

00:06:29.016 --> 00:06:31.155
was just around the corner
from the White House,

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:34.933
so imagine walking down the thoroughfare

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:39.166
of this great democracy,
seeing the president's house,

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.372
the seat of government,
and then turning a corner

00:06:41.372 --> 00:06:44.711
and seeing people being
sold off the block.

00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:46.971
You know Abraham Lincoln
saw a slave auction

00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.503
in New Orleans and he said
it was one of the things

00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:52.816
that most influenced him to hate slavery,

00:06:52.816 --> 00:06:55.579
just witnessing these
families being torn apart.

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.928
And imagine either watching
a mother being sold

00:06:59.928 --> 00:07:03.885
away from her infant
children, or being that mother

00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:05.135
wondering what it would be like

00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:07.395
if you're ever going to see them again.

00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:08.970
- [Voiceover] I think that's
a really important point

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.459
just to show that this was something

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:12.517
that was happening all
around the United States

00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:15.432
and this was just abolitionist
fervor was bubbling up,

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:19.059
and then in 1852, when
this book was published,

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:21.965
it really set into motion this new wave

00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:25.061
of political rhetoric, and other novels,

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:27.943
and just a lot of talk
about these fundamental

00:07:27.943 --> 00:07:32.592
contradictions between
Christianity and human bondage.

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:34.178
- [Voiceover] And we'll get
to that in the next video.
