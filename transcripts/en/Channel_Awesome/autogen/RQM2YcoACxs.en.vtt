00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.160
a big part of that is that the jokes did
not seem as character-driven there is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
not seem as character-driven there is
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.170

distinct separate identities they're all
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.070
distinct separate identities they're all
kind of there to make some of these

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080
kind of there to make some of these
 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.430
kind of there to make some of these
other jokes work or not work um but I'll

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
other jokes work or not work um but I'll
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.229
other jokes work or not work um but I'll
get to my biggest problem with this

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239
get to my biggest problem with this
 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.690
get to my biggest problem with this
movie is that as someone that loves

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
movie is that as someone that loves
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.880
movie is that as someone that loves
animation well I loved about the first

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890
animation well I loved about the first
 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.980
animation well I loved about the first
two Hotel Transylvania films is that the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990
two Hotel Transylvania films is that the
 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.350
two Hotel Transylvania films is that the
animation did have a lot of energy to it

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
animation did have a lot of energy to it
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.290
animation did have a lot of energy to it
but every character had a distinct kind

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300
but every character had a distinct kind
 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.909
but every character had a distinct kind
of movement and I think there's a

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919
of movement and I think there's a
 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.629
of movement and I think there's a
difference between a style and just

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639
difference between a style and just
 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.159
difference between a style and just
doing the exact same thing for everybody

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
doing the exact same thing for everybody
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.230

guy and he's he has a distinct movement
 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.950
guy and he's he has a distinct movement
cuz he says were a little robot but even

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960
cuz he says were a little robot but even
 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.840
cuz he says were a little robot but even
he kind of does the same movements the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850
he kind of does the same movements the
 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.750

more thing about it uh but she just kind

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760
more thing about it uh but she just kind
 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.670
more thing about it uh but she just kind
of moves like how everyone else moves it

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680
of moves like how everyone else moves it
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.940
of moves like how everyone else moves it
and I think what real one of the things

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950
and I think what real one of the things
 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.260
and I think what real one of the things
that really drew me to the other films

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270
that really drew me to the other films
 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.580
that really drew me to the other films
is that even though again they're not

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590
is that even though again they're not
 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.980
is that even though again they're not
like phenomenally character driven but I

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990
like phenomenally character driven but I
 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.510
like phenomenally character driven but I
mean they're that's still kind of the

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520
mean they're that's still kind of the
 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.220
mean they're that's still kind of the
focus everyone has their own distinct

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230
focus everyone has their own distinct
 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.470
focus everyone has their own distinct
identity and movement and it's really

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480
identity and movement and it's really
 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.570
identity and movement and it's really
all blending together here and I think

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580
all blending together here and I think
 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.790
all blending together here and I think
that's surprisingly what made a lot of

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800
that's surprisingly what made a lot of
 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.100
that's surprisingly what made a lot of
those jokes work in the first two films

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110
those jokes work in the first two films
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.410
those jokes work in the first two films
even though not all of them work it's

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:42.420
even though not all of them work it's
 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.720
even though not all of them work it's
still what gave it its charm and I think

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:44.730
still what gave it its charm and I think
 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.920
still what gave it its charm and I think
that's kind of what's missing here a lot

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:45.930
that's kind of what's missing here a lot
 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.680
that's kind of what's missing here a lot
of the charm is gone and it's not

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690
of the charm is gone and it's not
 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.080
of the charm is gone and it's not
replaced with comedy funny enough to
