00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.170
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop. Having a fireplace in your house can be really great

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.159
But if you don't have one, getting one installed can cost thousands of dollars. In our last video

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.059
we showed you how to build the body of this fireplace and today we're going to be finishing it up

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.179
So it looks like it's made of authentic brick and wood to make the bricks.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.840
We'll be using this wood grained contact paper

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.859
Most of the outside of the fireplace is going to be covered in the bricks made from these foam sheets

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.329
So let's get slicing! each of these foam sheets is 12 inches wide and 18 inches long.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.500
So let's cut it into eighteen bricks. That are six inches long and two inches wide

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.949
There you go, you can see we get quite a few bricks out of one sheet,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.139
which is good because we have a lot of fireplace to cover.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.779
There you have it, we've now cut up eight of those sheets of foam into bricks

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.780
So it's time to start applying them to our fireplace.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.619
Update you can now see that we have covered the whole front of our fireplace in our foam bricks for the most part

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:39.979
It's pretty basic,

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.639
we started just by putting this arch over the curved part of the opening of the fireplace

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.769
and then everything else kind of got built around that. We have a little bit of a staggered pattern of the whole bricks and the

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:49.260
partial bricks on the sides. For the partial bricks

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.040
I just lined up approximately where the next brick should be and cut it off with a pair of scissors

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.399
I did the same thing with these small

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.038
weirdly shaped pieces where they intersect with the curves or angled bits on the archway.  You can see I've got these pieces here and here

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.279
that I had to sort of custom shape. It's pretty easy to do, you lay it down

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.049
draw about where it should be cut with a pen cut it out if it fits great if it doesn't cut more if you cut

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.959
It too much get a new one now at the front of our fireplace bricked-up

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.549
I'm gonna move on to the sides and do the same thing there one thing to note is these small pieces of foam that are

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.780
Acting as the ends of bricks

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.410
I'm going to try and line those up

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.859
With full-length bricks on the sides so that it looks like the edge of a brick actually set into a fireplace

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.219
There we have it, we've now bricked up the front and the sides of our fireplace

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.690
And I have to say I think it's looking pretty good. So the next step is to paint it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.899
We did use the red and brown sort of British colors for the foam

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.419
But we are going to cover almost all of that color

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.899
So you can really use whatever colors a foam that you want now this foam has a very open and porous surface on it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.610
Which means that it doesn't always take paint very well at first it will sort of drink in the colour

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.169
And you'll lose a lot of what you try to apply to it so before we add any paint to it

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.809
we're going to take a heat gun and go over this whole thing the heat will actually make the cells on the phone sort of

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.429
Close up, and it will give a smoother shiny texture, which will take our paint a lot better

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.239
I also want to point out that I ended up with a lot of leftover bricks in fact

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.999
I have over two whole sheets worth of these bricks

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.009
And I used eight to make this which means you could probably get away. Just fine with only using six

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.340
As

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.280
you can probably see it doesn't take a lot of time on any one piece of foam you can keep moving fairly quickly

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.150
The foam is now fairly sealed and should take paint pretty well there may be some people out there very familiar with this craft foam

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.160
Who might suggest a few other steps using evey a glue and some Plasti Dip to get a really nice

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.079
Sealed coating on this foam but for our purposes. Just the heat gun should be enough the last step

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.639
We're gonna take before we add paint is I'm going to use the hot glue gun to fill in a few of the gaps where

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.640
the edges of the bricks meet

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.830
There we go our bricks are attached

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.880
They're sealed and we got gaps filled so now let's go over it with some paint and the first kind of paint

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.309
I'm going to use is this stone textured spray paint

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.980
It's really going to help give our bricks a much more realistic

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.739
Texture this stone textured spray paint is a little more expensive than most spray paint it costs about 10 bucks at Walmart

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.459
We've added a stone texture spray to the bricks

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.870
And I really like how it's looking but this stuff can take a few hours to dry so now we need to let it sit

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.179
Until it's safe to handle well the textured paint is drying. Let's make our mantelpiece look like it's actually made out of wood

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.930
We've got this wood grain contact paper, which is kind of like a roll of tape

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.120
That's 18 inches wide and 20 feet long

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.739
I'm using this color of wood grain because it was available at Home Depot for about 15 bucks if you look online

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.199
There are probably a lot of other colors or patterns if you prefer that what we want to do is measure a piece

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.330
That's long enough to cover our whole mantel cut that off then peel off the backing on this sticker paper

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.260
And then attach it over the whole thing at once

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.730
I've got a little bit of a wrinkled edge here, so I'm first just gonna trim that off

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.920
So I have a nice straight edge there we go

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.580
I want it for you long enough to reach all the way across the mantel down the edge

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.699
And then overlap just about an inch or so on the bottom. I'm gonna give myself some extra. I've got about four inches here

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.550
I'd probably only need two and a half or so inches, but I'm gonna give myself

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.880
margin of error same thing on this side

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.949
Well snip to measure that and then the back of the contact paper

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.150
Has gridlines all over it so it's easy to follow making sure you're getting a nice straight line

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.840
If you're looking for where to buy this stuff. It's usually called shelf liner

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.739
It's designed to put on the inside of shelves to make them look like they're a little more

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.069
Fancy and less just plain particle board or something now

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.710
We need to do is peel off the backing to this strip of contact paper without getting it all wrinkled up remember

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.139
This is basically a giant piece of tape at this point

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.919
So I just have to make sure it doesn't stick to itself and get too wrinkled now

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.030
We're gonna want this attached to our board to try and make it go on nice and evenly

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.500
We can't just flip it upside down and press it on that does seem like it'd be the easiest way

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.859
But I've tried that and it never goes on really nice and smooth

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.759
So we do have to do something a little more careful than that so to start

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.450
Let's take our mantel piece and fit it I'm not gonna put it right in the center

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.000
I'm gonna put it a little farther toward the back because the back

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.699
Doesn't really need to be perfectly lined our fireplace is going to be sitting up against a wall if that doesn't have quite enough

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.830
Coverage or anything like that. It won't be a big

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.459
So overlapping just by about an inch and trying to keep it nice and straight so that our contact paper will go over it straight

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.280
and to attach this

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.370
Down onto the paper

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.249
See that it's sticking to it like I said

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.509
It's basically tape so now what we're gonna try and do is lift it up and start laying it down

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.389
Over the top of our mantle one bit at a time

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.429
You can now see what it's supposed to look like

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.199
We now have our contact paper stretched out all the way across our mantle as you can see it like I said there would be

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.150
There are some bubbles and some slight wrinkles

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.209
But we can actually get most of those out just by carefully pressing them down if we're able to push the bubble to an edge

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.199
Then all of the air can easily escape and we can usually get rid of it entirely

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.260
If you have any bubbles that are in the middle of your board

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.760
And you just can't get rid of them completely the air is probably stuck and can't escape

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.969
What we need to do is take a sharp razor blade or a pin and poke a very small hole in part of the bubble

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.749
This should allow all of the air to escape and your bubble to disappear

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.460
There we go our contact paper is now

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.859
Nicely secured to the top of our mantle let's turn off the excess and attach it to the sides

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.690
And see here's one edge

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.640
I want it to reach down to the bottom of the mantle and then maybe about an inch on the bottom to wrap around

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.859
So let's cut off our extra about here

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.940
We'll want the contact paper to wrap around the front of our mantle and the side

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.780
But this corner piece is just gonna get in our way

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.100
So let's try and cut that out

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.129
We're gonna cut lines into our contact paper lined up with the front edge and the side edge of the mantle

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.619
Now let's pull our rap fairly tight over the edge and

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.189
Rap it down over the bottom of the mantle

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.829
We can see that even though I trimmed the sheet there's a little bit of overlap on to the front

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.730
That's alright that will help prevent there being any gap in between the front and the side

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.340
So we're just going to put a little slit right here

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.280
So these will fold down evenly and then they'll get covered by our front sheet

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:17.749
Now just to take out a few more wrinkles and spots where it's not quite even I'm going to lightly go over the contact paper

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.909
With the low heat setting on the heat gun

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.210
With the wood print attached to our mantle

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.659
We're now ready to move back to the body of our fireplace and finish with the paint job

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.500
I'm going with this sort of darker red the color on the can is colonial red

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.700
And I think it makes a really good sort of faded brick look. I've got three colors of paint

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.239
I'm gonna be using the red that I already pointed out is going to be my primary brick color

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.979
I have a little bit of this caramel color that I'm going to be using on the inside of the fireplace to give it that

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.520
Sort of fire brick look and then I've got black which I'm gonna lay down everywhere

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.129
That should be pretty covered with soot on the inside of the fireplace

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.950
There we go our fireplace is now looking a lovely brick shade of red however real bricks are very rarely one smooth uniform color

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.670
So to make it look a little more realistic

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:24.170
Let's take a few different colors of acrylic paint some crumpled up paper and sort of sponge paint that on all over to give it

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.170
a more mottled look

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:52.799
Using just a little bit of acrylic paint and a paintbrush

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.390
I added mortar into all of the gaps between the bricks and that really makes it pop

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:03.179
I think now the bricks look like bricks instead of just like a red textured wall so I love doing that part

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.739
We've only got one step left before we permanently attach our mantel on top and finish our fireplace

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:13.139
That's to take our black spray-paint and go over and just add a little bit of built-up soot onto our fireplace

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.890
Beautiful be

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:40.089
Beautiful love adding weathering to stuff mmm something looks so good like it looks good before and then you add weathering and you're like BAM

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.950
It's perfect

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.749
Now all we need to do is attach our mantle and our fireplace will be complete

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.990
To attach this we're gonna use the hot glue gun again and to start

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:55.269
I'm just gonna put two little points of glue on the very back that will hold it in place so that when I put the

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.470
Bead down on the front. I know it's not going to shift forward backward or sideways at all

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.410
There you go mantle piece attached you can see you can lift the whole fireplace up by the mantel I

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.040
Mean it only weighs like this whole thing is probably like

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.360
six pounds

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:28.209
Maybe I don't know it's very lightweight for a whole fireplace of course. Yeah, mantel attached looks like wood the bricks look like brick

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.290
Fantastic this thing makes such a cool decorative piece, but to finish it off

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.579
There's one more thing it needs and that's a fire in the fireplace of course

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.420
We don't want a real fire this thing's made of foam it will melt and burn and fall apart and smell terrible

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.730
We can't have that so we have a good substitute. Yeah there we go a

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.550
Nice log fire to go in our fireplace

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:59.020
This is a neat little artificial log fireplace setup that is actually also a heater. It puts out real heat, so you can have

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.869
Fireplace with a fire and heat all coming from one spot. It's pretty cool now to make this work

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.760
There is a cord that comes off of our fire

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.950
And we need to be able to get that to an outlet

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.869
So let's cut just a small hole in the bottom of the back of our fireplace so the cord has a place to get out

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.259
Beautiful

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:35.558
That is so great now. It's like a real functional fireplace. You've got the nice warm glow

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.860
You've got the look of the flames in the background. You've got the warmth coming off of it everything you could need from a fireplace

00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:43.329
There you have it now

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:46.539
You're all prepared to relax by your own homemade fireplace

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:51.519
If it happens to be near Christmas time your homemade fireplace can be the perfect spot to hang some stockings

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.199
That was a real fire

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.659
You would really not want that stocking to hang that low

00:13:55.759 --> 00:14:01.118
But that's all right this isn't gonna catch your stockings on fire there you have it how to build your very own brick fireplace

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:06.279
It's way lower cost and takes a lot less time than putting in a real one there are of course some

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:12.609
Limitations like no real fire in your fireplace, and there's a limit to how much weight you can put on top of it

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.529
But it really does a good job of looking like a fireplace. I love having one of these things

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.239
Thanks for joining us for this video and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at the king of random

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:24.369
Calm see you there you

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:29.589
Can cut right through bricks with a razor blade, it's amazing it hit you in your face. It wouldn't even hurt

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.420
You
