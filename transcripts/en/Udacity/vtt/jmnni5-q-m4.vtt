00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.000
So now it's time we zoom out just a bit

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.050
more on Kate's family pedigree of lactose intolerance. And hopefully you

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.560
realize now we're looking at a pedigree for a recessive

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.120
trait. This is what a recessive pedigree looks like. And let's

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.500
see if we can write down a couple of things

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
that we definitely know from the pedigree. Remember we might switch

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.160
back and forth between using these two different types of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.510
symbols. The thymine cytosine DNA letter alleles versus the plus minus

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.300
symbols indicating lactase persistence on the top and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.470
lactase nonpersistence on the bottom. Now in our pedigree,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020
we know that everybody who is affected is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.708
shaded in. And they must be recessive. Homozygous recessive.

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.820
Every individual that's shaded in this pedigree must

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.540
be minus minus or c c. Based on what

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.550
we've learned so far, we know that this must be true. Now let's take a look at

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.900
Kate's parents here. Kate is effective. We know she's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.300
minus, minus. Each parent had to give her one of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.170
their own alleles. This means one of her minuses had

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.730
to come from mom and one of her minuses had

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.620
to come from dad. But the question is what's

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.800
the other allele? And we already know the answer, mom

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.600
and dad are unaffected. If mom and dad are unaffected,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.170
that means their other allele has to be a plus,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.100
because if it was a minus then both mom and

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.430
dad would also be affected and you'd see them shaded

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.230
in as well. But they're not, we know they're not

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.250
affected. This information about trait has been able to inform us

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
about what their possible genotype is. This is what makes

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.190
categories so amazing. We know immediately what Kate's genotype must be.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.480
We know what her parents' genotypes must be. But now,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.800
let's look at her brother. We know her brother's not effected,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.290
so he could be either plus plus or plus minus

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.890
and actually the problem here is all we know is that

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.950
he has one plus. He could be plus, plus right?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.090
He could have gotten a plus from each parent or he

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.780
could have gotten a plus from one parent and a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.560
minus from another parent. We don't know. So that's actually still

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.350
an unknown variable for us right now. It's something we

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.930
can't determine from the pedigree. This is one of our limits.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.900
Now there's another really amazing pattern that this

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.960
pedigree reveals to us. We learned earlier, that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.190
the trait itself of lactose intolerance, skips generations.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.950
Kate's maternal grandfather is affected by lactose intolerance.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.810
Her mother is not, but then Kate is.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.350
The trait skipped a generation. But now look

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.970
at the genotypes. We know her grandfather must

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.900
be minus minus, her mother must be minus plus,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.240
and she is also minus minus. That

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.840
minus allele traveled from here grandfather to her

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.550
mother to her. So although her mother doesn't

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.120
show the trait, one of the alleles that

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.700
contribuets to the trait that Kate has

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.960
Was passed from her grandfather to her mother

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400
to her. So for a recessive trait like

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.440
lactose intolerance, using the information from the pedigree

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.400
that we've been discussing, which of the following items

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.370
are true. Now this can be a very tricky problem.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.000
I do not want you to be intimidated. But I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.910
do want you to take your time and think about

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.470
it. These are check-boxes, which means there are lots

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.580
of possible combinations here. I want you to see if

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.320
you can figure out which of these items are true

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.920
and check any and all boxes that you think apply.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.860
Now if you get frustrated, don't worry. Go to the discussion forums. See if

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.400
you can get some other hints about how to figure this out. And if you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.780
really think it'll be helpful go ahead and skip ahead to the solution video but

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.720
please, please try and think about this one and answer it on your own first.
