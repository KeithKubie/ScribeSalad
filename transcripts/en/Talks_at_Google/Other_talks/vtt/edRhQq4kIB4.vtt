&gt;&gt; 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.700
Hi. There it is. Okay.
Welcome to today's event.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.220
On behalf of Authors at Google and Women at
Google, it is my privilege to introduce Jennifer

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.890
Jordan.
Jennifer is an award-winning filmmaker and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.680
author.
Her film, "Women of K2", will be screened

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.059
tonight at 6:15, at the Mountain View Center
for the Performing Arts, as part of the Mountain

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.140
View Reads Together program, which is featuring
the book, Three Cups of Tea.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.050
Jennifer is here to talk about her book "Savage
Summit", the true stories of the first five

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.250
women who climbed K2, the world's most feared
mountain.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.620
She twice lived at the base of K2 while writing
and researching her book, which won the National

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.020
Outdoor Book Award in 2005.
Following the talk, we'll have a Q and A session,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.400
and I ask you to please use the microphone
for a remote audience.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:03.000
And now, please join me in welcoming Jennifer
Jordan.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.189
Jennifer Jordan: Thank you so much.
Taking time out -- well, I was going to say

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.680
"taking time out of your busy day," but you
brought your busy day with you.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000
We -- in Salt Lake, we don't take our computers
everywhere.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.810
So it's fun to see you always connected.
It's great to be here.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.350
I love coming to California, because I get
that much closer to the ocean.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.530
Coming from -- I lived in Boston for years
until I moved out to Salt Lake seven years

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.829
ago.
So it's wonderful to be back within arm's

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.590
breadth.
People ask me a lot whether I've climbed K2,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.759
and I always say you know, "Have you seen
the thing? Are you kidding me? I'm not about

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.159
to climb that mountain."
I came to high-altitude mountaineering quite

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.990
innocently.
I was anchoring NPR's "All Things Considered"

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.740
in Boston, in May of 1996, when I heard that
eight people had died on Everest in a single

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.029
day.
And I knew probably next to nothing about

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:14.671
high-altitude climbing, but I knew that the
high-altitude mountaineering had changed in

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:19.540
those deaths -- had changed forever, with
that many people dying.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.500
And, with many of them being experienced guides
and some of the world's best climbers who

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.560
were part of the toll.
And the world reacted with shock and many

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.019
questions.
And many questioned, "Why would anybody risk

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.810
so much for a mountain?"
But it was really the women who fascinated

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.319
me.
Because, I can almost understand a man's drive

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.890
 -- almost.
After all, they are the ones with the hunting

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.689
instinct and not a small measure of testosterone.
And, "But what on earth" I thought, "explained

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.040
women's desires to risk their lives in the
unrelenting world of high altitude?"

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.430
After all, I'm a woman. I love the outdoors.
I love a good challenge.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.230
But I don't love any of them enough to risk
my life to get there.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.930
And most women seem to agree with me.
In fact, only five percent of Himalayan climbing

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.969
 -- the population -- is female.
And by 'Himalayan', I mean, those 14 peaks

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.290
that stand above 8,000 meters that are scattered
through Nepal, Tibet, and Pakistan.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.109
But that still leaves five percent who are
willing to enter this grueling and perilous

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.799
sport.
Why? The questions that I heard came from

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.469
all different, you know, areas of my research.
And I heard you know, "Because we're all adrenaline

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.640
junkies."
To, "It's a life-changing experience to stand

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.999
at the top of the world." Never, by the way,
have I heard, "Because it's there."

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.859
You know, I don't think there is really any
one answer.

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.630
I think that the same way that there's no
one answer to being why a parent makes someone

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.790
feel more alive, and why you love that person
over there and not that person over there.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.790
I think it's who you are and who you want
to be.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.290
And it's just that some of us are better built,
both emotionally and physically, for the torture

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.540
and triumph of high-altitude climbing.
And let's face it, some of us just look better

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.799
doing it.
Araceli Segarra, if you don't know her or

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:28.410
have seen her in the Everest film about the
Everest tragedy -- she's a beautiful woman.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.070
She was our teammate in 2002 to K2.
But, I will tell you this -- I've learned

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:40.040
that, at its best, high-altitude climbing
is about joy, pride, iron will, and graceful

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.530
suffering.
And those, who are engulfed in its cruel beauty,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.320
experience something rare and sacred, deep
within their souls.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.200
At times, I would love to be among them.
But, in my more rational moments, I'm very

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.850
thankful to be writing and reading about them
instead.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.490
Earlier, I said my fascination with the big
mountains and women's place on them started

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.460
with the Everest tragedy, but it was fed by
reading "Into Thin Air" and trying to imagine

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.010
what life was like in that Death Zone, that
magic mark around 25,000 feet where life slowly

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.470
suffocates to death.
As I read the book, I wondered why one climber

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.090
 -- one woman, Sandy Hill Pittman of New York
City -- was singled out for shame and blame

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.600
in the tragedy.
And it seemed to me that she was vilified

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.090
for who she was rather than what she did.
She was after all, a client, not a guide.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.340
She was taking orders, not giving them.
So I wondered, "Was she more a victim of her

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.630
strong personality than of her behavior on
the mountain that day?"

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.560
And, one of the joys of being a journalist
is, I could find out.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.190
And when I interviewed many of the other survivors
of that deadly storm, I heard a very different

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.940
story.
I was told that Sandy Hill was strong and

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.660
experienced climber.
David Breashears called her, "fearless."

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.340
And if any of you know David or know of him,
you know that's high praise indeed.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.970
In fact, Sandy had every right to be on the
mountain that day.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.410
She had a bad summit day, and collapsed.
But you know what?

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.920
She wasn't alone.
Eight people died, and many of them, the world's

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.540
best climbers.
No, in my opinion, it seemed that Sandy Hill

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.540
simply wasn't liked.
And the man who didn't like her had a very

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.770
powerful pen.
Maybe it was her wealth or her confidence,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.170
something -- whatever the reasons.
"Into Thin Air" has forever damned Sandy Hill.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.040
And, as a woman -- with my own measure of
pride and confidence -- it affronted me.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.550
And it shocked me to realize how close we
strong women all are to becoming publicly

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.480
destroyed because someone, who is powerful,
doesn't like us.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.980
So I came to this story, "The Women of K2",
with an itch and some suspicions that, "Perhaps

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.620
women climbers have been unfairly treated
 -- not only by the men with whom they climb,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.410
but by those who were writing their stories."
When I found this story in 1998, only five

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.170
women had climbed the mountain, and each of
them had died -- three on their descent of

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.300
K2, and two on two of the other 8,000-meter
peaks.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.440
And, as I get more and more immersed in the
history, I was amazed to find that, in the

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.050
scores of books on the so-called "Savage Mountain",
female climbers were just footnotes in this

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.650
history.
No one had written the stories of these incredible

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.021
women.
So I get this crazy notion that I -- the journalist

00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:44.390
from Boston, the flattest of flatland -- would
write the book and give these pioneers their

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.360
due place in climbing history.
But I knew that -- in order to do a credible

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.620
job -- I had to go to K2, and I'd have to
see this mountain for myself, which I did

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.780
twice, as you heard.
The first thing you have to understand is

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.530
that, for women, the challenges of the mountain
begin not at Base Camp, but the minute they

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.090
enter patriarchal Pakistan.
Hoping to show some respect and keep a low

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:14.270
profile in the heart of Islam, I decided to
wear the traditional shalwar kameez, but I

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.710
needn't have bothered.
Western women walk through life with a purpose

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:25.470
and a sense of power that many women who are
raised in patriarchal societies do not.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.310
So you can dress us up, cover us up head to
toe, and still, the square shoulders and the

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.450
head held high and the straight on, "look
you in the eye" of a western woman can be

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.529
seen a mile away.
It's a world of men, where women are largely

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:44.960
not seen or heard.
And, in the eyes of some, the square shoulders

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.710
and confidence of a western woman simply aren't
welcome.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:56.810
By the time I got to Base Camp, I was exhausted.
In part from the ten-day, 65-mile trek.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:05.840
And in part from being an object of fascination
and derision -- even contempt -- from the

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.940
constant strain and company of men.
I felt like I'd ground a layer of enamel off

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.580
my teeth, I was so frustrated.
But I said to myself, "You know what? At least

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.050
I don't have to climb the mountain."
And I realized that the women who do, perhaps

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.610
have two mountains to conquer.
One of them is, the mountain in front of them.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:31.710
And one of them is, the men at their backs.
And, you know, it's an incredibly arduous

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.850
climb, even when you do it -- like Wanda Rutkiewicz
did in '82 -- on crutches.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.910
She had broken her femur in training for the
mountain, and she refused to give up the expedition.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.060
So she went in on crutches.
She went through 25 pairs of crutches on her

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.940
way in.
I'm not saying that all women face opposition

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.090
from men in the mountains.
But my suspicion is that many do.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.400
All five of the women of K2 did.
And most of the women I interviewed for the

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.360
film and book told me stories of frustration
and pain at the hands of at least one of their

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.470
male teammates.
When I asked the legendary rock climber Lynn

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.780
Hill why she was never interested in high-altitude
climbing, she said, "Because I don't need

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.950
to put up with the B.S.
of Base Camp."

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.490
But the women of K2 did put up with it, and
others will continue to put up with it, so

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:23.840
long as their souls are enriched by attaining
summits beyond the reach of most.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.960
Because, along with the agony and ecstasy,
and among the petty and cruel, are life partners

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.380
and friends.
High-altitude climbing is a dangerous -- often

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.130
deadly -- intoxicating, humbling, and exhilarating
endeavor.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.400
And those who pursue it, do so for the glorious
payoff of breathing that rarefied air that

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.680
veils the top of the world.
In writing the "Women of K2" and "Savage Summit",

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.770
I hope I've honored the strong women among
them -- those intrepid few who shatter ceilings

00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:01.630
and challenge traditions to realize passion
on their own terms.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:10.200
And I want to close with a reading.
And then, we can take some questions.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.190
[reading] The last time I approached K2, rounding
the famous corner in Concordia and seeing

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:21.730
it there, sitting ten miles up the glacier,
I bent over my trekking poles and sobbed.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:30.290
I simply knew too much.
I knew I was looking at the graveyard of scores

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.670
of people, five of whom I'd come to know tenderly
 -- lovingly.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.850
And I knew my days would be spent in anxious
worry, watching Jeff -- my love and partner

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.680
 -- inch his way up the mountain that had
killed so many.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.920
It was June 17th, 2002, and we were heading
into the mountain to film the attempt of Spanish

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.710
climber, Araceli Segarra, to become the sixth
woman to climb K2.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.230
Jeff would not only be filming her, but climbing
with her on a mountain known for its savage

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:02.310
weather, catastrophic avalanches, and unrelenting
rockfall -- all of which make K2 one of the

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.320
deadliest mountains on earth.
And, even if our small team of four made it

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.750
to the summit, their chances of dying on descent
were greater than on any other mountain on

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:16.190
earth -- one in seven.
So I knew that, sitting at the Base all summer

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.130
and watching them climb the mountain was going
to be tough, and I was right.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.980
It was two months of unrelenting worry, sadness,
and strain.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.630
While my team climbed, I walked the glacier
and found the heartbreaking and grotesque

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.420
bits and pieces of some of the scores who've
died on the mountain, and then, buried in

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.180
crevasse their broken remains.
Finally, the day of our departure came.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.960
I woke that morning, as the sun breached the
northeast ridge of Broad Peak, and I got out

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.870
of my tent feeling an odd happiness.
Something was different.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.230
My nose rose high, searching the air like
a wolf looking for dinner.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.270
My body knew what it was before my brain did,
and I smiled.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:01.139
Wood smoke -- that beautiful, sweet, warm
smell of my childhood in Vermont.

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:06.110
Like pied pipers, we all walked toward the
source and found ourselves guests at, what

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.180
was probably, the world's highest cremation
ceremony.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.380
Seven years before, a team of Japanese climbers
had been swept off the slope while they slept

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.570
in their tents, an enormous avalanche throwing
them into the deep crevasse.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.560
Earlier that summer, five of their bodies
had been found, and two of the remaining teammates

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.160
had ventured from Japan, along with 120 porterloads
of special wood and kerosene to give them

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.170
a proper burial.
I sat at a distance from the flames, trying

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.470
not to enjoy too much the pure, visceral pleasure
of a wood fire -- trying to remember that

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.050
wasn't only wood that was burning.
Occasionally, one of the Japanese would throw

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.020
a gallon-sized container of kerosene on the
fire.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.700
And they would explode into the thin air in
a burst of red and black, the picture-postcard

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.550
K2 visible through the flames.
I watched the five pyres slowly dissolve,

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.860
their tepee stacks falling into the centers
and onto the bodies beneath.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.440
Then, I saw a white cage of ribs emerge from
the red coals.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.980
It was another.
In another, I began to make out a bent arm.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.620
In another, a perfectly round skull.
My selfish pleasure dissolved; and feeling

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:19.800
numb, mute, and heavy with sadness, I watched
the bodies dissolve.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.630
I looked at the five, distinct cairns.
Not four, not six, but five.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.790
How odd that just five of the Japanese were
found, and here I was, witnessing the one-and-only

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.210
cremation at K2 Base Camp in history.
Here they were burning before my very eyes,

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.350
the five, lost Japanese.
The five women of K2.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.920
How eeriely ironic that five women had climbed
it, and although two made it off alive, another

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.529
two had died trying.
So five women remained up there, down here,

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:51.510
somewhere.
None of their families were here to usurp

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.610
this ceremony for their loved one.
So I thought I might as well.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.760
This was also the funeral for the women of
K2.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.310
How they had lived and the facts of their
death had consumed me for years -- too many

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.810
years.
My fascination began, as it always does for

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:11.200
most journalists, I was consumed with compelling
facts -- the five lives, the five deaths,

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.550
the one mountain.
But as that research developed into a book

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:21.000
and a documentary, my emotions ranged from
fascination to obsession to sadness to anger,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.390
as I delved deeper and came to know the women
with an intimacy not shared by some of those

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.690
closest to them.
I began to get mad.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.790
I felt like a parent whose emotions turn to
rage after losing a child to a random murder

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.480
or a stupid accident.
Why didn't the women see trouble coming?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.089
Why didn't they turn around?
Why did they try to cheat the mountain by

00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:45.170
going to K2 before they had more experience?
How could they have been so blind, driven,

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.190
selfish, you name it.
I had these adjectives for my blame and judgment.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.590
But, as I came to the end of my research,
I finally came to peace with their deaths.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.970
I saw that they lived heroically, and that,
even though they died too young, they did

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.360
not die senselessly.
They lived in passion and died in stillness,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.250
doing what they loved in a place that fed
their souls.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.649
Someone had told me that, when a climber dies
in the mountains, it's not a tragedy; it's

00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:14.320
fate, and that's where they wanted to be.
Another climber told me that he never felt

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.260
quite so alive as when he climbed at the edge
of death.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:22.779
And the closer he got, the more alive he felt.
I finally realized that, although I didn't

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:28.730
celebrate living at that edge, I couldn't
condemn these five women -- or the mountains

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.920
 -- when they themselves accepted the risks.
Most of us will not choose where we die.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.410
But climbers who enter their deadly arena
know they are dancing on that razor's edge

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.850
with every movement they make.
They don't mind the risk.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.630
In fact, they embrace the risk as part of
the price of such unbridled joy.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.060
If they accept their fates, so must I.
I finally realized that I had to understand

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:57.399
that, given the choice, the women of K2 would
have chosen to die right where they did, rather

00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:01.790
than rotting from cancer or being crushed
in an automobile accident or slipping into

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.529
the long dark tunnel of Alzheimer's.
If they had peace, who was I to judge that

00:17:06.529 --> 00:17:09.700
quiet happiness?
Their choice to live and die in the mountains

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.220
was one of passion, purpose, and talent, not
idle arrogance or selfish whim.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.519
They were talented climbers, and they found
their greatest purpose in the mountains.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:24.369
The women of K2 were mothers and daughters,
wives and lovers, sisters and aunts, rivals

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:27.689
and friends.
Their deaths are losses for all of us.

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:31.450
But the way they lived should be a lesson
for all of us.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.929
Perhaps losing so many good women in such
a relatively short period of time -- 1986

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:40.919
to 1998 -- has kept other women from becoming
high-altitude climbers.

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:46.629
Most women today, who are becoming climbers,
choose to stay away from the 8,000-meter game

00:17:46.629 --> 00:17:50.210
 -- instead excelling on rock and ice, like
Lynn Hill, Catherine Destivelle, and Nancy

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.850
Feagin.
Some say the commitment of a Himalayan expedition

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.710
is too great.
Others -- who venture into Alpine climbing

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.379
in their 20's -- quickly retire early when
they hit their childbearing years, to stay

00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:06.420
close to home for their children and families.
Some simply don't think the risks of high-altitude

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.470
and all the macho B.S. are worth it.
Regardless of the reasons, most women climbers

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.529
just don't aspire to high altitudes' risk
and rewards.

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:19.279
Today, there is no Wanda Rutkiewicz -- no
apparent heir to her strength, determination,

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:24.980
and sacrifice; no follower who can claim bragging
rights to her legacy.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:31.009
Alison Hargreaves was well on her way, but
fate and foul weather changed her plans.

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:37.619
[talking] And I'm going to zip ahead.
[reading] Five women have many people in their

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:43.510
lives: husbands and lovers, children and siblings,
mothers and fathers, friends and adversaries.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:48.230
The five women of K2 were no exception.
One of my joys in being a writer and a journalist

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.730
is, the privilege I've had to meet and interview
people who most interest me.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:58.710
Over the years, I've been amazed and disappointed,
shocked and chagrinned, enraptured and disgusted,

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.450
bored and enthralled.
But nothing prepared me for getting to know

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.720
the people, the women of K2 left behind.
With every new person I found, every fact

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.890
I learned, every controversy I unearthed,
I scratched away at the veneer of their lives,

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.410
learning things I sometimes had no right to
learn, talking with people who hadn't spoken

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.409
since the woman's death, or since their love
affair with her had ended.

00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:26.549
I spoke with families who hadn't yet found
closure, siblings who never had a chance to

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:31.279
say good-bye, lovers who were unacknowledged,
and children who were sad and confused at

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:36.019
having played second fiddle to a monolith
of rock and ice.

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:38.610
The women of K2 left a tapestry of grief behind
them.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.639
Because, even though each climber and her
family knew the risks involved, when someone

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:52.390
is actually lost, the hole they leave is raw
with unsaid words, unlived potential, and

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.380
unrealized dreams.
[pause] That's it.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:05.000
I was going to read on, but you know, it's
just -- I'm going to get too emotional.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.549
I haven't read these passages in a long time.
It's even hard for me.

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:12.859
But, thank you for coming.
I welcome your questions, your comments.

00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:17.739
And please, if you have any -- or either or
both -- go to the microphone, because we are

00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:27.330
taping the proceedings. [pause]
Shocked? Shocked into silence?

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:34.070
Q Was there a particular woman that affected
you, or impacted you, more than others?

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:46.090
Jennifer Jordan: Well, I think that Wanda
Rutkiewicz, I felt most akin to.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:56.029
She was definitely a very, very assertive,
and you know, some say 'selfish' and 'stubborn'

00:20:56.029 --> 00:21:00.299
and 'bull-headed' and all the adjectives that
strong women get.

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:08.370
And I kind of relived -- she had a series
of really heartbreaking denunciations from

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:13.629
within the climbing world in Poland that just
broke her heart right before she died.

00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:18.289
I mean, just really devastated her.
And I just, you know, you read the history

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:20.529
and, you know, it came down to a "he said/she
said."

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:24.340
And "You lied" and "No, I didn't."
And to have your climbing career tarnished

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.799
in that way -- for someone like Wanda -- was
just devastating.

00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:43.419
So I felt that kind of societal -- global,
whatever -- pain of hers in a way that the

00:21:43.419 --> 00:21:50.190
others -- you know, they were all really tough.
I -- almost every day, I cried at the keyboard,

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.909
because, you know, you just get so far into
these lives and then deaths.

00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:59.989
And you talk to these people who, I mean.
Liliane Barrard was the second woman to climb

00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:02.760
K2.
She did it with Wanda, but an hour later.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:08.239
So Wanda was the first, and then Liliane.
They were on the same team.

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:14.039
And Liliane and her husband both disappeared
on descent.

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:19.970
And her body was found that same summer, about
a month later, that she looked like she'd

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.919
fallen the distance.
And Maurice's body was found 12 years later.

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:30.779
In any case -- so that was 1986, and I started
Googling -- I don't know how people wrote

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:37.159
books before Google or the Internet.
And was trying to find information on her,

00:22:37.159 --> 00:22:39.789
because there's just almost nothing written.
And I talked to all the people who were on

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:41.820
the expedition that year, on the mountain
that year.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.739
"Do you remember Liliane?"
"Oh," they'd say, "You know, I remember she

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:48.520
had a really pretty smile, and she was very
quiet."

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.609
And this is the second woman who climbed K2.
And she has a pretty smile and was quiet.

00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:58.050
That's all they remembered.
So I was, you know, you delve deeper and deeper

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.850
and deeper, and as I get deeper, I found out
she had a brother.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:07.899
And it didn't help that she was French and
didn't speak -- nothing in English.

00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:11.350
And so anyway, so I started Googling literally
"Alain Bontemps, Paris."

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.450
Ding.
And then, woop, up comes an Alain with an

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.470
e-mail address.
"My name is, I'm researching your sister,"

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.139
You know, "Remember the K2? Are you the brother
of Liliane Barrard?"

00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:27.779
Next morning, got to my e-mail.
Not only, "Yes, I am," but "I have footage

00:23:27.779 --> 00:23:32.710
of her climbing on G2.
Might you be interested?"

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.489
And so, I interviewed him, and he sobbed over
the phone.

00:23:35.489 --> 00:23:42.080
I was the first person, outside of the immediate
rush of her death, to have any interest in

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.820
her -- this is his only sibling; both parents
were gone.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:52.830
And that really broke my heart that these
women -- and particularly, Liliane and Julie

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.970
Tullis, the third woman to climb K2 that same
summer and died on descent -- just kind of

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.970
disappeared. Pat?

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.970
Q What surprised you, as you were doing the
research?

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:57.970
Were there any surprises?

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.509
Jennifer Jordan: Oh, no. You've got to narrow
it down for me.

00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:04.450
There were too many.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.809
Q Surprises about the women.

00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:20.999
Jennifer Jordan: Surprises about the women.
Even that's a broad question, but thank you

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:28.340
for narrowing it down.
I guess, I was surprised how lonely they all

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.229
were.
They all really struggled to climb.

00:24:33.229 --> 00:24:36.299
And I wasn't prepared for that.
I mean, when I started the research -- yes,

00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:39.840
I started through the Sandy Hill story.
But Sandy's not a high-altitude climber.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.100
You know, Sandy really did decide to climb
the seven summits as kind of a, you know,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.269
midlife thing.
And she trained well.

00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:52.679
And she was a good, strong climber, but it
wasn't her life's passion.

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:59.539
These women were pulled into it.
I mean, it's almost as if they didn't choose

00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:02.970
it; it chose them.
And I wasn't ready for that.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:09.979
I wasn't ready for their really, giving their
lives to it, as if they had no choice -- and

00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:14.009
maybe they didn't.
I mean, to live with that kind of passion.

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:18.539
It would be like, you know, Michael Phelps
deciding he wants to stop swimming and take

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:22.519
up golf -- which he may do, I mean, the golf
part -- but he'll never not swim, because

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:27.070
he's got a passion for it.
So that surprised me.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:33.590
I wasn't ready for these women to have been
chosen by climbing.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:39.859
And then, to really find out how isolating
it was to be in that five percent -- and the

00:25:39.859 --> 00:25:41.850
top of that five percent -- of female, Himalayan
climbers.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:52.790
You know, each of these five women had milestones.
They were firsts on something, and that was

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:59.810
a very lonely, isolating thing.
I mean, it was sad for me to see that the

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:04.890
climbing community -- and even some of the
men they were with -- didn't necessarily care.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:11.379
I mean, when I started again, Googling -- I
mean, when I found out that -- the only five

00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:15.799
women to climb K2 sitting on Charlotte Fox's
porch in Aspen.

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:20.759
And Charlotte's one of the survivors of Everest
'96, so I was interviewing her.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:24.139
And she knew I didn't know a thing.
She could tell within three sentences that

00:26:24.139 --> 00:26:29.600
I was, you know, "flatlander doing some research."
So she said -- she was going through a magazine

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.970
for an article she wanted me to read.
And she came across an obituary.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.059
She says, "Hmm. look at that. Chantal just
died on Dhaulagiri.

00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:43.210
That means all the women of K2 are dead."
And she looked and raised her eyebrow, "You

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.049
know where K2 is, right?"
I said, "Sure." I had no idea.

00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:50.019
She said, you know -- because she was very
Charlottsy kit -- "K2 second highest mountain

00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:52.491
in the world, only five women have climbed
it.

00:26:52.491 --> 00:26:56.450
And now that Chantal's dead, they're all dead.
There's not one survivor."

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.950
And just something clicked in me that had
to follow that.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:07.520
So I went, you know, as soon as I got to a
computer, I was like, "Women of K2, deaths."

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.820
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
And I thought, "Wow, how can?"

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.639
I mean, why didn't David Roberts find this
story?

00:27:14.639 --> 00:27:17.429
Why didn't Galen Rowell find this story?
I mean, all these mountain writers.

00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:22.529
This is a great story. Why didn't they?
Nobody, not even a magazine article connecting

00:27:22.529 --> 00:27:25.259
them.
There's one here about her, one here about

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:30.510
her, but not a collective look at these women
 -- and that just floored me.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:39.190
But again, it gets back to that isolation
thing, that they really were kind of overlooked.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:46.120
Q And when you were there -- at the second
Base Camp I guess -- did you have any itch

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.620
to go a little bit further maybe?

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:54.369
Jennifer Jordan: She's asking this, because
she asked it at lunch, so she knows the answer.

00:27:54.369 --> 00:27:59.499
I mean, I am an arrogant athlete, so yes.
I looked at that mountain and thought, "Oh,

00:27:59.499 --> 00:28:03.609
c'mon. You know, how hard could it be?"
But that was my arrogant athlete talking.

00:28:03.609 --> 00:28:10.099
I mean, I knew how hard it was.
And I knew that, if I even flirted with the

00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:15.749
hubris of putting my foot on the climbing
route, I was risking -- not only my death,

00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:19.349
but my team's death.
I don't have the skills.

00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:26.970
I don't have the -- I was going to say 'temperament'
 -- but it's much more the emotional training.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:32.809
Because you've got to figure out how to suffer.
And you've got to figure out how to suffer

00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:37.340
when it hits the fan at 8,000 meters and you
don't have a rope.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.900
And we saw this summer on K2.
A lot of the people that died this summer

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.109
didn't have -- in my opinion -- didn't have
a lot of high-altitude experience to know

00:28:48.109 --> 00:28:54.009
how to handle catastrophe when it hits at
8,000 meters.

00:28:54.009 --> 00:29:01.159
And so, no. I knew better.
The base was challenging enough as far as

00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:07.389
being at 17,000 feet and crevass-laden and
littered with dead bodies and body parts.

00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:12.929
I mean, Hector -- who was on our expedition
on this second time in 2002 -- started calling

00:29:12.929 --> 00:29:16.889
me 'the bone collector', because every time
I'd go out for my walk -- they'd be climbing

00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:22.779
or they'd be setting the route or resting
between climbs -- and I'd take my daily walk

00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:28.169
and find -- I mean, I almost never came back
to camp without a remnant of sorts.

00:29:28.169 --> 00:29:32.419
Excuse me, some of them benign.
Some of them, you know, glove or hat.

00:29:32.419 --> 00:29:37.549
And then, you get into the boots, and you
know that that's not good.

00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:44.799
Climbers don't leave boots on mountains.
And then, you get into ropes, and then, bones

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:49.620
and parts.
Because the topography of K2 -- unlike Everest

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:58.729
when people die -- K2 is so much steeper.
And it's also in a really active, earthquake

00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:02.679
zone.
This is what we keep saying, of course, southern

00:30:02.679 --> 00:30:06.049
Pakistan.
And the winds and the everything else -- everything

00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:11.470
that was once on K2 gets avalanched or blown
or falls off.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.159
So it ends up at the base.
And that's where I spent my summer, collecting

00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:14.159
bones and burying them and, occasionally,
the bodies.

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:21.860
So it was a gruesome summer.
It's not a happy summer.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.940
Q [inaudible]

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:32.629
Jennifer Jordan: The question is, How long
did it take me to write the book and make

00:30:32.629 --> 00:30:35.489
the film?
I really started the research for the book

00:30:35.489 --> 00:30:44.050
in '98 when Chantal died.
I mean that got me to the library, and then

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:49.049
to Google, thank God.
And so, '98 started the research.

00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:56.349
And I went to K2 for the first time in 2000,
and spent, you know, four months on that expedition.

00:30:56.349 --> 00:31:02.269
And came home just shattered, because it was
a very dysfunctional team -- a very angry

00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:08.669
team, a very troubled team.
And we all just kind of licked our wounds

00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:13.919
and went to our corners.
So I didn't come home with the book at that

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:17.499
point.
And then, a year-and-a-half later -- well

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:23.029
actually, a year later -- we were, right after
9/11, Araceli called Jeff and said, "I want

00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:25.399
to try K2 this summer, 2002. Can you be on
the team?"

00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:34.071
And he's like, "I can't afford to be on the
team unless I'm working."

00:31:34.071 --> 00:31:37.229
So we then pitched some friends of ours at
Nat Geo.

00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:43.451
So we sold the film first.
And then went over, did that research.

00:31:43.451 --> 00:31:50.960
The film took -- with pre- and post- production
and the expedition -- about a year and a half.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.179
And then, I came home from putting that together
and started the book.

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:58.499
And the book took six months to write.
It was interesting.

00:31:58.499 --> 00:32:01.899
The first time I wrote it, I wrote it very
much like a journalist; I wrote it like a

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:06.109
magazine article.
And my editor came back and said, "No, we

00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:12.799
really want more of a nonfiction narrative."
So I rewrote it. And I'm glad I did.

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:18.820
I think a lot of the readers that have e-mailed
me have said that they found it one of the

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.899
most readable mountain books.
So I'm glad about that, because I'm not a

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.999
climber.
I knew I couldn't fake the climbing part.

00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:32.230
I could do as much research as I could do,
but I had to fill in my experiential gap with

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.179
good writing.
So I hope I did that.

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.179
Q [inaudible]

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:42.299
Jennifer Jordan: The most challenging part
about making the movie was, making it in Hollywood

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:48.700
with a lot of executives.
I was telling Pat and Charlene over lunch,

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:55.200
it's just -- it was unbelievable to me how
they fight battles just to fight battles -- even

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.389
though it would have been a better film, would
have been more comprehensive, but they just

00:32:59.389 --> 00:33:04.029
fight them to fight you.
So I lost a few battles, which bothered me.

00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:07.980
And that was tough, because we left some of
the best stuff on the cutting room floor just

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.389
because of ego wars and time.
You know, we pitched an hour-and-a-half and

00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:15.190
they gave us an hour, which on television
is 47 minutes.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.859
So, that was tough.
The hardest part of the book was sobbing over

00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:25.739
the keyboard every day.
And just the incredible self-doubt of knowing

00:33:25.739 --> 00:33:29.850
that the climbing community that had been
criticizing me for my first day on that first

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:34.940
expedition, "Who are you to write a climbing
book?"

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.610
I just had this horrible, gut-wrenching fear
of the reviews -- of John Krakauer writing

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:46.210
a review.
I don't slam him, but I'm not really kind

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:53.740
to him in the book.
But it didn't happen. The critics were silent.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.129
So that was a relief.
But it kind of stained the process, because

00:33:59.129 --> 00:34:05.559
it was so -- it was not only a difficult subject,
but it was also very -- I've never written

00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:12.899
a biography, and to write five?
It was very, very tough.

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:17.490
And then, I felt like I had all this information
that no one else had ever gathered.

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:21.369
I felt like I was kind of a caretaker of these
women's legacies.

00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:27.010
And I wanted to be honest, and I wanted to
be, you know, plain with the truth.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:32.980
But I didn't want to, you know, I didn't want
to tabloid it.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.129
So making the decision, "Do I expose that
love affair? Are the children going to read

00:34:36.129 --> 00:34:41.980
this?"
You know. That kind of thing.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:49.790
It was an ongoing, constant decision-making
process of, How much do I reveal?

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.889
And to whom?

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:58.390
Q So I read the book, and I found it a real
page-turner.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:04.910
But I'm wondering if you could describe what
were some of the issues particular to women

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.630
that you described in the book.
And did you personally experience any of those

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.730
on your trip in 2000?
I don't know if there were other women present?

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:21.300
Jennifer Jordan: I did. And I, you know, it's
still difficult.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.890
When I eventually write the book, because
I will, because it was an incredible expedition.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:35.430
But I can't write it yet, because I'm still
too -- it was eight years ago, and I'm still

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:41.880
too emotionally raw or angry or sad or all
those things to write about that expedition.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:48.750
So a lot of incredible -- and the kind of
ugly stuff that you just, you can't believe

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.080
it's going on.
And what happens at Base Camp is that it's

00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:00.400
a lawless community.
And the people there are a personality type

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.660
in a life -- personality type that is, you
know, very egotistic -- men and women, it's

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.940
not just men.
Very egotistic, very driven, very self-centered,

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:14.790
in the true meaning of the word.
And very frustrated.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:20.740
On a mountain like K2, you spend most of your
time waiting for the weather to break.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:27.779
So you got all this broiling stuff.
And so, you know, you -- the bullies are looking

00:36:27.779 --> 00:36:31.090
for victims.
And the victims are just trying to hide.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.849
And I was a victim, because I wasn't a climber
 -- I wasn't on the team.

00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:38.359
You know, I was there as a journalist from
Boston, for God's sake.

00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:44.349
You know 'Harvard' on the resume, God forbid.
And it was just unrelenting.

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:52.110
And you know, so I survived that.
And then, went back in 2002 with a small group

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.590
 -- Araceli, Hector, Armando, Jeff -- fabulous
expedition.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:58.079
We still had issues, but fabulous group of
people.

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:03.230
And I thought that, "Okay, that had been a
bad expedition for me."

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.490
You know, and I did my research.
And these women had their issues, but you

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:14.450
know, I wasn't going to -- I thought it was
perhaps rare that my expedition was that ugly.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:20.250
And then, I got home, and the book came out.
And a total stranger -- it's a small world

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.700
in Salt Lake.
So she found my phone number.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.850
And she called me up, in tears, and said,
"Oh, my God. I thought it was just me."

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.360
I said, "What are you talking about?"
And she told me a story that she had been

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.099
to the north side of K2 -- only woman on a
large American expedition -- and the men shat

00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:40.619
in her shoes.
And that had been just 18 months before.

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:45.970
And I was like, "Why?"
She said, "Well, they didn't like me."

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:52.170
So, it's just -- I mean, it really -- it's
the kind of behavior that you just don't know

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:56.670
how to process.
And, looking back from sea-level, with you

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:02.140
know, my brain cells back where they should
be and -- it's very hard to look at.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:07.660
Because it just doesn't make sense.
And the behavior is so beyond -- and most

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.140
mountain writers won't talk about it.
Because it's just too ugly and it's the tabloid

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.640
world and people don't understand it.
And if you've never been to 8,000 meters,

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:22.970
you can't judge, and you hear all that.
So, it's really, yeah. And it keeps going

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:27.260
on.
And, in fact, Charlotte -- I'll betray a confidence.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.609
She -- I interviewed her for the book and
film.

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:34.390
And throughout, for years -- I mean, I met
her in '98.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:38.370
And for years, she said, "No, no, no, Sandy
got the bad end of that stick.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.079
It's Krakauer this and Sandy's difficult.
But I had a great time.

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:46.810
I always have a great time. I love expeditions.
I'm one of the guys. I'm strong. I'm capable.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.720
Blah blah blah."
She read the book.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.220
Again, called me in tears, and said, "Oh,
my God," and just ranted -- ranted about what

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.930
she had been through.
And so, there are a lot of women out there

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.520
who don't even want to share it, because they
don't want to be pariahs.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.079
You still need a climbing team.
It's very hard to put a team together.

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:10.420
And especially for women, because there are
not that many of us -- them -- climbing.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:17.279
So it's troubled.
And I'm sorry to kind of rant, but it's still

00:39:17.279 --> 00:39:22.789
obviously very difficult for me.
And I can't -- until I can process it, I can't

00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:25.029
really do it justice, because it needs to
be done.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:28.010
I need to write that book, but I can't write
it yet.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:34.970
It's still too fresh -- eight years later.
But that's what, you know.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.349
You know, those of us who were bullied?
Any of you guys bullied in school?

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:42.240
It never goes away.
And it's just, you know, when you're bullied

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:48.380
at 42 years old, it really never goes away,
but. [pause]

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:55.770
Q I've read a few mountaineering books --

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.770
Jennifer Jordan: Oh, good.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:03.620
Q -- and yours is different.
And one of the ways that it was really different

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.951
for me was, it affected me emotionally much
more than a recounting by Jim Wickwire or

00:40:06.951 --> 00:40:15.300
whatever, Roberts.
And the thing -- for example, Julie, right?

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.720
And I read that, and I was just angry.
I mean, I was getting emotional. I was angry

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.809
at Dan Berger.
I was angry at her. It was interesting.

00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:27.900
Jennifer Jordan: Oh thank you. You know, the
Julie.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.710
Do I have time to read that? Good.
I'm going to read you one more passage, because

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:38.119
I think it gets to your point.
And I'll tell you this about Julie.

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:43.160
When the lawyers at HarperCollins and I sat
down to vet the book -- you know, go through

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.039
 -- and something that didn't happen to you-know-who
a few months ago.

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:52.609
Anyway, didn't want to get into politics.
She said, "Let me just tell you two things.

00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:55.500
Number one, I consider Holiday Inn roughing
it.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.609
So I don't know how you went to K2."
And that made me laugh, because, if there's

00:40:59.609 --> 00:41:03.170
anything I can do, it's rough it.
And she said, "Second of all. I don't like

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:08.319
Julie."
She was angry at Julie for the choice that

00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:15.059
she made, and I wasn't.
I didn't get angry -- I got angry at Julie

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:21.150
for not introducing -- not taking the time
to meet her son's girlfriend.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:26.190
Remember that scene at the airport?
Where she looks right through him, because

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:33.049
the press is there?
Okay. Anyway.

00:41:33.049 --> 00:41:40.849
One of my incredible challenges in writing
this book is that I, not only am not a climber,

00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:43.480
I was not with these women when they died
 -- any of them.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.809
I found the story after Chantal died -- after
the last one died.

00:41:46.809 --> 00:41:53.210
So, I had to write five biographies; I had
to write five deaths, none of which I witnessed.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:42:02.490
So I knew I couldn't -- I didn't want to do
just, you know, "Julie died on August 3rd,

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.519
1986."
I didn't want to do that.

00:42:05.519 --> 00:42:10.079
You have magazine articles for that.
So I wrote this in this style instead.

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:14.660
[reading] And Julie and Kurt had made the
summit of K2.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:22.089
On the way down, for some inexplicable reason,
Kurt went first on the rope.

00:42:22.089 --> 00:42:27.049
They were roped together, not to the mountain
 -- and Julie behind, which you just don't

00:42:27.049 --> 00:42:33.720
do, because the strongest person has to be
above.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:37.190
And for some reason, I guess he was just desperate
to get down.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.180
He went first.
She fell, and pulled him with her.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.049
And as with a tea kettle, boom di boom boom.
And finally, he was able to self-arrest them

00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:52.430
with his ice ax, bullet-proof ice, dark.
And in the process, she was probably concussed.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:56.299
We'll never know, because she died up there.
But she was probably concussed.

00:42:56.299 --> 00:43:01.819
So this is -- they made it back to Camp Four
 -- she, on all fours.

00:43:01.819 --> 00:43:06.960
And they had to get into separate tents, because
theirs had collapsed.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.400
They had this, just piece of crap, little,
bivouacy tent that couldn't withstand the

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.140
storm that they got stuck in at Camp Four,
so.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:19.089
[reading] Julie lay in her sleeping bag awake,
but she could feel sleep pulling her down

00:43:19.089 --> 00:43:23.089
into its comforting womb.
Villi, Alfred, and Hans were so close that

00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:26.980
she could barely distinguish where her breath
ended and theirs began, but she had clunk

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.329
in with three other climbers in a two-man
tent, so it's four of them in a two-man tent.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:33.650
[reading] Their long leg bones pushed against
hers.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.529
Their arms occasionally knocking her head
or chest.

00:43:36.529 --> 00:43:40.940
Their beards were coated in the same frost
as the hair that framed her face.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:45.210
She stared up at the tent, bucking and fluttering,
in the constant roar of wind.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:49.730
She'd been in storms before -- both here on
K2 and on Everest -- but this was different.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:55.369
She had gone from panic to anger to dread,
and now, to what?

00:43:55.369 --> 00:43:58.839
She hardly felt a thing.
Her blurred vision helped her stay cocooned

00:43:58.839 --> 00:44:03.630
away from the worst of the reality they faced.
The men were taking good care of her.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:08.320
The Koreans had left them a well-stocked tent.
And she drank as much tea as her shrinking

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.440
stomach could handle.
Eating was more difficult, but she managed

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.140
to choke down some dry bread and some odd,
fishy soup.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.670
As the wind screamed over the tent fabric
and pushed anew at its poles, she thought

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:24.940
of Terry and Chris and Lindsay -- her family.
Of their funny house and its cozy, narrow,

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.410
living room, a room crowded with only four
people in it.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:32.600
She thought of how the sun would flood in
the southern window and warm the entire room

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.470
on a chilly November day.
She thought of the first time she had seen

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:40.740
Terry in his incredibly blue eyes, and how
she'd marveled the first time she saw Chris

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.859
suckling at her breast.
What an odd, indescribably joyful sensation

00:44:44.859 --> 00:44:49.769
that had been! She thought of her wonderful
vesta, and tried to remember what had finally

00:44:49.769 --> 00:44:52.829
happened to it.
Had she toppled it one too many times?

00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:55.740
It was a wonder that thing had never killed
her.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.740
Her lips cracked in a faint smile remembering
how many bushes she christened until she finally

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:05.039
figured out the damn brakes and clutch.
And finally she thought of the way the rocks

00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:09.740
at world's end felt under her fingers and
how the warmth caressed her skin and allowed

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.200
her to feel like she was floating up the wall
 -- effortless, tireless, weightless.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.200
It was freedom, and she breathed deep, remembering
the release of her body.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:23.319
Then she closed her eyes.
[talking] So that's how I dealt with her death.

00:45:23.319 --> 00:45:28.780
And the next morning, she was dead, in the
tent.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:34.130
And they put her in the ruined tent.
And two of those men in the tent with her

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:41.710
also died.
And the man and woman that Kurt was in his

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:47.770
tent with, also died.
1986 has been called the "Black Summer," because

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:55.829
27 people summited, and 13 died in the process
 -- most of them trapped at Camp Four in that

00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:58.990
storm.
It was also the, you know, three women.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:04.339
The first three women that made it to the
summit that year, and two of them never made

00:46:04.339 --> 00:46:06.150
it home.
Cheerful huh?

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:11.339
We can see where I've been for the past, you
know, yeah. Whoo.

00:46:11.339 --> 00:46:14.450
Next time, I'm going to write about, you know,
vacation spots of the rich and famous.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:18.769
Because this, yeah.
I mean, but it's interesting about passion,

00:46:18.769 --> 00:46:21.000
right?
I mean, this chose me.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.140
When Charlotte said, "Oh, look at that.
You know, that means all the women of K2 are

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.190
dead."
You think I made the rational like, "Oh, you

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.559
know what? That'd be an interesting subject
to research."

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:35.440
Not at all, I -- it just took me and grabbed
me, and here I am.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:42.150
And it still hasn't let me go.
I still go to K2climb.net, almost every morning

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:46.559
of the climbing season.
Well, every morning of the climbing season,

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:55.359
and almost every morning in non-climbing seasons.
It's just -- it's an odd addiction to a place

00:46:55.359 --> 00:47:01.400
that I'll never see.
I'll never get to 8,000 meters, God willing.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.920
And unless it's in a very nice airplane, so.
But it is passion.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.510
Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.260
Q Would you do it again?

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.260
Jennifer Jordan: Do what again?

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.760
Q Go through this whole experience?
Knowing what you know now.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.720
Jennifer Jordan: Oh, in retrospect? Yes, absolutely.
Because I think that you don't get to choose.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.250
You're asking me, Would I choose, though.
So, yes, I would, because it's changed my

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:32.319
life in every conceivable way that something
can.

00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:37.730
I mean, I started this research, you know,
a single woman living in a third floor walk-up

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:42.450
in Cambridge Massachusetts and loving it.
Believe me, no complaints, working at, you

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:47.779
know, WGBH in Boston and at Harvard.
Had all my little freelance gigs going.

00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:52.599
Great life. I biked everywhere.
I never owned a car. It's like "woo hoo"!

00:47:52.599 --> 00:48:00.099
My family up the road in Vermont.
My house in the Cape.

00:48:00.099 --> 00:48:04.359
Boom! Gave it all up -- rented the condo,
quit all the part-time jobs, gave up the gigs,

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:08.930
got on a plane, went to K2.
And, in that process, I met Jeff, and here

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:16.589
I am in Salt Lake with a house and a car and
a dog and a husband and a book and a film,

00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:22.690
and, you know, a new career.
But I don't like the word 'career.' I have

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.660
new interests.
Because I think 'career' is too limiting,

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.569
especially in these days.
It's too scary to have one job.

00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:37.990
The last full-time job I had was in 1990.
And

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.089
I said, "Never again."
Just too scary to have somebody else have

00:48:42.089 --> 00:48:45.349
that much power.
So now, I just do freelance.

00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:49.500
And that's scary too.
But especially when the medical bills -- the

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.740
quarterly -- comes, but anyway, I'm rambling
now.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:57.109
Any more questions? You've been fabulous.
Thank you so much. I'll be -- there are books

00:48:57.109 --> 00:49:01.700
here.
If you don't have one. I'll be happy to sign.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.349
Thank you so much. And thank you so much,
Pat, and Google.

00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
