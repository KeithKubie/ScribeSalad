Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

together experts from diverse disciplines

- [Pascal] Thanks very much for this great
afternoon, to all the speakers. I'm

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.120
especially grateful to Dan Lieberman for
having set the stage with a lot of carnage

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.070
and meat-eating, because the molecules I
talk about today have to do with

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.120
vertebrates and what we eat and what
happens to it in our bodies. So this

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.240
afternoon I'd like to share an idea about
a way that a molecule could be driving

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.510
speciation and share some evidence for it
in Vigo [sp], not in primates but in mice.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.410
I like to start with by acknowledging the
people who've done some of the heavy

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.270
lifting, including Fang Ma who's back in
Chengdu, a former lab member and Darius

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.210
Ghaderi and my team here especially Stevan
Springer and Miriam Cohen, as well as my

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.320
collaborators, Ajit Varki and his team.
The kelp there in the background is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.350
actually an analogy I use when I talk
about the glycocalyx. Every living life,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:01.850
every living cell has a sugar coat called
glycocalyx which consist of glycolipids

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.780
and glycoprotiens that completely cover
the cell and give it its molecular

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.010
identity. These molecules swing around
very much like the kelp in the ocean right

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.250
here. And if we make ourselves hundreds of
millions of times smaller and land on a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.310
cell, one of my favorite cells, a
mammalian sperm cell, we would see

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.250
something that reminds us of one of these
kelp forests. These are the glycolipids

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.470
and glycoproteins. All of them share short
sugar chains on them, each little sugar is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.260
about one nanometer big. And what they
share is that most of these chains

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.160
terminate in a sugar coat sialic acid that
helps define the identity of the cell type

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.870
and it tells the body that this is a self
cell. So sialic acid can be thought of as

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.370
a very potent self signal. You can
visualize them here with an antibody and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.100
you see the entire surface of the sperm,
it's payload so to speak is the haploid

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.040
genome in blue. And the surface of the
sperm is completely covered in sialic

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.500
acids. To go back to the kelp analogy,
macrocystis kelp has these big terminal

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.670
bulbs that help it float and it defines
the outer edge, the molecular frontier of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.020
every cell, that's what you can think of
as sialic acids. They're very important

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.100
because they're telling the body that this
is self and they play a role in

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.020
fertilization, in gestation, in
development including during pregnancy.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.200
Peter Medawar many years ago coined the
phrase "immunological paradox of mammalian

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.670
pregnancy" where a female, a mother, is
gestating an individual that is

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.500
genetically not identical to her within
her body, in a very intimate contact. The

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.200
interface between the fetal cells of the
trophoblast and the mother includes these

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.030
sialic acids, these sugar molecules found
on cell surfaces of all vertebrates. This

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.710
matters, it can be quite dramatic. This
young fellow here was born in 1963 and he

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.200
had a problem; his mother was type O, had
a lot of antibodies against type A blood.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.620
And they had a former son and his father
was type A. So what happened during the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.190
pregnancy is that the antibodies that his
mother were making passed through the

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.560
placenta and almost killed him. He was
born with massive hemolytic disease of the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.480
newborn that had only been described a
couple of years earlier. And it's only

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.140
because he was given two complete blood
transfusions that he can stand here today

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:42.310
and give a talk. So sugars and mismatches
of sugars are really important. But I

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.040
would like to propose that there is
another immunological paradox and it's the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.420
one about mammalian fertilization. How do
sperm manage to survive this journey from

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.890
insemination to the place of fertilization
way up in the ampulla of the oviduct? If

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.100
you think back, when you were a sperm, the
reproductive tract of your mother was

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:11.130
about the equivalent of six kilometers,
we're back to running. Of course, hundreds

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.480
of millions of potential you's were
inseminated, but only one made it up all

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.900
the way to the ampulla. And that is partly
due to a massive influx of immune cells of

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.500
the mother upon insemination that take out
and actively kill, potentially select,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.680
most of the sperm. Only a few hundreds
make it to the oviduct where they

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.170
capacitate, they start sprinting,
galloping and one of them meets the egg

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:42.810
and fertilizes it. So, females may be
scrutinizing and even selecting sperm. Why

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.820
would they do that? Well, one thing they
might have to look out for is, is it the

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.680
correct species? Male mammals are quite
famous for trying to mate with anything

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.910
that is shaped roughly like that. But the
female might be interested in some read

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.490
out of the fitness of the male who made
the sperm or in the fact that the male is

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.140
genetically compatible also more
importantly that the sperm is still

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:13.770
functional. Wasting one precious egg on a
sperm that already lost its acrosome and

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:20.530
is not fit to make a surviving embryo
would be a terrible waste. So, I come back

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.950
to the sialic acid on the surface of cells
and in most mammals, the two most common

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.010
sialic acids are called N-acetylneuraminic
acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid, AC and

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.900
GC for short. What is interesting is that
there's an enzyme the modifies AC to GC

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.610
and humans are natural knock outs. This is
work by Ajit Varki's laboratory that over

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:48.070
the last 15 years has found the mechanism.
We are knock out for a gene that was an

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.950
insertion of a selfish piece of DNA that
destroyed the gene. We cannot make the GC

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.650
anymore. All of us in this room are pure
AC on our cell surfaces. So the cell

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:03.040
surface of a human differs dramatically
from that of most other mammals. So with

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.930
all our close living ape relatives, we
share AC. But because of a mutation that

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.580
is quite well-timed with three different
methods using coalescence, molecular clock

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.080
and the type of element that is present,
we know that this mutation happened

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.460
between 2 and 3 million years ago. And we
know that it causes us to only have one

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.880
type of sugar on our cell surface, of
sialic acid. Now you'd think it's a tiny,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.840
tiny change in DNA, why could this be a
big deal? I haven't mentioned that your

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.970
average cell has tens to hundreds of
millions of this molecule. So a tiny

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.660
change in your DNA changes the flavor, the
molecular flavor of your cells in a big

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.900
way. A human cell would appear in one
flavor and a non-human cell in a

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.910
completely different flavor. What could
have driven this? You're looking at a

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.320
model of a cell surface of a red blood
cell which make up over 80% of all your

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.300
cells. And they're targeted by some of the
most important pathogens that we know for

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.990
human kind such as falciparum, malaria.
This molecule encircled is glycophorin A

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:15.120
that carries a lot of sialic acid which
malaria uses to get into the host. So a

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.940
couple of years back with Ajit, we
commented on the fact that it is known

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:26.060
that the apes that still make most of our
great ape cousins sick, they use sialic

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.790
acid that we don't have anymore. They
cannot infect us. So, one possible driving

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.610
force for the loss of this sugar initially
might have been to escape a pathogen such

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.850
as an ancestral malaria. We got a nice
break. Unfortunately, much, much later in

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:46.620
the Neolithic with agriculture and the
expansion of Anopheles mosquito species,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.150
malaria caught up with us with a vengeance
and is now highly specific for the sugar

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:58.050
we have on human cells. Now,
interestingly, as we've heard somewhere

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:03.280
along the line to Homo, we became top
predators and we regularly engage in

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.640
hunting or scavenging or a combination of
both. And when you eat this non-human

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.000
sugar, you actually incorporate it and you
start making an immune reaction to it. So

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.570
after having lost the sugar, we started
getting regularly immunized to it and

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:23.570
making antibodies. And there is ongoing
work showing that this is incorporated, is

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.740
relevant for modern Homo sapiens, all of
us who eat red meat which is the biggest

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.260
source of this non-human sugar, continue
to immunize ourselves and to incorporate

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:39.200
it. So several years back, we asked,
"Well, could it be that if sperm differs

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.030
so dramatically that a change in cell
surface sugars could actually have been

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.130
involved in this reproductive
incompatibility that I was unlucky enough

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.140
to suffer from when I was born? That was
ABO blood groups, very unusual, a rare

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.970
case. But this would have been a very
powerful point, a way to immunize the

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.380
mother against the sugar she doesn't have.
Could this have been involved, this

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:07.690
mutation? The fixation of it, could that
have been driven? Could that have driven

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:14.290
the speciation along the lineage to modern
Homo? So one thing we could do at the time

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.010
is obtain chimpanzee sperm in a
non-invasive fashion. I shall not go into

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:25.580
details. And expose those chimpanzee sperm
to human serum with antibodies and show

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.090
that they die. But the reverse is not
true. We could also show that compliment

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.390
gets deposited on sperm. It seems to be an
antibody-driven killing mechanism in human

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:41.020
serum. Luckily by then, there was a model
mouse that carried the same mutation that

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.120
we humans carry. You can see that the
wild-type mouse has the non-human sialic

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.550
acid on its sperm, the knock out mouse
doesn't. And so we said, "Well, let's use

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.810
these mice to prove whether this mechanism
could function." And we could show that

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:02.620
yes, the immunized mice would make
antibodies that stick to the sperm. The

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.440
two groups of females, we mated with
different males, had similar comparable

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.670
levels. And there were antibodies very
importantly in the female reproductive

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:17.480
tract of these mice. So, that would be a
way to model female immunity being hostile

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:24.160
to the ancestral molecule. And after
hundreds of mating experiments,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.660
effectively the only group of pairings
where there was a 30% reduction in

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:34.680
fertility was with females lacking a
sugar, making antibodies against a sugar

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:42.380
that was on sperm that was mismatched.
Now, 30% reduction in fertility, is that

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.910
important? Could that drive speciation?
And this is where Stevan Springer came in

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:53.610
and came up with an instantaneous model of
selection with pay-off matrices of all

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:59.380
possible combination between the genotypes
of males and females. Interestingly, this

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.750
process could not start by sexual
selection. This is a type of sexual

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:09.190
selection, female immunity, punishing
sperm for carrying the wrong sugar. But if

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:15.050
a pathogen were to introduce and favor the
mutation, very quickly as the frequency of

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.980
the mutation rises in the females, males
get rewarded by also losing the sugar

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.840
because they gain compatibility. And after
a certain moment, you can cross a

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.350
threshold from negative selection in
females, in pink, to a net positive

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.150
selection in black. In males, as soon as
there is enough females that lack the

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.510
sugar, it is worth losing the sugar. So
that should gain compatibility. We modeled

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:48.900
the effect of both the degree of
incompatibility and promiscuity and it

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:55.290
showed that with a promiscuity of about
three matings per ovulation. So a female

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.850
would have to mate between two and five
males for each egg. And a frequency of

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:06.310
only about 0.4% which is 1 in 25 females
will be homozygous. This process would

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:12.430
become a directional selection fixing the
allele. So in a cartoon version, the idea

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.810
is that pathogens are prominently driving
the sugars on your cell surfaces, that's

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.510
why we have blood groups. But usually
these changes go back and forth. And they

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.370
generate selection that oscillates and
results in polymorphisms that do not fix.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:32.960
But if this process comes on the sexual
selection via female antibodies against

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.960
molecules on the sperm, you have
directional selection that rapidly fixes

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.510
the loss of functional mutation. So what
we propose might have happened somewhere

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.990
in the past and possibly at the beginning
of the genus Homo is a very important

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:54.880
pathogen driving changes in the glycocalyx
of the host. Some of the hosts would have

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.640
been homozygous. They would have looked
very different. The females by virtue of

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.070
their new mode of life with much hunting
and contact with other animal products

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:09.190
would have been immunized against this
sugar. That immunity also protected them

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:14.790
from infection from these bugs, but it
would preclude optimal compatibility with

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.870
males that still had the ancestral
molecule, eventually driving apart two

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:25.850
populations even within the same sympatric
environment. So as a model for sympatric

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:32.520
speciation of ancestral hominids. The hope
now is to get fossil material to actually

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.960
look for incorporated monosaccharides as
far back as 3 or 4 million years and find

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.320
out which lineages still have both sugars
as opposed to which lineages already had

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.254
just one sugar and would make a better
candidate for our ancestors.

00:15:47.254 --> 00:15:49.785
Thank you very much.
