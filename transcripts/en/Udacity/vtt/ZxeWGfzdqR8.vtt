00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 0.72.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The way we get there is to take the variance and divide it by the square root of n--83.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Then factor in the magic number 1.96,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is the two-sided 95% confidence interval number for the normal distribution.

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That gives us 0.72.
