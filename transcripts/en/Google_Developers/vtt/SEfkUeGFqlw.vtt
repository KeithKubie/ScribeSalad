Nikhil Chandhok:
Okay, I'm going to talk about
two specific products over here,

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:10.634
one being AdSense video units.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:12.300
It's a way to, uh--

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.901
It's a syndication
and monetization product

00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.000
that we put approximately
six to eight months ago.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.734
And it's essentially targeted
at web publishers,

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.434
who want to enhance their site
with monetized video.

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.734
And then I'm going to talk
about custom players,

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.167
which is another feature
of our site,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:32.667
which is a way for people
to actually display playlists

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.000
on their site.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.133
A lot of what we--
A lot of you are already used

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.601
to displaying embedded players,
like single clip embeds,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.934
on your site.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:43.868
But being able
to display a full playlist

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:46.567
lets you write a richer story,
add more context to your site.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.767
So both of these are about--
These--

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.901
Both of these concepts are
focused on web masters,

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.300
web publishers, so to speak.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.868
I know a lot of you guys
are API Developers.

00:00:56.868 --> 00:00:58.467
But I still think it
will be useful for you

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:04.133
to understand all the--
all the syndication products

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.901
that YouTube provides.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.767
And maybe you can leverage
some of these products

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.501
in an interesting way

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.300
within your
application source websites.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.200
So Video Units--
why should you care?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.067
It's a way
to enhance your site.

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:22.234
It's a way to enhance video,
add video to your site.

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:24.167
And you say,
"Yep, I can do that already."

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.067
I can pick a player on YouTube,
I can add it to my site.

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:30.133
And you know, the video plays,
I write a blog,

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.100
and I can add some text
around the blog,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.501
and it's a fantastic solution.

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.567
Well, what Video Units says,
lets you draw up

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.234
a piece of code on your site,

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:41.167
and it lets you
contextually target the video.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:45.601
So, much like AdSense,
where AdSense is able

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.601
to sense the page, and
figure out what is on the page,

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:52.467
Video Units is able to figure
out what is on the page,

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:55.334
figure out the relevant video
in our index

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:57.367
that can be showed
against that page.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.968
And then what are the ads
against that page?

00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.667
What are the ads
against the video and the page?

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.334
And serve them all together
in one package solution,

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:07.701
which we'll walk through
right after this.

00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:10.834
So, it's about contextual video.

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:14.133
And the last thing--the most
important thing, I think--

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.534
A lot of people
have asked me this question

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.067
is, "How do you derive revenue?"

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:20.167
It's our first monetization
product that we've put out

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:21.801
as part of YouTube syndication.

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.868
So it's a way for you to derive
revenues from the video itself,

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:29.300
instead of--instead of deriving
revenue from the overall site

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.534
that you're building,
using the video, okay?

00:02:32.534 --> 00:02:34.834
And feel free to stop me
at any time with any questions,

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.801
or clarifications that--
Can everybody hear me okay?

00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:40.234
Yep.
Okay.

00:02:40.234 --> 00:02:42.667
So how does it--
What does it mean?

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:46.267
So, normally
when you see a video on YouTube,

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:52.234
it has--this is an example
of an Audi A4 video on YouTube.

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:55.868
It's got it's little--
it's playing on YouTube.

00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:57.267
And it's got this little
embedded player

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:58.634
that you guys are used
to seeing.

00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:00.400
The Adsense Video Units
player

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.100
is actually a different kind
of player.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.133
And you see this player--
If you look at the player,

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:07.734
it has a banner ad on the top.

00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:10.868
And the video is
still playing inside the player.

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:13.534
And there is an in stream ad
on top of that.

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:16.667
And what happens is--
And the concept is essentially

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:19.801
this player gets syndicated
from YouTube,

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:22.400
and then ends up on a
publisher's site,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.267
where the publisher
is then syndicating the video

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:28.400
for YouTube.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.701
It is enhancing
the publisher's site,

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.868
and also the publisher
is participating

00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:34.167
in a three-way revenue share.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:37.901
So the way it work is,
the content--

00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:40.067
the only content we can monetize

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:42.601
is the content that comes
from YouTube partners.

00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:44.868
So it is not all the content
in the YouTube index,

00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:47.501
it's a section of that content

00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.534
that we have verified
who the owner is,

00:03:49.534 --> 00:03:52.100
and now we can run ads
against this content.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.734
So there's one big difference
around what content can flow on.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:57.100
The content is bundled with ads.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.267
So right here,
if you see up there,

00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:03.000
there's an ad unit that goes
with the content.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.834
It's not just a standard
embedded player,

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:09.234
where there is no ads;
the ads travel with the player.

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:11.501
And the last part being,
it's a three-way revenue share.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.767
And you might ask,

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:14.801
"Who are the three parties
in the revenue share?"

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:17.033
Well, it's yourself,
who's the publisher,

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:20.033
it's Google,
and it's the content-owner,

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:21.534
who is actually
giving us the content,

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:25.234
and is--has not been
participating in the value chain

00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:28.000
so far, but it's our way
for help them make--

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.400
help them make some money.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.067
So that more, and more good
content can flow in the system.

00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:33.701
And everybody
in the ecosystem

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:36.734
can then derive the benefits
of syndication.

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.968
Any questions on this line?
Yeah?

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:45.300
man:
Is it ever a two-way revenue
share where you don't have--

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.033
It's, like, maybe a popular
video, but it's [indistinct].

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.701
I show it on my site,
I split it with Google,

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:56.901
but that person never
sends it down.

00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:59.067
Chandhok:
Yeah.
No, we cannot do that.

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:02.000
Because I mean, the value has
been derived from the playback.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.601
And, um...

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:06.133
The lawyers would argue

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.601
that most of the value
has been derived

00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:09.000
from the playback,
and we have to make sure

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.267
that we know who the owner is
before running an ad

00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:12.534
on the--on the video.

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:13.868
man:
Thank you.

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:15.367
Chandhok:
Sure.

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:17.367
man:
Does the video--you mention
that it's sort

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.901
of contextually targeted,
does the video actually change

00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.634
based on what text is
on the screen?

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:24.133
Chandhok:
Yep, it will change based on
what text is on the page.

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:25.634
It'll change automatically.

00:05:25.634 --> 00:05:28.434
It'll change based on--as
new content comes in our index,

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:31.934
we try to keep the videos
as fresh as possible.

00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:36.701
So the idea there is not just
about deriving revenue, right.

00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:39.234
Traditionally AdSense publishers
have looked at all AdSense units

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:42.234
as a way to derive revenue,
and this is a way to deri--

00:05:42.234 --> 00:05:44.400
to drive engagement
in an automated fashion.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.434
So I have a car blog,
and I put up this.

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:49.801
One day it might be
an Audi video that shows up,

00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:53.434
another day it might be
a Honda video that shows up,

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.200
but the idea there is
that we can show you

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.501
fresh and relevant content
at all times.

00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:00.334
man:
Okay, just as a follow-up,
so how is that relevant?

00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:03.701
Is it sort of calculated?
Is it based on the words?

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:05.100
Chandhok:
Yeah.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.734
Uh no, the relevance is--

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.501
So we get meta data associated
with the video,

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.868
that comes in with the video.

00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:11.767
And we max that meta data.

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:13.300
We have
a traditional AdSense servers

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.834
that are figuring out
what ads to run on the page.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.767
Those same AdSense servers
are figuring out

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:19.200
what category the page is in.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.133
So they figure out,
"Oh, this is a car page,

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:24.400
"so we need to go look into--
go look for a car video."

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.534
And then we have algorithms
in the back that figure out,

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:30.000
"Okay, what's a popular car
video that monetizes well?"

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.300
That's going to be relevant
to this page.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.701
And then we serve it up.

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:36.200
When multiple signals going into
it, for like, the elements,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.334
freshness, um, child safety--
all those things.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.167
Because we want to make sure
that what we are syndicating

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:44.701
is more or less safe.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:47.501
man:
So there's a basic piece
of the meta data there

00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:49.133
is captured during upload,
right?

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:50.934
Chandhok:
Yeah, it's captured
on the video site.

00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:53.167
Yeah, on the video site
it's captured during upload.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:55.234
But then again,
it's matched against the page.

00:06:55.234 --> 00:06:58.801
So we don't go into the spoken
word of the video, you're right.

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:00.567
Okay?

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:01.667
man #2:
Can I ask a question?

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:03.400
Chandhok:
Sure.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.534
man #2:
So on an international page,
do you have to take the content

00:07:05.534 --> 00:07:07.534
of the page
and send it back to Google?

00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:09.501
Chandhok:
No, I mean,
Google will crawl it.

00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:11.167
If your participating
in AdSense,

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.567
Google is automati--whenever
you sign up for AdSense,

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.133
you take a domain,
and you give it to AdSense.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:16.934
And you say, "Hey, I'm going
to run ads on this page."

00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:18.734
The way AdSense works,
is it comes--

00:07:18.734 --> 00:07:20.634
the crawlers come out,
they figure out the page,

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:22.567
and then we pick up
the signals from the page.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.868
And um...

00:07:24.868 --> 00:07:26.467
we target the video on the page.

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.334
Sure.

00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:31.501
man #3:
So you're running basically,
a targeted video advertisement

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:33.634
and a contextual advertisement
on top of it?

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:36.367
Chandhok:
It's video content,
plus textual advertising.

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:38.968
man #3:
That means that content is going
to be provided by the people

00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:40.801
who are syndicating it
on purpose.

00:07:40.801 --> 00:07:44.300
So for instance, if I had a car
on my page that had video,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.601
it's probably being presented
by the manufacturer.

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.000
Chandhok:
No, no, no.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.234
It's a lot of our partners,
our regular partners,

00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:51.434
we have very big partners.

00:07:51.434 --> 00:07:53.901
I--Off the top of my head,
I don't know.

00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:57.634
So all our...
like, Lisa Nova, and Smosh--

00:07:57.634 --> 00:07:59.100
All of them are participating
in the program.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.534
So you
have entertainment content,

00:08:00.534 --> 00:08:04.634
you have car content of course,
coming from car magazines.

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:08.934
I'd like to say TalkGear
is a partner,

00:08:08.934 --> 00:08:11.467
but I don't remember if the BBC
is partnering with us on this.

00:08:11.467 --> 00:08:15.300
And we have a bunch of content
that is not advertorial.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.300
So a goal of this content
is not advertorial content,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.234
it is actually content
that is engaging and useful

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.501
to a user who is coming
on the site.

00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:25.968
And oh, by the way, the content,
it's high-value content,

00:08:25.968 --> 00:08:28.634
and the cost--typically you
would pay to syndicate.

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:31.400
As a publisher, you would pay
the owner of the content rights,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.901
to actually get the content
on your site.

00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:35.601
In this case, we are saying,
"We'll support it with that.

00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:36.934
"It comes bundled.

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:38.567
"And the cost to you,
publisher, is nothing."

00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:39.701
Okay?

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.934
Last question.
I got to move on to--

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:44.901
man #4:
So is it possible that you could
be talking about content

00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:46.968
for, say, a BMW car.

00:08:46.968 --> 00:08:48.033
Chandhok:
Yeah.

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:51.334
man #4:
And starting off an Audi ad.

00:08:51.334 --> 00:08:54.400
Chandhok:
Uh, it could be an Audi--
depends, I don't know.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.901
Hopefully, our systems
are not that stupid.

00:08:56.901 --> 00:08:59.767
[laughing]

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:02.100
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.267
Chandhok:
Yeah, then you know,
it could pick up anything.

00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:07.567
Yeah, I mean, it's going to pick
up--it'll key off the key words.

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:10.434
And that's just the challenge
of all contextual--

00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:12.167
The classic example is Java.

00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:13.601
Are you talking about Java,
the language,

00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:14.701
or java, the coffee, right?
So...

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:16.200
[man speaking indistinctly

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.400
Chandhok:
Hopefully our Ad systems
are smarter than that.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.801
Uh, what are the ad types?

00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:23.300
There are two types of ads.
Clearly, there's ads on top.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.033
Which can be banner,
or text ads.

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:28.634
So in the previous example, you
saw a text ad being on the top.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.968
In this example, I have a banner
ad, which is a 468 by 60 unit,

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:35.801
bundled with a video on the top.

00:09:35.801 --> 00:09:38.367
It can be CPC text
and image ads.

00:09:38.367 --> 00:09:40.267
It can be CP image ad
on the top.

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:46.033
In Stream typically tends
to be a text ad or image ad,

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:48.100
but it tends to be a CPC ad.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.334
Okay?

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:51.467
[short silence]

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:53.067
How do you configure this?

00:09:53.067 --> 00:09:55.767
It's much like AdSense in the
sense that you drop a piece

00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:58.968
of code on your site.

00:09:58.968 --> 00:10:00.367
The code is generated for you.

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:02.701
You configure your player
using your AdSense account.

00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:05.467
You are able to adjust the size
of the player.

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:07.200
You're able to pick up
multiple player formats.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.868
If you look over here,
there are five player formats.

00:10:08.868 --> 00:10:10.167
They're kind of small.

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:12.200
As I walk to the demo,
you'll see those.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.734
And then the last,
and most interesting piece is

00:10:14.734 --> 00:10:18.033
you are able to focus the video
choices using key words

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:19.367
and categories.

00:10:19.367 --> 00:10:22.968
So if I have an auto blog,
and let's say we have

00:10:22.968 --> 00:10:24.601
"Autos and Vehicles,"
as a category,

00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.400
And then we have "News and
Ent"--"News" also as a category.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.200
So lets say I don't want
any news content on my site.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.834
All I want is like,
good quality auto content.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.667
So what I'm going to do
is just uncheck the "News" box.

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.901
I'm going
to uncheck the "Humor" box.

00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:42.234
I don't want anything funny
about cars on my site.

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:45.400
So all I want is something
about "Autos and Vehicles,"

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.801
and all I want is that.

00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:48.567
If I'm not
an "Autos and Vehicles" site,

00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:51.667
if I'm an "Entertainment" site,
all I want it entertainment,

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:52.934
I'm gonna choose that.

00:10:52.934 --> 00:10:54.534
I'm going to start
getting the Smosh videos,

00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:55.934
the Lisa Nova videos,

00:10:55.934 --> 00:10:58.133
whatever else has
been syndicated in our index.

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:00.400
If I just choose "News,"
I'm going to start

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.667
getting everything
that's being syndicated

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.467
by the local stations
on my site, right?

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:05.968
So it's a combination of--
it gives you enough--

00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:08.400
You can choose all categories.
You can choose two categories.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.734
You can choose three categories.
It's up to you.

00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:13.267
And then you can use keywords
to further inform us

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:18.234
on how to do--on how
to optimize the targeting.

00:11:18.234 --> 00:11:21.033
Okay.

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:24.734
Where do I--Where do you
go see your revenue in AdSense?

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:28.934
Within Adsense, there is the
concept of AdSense for content.

00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:33.167
And within that, if you use--
if you are using AdSense ads

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:36.133
on your site today, it's
called "AdSense For Content."

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:38.267
There's a channel
that gets created within that.

00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:40.167
It's called, "Video Units."

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.868
And you start seeing
your revenue flow through that.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.767
Okay?

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:46.267
So this is pretty simple,
and once you drop it,

00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:47.868
the channel
gets created automatically.

00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:49.033
You sign up for it.

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:50.701
Everything just starts flowing
into that.

00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:52.834
[short pause]

00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:54.300
Uh, demo.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.767
So I'm gonna
quickly walk through

00:11:57.767 --> 00:12:00.501
what it means to do this.

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:02.534
And so I'm--
This is my AdSense account.

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:04.300
I've already logged into
my AdSense account.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.100
And if I go into AdSense Setup,
which is their second tab,

00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:14.167
I can--I can then
see AdSense for Content,

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.834
which is the typical ads
that you drop on your site.

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:20.267
AdSense for Search, Referrals,
which we are retiring,

00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:22.968
and then Video Units is the
fourth unit that was put out.

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:25.367
And now we have
AdSense for Mobile Content.

00:12:25.367 --> 00:12:28.067
So when I click on Video Units,

00:12:28.067 --> 00:12:30.100
that just takes me
to my YouTube account.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.767
So prior to this, uh--

00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:35.801
Prior to this talk,
I've gone ahead and linked

00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:37.634
my AdSense account
and my YouTube account.

00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:39.501
And the reason
we have to link those accounts

00:12:39.501 --> 00:12:42.367
is YouTube was an acquisition,
and they still haven't

00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:45.734
migrated all our YouTube
accounts to Google accounts.

00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:48.734
Once we are done
with the migration of accounts,

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.234
it should be
a one-click process,

00:12:50.234 --> 00:12:52.634
and hopefully you don't have to
associate those two accounts.

00:12:52.634 --> 00:12:54.100
So for now,
you have to associate--

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.968
You have to go through the pain
of associating those accounts.

00:12:57.968 --> 00:13:02.033
And then I can create
an AdSense Player.

00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:06.133
And I can say, well--

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:12.067
"My car player."

00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:13.300
Can pick a color.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.334
And so I pick blue.

00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:17.968
I'm gonna use
an expandable unit,

00:13:17.968 --> 00:13:19.934
which is a 728x90 unit,

00:13:19.934 --> 00:13:24.133
which is a standard
IB size unit.

00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:26.801
We have three units
which are not expandable.

00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:32.534
The 400x415, 500x510
which are more focused on--

00:13:32.534 --> 00:13:33.834
which are full-size units

00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:35.868
in the sense that they
are not IB standard units.

00:13:35.868 --> 00:13:39.334
There is no standard
IB video player size yet,

00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:42.567
so what we tried to do
was create expandable units

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:44.167
that fit within
existing inventory

00:13:44.167 --> 00:13:45.667
that publishers would have.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:49.067
So 728x90 and 160x600.

00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:51.133
This is the other unit we have.

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:52.667
It's a 160x600 unit.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:53.701
It's a vertical unit

00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:55.434
which shows
a bunch of thumbnails,

00:13:55.434 --> 00:13:56.701
and then you can
click on a thumbnail

00:13:56.701 --> 00:14:02.234
and it expands
into the playback experience.

00:14:02.234 --> 00:14:03.467
I can choose my content,

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:06.167
so I'm gonna
choose Autos &amp; Vehicles,

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:10.534
and I'm going to
unselect everything else.

00:14:10.534 --> 00:14:13.934
We have bunch
of categories here.

00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:15.968
If it's a pet site,
you can put pet content.

00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:17.133
Gaming.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:18.834
We have a lot
of gaming content coming in

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:20.534
after Spore was launched.

00:14:20.534 --> 00:14:22.834
A lot of people uploading
a lot of Spore content.

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:25.567
All of that gets monetized
really, really well.

00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:30.067
And then I'm gonna
say Generate Code.

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:32.701
And so my player was created.

00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:34.801
And this is the code
for the player.

00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:37.467
I accidentally created
a vertical player,

00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:39.100
but all what I have
embedded in my blog

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.501
is a horizontal player,
so I'm gonna show you that.

00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:44.200
So if I go here on Blogger,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.234
where I've actually
embedded the player--

00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:51.434
It's a player about cars.

00:14:51.434 --> 00:14:57.367
And I'm able to scroll through
multiple videos over here.

00:14:57.367 --> 00:15:03.300
And I'm able to play
this video right here.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.467
Right, so this is a car video
that got syndicated through us

00:15:06.467 --> 00:15:08.200
by one of our--

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.033
It's a video about--
classified as Autos &amp; Vehicles

00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:15.234
that got syndicated to us
by one of our partners.

00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:16.701
On this one,
you're seeing a banner ad,

00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:18.567
which is of text,
and then in-stream ad,

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:22.801
which is also around text.

00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:24.767
And you get paid every time
a user clicks on an ad,

00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:27.934
so if I click on this ad--

00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:31.033
User is taken off the site
and at that point

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:36.534
there's a publisher payout event
that happened.

00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:44.701
So at this point I can
play another video.

00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:50.701
I can skip through videos.

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:54.400
If I went back here,
and I went back to this--

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.767
Sorry.

00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:00.000
I think I lost...

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.133
I could actually change
the category of the content.

00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:09.701
Right there, from...

00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:16.934
Instead of Autos &amp; Vehicles,
I could choose Film &amp; Animation.

00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:20.467
Save the player.

00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:26.467
And if I went back here,
and refresh this page,

00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:30.734
I have different content now,
showing up in the player.

00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:32.067
So again--so if you have
a network of sites

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:33.801
that you're managing,

00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:36.167
it's the same piece--
you're creating one player.

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:37.567
And you had,
depending on if you have

00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:39.033
a class of websites
that you're managing,

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:42.100
all you'd--you have one central
console to manage your players,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.467
and then all this
monetized content

00:16:44.467 --> 00:16:45.767
being distributed on that site.

00:16:45.767 --> 00:16:47.667
So again, over here,
this is entertainment.

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:50.634
Also, we chose Film &amp; Animation.

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:55.834
So I don't know what this is,
but it's funny.

00:16:57.234 --> 00:16:58.501
Okay. Any questions on this?

00:16:58.501 --> 00:17:01.501
I have seven--
how many more minutes?

00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:03.868
Seven.
[chuckles]

00:17:03.868 --> 00:17:05.367
Sure, uh, black. In the black.

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:06.801
woman: Could you
repeat what you said

00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:09.200
concerning having
a YouTube account

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.801
and, like, an AdSense--
if you have--

00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:12.801
I have an AdSense account.

00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:13.968
Chandhok: Yeah.

00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.167
woman: So what do I have to do?

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.267
Chandhok: So you--when you
go inside AdSense,

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:20.901
you just click on...

00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:26.167
I'll show you.

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:29.033
It's gonna log me in.

00:17:29.033 --> 00:17:31.634
You go to AdSense Setup.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:34.400
And click on this link.
Click on Video Units.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.934
And it'll walk you through
linking of the accounts.

00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:38.133
Okay?

00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:39.734
woman: That will take care
of your YouTube--

00:17:39.734 --> 00:17:42.901
Chandhok: Yeah. It'll walk you
through how to do that.

00:17:42.901 --> 00:17:43.901
Is there another question?

00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:45.234
Yeah.

00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:46.701
man: I'm still trying
to understand how to see--

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.434
where three-way revenue
is gonna be going.

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.701
Chandhok: Sure.

00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:52.534
The three-way revenue share
is essentially

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:58.534
between yourself the publisher,
the content owner, and Google.

00:17:58.534 --> 00:17:59.934
Does that make sense?

00:17:59.934 --> 00:18:01.834
man: But who's paying?

00:18:01.834 --> 00:18:03.534
Chandhok: Who is paying?
The advertiser is paying.

00:18:03.534 --> 00:18:05.501
It's ad supported.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.501
So when the ad runs,
somebody clicks on the ad

00:18:08.501 --> 00:18:10.167
or there's an
impression of the ad,

00:18:10.167 --> 00:18:11.434
the advertiser is--

00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:13.667
Advertiser is paying
to advertise on that content

00:18:13.667 --> 00:18:15.167
and on your site.

00:18:15.167 --> 00:18:17.868
And when a click
happens on the ad,

00:18:17.868 --> 00:18:21.133
revenue is generated, and then
that revenue from that ad

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.100
is spread between
the three people

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.934
who are participating
in the syndication.

00:18:25.934 --> 00:18:28.000
man: So I have to have
a content platform,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.734
and I can Google Survey the ads.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.033
Chandhok: Yep.

00:18:31.033 --> 00:18:34.300
man: Somebody providing
some content or information.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.534
Chandhok: Yep.

00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:38.033
man: And in order
to get to see that content,

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:39.734
I have to watch it there.

00:18:39.734 --> 00:18:42.400
Chandhok: Yep. It's the cost
of the content.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.367
When you watch cable television,

00:18:44.367 --> 00:18:48.033
you are paying Comcast money
per month to watch television.

00:18:48.033 --> 00:18:49.834
On this, it's ad supported.
Right? So.

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:52.868
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:56.267
Chandhok: We try to optimize
for the highest rpm on that one.

00:18:56.267 --> 00:18:57.534
Yeah.

00:18:57.534 --> 00:18:59.601
man: You mentioned that
sport content modifies as well.

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:01.033
Chandhok: Yeah.

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.868
man: In that case, who do you
consider the content owner?

00:19:02.868 --> 00:19:05.267
Is it the guy who uploaded
that custom video?

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:06.934
Or is it support?

00:19:06.934 --> 00:19:08.200
Chandhok: Uh, it's EA.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.601
Because the sport is different,
because it is--

00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:12.834
It was created
within the environment,

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.334
the EA environment.

00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:17.267
So EA actually owns the content.

00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:18.501
man: Even though it's user--

00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:20.968
Chandhok: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:19:20.968 --> 00:19:22.367
Yep?

00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:24.734
man: Do you plan on allowing
any further custom relation

00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:26.834
of the YouTube--

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:30.601
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:33.234
Do you plan on
allowing more fine tuning?

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:34.434
Chandhok: Yep.

00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:36.501
So we are looking
into providing more, like,

00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:38.767
different more formats,
which are more flexible.

00:19:38.767 --> 00:19:40.033
Last question; I gotta finish

00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:41.868
one other part
of the presentation.

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.667
man: Since you mentioned
that the videos

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:47.300
can only be monetized with
a deal with the content creator,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.100
do you have an idea
of percentage-wise

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.634
what you see now, and what
you kind of expect to see,

00:19:52.634 --> 00:19:55.434
in terms of video served,
as to which--

00:19:55.434 --> 00:19:56.834
how many videos are monetized?

00:19:56.834 --> 00:19:59.067
Are we talking, like, 1-2% now,

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:01.400
maybe growing to 10
by the end of the year?

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.300
Chandhok: I can't give
exact numbers, but in absolute--

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.067
I can't give exact
percentages of, like,

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:08.667
how much of the corpus
is monetizable,

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:11.133
but in absolute numbers of,
like, con--

00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:14.734
We are the largest
cleared content depository

00:20:14.734 --> 00:20:17.400
on the internet.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.767
And I can make that claim.

00:20:19.767 --> 00:20:22.901
It's large enough that you
will not run out of content.

00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:24.334
That's what I'm gonna say.

00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:25.434
Okay?

00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:26.767
I don't have
a good answer to that

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.133
because then I'd be giving
private information.

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:32.567
Okay, there's one other
thing I wanna share.

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.734
I'm gonna do it very quickly.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:38.567
So what we just discussed
was about video,

00:20:38.567 --> 00:20:40.934
and it was about
building contextually--

00:20:40.934 --> 00:20:42.167
bringing context--
[clears throat]

00:20:42.167 --> 00:20:43.434
Sorry.

00:20:43.434 --> 00:20:45.501
Bringing contextually targeted
video to your site

00:20:45.501 --> 00:20:47.334
and have it supported by ads,

00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:49.100
and then deriving
revenue from that.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.067
We have another
feature on our site,

00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:53.200
which we call Custom Players,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.701
which is a simple way
for you to embed playlists

00:20:55.701 --> 00:20:57.067
on your site.

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:59.934
So everybody's familiar
with embedding single players,

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:01.467
but not a lot of people know

00:21:01.467 --> 00:21:04.868
how to embed playlists
on their site.

00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:06.801
Again, we have multiple
player formats here.

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:10.934
We have a full page player
with thumbnails along with that,

00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:12.133
and then we have
a smaller player,

00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:15.467
which kind of cycles
through the playlist.

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:17.234
You can display any
YouTube playlist through this.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.133
It is not limited
like video units.

00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:21.000
Because there is
no monetization, right?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.267
So all the content in the index
is available to syndicate,

00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:28.501
and again, much like the--
the demo you just saw,

00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:30.501
you can change
the playlist on the fly,

00:21:30.501 --> 00:21:32.267
and the players
update everywhere.

00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:35.300
So it's a very
simple thing to use.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.567
How do you configure it?

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:40.067
Again, you do it
through your account.

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:42.234
It's--You choose your videos,
you choose your player,

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.434
you choose--you choose
the colors of the player,

00:21:44.434 --> 00:21:46.801
and then you choose the playlist
you want to embed in.

00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:48.200
So I'm going to
quickly demo this

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.067
because I have two more minutes.

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:53.334
So if I go to my account,

00:21:53.334 --> 00:21:55.234
I click on Account.

00:21:55.234 --> 00:22:00.300
I can go to what is called
Custom Video Players.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.901
And I can create
a custom player.

00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:08.367
So, this one I'm going to
call Spore Videos.

00:22:08.367 --> 00:22:10.734
Make it pink.

00:22:10.734 --> 00:22:14.000
I'm gonna choose
the small one over here.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.300
This is a playlist
I created in the past

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.667
when we launched the Spore--

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:20.100
when we launched Spore
a couple of weeks ago.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.033
It's a bunch of Spore videos.

00:22:22.033 --> 00:22:25.367
And then I'm going to
say Select.

00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:29.467
Generate code.

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:33.534
Go to Blogger.

00:22:33.534 --> 00:22:39.467
Make a new post.

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:53.334
So now I'm gonna be able to play
my Spore videos right there.

00:22:53.334 --> 00:22:54.767
So you can see the little--

00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:56.767
what we like to call
the Genie pop up

00:22:56.767 --> 00:23:00.267
with all the videos over here.

00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:02.300
[video's music playing quietly]

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.033
I can skip through videos.

00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:07.834
I mean, I can watch these
for hours, but...

00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:09.267
[audience laughs]

00:23:09.267 --> 00:23:11.400
man: Is it, like,
an automatic--

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.767
Chandhok: Yeah, it automatically
cycles through, and, like, uh...

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.167
And if you go back--

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:16.234
I can go back and make this

00:23:16.234 --> 00:23:18.334
a Joe Biden playlist,
if I wanted to.

00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:19.834
It's all controlled
from the back.

00:23:19.834 --> 00:23:21.434
Sorry, go ahead.
There's a question.

00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:23.033
man: Most of this is

00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:26.434
from a different paced
current generated...

00:23:26.434 --> 00:23:27.934
I know you guys have
a subset player

00:23:27.934 --> 00:23:30.000
for industry
password combinations

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.534
for a popular drawing platform
and other services.

00:23:32.534 --> 00:23:36.367
Is there a philosophy on that
on how to do the syndication

00:23:36.367 --> 00:23:39.400
if I mail stuff,
can I paste in that code,

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.000
or it could be
supported in more other

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.467
subscription files
that are more automatic.

00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:46.434
Chandhok: We want to get
as automatic as possible,

00:23:46.434 --> 00:23:48.501
so, I mean, the way--

00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.400
The direction
I want to move in is

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.167
all of this
is programmable to an API.

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.767
So any platform, like,

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:57.501
if you have word press,
or automatic out there,

00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.868
using our APIs
and embedding the players.

00:23:59.868 --> 00:24:02.801
I mean, the more--We have no--

00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:05.634
I think if you're not sensitive
to one channel or the other.

00:24:05.634 --> 00:24:08.701
Right? So any channel
that works is good for us.

00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:10.734
man: The biggest
alteration you might make

00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:13.133
is if in the future, especially
if it optimizes the platform--

00:24:13.133 --> 00:24:14.133
Chandhok: Yep.

00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:15.467
man: Somebody walked in--

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:16.601
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:24:16.601 --> 00:24:17.601
--walked into
a lot of their own files.

00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:19.033
Do you get more--

00:24:19.033 --> 00:24:20.567
Chandhok: Yeah, so this player
actually then has to become

00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:23.334
an open social gadget;
it has to become smarter.

00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:25.467
Right now, it doesn't know
how to talk to the container.

00:24:25.467 --> 00:24:26.968
man: It might be cool,
if you go

00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:27.968
in that direction
with the actual--

00:24:27.968 --> 00:24:29.033
you have to have syndication...

00:24:29.033 --> 00:24:33.200
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.601
Chandhok: Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:37.000
It's a good idea.
[chuckles]

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.267
I should do it.

00:24:38.267 --> 00:24:40.000
[audience laughs]
[man speaks indistinctly]

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.300
[Chandhok laughs]

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.033
Um, I mean, I can't say--

00:24:45.033 --> 00:24:47.934
You might be
the first person to think of it.

00:24:47.934 --> 00:24:49.634
It's all--We're always
looking for feedback.

00:24:49.634 --> 00:24:52.300
So, well, I mean, we are
constantly evolving the player.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.467
I know that the player
is dumb today.

00:24:54.467 --> 00:24:56.667
So, but it runs
on MySpace, right,

00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:57.901
so, it's got--

00:24:57.901 --> 00:24:59.634
it's a Flash Player,
it runs on MySpace.

00:24:59.634 --> 00:25:02.667
All the pages on MySpace
are not really container pages.

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:05.367
There's this
little container section,

00:25:05.367 --> 00:25:07.667
and that's not really
flexible enough for us to, like,

00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:09.100
move the player.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.934
I mean, we would like to have
a smarter version of the player,

00:25:10.934 --> 00:25:13.200
it's just not enough
container pages out there.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.868
man: You're saying that
the content index, like,

00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:18.434
makes it a much higher bar
for the average person...

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:20.868
Chandhok: Yeah.
It does, it does.

00:25:20.868 --> 00:25:21.868
Anything else?

00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:22.868
Yeah.

00:25:22.868 --> 00:25:24.200
man: Is there a way to show--

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.000
for the videos that are
playing in the playlist,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.567
is there a way to show the title
and descriptions as they play?

00:25:29.567 --> 00:25:32.000
Chandhok: Um, no,
but we should--

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.501
Hopefully we put out an API
which lets you query the player,

00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:39.567
and then you can
manage that yourself.

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:42.501
[coughs]

00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:45.801
Any other questions?

00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:47.834
Okay. Thank you.

00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:51.968
[applause]
