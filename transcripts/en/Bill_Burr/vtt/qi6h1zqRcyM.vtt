00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.480

Fully based bars in front of what's up, fool podcasts and uh,

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.450
let's get all the hype out of the way. At first we got a,

13
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:44.730
you have a new HBO special? Yes.

14
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:49.731
A new HBO with Bash on September 30th at 10 September 30th at 10 on HBO.

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.780
That's where the HBO specials are called. Translate this. So, uh,

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.810
let's get into it. Tell me about that. What's it like to shoot a, uh,

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.670
hour long special for HBO?

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.600
<v 1>Um, it was, it was good. Um, I shot in myself. Um, I, I,</v>

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.830
um, I got the money together, I saved up some money and my wife and I, we,

20
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.790
um, we chose San Jose Improv and we got cloud shires.

21
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.180
And, um, it was all DIY, you know,

22
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.000
<v 0>so you did it yourself and an HBO liked it so much they bought it. Oh,</v>

23
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.190
so when you were doing it, you weren't thinking like, Holy Shit,

24
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.120
I'm doing an fields

25
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920
<v 1>that I don't know where it's going to go. Like, oh, go to Netflix somewhere.</v>

26
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.170
Even Amazon. Yeah.

27
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.690
<v 2>No, but that's, I think that's a, uh, that's a great way to Donna,</v>

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.260
fuck is nobody giving you a shot. I don't know.

29
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.210
You know why you're not white like me. Um, I gotta be honest,

30
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.250
before we, I did this, you know,

31
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:45.500
I was looking up like videos and all that type of stuff to make sure I got

32
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.230
something to talk about. So it doesn't become this, like,

33
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.050
my biggest fear with these interviews is it's just gonna become this horrific

34
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.200
staring contest. Cause I'm such a huge fan of what you do.

35
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:57.470
And I had never seen the, um, the Irish,

36
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.360
a few in Irish affair was hosting the show. Uh,

37
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.920
this isn't happening when you told that whole story about,

38
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.050
uh, being in the gang and fight in the guy biting his era and shit,

39
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.020
it's just like, like I was listening to that, that story. It was like,

40
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:17.021
this is like at least three different Tarantino movies and then you ended in and

41
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.080
just such a nice place. Um, I don't want to force you to tell this story again,

42
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:22.060
but if you could just read it.

43
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.890
<v 1>Mine, um, I would start by where did you grow? I grew up in, um, Boyle heights,</v>

44
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.330
California. You know, Los Angeles, but east la, but it's called Boyle heights.

45
00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:35.440
You know, east La is like further east,

46
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.790
east Los Angeles. You know, it's by almost close to Monterey Park,

47
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.480
but Boyle heights in the neighborhood right after the fire away. Is that,

48
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.380
to put it in white perspective, how far away is that from the staple center?

49
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.160
Ooh, if I were to walk,

50
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.780
it'll take me like an hour and hour drive. Probably 50 minutes with him.

51
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.980
Two minutes. Okay, cool. A 30 minute bus ride. Okay. 30 minute bus ride.

52
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 2>So you grew up, uh, what you, what,</v>

53
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.740
what decade you were a child of what you Katie's you're the eighties okay.

54
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.690
<v 1>[inaudible] eighties so that was the real deal. Yeah. I grew up in,</v>

55
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.700
my neighborhood was in the housing projects [inaudible] Pico Gardens and there

56
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.580
were like three separate in housing projects. There was at least so village,

57
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:17.391
Pico,

58
00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:22.391
Aliso and then Pico Gardens from first street to like sixth street and there was

59
00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:26.480
like Saint Mary's with like a shit load of gangs, like maybe 11.

60
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.570
<v 2>How did you, now when you're not in a gang and you're a young kid,</v>

61
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.740
how do you negotiate? Like I got to get from my house,

62
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.620
I got to go pick up my, my fuck, I got to go do my laundry,

63
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:42.030
I got to go to school. How do you negotiate? Is it a no. A gangs.

64
00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:43.050
24 seven

65
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.980
<v 1>Oh yeah man, the 25th that neighborhood they were 24 seven p I,</v>

66
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.140
<v 2>I always thought they came out around five like anybody with like just live in</v>

67
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.020
the regular lifestyle goes to bed and then they just kind of give up this,

68
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.333
the area there. Yeah.

69
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.290
<v 1>And those gangs, they come on at five.</v>

70
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.240
They're like the gangs that are still living in a gentrified neighborhood. Okay.

71
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.050
They don't come on a daytime. They might call the cops on them. Oh yeah man.

72
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:10.340
But most gangs, you know from Echo Park, they come on at night, man.

73
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.270
Robbing people. Really? Yeah. They come on at night. Those guys were,

74
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.610
where were the gentrification? Those gangs are still around,

75
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.630
but they come on at night and they gang bang or different areas, you know.

76
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:24.630
But they're still gang banging. It'll hot yet.

77
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.820
How old were you the first time you got mugged?

78
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.650
I got mugged on the first time when I was like 18 years old. My friend,

79
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.170
I'm cocoa. That's pretty good man. Yeah.

80
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:38.310
I got called 18 downtown crossing when I was like in eighth grade.

81
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.620
That I was like, I was out selling crack on my first day like that where they,

82
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:44.880
one hour I got robbed,

83
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.960
somebody put a knife behind my back and other knife in my like in front of me

84
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:50.790
and they took all my, my crack away

85
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.460
<v 2>to call you crack away. So then, then what do you have to do?</v>

86
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.831
<v 1>Oh,</v>

87
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.820
I have to go back to the guy who gave it to me or a friend of mine who I grew up

88
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:57.271
with, you know,

89
00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:01.620
he passed away already cause they used to call them cocoa and we grew up

90
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:05.460
together. Him and I were, um, from second grade to adults.

91
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.480
I needed money at the time I got somebody pregnant and I didn't know how to make

92
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:14.160
money. So I asked him for a job in the criminal business,

93
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.390
can I, you know, hey man, I had no money. How does that go down?

94
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.300
You probably how avoid it. It's like I don't want to sell drugs, but I,

95
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:25.950
I kind of have to now I got a kid calming, so help me.

96
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.610
So he gave me like $100 of, of crack, you know,

97
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.630
a hundred to just bring me back a hundred. They didn't give you more to sell.

98
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.850
So as soon as I got out, they didn't know who I was in that neighborhood.

99
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.850
They just came around me and he took all my stuff.

100
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.990
They didn't hurt me or anything.

101
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.880
I was begging for my can I keep my id and they gave my id. I liked it.

102
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.690
How scared were you? I was scared, man.

103
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.750
I thought they were going to kill me right there. I was starting.

104
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.340
I felt like I was young. I was really scared, but I was calm, you know?

105
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:59.750
I wasn't like, uh, right. Just take your mind. Just take you, leave me alone.

106
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.030
You know, just walked out of I take it.

107
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.570
I didn't fight him or nothing cause I knew they would've killed me or stab me or

108
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.943
worse.

109
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.780
So went back to my friend Coco and I told them what happened and I thought,

110
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:14.360
you know, he was going to be okay man. You know it's alright. You know,

111
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.300
that's your first hands. It happens. No Man,

112
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.800
it man that night and it like it took with it.

113
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.690
He gave me the crack and I go on midnight,

114
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.310
I go rather our one 30 at two 30 in the morning, I'm back at his house. What,

115
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.090
who robbed you? Cause so what happened? He gave me a gun,

116
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.700
he gave me some sense of rice.

117
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.830
He got himself a pistol and he and he put a blue handkerchief on [inaudible]

118
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.700
head and up and he put a black beanie on and we both were looking for those

119
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:44.534
guys.

120
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.360
And you must've been praying to God like I don't want to murder somebody to

121
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:51.050
first. Oh hell yeah. Mouth pray. Please don't find those guys. Wow.

122
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.270
Cause I thought I was like I would've probably would done anything.

123
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:57.080
He would have told me, oh the vulnerable. I was weak. Right. You know I have no,

124
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.371
I didn't know what to do.

125
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:03.371
So we went together and we saw one guy that saw what happened but he didn't do

126
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:09.350
anything and, and then like he kinda like hit him real hard and who did it? Man,

127
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.140
where are the ad then I said, man, it wasn't here man. It wasn't him.

128
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.760
So it wasn't him. Wait, how did that, I see you all. I basic,

129
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.010
I remember that guy standing there watching me get robbed.

130
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.470
So now this poor pastor gets dragged into it. He gets dragged into any,

131
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.430
he got like he got a gun slap, you know by my friend.

132
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.030
He's my friend name and ask him a question and he just hit him in the face hard

133
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.350
man and like started beating,

134
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:35.510
I mean the year and I just say wild man. He was looking at me like, come on man,

135
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.400
please tell him they wouldn't meet. So you wait until after the pistol slap.

136
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.990
Oh Hey, I met them at to tell you this. It wasn't him.

137
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.530
So we got nothing happened to him and we went back and later on those guys who

138
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:52.160
actually did it, walked back and gave it back or everything,

139
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.540
get back to crack to that guy and everything was cool because of what he has

140
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.200
said. Sorry, we didn't know that they were afraid of that guy. Yes.

141
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.470
I really don't know. Batman went with you. Yeah, we should st nicknames. Yeah.

142
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.290
So then after that, then they knew that you were with him,

143
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:08.900
so then people stopped fucking with you. People stopped messing with me. Yeah.

144
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.910
Jesus Christ.

145
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:14.150
This is what kills me about you is you have like a thousand of those stories and

146
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:18.470
you're the most relaxed, laid back guy ever.

147
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.170
Like where did it all go? Because Dude, I look at me,

148
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:24.800
I sound like I lived your life and you sound like you lived my life.

149
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.330
Like you sound like you grew up in a nice little culdesac area and played street

150
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:33.710
hockey and I'm all fucking wound up. How did you do that? Well,

151
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.150
I have a mom. I have parents.

152
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:38.600
I had my mom and dad and most of my crazy friends and the project,

153
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.640
you know the crazier ones, they didn't have a mom and dad. Right.

154
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.620
They had nobody telling him you better come home early or there was nobody

155
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:48.440
telling them those kids to come home. The lights go on in the streets.

156
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.800
So they had no really nobody telling them what to do, how to live. Right.

157
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.850
No discipline. I had my mom and dad, mom and worked and my mom stood up,

158
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.640
Amman worked at a elementary school at the doors,

159
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.540
be home from selling crack when the streetlights came on. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:06.810
You had that. But I've always got family foundation,

161
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.440
but I don't get that. I just now you're talking, you've got a home life,

162
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.170
but you're telling you you're doing all this other shit. I know the kid,

163
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:17.550
you know when I was like 13, 12, 14 years old, I wasn't crazy. Oh,

164
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.830
I see you crazy. After high school. That's the one I'm pregnant.

165
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.210
I just didn't know what to do, but I was always like a little hustler man.

166
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.420
My Mom was saw a barn and I will collect the money for her.

167
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.970
[inaudible] you know, so I learned how to collect money for people,

168
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:34.440
at least from my mom was always telling her, um, herbal life, Avon,

169
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.970
she was always studying something.

170
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.810
Can we live by the warehouses in downtown la where the factories are at,

171
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.650
where other trucks will come in and pick up stuff on the trains and take them to

172
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:44.484
like stores.

173
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So when Momma knew where like we used to go to this one factory and we,

174
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.380
we used to um, put a bunch of that synthetic cotton, the plastic one,

175
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.620
they would throw it away and my mom and I will put it in bags,

176
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:03.240
like hefty bags and then we go to another place where they will throw these

177
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.340
raggedy old sheets.

178
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.590
And then my mom was so those regular old sheets with the cotton and then we'll

179
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.740
walk, we'll go the door to Dell, door to door in a housing project.

180
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:14.820
Selling pillows.

181
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.583
<v 3>Okay.</v>

182
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.530
<v 1>So you guys were a real green family man. You were there, you were there.</v>

183
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:27.550
Recycling [inaudible] we saw we fired a trash and we've slowly, like,

184
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.030
we've so pillows I used to when I was like 14 I used to walk to downtown to do

185
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:38.110
with pallets. Would you build a little house and then sell that? No Man,

186
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.280
that's too much work. I want to, we want fast money. Oh, okay. Cash.

187
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.450
Although with a bunch of factories where I live, you know,

188
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.500
I felt like I felt like Henry Hill from Goodfellas. Right.

189
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.790
Because they were always stealing stuff from the airport and we were always

190
00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:54.940
taking stuff from the factories. I wasn't stealing from these factories.

191
00:10:54.941 --> 00:10:58.870
My friends where I was taking stuff on the trash, like, um,

192
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.270
though there was a watermelon factory and they will throw away rotten

193
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.100
watermelons and I will get the watermelons and clear them in a watermelon.

194
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.130
Like they, they make watermen like [inaudible] should grow them.

195
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.100
Know that they were getting from the farmer, I guess. And they, right.

196
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.090
They would hold them there. They have pallets full of watermelon from could.

197
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.430
There's like a grocery area of downtown la where every grocer gets all this

198
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.580
other stuff. Flowers, stereos, you know, you name it bananas.

199
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.640
I know where everything is. That suits the cheap suits.

200
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.810
I know where everything's at.

201
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.410
So we'll get the hang out and just go to the dumpsters.

202
00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:37.870
And whenever they threw out, you would then go sell. Yeah,

203
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.140
I will cut the watermelon and a half and then go sell it to the Mexicans.

204
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.570
They laborers, everybody that working in the factories, much of immigrants.

205
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.940
Right. And that was the half a water metaphor.

206
00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:53.941
A dollar $2 five I'll just cut the writing piece off.

207
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.970
You know what I mean? Oh, it wasn't awhile. Nobody looking.

208
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.070
I will send my little home girl, this girl,

209
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.660
the little less well should have lesbian now,

210
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.180
but we didn't know she was a lesbian now. She was like a tomboy.

211
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.750
I was sending her in there with my brother and then when there was like when

212
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.621
they were, nobody was looking,

213
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:10.630
they would throw good watermen in the trash can too.

214
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.270
So we had a mixture of good and bad water minus.

215
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:18.330
How long did you stay in that whole world of selling crack and all of that and

216
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.060
all those fights and biting the guy's ear off and all that shit before you

217
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:24.670
became a comedian, like how long, how long was that period of your life?

218
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.860
That was my period of from 18 years old to like 21 and a half.

219
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.480
21 and a half because at 21 it's when I was like messing up already man.

220
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.420
I was like, I'm out smoking a lot of PCP.

221
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.010
That was like my drug of choice for the time being. And Man,

222
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.390
I used to get all grades, PCP,

223
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.600
PCP and like I think it's an elephant tranquilizer.

224
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.880
That's what people tell me.

225
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.380
I always say that grown a PCP angel does and all that and that Angel Angel does.

226
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:58.120
It's like coming crystallized PCP. You could put it in a cigarette butt PCP.

227
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.520
In my neighborhood, we were at the PCP Capitol of the, of Los Angeles,

228
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.600
like in my neighborhood, they sold gallons of it. People had to,

229
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.020
they wouldn't have on sparklers water full of PCP,

230
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.100
so everybody had PCP. Wait a minute, you how did, did you ingest it? You smoke?

231
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.290
No, you, they're like a, I'm giving away secrets here.

232
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.780
I'll tell you. I'm asking because everybody tries to act like, Oh,

233
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.880
you understand [inaudible] I don't know any of that stuff.

234
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.090
You will get a new port, cigarette out, Korea, menthol, cigarette,

235
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:36.190
a new port and then you put your arm and you dip it instead of a little jar.

236
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.960
Like, I'm just a tip.

237
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:43.050
And that's a $5 tip as a $5 dip it dip it again at 10 you dip a whole one is 20

238
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:48.340
you know, you, you soak in this $30 it's by dip. You know,

239
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.760
now I get it. That's like when I drank booze, there's like the 10 year old shit.

240
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.390
You're the way up to 25 then you get into the cognacs and that can be like,

241
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:55.660
I dunno,

242
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.420
like I don't wines and shit could be like a century year old and something.

243
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.660
So there's one night I was smoking PC pint.

244
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.360
Just cause I'm stupid as hell when it comes to it. So what is it?

245
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.070
What stat highlight is man, it's like you're the incredible hoke.

246
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.780
If somebody attacks you,

247
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.960
oh this is a shit when like five cops shop and they gotta see that.

248
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.380
I've marked that. You see that child Bronson movie? That's where three,

249
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.070
when one white boy, like the surfer he's been at,

250
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.670
he's fighting all the police officers. He's on PCP. Okay, I got to rewatch that.

251
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.430
Yeah, man. PCB you think you have,

252
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.390
I'm like incredible hoke strength. But you just have like Mo,

253
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.870
you don't feel pain, but while people are hitting you, man,

254
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.390
you could just keep attacking forever. You know what I mean? Right.

255
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:40.240
And then the next morning you wake up and you feel like you played 12 years in

256
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:42.850
the NFL. Yeah, man. All right.

257
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:45.850
So the first time you smoked PCP and that shit hits you,

258
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.450
it's like literally like you're turning into like a superhero. Yeah, man.

259
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.220
Well, the one time, what did you do? Did you try to bend something? Nah,

260
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.720
that's what I want to talk cops now. No, that's what I would've done.

261
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.450
I would've tried to pull something off the fucking wall.

262
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.970
I better go to the Arona. Well that when I would let walking around, they'll,

263
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.180
I'll be coming to be known as Batman. You know, he's crazy. We'll chalk for him.

264
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.580
Why did they call you? Why did they call you Batman? Cause I'm,

265
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.040
I love Batman and I used to wear my, those um, superhero on the ruse.

266
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.500
[inaudible] and 18. Yeah, mass duet. Where the Batman shirts still afraid.

267
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.080
So I wore it and I didn't know where to get a Batman shirt anywhere else.

268
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.020
It was the underoos factory right down the street. Yeah.

269
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.580
It took it out of the dumps to the bad projects. Yeah. That's amazing.

270
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.810
All right, so you're doing all that. I'm watching. Um,

271
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.440
I'm at the drive in theater with my friends smoking PCP watching terminator to

272
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.110
asking why I saying I'd fight that guy. Yeah man.

273
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:50.570
And I'm thinking about the guy that's been bullying me for the last two weeks.

274
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.860
So I go, no, wait, if you smoke that, say a guy views,

275
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.980
I fuck I shouldn't do this cause I'm like doing a commercial here for the drug.

276
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.400
Say this, somebody bullying you and you, you can't beat that guy. Right.

277
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:05.810
If you were to smoke some pee PCP, it definitely would give you the belief,

278
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.730
but can it overcome how slow you are and your inability to slip a punch and you

279
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:14.320
just walked through is shit. Yeah man, you're throwing punches. Cause, um,

280
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.010
when I, when that got into a fight with these guys,

281
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.530
I w they told me I was doing things that I remember doing that they told me that

282
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:25.340
took my belt off and I was whipping them all over though we keep alluding to the

283
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:27.490
story. You gotta tell this story, right? So you're Batman,

284
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.770
you got on your under roofs, you smoked PCP at the driving.

285
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.960
He saw the terminator two when I left the Terminator two movie,

286
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.560
I come back into a project and I see this guy that he looked like an old dude,

287
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:43.310
man, he's like 30 years old. He just came out of prison. He don't know who I am.

288
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.850
He's like calling me bad names and I'm pushing me and pushing me and I don't

289
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.090
want to fight him pushing me. They finally, I socked him in the face,

290
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.750
but I kind of missed that. He hit me right in the eye and he hit me hard.

291
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:01.190
And My, I got black right away. He punched me in a face. I started bleeding.

292
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.270
They started choking me. So when he started choking me, that's when I like,

293
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:09.200
I went crazy. I went crazy, man. I lifted him up,

294
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.980
dropped him better. I bit his deer. Well, first of all, I've been here.

295
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.520
I've been here. I've never let the whole Cogan ever tell your brother.

296
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.730
Let me ask you this. When you paid his ear off, were you underneath?

297
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.090
Are you on top of him? I was like underneath him. He was choking me.

298
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.870
And you just, all of a sudden that PCP, I paid it off, man.

299
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.810
I never thought my skin is solos.

300
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.770
Easy to bite off and spin crochet out ice? No, not even,

301
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:38.630
man. I spit it out and I started punching him and then my friends told me that,

302
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.770
um, wait, what did he do? Oh Man. I took the hits like a soldier.

303
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.400
So when you bend his ear off, this guy seal scout, he's,

304
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.590
he's screaming like a little girl. Okay. Do you think pain?

305
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.510
So he's Kinda screaming like a guy got his ear bit off.

306
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.110
He's agreeing with that point. I think you still a man, if you,

307
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.930
if you go up a few octaves when you're missing a fucking deer,

308
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.160
but I don't know why. I believe Europe mainland. No, I get, I had no choice.

309
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:04.800
You know, he was choking me. Sounded like that was the move.

310
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.040
No one was helping me. He wasn't, didn't seem like he was going to be stopping.

311
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.180
All right.

312
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.790
See you beat you then you took your belt off and you or my friends told me that

313
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.670
I took my belt off an authority whipping him.

314
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.670
Like he was like chasing him with a belt, whipping them. Like, like he was like,

315
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.000
oh, runaway property or something. And how many people are witnessing this?

316
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.780
It's wild 15 people. But they're all assuring me on showing him on,

317
00:18:28.781 --> 00:18:32.550
nobody's helping the enemy hits that word. Get like nowadays,

318
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:35.610
if they do that would be, that might be like,

319
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.020
it would be epic PCP guy, epic belt guy.

320
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:43.140
They'd be something like that. Or would have been a rap song.

321
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.560
Autotune Batman wherever. Yeah. So wait a minute. So when you,

322
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.130
so you don't remember doing that. So there was like, oh fuck,

323
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:53.100
this guy's going to kill me. Then you start to bite his ear off. You're like,

324
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:55.200
wow, ears come off really easily.

325
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.720
Then you sort of blackout and then like where you just sort of came to with like

326
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:04.740
blood all over. You going like, uh, the night of a hotdog or stuff together?

327
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:08.250
The next day I wake, the next day I'm walking, going around, it's like 10,

328
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.270
seven in the morning, eight in the morning. I don't know man. I'm looking at,

329
00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:16.110
my body is full of blood, my pants, my face. You know my,

330
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.130
I have a black guy and my shirt is full of blood. I have no idea what happened.

331
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.640
I have no idea what happened. You probably thought it was your blood.

332
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.600
That's why I didn't know that. Whoa man. I was like checking Stephen.

333
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.390
I got shot or stabbed by somebody they didn't know.

334
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.510
Then my friends told me what happened and the guy was in the,

335
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.190
he went to the hospital for like a broken ribs my senior year.

336
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.450
Missing ear, you know where he's just putting your sporing on in that house.

337
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.140
And they went to, he were laying in bed and they asked him if I'm,

338
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.560
do you want to press charges? You know,

339
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:54.360
cause everybody know there was witnesses. Everybody knew who did it and he said,

340
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:58.500
no, we're going to handle it the right way. And I was like, wow,

341
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.960
I didn't even know know this until later on like a week later he goes, yeah man,

342
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.770
I think there was like a green light on you right now in the mean like green

343
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.300
light. What do you mean green light? Yeah man, shoot to kill. They see you.

344
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.600
What the fuck. So that's the first time you ever heard that. So now what?

345
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:19.660
Now what do you do besides not go outside? Do they know where you live?

346
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.400
They know where I live, but I don't know the, he's still in a hospital though,

347
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:26.190
but everything's calm, you know, but he's doing a hospital.

348
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:29.160
But I can feel tension from people who are,

349
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.720
who I thought were my friend or one time who I, who I grew up with, you know?

350
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.470
You know they were turning on me like, cause I was never in their gang.

351
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.870
I was in another gang. When you watched the wire, do you like fall asleep?

352
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.460
Is it like boring to you because it was the wire you don't need to you it.

353
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.360
So I'm like, it sounds like a in award-winning series to me.

354
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.080
I'm more like bloody and blood out. So wait a minute. So now,

355
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.470
now there's a green light on you. Yeah. And Hey,

356
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.170
at some point you got to go outside to get food because you're hungry. Yeah.

357
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:02.740
So when you have a green light on you in, in East La,

358
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:05.110
what's a good time to go out to? If you got to go hit,

359
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.380
hit the Mayfair market or whatever. What's it called?

360
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.470
Man that out to go to Dubai. When you know,

361
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.420
when you have a green light and in from anybody, you know,

362
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.080
whether it comes from prison or ever come from just the neighborhood,

363
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.030
it's just relieve man, move somewhere safe. Like Modesto.

364
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.350
What's a more serious greenlight?

365
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.400
If it came from prison or from the neighborhood or the,

366
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.810
if it come from prison and you're a dead man, man.

367
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.230
I mean there's nowhere to go there. Nowhere to go, man. And, um,

368
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.470
I read about these things, you know, on top of it, on books,

369
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.630
there's no way coming back from that.

370
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.870
But there was like only like a green light from his neighborhood, you know,

371
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.740
like go to the mall, no matter like the grove, pick a really white mall.

372
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:51.280
And you know what all those thoughts came to my mind at that time. Like, man,

373
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:54.250
I wish I would like the fresh prince of Bel Air. He said,

374
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.540
I wish that rich white guy didn't take a rich white guy or a wish fucker Mexican

375
00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:01.420
guy. Oh, no way. They weren't wearing that show. That was different strokes.

376
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.900
That was different strokes. But to drumming, they switched it up. They're like,

377
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:09.250
it's different strokes. Except the marathon bought into right now. Yeah,

378
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:10.870
that's what they, oh, they always do that shit.

379
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.500
So my mom called out Father Greg Boyle.

380
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.170
He's like this priest that I grew up with in the neighborhood.

381
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.180
He's from the homeboy industries here in la. That's a thing.

382
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.530
Yeah, he helps. He helps them. Gang members. That's a cool name.

383
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.560
Father Greg Boyle. He'd like a priest from my neighborhood and um,

384
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.750
he's always helped the neighborhood.

385
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:35.470
Like he would go out of his way to help people. He will like,

386
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:38.680
if you like driving and then you like,

387
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.000
he will pick up kids that were drunk off the streets and take him home.

388
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.020
He did that a couple of times for me in a good way. In a good way. Yeah.

389
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:50.950
Like if you're a gang member in the wrong neighborhood and then you know,

390
00:22:50.951 --> 00:22:51.850
you're pretty much,

391
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.300
someone's going to kill you in that neighborhood for the great boy will tell

392
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:59.620
you, get in a van. I took you back home as a, as,

393
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:00.580
as a gang member.

394
00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:05.560
How do you end up in the wrong neighborhood other than a woman, a man on PCP,

395
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.090
they're goddamn pieces. There's no, there's no heroin in your neighborhood.

396
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:13.330
So now you gotta go buy heroin somewhere else. You know,

397
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.010
there's no crack in the neighborhood. You know,

398
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.680
there's a dry spell somewhere and you got to get high,

399
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:20.030
so you're going to go to another neighborhood and buy it. Oh God. Oh,

400
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.390
you have a aunt. So how do they know you're in a different gang?

401
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:25.020
You don't go over there wearing your whole, Your York, your colors, right.

402
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.830
Most of the hardcore gang members, they wear the colors, man. They,

403
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.550
they're not gonna start wearing it colors your boy, they're not on the cover.

404
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.170
They're 24, seven. But other than one, I wouldn't want even one of those guys.

405
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.420
I was nothing like that.

406
00:23:39.421 --> 00:23:42.910
I was just the guy who was just hanging around with these kids.

407
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.980
And then one day I get jumped into a gang and I'm getting

408
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.690
<v 2>into so much trouble, but I don't know, ideas to get beaten into a gang.</v>

409
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.650
Just in case I ever fucked my life up. And I go to prison, you know,

410
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:58.850
when I go to prison, my only hope is I gotta join the area and Nazi guys,

411
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.140
I can listen to them bullshit and pretend I believe it just to save myself.

412
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.870
How long is that beat though?

413
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.410
<v 1>Um, well in, in, in the streets it would be like,</v>

414
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.710
I guess whatever number the gang is. So with 18th Street,

415
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:19.450
you gonna get beat up for 18 seconds. That's it. Yeah. Or, but I mean,

416
00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:23.690
how many guys are all of them? Oh Jesus. Okay. Fuck. Okay.

417
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.250
Strike thing. That's it from the record there. Cause when I got jumped in,

418
00:24:27.251 --> 00:24:28.630
I was just hanging out, man.

419
00:24:28.631 --> 00:24:32.290
Like I was just hanging out and if somebody said I'm a man,

420
00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:36.610
you want to get jumped in. And I wasn't gonna say no. If I say no, I'm a punk,

421
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.540
I'm gonna get jumped in. I'm gonna get judged for being a punk. So I said,

422
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.810
fuck it, let's do it. And then I punched the guy next to me for no reason. Well,

423
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.970
because I want to prove that I'm, I'm, I'm tough. So the guy next to him,

424
00:24:48.971 --> 00:24:52.890
I just knocked him out with one punch man. And then I hit like,

425
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.050
he wasn't even looking. I said, let's do this. And then like, I hit him. Right.

426
00:24:56.051 --> 00:25:00.190
You know, you gotta be ready. Big Dog. You gotta Look

427
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.220
<v 2>God holy this at Warren Sapp moment. Keep your head on a swivel. Look man,</v>

428
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.340
I bet he get the other guy's shit later. Like, Hey,

429
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:09.670
next time you're going to jump somebody yet, can you not say what?

430
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.960
I'm sitting right next to him. You knew he was a lefty. What the fuck? Yeah,

431
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.720
you get beat up, man. And I got Joe by everybody that one in.

432
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:20.600
And did you get more than one end? Did you get one? I got two in one.

433
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.800
<v 1>Him and another guy.</v>

434
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:26.660
But then after that I felt like I'm Nike cortex all over my face.

435
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.130
<v 2>So you're just laying on the ground and you just go one Mississippi two but just</v>

436
00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:37.490
waiting for this rain of, of footlocker to stop coming down on you.

437
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.580
<v 1>Yeah, man. I was like, I thought I was never going to stop, man.</v>

438
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.300
So what do you do? I would just, they're funny. They start over. I hit it off,

439
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:46.160
hit enough. Then everybody hugging me,

440
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:50.240
the same people that were beating my brains up were hugging me and kissing me.

441
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.320
You, I love you. You're my boy. You're my family now. And they're like, wow.

442
00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.940
<v 2>So then you come home. Okay. And then you just sit in there,</v>

443
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.540
all right with fucking sneaker marks all over you. And you're going like, okay,

444
00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:09.160
now I guess I'm in a gang. Jesus Christ. Okay,

445
00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:12.280
so then what happens? Um, I thought it,

446
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.460
what happened was I thought of hanging around white people who talk about white

447
00:26:15.461 --> 00:26:17.950
privilege going through, what the fuck is that? This is what it is.

448
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.950
Totally. Yes.

449
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.650
You can sit there selling lemonade at the end of your driveway and then

450
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.250
accidentally did I just join a gang? There was a, there's a green light on you.

451
00:26:30.251 --> 00:26:33.670
You was selling lemonade at the end of the wrong driveway.

452
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.240
You're in the wrong neighborhood. It was dumb. But you know,

453
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.630
like there was two white boys in my neighborhood that were gangs was one the red

454
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:43.290
headed kid from children, the corn.

455
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:48.150
<v 1>Exactly. He was, he was, he said, well one guy, he was a blood, actually,</v>

456
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.970
he was from east La. Slow man, they call them. Okay. There was a,

457
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.210
there was actually two white boys, mad offensive by the way, but continued.

458
00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.130
There was two white boys in the hood, man. And they were both gangbangers.

459
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.960
And one thing I bought white boy Cholos like when you see a white boy join a

460
00:27:02.961 --> 00:27:06.470
gang and when you see a white guy like someone like you and you're hanging

461
00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:09.680
around with nothing but Mexicans, they're white.

462
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.950
White guys are the most craziest gangsters.

463
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.850
When they were in a Mexican gang and they do stuff that I'm Mexican man will

464
00:27:16.851 --> 00:27:21.350
never think of like, I remember this one white guy, snow man, he was a blood.

465
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.460
He said, man, let's go do a home invasion. And I,

466
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.650
and everybody was asking him where he goes, my mom house.

467
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.000
<v 2>Oh you wanted a home game. All right.</v>

468
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.010
<v 1>And he wanted them, he wanted the eyebrow,</v>

469
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.020
all the homeys to rob his house because he wanted his mom and dad to get rob.

470
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.880
Why? Cause I don't know,

471
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.750
<v 2>they're probably saying stop hanging out with all those Mexicans.</v>

472
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.620
His idea and I was like, Damn.

473
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.640
So they probably behave that way cause they felt no matter what they,

474
00:27:51.641 --> 00:27:54.370
they had to constantly prove constantly man.

475
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.810
Because technically they could just get a haircut or whatever,

476
00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.880
put away the flannel and just slip, slip away, man.

477
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.310
Slip away down at the grove civil way,

478
00:28:03.311 --> 00:28:07.750
become a social worker and that'll be it. So how long were you in this gang for?

479
00:28:07.751 --> 00:28:09.010
And did you ever get beaten out?

480
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.760
<v 1>No, I wasn't in his gang too. I'm, when I'm father gray boat went and bit,</v>

481
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.410
that guy's deer off. I went to Rehab,

482
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.880
my father Greg Boyle took me to Rehab and um, I, I disappeared for,

483
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.640
I'm still gone. I never went back.

484
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.610
<v 2>Oh, he never went back or, yeah. When you get beaten out of a gang, how,</v>

485
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.320
how long has that beat though?

486
00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.920
<v 1>As long as they want to. Um, I know what we had,</v>

487
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.600
I had a guy on a podcast named Fabian who was in a,

488
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:40.260
in a gang and he talks about, he got beat up, beat out,

489
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.860
he got jumped out and he said that when you got jumped, they just last longer.

490
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.180
But, um,

491
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.180
his uncle is doing the gang [inaudible] expression course.

492
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.530
It's doing the gang. So his uncle oversaw him getting jumped out,

493
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.670
so he didn't get hurt that bad. Uh, I don't have an uncle.

494
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.890
I probably would've got killed if I got jumped out with them when I was 20. But

495
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.490
<v 2>the white version of that is our dad's the judge.</v>

496
00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.580
So we don't go to jail over whatever the fuck we just did.

497
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:13.150
Your version is you got an uncle that oversees being jumped out.

498
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.400
I got to tell you dude, I'm learning all kinds of stuff.

499
00:29:15.401 --> 00:29:17.560
Like I wonder why I don't know my case.

500
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.420
Somebody's just walking by somebody's recorder.

501
00:29:19.421 --> 00:29:22.360
It's always feels weird to have to like re hype something.

502
00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:27.361
So your special on HBO that you shot yourself learning all of your,

503
00:29:27.461 --> 00:29:31.150
do it yourself stuff from fucking going around in those warehouses,

504
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.620
making pillows out of, out of nothing. Um, you ended up shooting this at uh,

505
00:29:35.621 --> 00:29:37.240
the, uh, the Improv in San Jose,

506
00:29:37.241 --> 00:29:39.070
which is one of my favorite classes at a great club.

507
00:29:39.071 --> 00:29:41.650
Cause you feel like you're doing a theater. You know, even it's a club.

508
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:42.484
It's tremendous.

509
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.050
<v 0>And a, you shot it there.</v>

510
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.800
It's going to be on HBO September 30th at 10 o'clock called translate this.

511
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.950
Now are you, um, I know you're a great joke writer, but you, uh,

512
00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:55.060
I saw an Irish a fears you told that and he told the amazing story that you,

513
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:56.440
you touched on today. Um,

514
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.700
is your s a stand up style in this more joke telling more storytelling or both?

515
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.860
<v 1>Well, you know what my, my comedy special is, it's more about, um,</v>

516
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:10.720
it's more about how I got to this country with my parents and um,

517
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.890
being a single father and being a cheater.

518
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.870
But yeah, man, I cheat a lot. I got caught cheating,

519
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.810
cheating all the time. I'm bad. I can't help it.

520
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.180
I love women.

521
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:32.510
I talk about getting caught cheating cause I was caught cheating, you know, um,

522
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.630
burden. Both girls showed up to my house. Oh God. You know what I mean?

523
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.740
Leah in man, it was crazy. And he asked me were you going to save yourself? How?

524
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.080
Checkmate, how long was that beat down that long in 18 seconds.

525
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:52.180
It was crazy. They showed up in the same car with G. Oh,

526
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:55.540
they fray talked to each other. Yeah, man. Well now they film it and shit.

527
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.880
And then you go in there and then you're going to do like an apology and all

528
00:30:57.881 --> 00:31:02.590
that shit though. First 48. Yeah. Wow. Okay.

529
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.710
So you're going to do it. I can't wait to see this, but I'm not sure. I can't.

530
00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:06.820
I really honestly do

531
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.350
<v 0>stand up comedian. I cannot wait to see this. Thank you.</v>

532
00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:12.980
One of the most interesting dudes I've been. How are you so fucking happy.

533
00:31:12.981 --> 00:31:13.740
Go lucky.

534
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.670
<v 1>I don't get it. I Dunno. Imagine love life. You know, I'm never,</v>

535
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.430
I'm never going to go back to that type of lifestyle that I had in my twenties.

536
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.910
And I'm, I just love living life man.

537
00:31:23.911 --> 00:31:27.710
And I'm not going to say that I'm perfect because I'm, I did fall off the,

538
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:31.740
I was where after I went to Rehab, I was sober for 11 years.

539
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:36.360
Like I didn't trust no drugs. I didn't trust no alcohol, no beer, nothing.

540
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:40.650
But, um, along the way you know that the more that they stand up comedy,

541
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.460
the more you know, I did it. Not going nowhere.

542
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.630
I went back to smoking crack. She went right back to crack.

543
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.090
She never really were a booze guy. Huh?

544
00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.880
Now it's probably an unboosted domain gun. He say do,

545
00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:59.160
it's like Ralphie may retweeted my tweet the other night and I'm,

546
00:31:59.161 --> 00:32:03.060
I don't understand what he meant at first because I was in Houston and he

547
00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:07.440
retweeted, um, what y'all follow spoons bro?

548
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.890
And then like, what the hell is roughly where you're talking about him spoons?

549
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.700
Then I say, Oh shit, Burt,

550
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.190
I got so coked out in Houston, Texas.

551
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.600
I, I, they known for that day. I couldn't do no more coke.

552
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.650
My nose was bleeding, so I wanted to rock it up and smoking and crack instead.

553
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.400
You know, cause I want to see you just like,

554
00:32:29.401 --> 00:32:32.340
I'm just going to snort a couple of lines. Yeah. But did you,

555
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.970
did you anticipate like you were like, fuck this, when I go to Houston,

556
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:36.804
I'm gonna Party?

557
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.840
Or was it a spontaneous thing and all of a sudden you just said, fuck it.

558
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:46.190
Oh Man, yes, I was over there. I'll working the laptop in Houston.

559
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.080

562
00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.780
I started partying and I couldn't find no powder, no coke.

563
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:04.520

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.720

567
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.600
<v 3>[inaudible] saga. Ah,</v>

571
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.100
I'm gonna go talk to this comedian.

572
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:33.310
So I spoke to his comedian and then I'm this little Mexican food showed up all

573
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.760
week, take care of me. I give them a free tickets every day. I think you,

574
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.920
and um, I, I don't know what happened, man,

575
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:47.921
but I did too much coke and I felt like I can't do no more code through my nose,

576
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.710
you know, so they're gonna go bad. I want to smoke crack now.

577
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:54.350
You know what I mean? I don't want to stay a long burgers.

578
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:57.530
Now due to reoccurring story with you is,

579
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.410
I don't know what happened last time. He didn't know what happened.

580
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:01.790
You were whipping somebody with a belt.

581
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:04.280
Now you don't know what happened is like a fucking hole in your nose.

582
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.130
Jesus do we, how long ago was this? This wasn't them. 2006. All right, so you,

583
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:12.110
okay. Thousand seven, 2006. So you broke your record, you've gone,

584
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.170
you've gone to 11, five. Yeah, I called up um,

585
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.460
room service to the one who smoked crack and I call it a company.

586
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.240
You would call it a room service. And I say room service. I'm going to need,

587
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:27.410
I'm a big spoon and a baking soda brought over right now.

588
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.490
And they did not bring that to the room. Oh they blinded man.

589
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.550
They did to guy that brought in the guy on the front there.

590
00:34:35.551 --> 00:34:40.280
He knew me cause I'm made friends with him already know from previous times and

591
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.330
he brought it and it was like a big spoon and he brought it arm and hammer

592
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:48.140
baking soda. And the guy with him, he just with, with him to laugh at me,

593
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:50.810
I guess he goes, Hey, I guess I couldn't believe it.

594
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.600
You know this guy you'd order baking soda and spoon. No Way. Let's go see.

595
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.450
So the bolt open the door, they give it to me. They both laugh.

596
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.230
But yeah man, I wanted to smoke crack. Okay,

597
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:07.250
so and then, and then how long were you off the wagon for?

598
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.420
From when? Okay, so you're sober for 11 years.

599
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:16.490
You go to Houston, you order a spoon and some baking soda. Now you,

600
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.480
you snort coke, now you're smoking. I got you partied that weekend.

601
00:35:20.481 --> 00:35:22.190
Did you just come back and go, what the fuck was that?

602
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.710
And were you able to or did you have to go rehab? No Man,

603
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.270
I continue to party man. From that moment on. And the girl I with with man,

604
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.020
she ended up being a hermaphrodite. But that was another story for another time,

605
00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:35.410
you know? But yeah, sure.

606
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.870
The hermaphrodite she had was born with a peanut and a vagina. Right.

607
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.580
<v 2>So like how long was she your girlfriend before you figured that out?</v>

608
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:48.130
<v 1>Well, we were party with three and gentlemen. Yes, that's what I was,</v>

609
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.340
I wasn't a gentlemen.

610
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.600
I didn't want to touch her or nothing because she broke free coke, man,

611
00:35:53.601 --> 00:35:57.320
I can be that guy. So I just kissed her a couple of times,

612
00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.940
but then by the third night, you know,

613
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.250
we were off for three nights to rate her and I,

614
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.870
but when I finally found out I was like, whoa man. Yeah,

615
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.490
that's a big skin tag you got there.

616
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.010
So it was that enough. So it was at enough to get you sober again. No Man,

617
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.360
I didn't get sober again to two, you know the nine that stop sign. All right,

618
00:36:20.361 --> 00:36:25.190
so now we're still going. I didn't get sober till 2009. Oh fuck.

619
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.320
I was off and on.

620
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.241
<v 2>And you are already doing.</v>

621
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:29.690
So during those periods you were still doing stand up and you will,

622
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.690
<v 1>yeah, I was doing standup.</v>

623
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:35.780
I would even know I even got to go to Montreal comedy festival in 2005 and um,

624
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:43.440
I was bad. I did the young comedian show and I did well.

625
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.750
I guess I did well. I got a little,

626
00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:50.820
I little print on the Hollywood reporter. I got an agent.

627
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:55.750
Uta, actually they didn't have any idea you were high. No Man, I was young.

628
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.160
I was smoking crack in Montreal too. I hooked it up. I mean,

629
00:36:59.161 --> 00:37:01.860
I found crack in Montreal. It's funny,

630
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.770
I saw a Mexican guy in Montreal and a new,

631
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:08.260
he spoke Spanish and I told him, man, could you tell him?

632
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.860
I just could tell man he had the boots. You know,

633
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:13.800
he had that look like w w I need a job. You know,

634
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.940
I didn't even know what that means. It's hilarious. He got the boots, you know,

635
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:21.960
he had that look like I just got here. Cross country.

636
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.740
So he spoke Spanish. He spoke Spanish,

637
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.750
no English, but he was know, he knows how to speak French now.

638
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.430
But with a Mexican, you know, Mexican accent, you know,

639
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.210
doing all the romantic languages. So he

640
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.990
[inaudible] and de indicates back a romance language. Yeah, man. Crack.

641

643

MVMT also known as movement.

684
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.200
The company that started what was started by two broke college kids that wanted

685
00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:25.750
to wear stylish watches but couldn't afford them.

686
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.110
They had no money and somehow they started a watch company. Uh,

687
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:34.150
so they started their own watch company. Um, how is this like how you started?

688
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.930
Well, I didn't have any money and I then I started a comedy club.

689
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.240
I built my Kuranda fuck it. What I got,

690

All right, that's it. Okay. Stomach is growling here.

725
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.350
I'm still on my fucking diet. Oh, Billy died.

726
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.020
Some fucking asshole sent me a tweet going like,

727
00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.490
you're obsessed with your fucking weight. You look fine. Get help. It's like,

728
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:05.120
dude, that's why I look fine. You fucking moron. You don't give a shit.

729
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:06.620
You potato skins, Eaton fat.

730
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:11.150
Fuck these guys with your thick fucking torsos. You know what I mean?

731
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.760
Making that noise. When you reach back to get the seatbelt,

732
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.330
trying to pull it around you running out of material.

733
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.880
I don't want to be that guy. You know what I mean?

734
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.180
That guy who gets killed by his airbag because his fat face is too close to the,

735
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:28.220
the miniature explosion. Um, anyways,

736
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:33.080
all things comedy festival by the way, podcast festival, October 26th,

I am going to do my first ever live Monday morning podcast there at this stand

741
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.550
I'll do it live and I'm going to do it just how I do it my fucking house.

742
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.880
All right. I thought about getting the guest and I was like, fuck that.

743
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.570
That's not the CIM of what it is that I do. So I'm just gonna do it.

744
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.760
I Dunno what to lay down on the stage.

745
00:44:01.761 --> 00:44:02.810
I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do,

746
00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:04.670
but I'm going to do it the exact way I do.

747
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:07.910
So if you ever wanted to see this shit live, this absolute train wreck,

748
00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:11.960
if you wanted to see what it looked like in real time, come on down to, uh,

749
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.550
the standup live comedy club in Phoenix, Arizona. October 28th. I will be there.

750
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:20.180
I don't know when tickets go on sale. They on, I guess they're on sales now.

751
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:24.560
They're on ticket links. We're at bill bird.com. There you go. All right. Um,

752
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.300
anyways, let's talk some NFL football. Wetback

753
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.650
did you guys enjoy it? Did your team, when

754
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.220
<v 2>my team won the New England patriots,</v>

755
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:38.520
who everybody said was going to go undefeated and then we lost to the Kansas

756
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:42.180
city chiefs and then everybody said, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

757
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.990
I think Tom Brady is old now. I think he's washed up.

758
00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:47.640
I think the Kansas City chiefs,

759
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:50.310
they're gonna win their first super bowl since 1970.

760
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.710
That's what everybody said,

761
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:57.450
because the Kansas City chiefs beat the New England patriots in September.

762
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.010
Now all of a sudden they can see January. How fucking crazy is that?

763
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.000
How many fucking times? How many times are you going to watch? The giants go,

764
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:09.150
Oh, in two and oh and three and just start writing them off. You saw the points,

765
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:12.360
they scored high. You think they're not going to come back and beat Philly?

766
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.600
They're not gonna come back and be Dallas later on this fucking year.

767
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:19.740
When they all get on the same page, they will protect any lie much better.

768
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.350
According to the 30 seconds of highlights that I saw.

769
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.040
I'm sticking by my prediction. New England patriots,

770
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.970
New York giant Superbowl rematch. All right?

771
00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:35.930
Until the Kansas City chiefs, who I actually like until we Andy Reed, who?

772
00:45:35.931 --> 00:45:40.280
I'm not saying he's fat until those fuckers do something in January.

773
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.033
All right.

774
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.190
I think all you need to sit down a little bit and fucking relax with all your

775
00:45:47.191 --> 00:45:52.050
shit talk and how many fucking guys have you seen throw for 500 yards in the

776
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.960
regular season and get bounced out and the first round of the playoffs,

777
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:58.110
how many times did you see a fucking Guy Zigzag and all over the field?

778
00:45:58.111 --> 00:46:00.210
You can't tackle them and come play off time.

779
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.260
He sitting on a fucking exercise bike wearing a tinted windshield crossed his

780
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.400
eyes. Huh?

781
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.400
The incredible lack of fucking respect that you gave our little quarterback that

782
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:13.950
could Tom Brady. How dare you.

783
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.810
How dare you write off the New England patriots after one fucking week. Huh?

784
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.980
It's all wishful thinking.

785
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.300
We're coming again and we're going to take your hearts out and we're going to

786
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:25.380
pull them out of your chest.

787
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:29.430
We're going to show him to you and then we're going to under inflate them on or

788
00:46:29.431 --> 00:46:32.040
a way to another fucking, actually, we never got caught doing that.

789
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.610
They just suggested that we did it and they got laughed out of court. Um,

790
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.670
and then do, and I really need to address, um,

791
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:44.370
the stupid controversy of the fucking people taking a knee during the national

792
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:48.030
anthem. You know, watching all these white people getting fucking upset by that.

793
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:48.721
Like it really does.

794
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:53.400
It really affects your fucking life and all these fucking idiots trying to make

795
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.760
the point of what they're doing. It's not about your point,

796
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.640
the people who started this thing, it's about my point.

797
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.700
It's about the way that I see it. You know, I had a buddy of mine go, yeah,

798
00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.030
he's fucking guys and make $1 million. You know, he think it's bad here.

799
00:47:07.031 --> 00:47:10.270
Why don't you go fucking move to Syria? It's like, why do they have to move?

800
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.590
Why can't they just live here the way you do? I don't understand that and I'm,

801
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.770
but Donald Trump is a fucking genius that he has everybody talking about this

802
00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:24.771
issue because he is trying to get everybody to stop focusing on the pool party

803
00:47:25.741 --> 00:47:29.440
he had with fucking Vladimir. What's his face over there in Russia?

804
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.160
He doesn't want you watching that. He goes, oh look at this over here.

805
00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:34.540
All right.

806
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.920
He goes down to Alabama and he gets all them fucking people all riled up and he

807
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:41.770
keeps talking about this fatty over in fucking North Korea.

808
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:46.930
That's what he's still doing. It reminds me of when, Oh fucking slick willy,

809
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:48.281
you know,

810
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:51.910
bombed that country cause he stuck his cigar in that woman's Nether region.

811
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.300
This is the type of sick people that become president. This is what they do.

812
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.510
All right? They get caught doing some fucked up shit.

813
00:47:58.511 --> 00:48:01.360
And then I will say this about Trump least he didn't go bomb some people,

814
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.060
unlike what's his face with his bitch hands,

815
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:07.780
who now gets treated like a fucking hero. I don't understand that guy at all.

816
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.240
You know what I mean? Oh, you go oil's cry. Oh,

817
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.330
I got cocky and my Dick sucked in the older office, so I bombed a country.

818
00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.860
I'm outta killed the baby, but I sleep like one ever. Not. Um,

819
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.580
I know I'm a conspiracy theorist. I fucking hate them all.

820
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.600
Did you see that thing? Uh, what's his face in fucking, uh,

821
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:33.470
Korea considered that we declared war on right. So a,

822
00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:37.720
a Maggie, Megan Hall, whenever fucking name is, uh, Maggie Gyllenhaal.

823
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.580
What is a Ford is the fucking,

824
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:42.940
the poor woman who has to go out and fucking give the press conferences now

825
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.150
because that dude with no neck, you know,

826
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:50.290
who kind of looks like the political version of Roger Goodell went out there and

827
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:53.410
fucked it all up. The hell's her name? She's got a classic political name.

828
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.870
I don't know what the hell it is. She said,

829
00:48:55.871 --> 00:48:59.230
the fact that North Korea thinks that we're at war with them is absolutely

830
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.650
preposterous or something like that. And then like a week before,

831
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.220
what's his face? Trump basically tweeted that,

832
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:08.590
that that fatty over there wasn't long for this earth.

833
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.900
And it's like you kind of just said he's not going to last.

834
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.540
He's not going to be around long. That's what he said. Yeah.

835
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:14.920
I mean I would take that as a threat.

836
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.110
All have a dash for his habit dash um, you know what they really need to do?

837
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.050
They both need to just go to a whorehouse together and fucking grow up.

838
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.740
You know, Bang. A couple of whores they need to do a threesome. Right.

839
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.730
One of them is getting blown the others hitting it doggy style and just their

840
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:34.810
eyes meet and they just start laughing being like, this is a great life. Right.

841
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:39.730
You've got a personal chef too. That's fucking amazing. You live in a castle,

842
00:49:39.731 --> 00:49:42.970
live in a White House, inmates. Fuck, it's cool. They should just talk about,

843
00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:46.750
you know, trade stories, the way comedians trade stories about bombing.

844
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:51.340
They could just talk about fucking bomb and other countries and I dunno what

845
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.460
fishing, whatever, whatever people at that level talk about. All right,

846
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:56.950
let's get to the questions for this week.

847
00:49:56.951 --> 00:50:01.150
So I don't have any fucking problem with these, these guys taking a knee.

848
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.300
I try to listen to what it's about rather than,

849
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:08.100
than getting wrapped up in what I'm, what, what it means to me. Um,

850
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.240
uh, great pharmacists writing in dear Billy bag chaser.

851
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.830
I Dunno what that meets. Um, by the way, people 39 days sober,

852
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.680
39 fucking days, and this is, this is how well I'm doing with my sobriety. I,

853
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.030
when I flew to Canada, I went by this duty free and this, this uh,

854
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.940
McCallum rare cas, they got this new one black oak or some shit like that.

855
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:34.580
And I was like, I'm going to buy that. Okay,

856
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:37.760
I'm not going to take it to fucking Canada then suck it down like a fucking

857
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:42.680
jackass. I'm just going to have this thing waiting for me. You know what I mean?

858
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:44.750
For whenever I fall off the wagon.

859
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.440
So this is like what I was thinking the whole ride and like, you know,

860
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:49.580
I'm getting off the plane,

861
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.390
I'm trying to beat the crowd to get over to the taxi line cause I don't fucking

862
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.310
Uber, I never remembered to set up a car.

863
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:56.960
So I always go to the fucking taxi line.

864
00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.260
And what's great at lax is there's never anybody there cause nobody fucking

865
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:03.590
takes a taxi if he's got a friend to pick them up. Um,

866
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.090
I don't know what the fuck they do. There's always plenty of cabs.

867
00:51:06.091 --> 00:51:09.860
So I don't even try to be first in line at the cap stand.

868
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:14.420
I go out of my way over to this duty free place and I grabbed this fucking

869
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:15.254
thing,

870
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.200
<v 6>you know, and I like [inaudible]</v>

871
00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:22.140
<v 2>bring it up to the counter and the lady goes, Oh my God. She goes, fucking, uh,</v>

872
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.260
what a wonderful choice and blah blah, blah, blah, blah. You have great tastes.

873
00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:27.390
I go, I am. I go, I'm on the wagon when I come off,

874
00:51:27.391 --> 00:51:31.470
this is the bottle I'm opening up. She goes, are you going to Canada? I said,

875
00:51:31.471 --> 00:51:32.580
Nope, I'm going home.

876
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:37.500
<v 0>And she goes, Oh, I'm sorry I can't sell you this. And I'm like,</v>

877
00:51:37.501 --> 00:51:39.300
why not? She goes, you have to be going to Canada,

878
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.030
some of the about the duty free. And I'm like, it's legal though.

879
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.510
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

880
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.210
<v 0>Do they sell this anywhere else in the airport?</v>

881
00:51:45.211 --> 00:51:49.230
If you just going back to your home? They're like, no, no we don't.

882
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.800
<v 6>So I dunno.</v>

883
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.700
<v 2>So I had a fucking hissy fit. I had a fucking hissy fit</v>

884
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.650
<v 0>hi to hissy fits one in the way they're going through Canadian customs.</v>

885
00:51:59.651 --> 00:52:00.490
When they made me take the,

886
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.730
the lime green plastic cover off of my fucking laptop,

887
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:08.080
like I somehow had a bomb in there or some sort of bomb residue and I'm

888
00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:10.390
literally taking it off going, I'm going to crack this thing. And they go,

889
00:52:10.391 --> 00:52:12.070
well just try to take it off easily.

890
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.770
It's just like, would you look, I look like fucking howdy doody. What? What?

891
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.450
I'm in this matrix. I like what's going on?

892
00:52:21.451 --> 00:52:23.940
Tell me what you want me to do the fuck.

893
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.550
So they make me take that fucking thing off. Ended up cracking the carver.

894
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.120
So I'm already in a bad mood. So, rather than, you know,

895
00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.520
growing up and realizing that these fucking people at the,

896
00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:38.970
what is it that the TCA, TCP, whatever, fuck it to Geyer tea, what is it called?

897
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.850
TSA. TSA. The fucking TSA.

898
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.330
Rather than just realizing these people are trying to protect me,

899
00:52:45.331 --> 00:52:46.530
which I don't think they're trying to do.

900
00:52:46.531 --> 00:52:49.480
I think they're trying to make it as inconvenient as fucking possible. So I'll,

901
00:52:49.481 --> 00:52:52.500
I'll agree to have my fucking retina scan so they can share that fucking

902
00:52:52.501 --> 00:52:54.900
information and gradually build a fucking robot.

903
00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:03.960
<v 6>Sorry, put this fucking headphones back. Um,</v>

904
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.550
<v 0>yeah, so all I wanted was a bottle of booze. That's all I wanted.</v>

905
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.430
And they wouldn't sell it to me. They wouldn't sell it to me.

906
00:53:11.431 --> 00:53:14.520
So I went online and I'll, I'll figure out a fucking place to get it. All right,

907
00:53:14.521 --> 00:53:17.130
let's, let's do the little right in here. Um,

908
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:22.090
pharmacist writing in a dear Billy bag chaser.

909
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:26.250
Your rant on pharmacist last week was hilarious. We have to be able,

910
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.840
able to laugh at ourselves. Right.

911
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:31.290
I just wanted to weigh in on a couple of things. First off,

912
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.000
the medication you were prescribed,

913
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:38.001
the antiinflammatory drug you've received was in the nonsteroidal

914
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:42.510
antiinflammatory drug class. How the fuck do you know?

915
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:44.970
You didn't even look at it. Maybe you just be, I know,

916
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.520
I can tell just by the way he's talking about it. I understand.

917
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.880
Basically these drugs decrease the formation of prostaglandins and thromb back's

918
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:58.500
named. Those chemicals are involved in the inflammation process,

919
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.030
which itself causes pain.

920
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:05.031
So these drugs can't just decrease inflammation without also decreasing pain,

921
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.060
thus being labeled a pain killer. Oh, okay.

922
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.520
<v 4>Okay.</v>

923
00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.880
<v 0>And ceds are not in the opioid family. Okay.</v>

924
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.090
Are Not happy habit forming. I don't know what this guy's talking about,

925
00:54:17.091 --> 00:54:20.300
but it sounds like he's blowing my argument out of the water. However,

926
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.910
they can be very dangerous in susceptible.

927
00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:24.140
<v 4>Okay.</v>

928
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:27.290
<v 0>Populations. Why can't you say with addicts,</v>

929
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.180
susceptible populations, you guys are such fucking creeps in that world.

930
00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:37.760
And sades n s a I d s and says,

931
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:43.080
increase the risk of cardiac events, kidney damage and stomach ulcers.

932
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.110
I'm sorry, recovered addicts. Uh,

933
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:48.930
usually in the elderly or those with preexisting conditions.

934
00:54:48.931 --> 00:54:51.000
I'm not sure what the other drug you receive was.

935
00:54:51.001 --> 00:54:54.750
If it was a narcotic opioid painkiller and the doctrine pharmacist did not

936
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:58.770
discuss it with you, they would be now negligible on their parts since when?

937
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.970
Since when? I want to know, um, now that the, uh,

938
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:07.560
the fucking heroin epidemic is completely out of control in the state of Ohio is

939
00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:09.630
suing pharmaceutical companies.

940
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.140
I guarantee I graduated four years ago and the dangers of narcotics was

941
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:14.310
extremely stressed.

942
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.970
Now all the medical bodies are communicating the dangerous of narcotics to

943
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:22.320
practitioners and overseeing that prescribing is done appropriately.

944
00:55:22.321 --> 00:55:24.330
And maybe this is just the fucking

945
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:25.763
<v 4>okay.</v>

946
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.410
<v 0>It's just how we are. You know, like when we first,</v>

947
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:31.770
they first had that DDT and they sprayed it all over the place and this is like

948
00:55:31.771 --> 00:55:35.130
great. We just ended all these plagues and then we did all this damage to the

949
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:38.640
environment. We created this fucking window that is starting to close,

950
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:42.330
I feel where it was this golden age of not having to walk around with a fucking

951
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:46.830
Boyle on your face and dying of the black plague. And, um,

952
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.050
<v 4>okay.</v>

953
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.550
<v 0>We just got a little out of control with it,</v>

954
00:55:49.551 --> 00:55:53.960
which would have been great is if as we are radicating all of these different

955
00:55:53.961 --> 00:55:56.990
diseases, if we somehow didn't grow the population,

956
00:55:56.991 --> 00:55:58.640
I feel like that's the sweet spot.

957
00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:03.290
I feel like that's what the fucking Illuminati should be discussing is like what

958
00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:07.550
is the optimal number of people, including ourselves of course,

959
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:12.170
who should be allowed to survive while we keep all the modern day technologies.

960
00:56:12.171 --> 00:56:17.120
So we can still live this awesome flatscreen life with no plagues.

961
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:18.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

962
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.570
<v 0>But like we also can still sustain like living on this fucking planet.</v>

963
00:56:22.571 --> 00:56:24.820
What is thing? What is, what is that number?

964
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.660
And they're not taking college cause they're a fucking closed entity. All right,

965
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:31.540
let me read a few more of these. Wow. How much time are we up to at this point?

966
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:37.900
18 minutes. 18 minutes plus 37 is 55. Okay. All right,

967
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:42.780
so here we go. Gold money.com dear Billy copper nuts. Uh,

968
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:47.860
I heard you talk about gold money.com on your pot Monday morning podcast.

969
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:50.530
Whoever emailed you about it didn't explain it very well.

970
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.950
I feel like all these are just like free commercials. Um,

971
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:55.660
I haven't put any money into it yet,

972
00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:59.350
but now I'm going to speak about it as an authority a,

973
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:02.020
but I am considering it as it seems pretty legit.

974
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.870
If you listen to Rogan's podcast with Peter Schiff,

975
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:08.260
he explains it pretty well and makes a good pitch. Yeah.

976
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:10.150
But that guy stands to profit off it.

977
00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:13.420
Granted shift admits that he invested money in the company. Yes. So he's out.

978
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.033
He's out.

979
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.420
I want an independent fucking data.

980
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.550
I can even find that anymore.

981
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:24.520
Evidently they sell you the gold at a low market price.

982
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:27.490
Half of 1%, I think.

983
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.050
What do you mean half, half of 1% of what?

984
00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.650
That's just sort of a number floating out there, right. Uh,

985
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.190
stored for you in a vault of your choosing with your name on it.

986
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:42.400
And if you want it, they will actually mail your gold to you for free.

987
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.220
Many of them have like five grams or something.

988
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:49.780
You also get a mastercard debit card that you can use to spend your gold slash

989
00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:51.340
money. Evidently you can use,

990
00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.610
you can even get a debit card that is made of real gold,

991
00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.310
which sounds fucking baller. The Federal Reserve and powers that may be,

992
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.790
may never let it work, but it seems like a great idea. At least.

993
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:07.390
Thanks and go fuck yourself. Yeah, there's a bunch of great ideas. Yeah,

994
00:58:07.391 --> 00:58:11.280
I'm all set on that. Hey, you give me your cash and uh,

995
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.030
we'll put it in gold in a vault that you choose.

996
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:19.430
That's not where you can see it. Um, all right. Dating and Saudi Arabia.

997
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.720
Now maybe, I dunno, I that sounds like a, even if their,

998
00:58:23.721 --> 00:58:25.820
their mind is in the right place,

999
00:58:25.821 --> 00:58:28.820
it's going to go belly up and then they're all gonna write themselves bonus

1000
00:58:28.821 --> 00:58:31.220
checks off your gold. That's what I would guess what happened.

1001
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:34.340
Or the Federal Reserve will come and say this is all legal and take all the gold

1002
00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.670
and then act like it's in Fort Knox when it's really fucking, uh, I dunno.

1003
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.300
I don't know where the fuck it is. Somewhere in the Hamptons. All right.

1004
00:58:41.301 --> 00:58:45.620
Dating and Saudi Arabia. Hey there, Billy pie. Billy the pie maker.

1005
00:58:45.621 --> 00:58:47.080
Hope you're having a great day. Anyways,

1006
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:51.510
I wanted your advice on this problematic shit that I'm stuck in. I met this guy,

1007
00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:53.190
<v 7>lady</v>

1008
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:56.990
<v 0>through a common friend of ours. Oh God. We talked and this is nuts,</v>

1009
00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.780
is going to get messy when you break up with her and you're going to lose her

1010
00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:03.230
and a friend a we talked. She's really cool person.

1011
00:59:03.231 --> 00:59:04.520
We got a lot of things in common.

1012
00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:08.840
Then we met again twice as a friend and now I want to ask her out,

1013
00:59:08.841 --> 00:59:09.920
but here's the thing.

1014
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.270
She is a Gypson and I'm Indian and we live in Saudi Arabia.

1015
00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.280
Rabia and dating is illegal here.

1016
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.880
Well then what the fuck did you go out with there for now?

1017
00:59:19.881 --> 00:59:23.430
Your Heart's going to get cause you to get your fucking, what do they do?

1018
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.770
Have that beat your feet in the square.

1019
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:29.240
They're going to fucking slap your dick around in public or something.

1020
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.400
Whatever the punishment is over there.

1021
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:34.850
I made the authority could deport you immediately or worse,

1022
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:36.470
send you to jail for years.

1023
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:40.190
Now I really like this girl more than your freedom.

1024
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:43.100
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1025
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.730
<v 0>All right. Now I really liked this girl and I like you not even love this girl.</v>

1026
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:51.731
And I've already thought of have names for our kids before she even said yes to

1027
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:52.670
me.

1028
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:57.410
But I'm really stuck on thinking through my brain.

1029
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.590
Okay, this is second language here. I'm gonna try to help this out here,

1030
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.240
but I'm really stuck here.

1031
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.870
What she should I think through my brain or through my Dick. Uh, should I?

1032
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.710
We'll do none of that is your heart. So you should just leave.

1033
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.780
Should I ask her out and open for a whole another level of problems or should I

1034
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:17.980
just shut the fuck up? Any advice to me was highly appreciated.

1035
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.270
Loved the podcast and love you as a brother. Go Fuck Yourself.

1036
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:25.271
There's not a woman or a man out there worth going to fucking prison in Saudi

1037
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.160
Arabia. I know a bad the prisons are up here.

1038
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.920
I don't know what they are like over there. You guys got a lot of oil money. Oh,

1039
01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.920
I did run into this guy from Saudi Arabia who laughing his ass off and he goes,

1040
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:37.550
dude, we don't, we don't all have oil money. And I was like, all right,

1041
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.530
fair enough. This oil man over here, I don't have any of that money. Yeah, dude,

1042
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.010
I would walk away from this shit. It's fucking illegal. You could go to jail,

1043
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:50.060
you get deported. You know what I mean? And even if you love somebody,

1044
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.770
they're going to annoy the shit out of Eso. I mean,

1045
01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:54.410
is that worth going to jail for? You know,

1046
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.490
I don't mean is it illegal to just banger, but then if you love her, I dunno.

1047
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:00.650
I Dunno. I would, I would get out of that.

1048
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:03.690
<v 6>Uh, I get out of it. All right.</v>

1049
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:08.220
<v 0>All right. Great movie scene. Unknown actor. All right. Oh yeah.</v>

1050
01:01:08.221 --> 01:01:10.500
I was talking about, uh, this is the, uh,

1051
01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:15.780
this is a new top procure for where I was talking about actors that you saw just

1052
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:19.590
do like five lines in a fucking movie and they absolutely destroyed it.

1053
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:21.660
And you and your friends still quote them.

1054
01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:24.300
You don't even know their fucking names. I brought up that guy last week,

1055
01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:28.190
the guy from pump a reservoir dogs, the guy in,

1056
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.310
you know when Tim Roth's character is a,

1057
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.840
what is he? He's in the fucking bathroom and that cops telling that story.

1058
01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:41.070
I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face. You know,

1059
01:01:41.071 --> 01:01:43.920
put your fucking hands in that dashboard. Love that gun. So here he goes.

1060
01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.970
One of my favorite scenes with an unknown actor was kill bill to bill's brother

1061
01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:52.140
Bud. I wish I need to see these movies to do this justice. I mean, I saw this,

1062
01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:55.680
but I don't remember it. Um, she, she wore the same outfit,

1063
01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.050
that fucking yellow outfit in both movies. Then she,

1064
01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.470
Bill's brother Bud is working as a bouncer at a rundown strip club.

1065
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:06.120
He shows up late for work, gets called into his boss's office. His boss,

1066
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:10.050
Larry Gomes, is played by actor Larry Bishop,

1067
01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:15.051
and he looks like half a wolf man after doing a line of blow with a haggard

1068
01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:16.920
looking stripper. I vaguely remember this.

1069
01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:21.450
He levels his gaze at buzzed bud and says, uh,

1070
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:24.660
I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here.

1071
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:29.930
They let you stroll in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by you or what?

1072
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.030
It wasn't owned by me and I own a fucking car wash.

1073
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.090
I just butchered that line. People I can't read.

1074
01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.010
I've realized that I need glasses and I have slight dyslexia. I'm like,

1075
01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:44.370
I was trying to write squawk today and I knew all the letters and I just could

1076
01:02:44.371 --> 01:02:45.204
not remember.

1077
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.140
So I was trying to remember what squawking 7,700 versus 7,500.

1078
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:52.440
I always get those two mixed up.

1079
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:54.680
If that's an emergency landing or a fucking hijacking,

1080
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:59.460
I was cause one stay alive and the other is fucking go to heaven.

1081
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:04.080
Um, all right, sorry. That's how you remember it. 75 stay alive.

1082
01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:07.380
77 and go to heaven. All right, 75 is hijacking.

1083
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.490
77 is emergency in 76. Nita fix means you fucking radios out.

1084
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.710
This doesn't mean anything to you guys. Um,

1085
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.460
I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here and let you stroll in

1086
01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:22.090
20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by me and I own a fucking car wash day.

1087
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.980
You go, that was a good fucking read. It makes me want to go see that move.

1088
01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:31.410
He say he then proceeded to give this world-class assassin a humiliating dress

1089
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:31.960
down,

1090
01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:36.960
telling him he's as useless as an asshole on his elbow and crossing off all his

1091
01:03:37.121 --> 01:03:39.670
scheduled work days on the calendar.

1092
01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:44.170
He finishes by telling him never to wear his cowboy hat to work and has him

1093
01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:46.360
cleaned a clogged toilet on his way out.

1094
01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:50.020
All Bud can do is stand there and take it. I hope you've seen this great movie.

1095
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.720
If not, it's worth to watch. Thanks and go fuck yourself.

1096
01:03:52.721 --> 01:03:55.090
I'm going to go watch it again. All right.

1097
01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:59.740
I think I'm a think this bit is going to make people go see these cool movies

1098
01:03:59.741 --> 01:04:03.130
again and it's also gonna make everybody laugh at how bad I can't fucking read

1099
01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.540
out loud. All right, Bill,

1100
01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:08.950
my favorite line in a comedy ever might be from blazing saddles delivered by

1101
01:04:08.951 --> 01:04:09.910
slim pickins.

1102
01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:15.690
<v 2>He rides into the scene where his workers are singing a camp.</v>

1103
01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:17.590
Is it Camptown races?

1104
01:04:17.591 --> 01:04:22.591
I always thought it was camp Camptown races and says what the wide wide world of

1105
01:04:23.061 --> 01:04:27.310
sport is going on here. I hired you people to try to get,

1106
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.610
I had you people to try and get a little track late,

1107
01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.960
not to jump around like a bunch of kids to city faggots. I remember that line.

1108
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.240
Whatever the hell that means. And I'm quoting a movie by the way,

1109
01:04:40.241 --> 01:04:43.930
before everybody gets all fucking uptight about the, uh, you know,

1110
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.870
Richard Pryor wrote on that and he was actually supposed to be the lead in that.

1111
01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:47.950
And then they went with the,

1112
01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:50.170
the other actor and I don't know any of the actress names. Okay.

1113
01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:51.550
Three number three, Bill.

1114
01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.290
You asked for movie lines said by a non movie star actress that your listeners

1115
01:04:56.291 --> 01:05:00.160
friends talked about from my group of friends. It's aligned from Ghostbusters.

1116
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.980
When Peter Venkman, uh,

1117
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:08.010
Bill Murray shows up to Dana's w weaver apartment right after the dog monster

1118
01:05:09.221 --> 01:05:12.250
runs loose from Lewis. Tell you I've never seen that movie.

1119
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.340
I've never seen Ghostbusters. Just not OSI fi guy.

1120
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.570
Vanke is that considered vanquish?

1121
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.180
Shows up to the scene and asks a cop what happened.

1122
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:27.930
And the cop nonchalantly replies a some more on brought a cougar to a party and

1123
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:28.984
it went buzzer.

1124
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:32.303
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1125
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.980
<v 2>My friends and my been quoting that cop for years.</v>

1126
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:39.830
Check it out at two 30 of the following. Oh, I can, I can look at these. Fuck.

1127
01:05:39.831 --> 01:05:42.610
I can click on the links. This is even better.

1128
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:46.150
Why have me read it when I can click on the links. All right.

1129
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.350
We'll compare my read.

1130
01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.900
<v 6>Come on. No.</v>

1131
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.980
Why you lollygagging around here with [inaudible]?

1132
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.170
Shoulds seemed like it was 120 degrees. Hey,

1133
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:00.060
be more modern in the fort.

1134
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.750
[inaudible] when you a slave,

1135
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.730
you saying lie bird gone. How about a good old n****r works, Huh?

1136
01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:12.110
<v 2>Jesus Christ. What the fuck kind of Ligia is sending me here.</v>

1137
01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.450
I thought that was going to go to your fucking Ah, boy.

1138
01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:21.890
Oh boy. Am I going to have to have an apology video here?

1139
01:06:21.891 --> 01:06:25.570
What the fuck just happened? Oh, let's do I do this other one. This is,

1140
01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.300
<v 8>why are you doing money? You have some of the breeds at room temperature.</v>

1141
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.020
If you think it's too warm in here for the Green Luis.

1142
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:33.980
Always yet. All right. All right.

1143
01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.610
<v 2>Fuck all these things. These things are going to be too long and evidently they,</v>

1144
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.170
they have the n word in them. Yeah. Boy,

1145
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.780
do I need to take a knee after this one? All right. Number four.

1146
01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:46.490
I have two unknown and unheralded actors with memorable movie lines.

1147
01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:50.810
Both are the Great Mel Brooks movies. Uh,

1148
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.350
the first one is the Roman soldier in the history of the world, part one,

1149
01:06:54.351 --> 01:06:57.200
the empress is approaching, but the, there's a horse and a carriage.

1150
01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:00.710
And the way the Roman soldier looks directly at the camera and says,

1151
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:05.270
move that miserable piece of shit. Uh, the over the top way delivers.

1152
01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:08.630
The line comes out of nowhere. I say it all the time. And the, uh,

1153
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:10.850
the best impression I could do, you know what I gotta do?

1154
01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:14.960
I have to get the actual clips for this to work because what I'm now doing is

1155
01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:19.040
ruining, um, ruining great movies. All right. Girlfriend believes in ghosts.

1156
01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.530
Uh, alright. Girlfriend believes in ghosts dear grandmaster B.

1157
01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:28.640
I met this lady a few weeks ago. Things went really good.

1158
01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:30.320
She's very cool.

1159
01:07:30.321 --> 01:07:34.190
I found her good looking and we have a lot of stuff to talk about.

1160
01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.420
I didn't have a great a lot of,

1161
01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.700
I didn't have a lot of relationships in the past.

1162
01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:41.390
I'm 32 and I picked up my game about four years ago.

1163
01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.450
Everything was great until we went to a restaurant one day and she told me she

1164
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:45.350
believes in ghosts,

1165
01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.680
not just that she said she actually sees them and even got patients who come to

1166
01:07:51.261 --> 01:07:55.160
her for treatment about it. I tried to be open minded about it. Oh my God.

1167
01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.620
I can just hear the silverware hitting the plates at this point,

1168
01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.860
trying to compare it to people who believe in God,

1169
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:06.020
but her believing in this keeps bugging me. I'm not saying she's crazy or wrong.

1170
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.950
Who am I to know? But she doesn't sit right the way I see the world.

1171
01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.920
Well then fucking dropper. This is the thing.

1172
01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:16.430
Now this is whole fucking straight across the board.

1173
01:08:16.431 --> 01:08:21.140
You have to look at everything like all the leaves are brown and the sky is

1174
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:26.090
gray. Like if you're dating and somebody does something and it makes you buddy,

1175
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:29.780
you just body literally go like, what the fuck? And then you're literally,

1176
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:33.020
you're going to fight that feeling and go,

1177
01:08:33.021 --> 01:08:37.190
well maybe I need to stop being so ghost to phobic. It's like, no,

1178
01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.110
it's fucking ghosts. It's weird.

1179
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.460
You know you're going to fucking live with Whoopi Goldberg's character from

1180
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:44.571
ghosts. That's what you're going to do.

1181
01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:48.560
People trying to sit on her and shit trying to sit on your wife.

1182
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:50.810
That's what you're going to sign up for me if that's what you're into,

1183
01:08:50.811 --> 01:08:53.230
by all means steward. But if you're on a date and there's like,

1184
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:56.820
that's a major fucking thing. Cause it's not like she just believes in it.

1185
01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:00.560
Every once in a while she's going to hear it like a thump in the house and start

1186
01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:02.120
telling you it's a ghost. When you're like, honey,

1187
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:04.190
it's fucking air in the pipes. All right,

1188
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:06.830
we just have to fucking turn on the faucet. You know? And you know,

1189
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:09.950
remember if the plumber did work today and they shut it off for a second,

1190
01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:13.280
that that's what that is. You know, that's not that she actually,

1191
01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:17.390
she's going to become like a ghost hunter and all of that stuff and uh,

1192
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:21.380
gradually she's going to get starts dressing more and more like she can predict

1193
01:09:21.381 --> 01:09:24.350
the future and you don't want to fuck that. You know what I mean?

1194
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.480
When they start wearing those long flowing things, you know,

1195
01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:31.100
you just so many layers of clothes to try and pick up to just get it going.

1196
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.420
You know, he start wearing like curtains and shit. You don't need that anyways.

1197
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.710
All right. I'm sorry. That whole fucking movie thing just, I dunno,

1198
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:43.730
can you guys just send me the Goddamn clip or I guess you sent me the clip.

1199
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.370
What I should've done was cue it up. I tried to do too many things.

1200
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:48.170
I tried to promote shit.

1201
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:51.440
I tried to do all that and then do the whole thing in the whole fucking thing

1202
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:54.740
just fell apart. All right. Let me just finish with this last thing.

1203
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.130
A buddy of mine is opening a fucking, uh,

1204

1206
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.340
It's like a little 100 seat fucking club.

1207
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:15.341
I'm going to be coming to the town in November and I'm going to pop in and do a

1208
01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:19.700

1213
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:37.910
which is also cool. You know what I mean?

1214
01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:41.060
You go in there and you fucking do your spots and you come out and you go, wow.

1215

Someday I'll be across the street. It's tremendous. Give it a shot.

1216
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.540
