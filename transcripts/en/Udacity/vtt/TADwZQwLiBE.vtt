00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.710
Pods can be created using
pod configuration files.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.480
Let's take a moment to explore
the model of pod configuration file.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.560
There are a few things to notice here,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.730
you'll see that our pod is made up
of one container, the monolith.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.580
You can also see that we're passing
a few arguments to the container

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.100
when it starts up.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.000
Lastly, we're open up port 80 for
HTTP traffic, and

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.350
port 81 for our health checks.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.710
Create the monolith pod using kubectl.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.890
Let's examine our pods.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.750
We'll use a kubectl get pods command
to list all the pods running in

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.650
the default namespace.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.050
It may take a few seconds before
the monolith pod is up and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.780
running, as a monolith
container image needs to be

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.360
pulled from the doca hub
before we can run it.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.810
Used the kubectl describe command to get
more information about the monolith pod.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.220
You'll see a lot of information
about the monolith pod,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.810
including the product IP address and
the event log.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.120
This information will come in
handy when troubleshooting.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.790
As you can see kubernetes makes it easy
to create pods by describing them in

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.510
configuration pods and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.450
viewing information about
them while they're running.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.370
At this point you have the ability to
create all the pods your deployment

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.960
requires.
