[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.490
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, folks.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.780
Welcome to today's
"Authors at Talk."

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.620
We have Huggy Rao and Bob Sutton
with us, both from Stanford.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.677
And they are incredible
collaborators

00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:18.260
who have written this new book
called "Scaling Up Excellence,"

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.450
which we will be
discussing with them today.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.160
The format, as you
can figure out,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.820
is a fireside chat between us.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.215
But we will open it up to you
for questions at some point

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.800
soon.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.100
Before I get into interactions
with Huggy and Bob,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.970
my first exposure to Huggy
was almost ten years back.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.500
And we were both working
with an Indian nonprofit.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.040
And then a few years
later, we again

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.660
connected when I was at Google.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.740
And he is a frequent visitor to
our annual PiLab summit, which

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.615
is a gathering that we
have every year, where

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.840
we get academics from
different social scientists

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.760
to come out here.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.410
And Huggy always asked the most
incisive questions out there.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.370
And he would say,
can I be mischievous?

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.840
And ask a critical question
that would really make us think.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.354
And so today, I'm
happy that I get

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.520
to ask him the mischievous
questions about his book.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.070
BOB SUTTON: He'll probably
get you a couple times.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.340
MALE SPEAKER: And
Bob is a professor

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.420
at the Stanford
engineering school.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.390
And Bob doesn't know this,
but Jennifer Kurkoski,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.550
who leads our People
&amp; Innovation Lab,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.280
said that one of the best
reads, that she has ever

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.260
had on the academic
side, is a paper

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.680
that Bob authored in ASQ in '96.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.720
This was about
brainstorming an idea--

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.560
BOB SUTTON: Oh yeah, that
was a long time ago--

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.893
MALE SPEAKER: --and she said,
that was the best research

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:40.610
that she has ever
read that describes

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.400
a qualitative methodology.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.650
So we're really excited to
have both of them out here.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.490
They have set up this
program about scaling

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.890
that they've been
running at Stanford.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.670
And coming from both the
business school side, as well

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.780
as the engineering
side, they really

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.700
have a very Googley,
I guess, approach

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.450
to thinking about this
huge problem with scaling.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.716
So let's give a warm
welcome to Bob and Huggy.

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:07.085
BOB SUTTON AND HUGGY
RAO: Thank you very much.

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:07.585
Thank you.

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:11.510
MALE SPEAKER: So I
have a few questions

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.720
to start off the discussion.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.170
And then we'll get into
some of your questions too.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.590
So the first one,
I guess is, tell us

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.270
what you mean by scaling?

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.734
And why you thought it was
important to write this book?

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:26.525
BOB SUTTON: I guess,
Huggy's looking at me,

00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:28.950
so that means I'm
supposed to go first.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.730
So in the process of thinking
about what this challenge was,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.015
it actually was a
pretty simple problem

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:36.390
that we thought
was going to take

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.530
a couple years to figure out.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.040
But some seven years later,
we're still struggling with it.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.770
And it's essentially,
when you've

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.280
got a little bit of
goodness in an organization,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.670
how do you spread it further?

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.451
So it's everything from,
you've got a startup,

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:51.700
being Googley would be a
good example like, how do you

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.540
maintain your Googley-ness
as you get bigger?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.750
And also, spreading
goodness across the system,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.850
and getting rid of bad behavior.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.080
So one of the big things
that led us to this research

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.820
was, we were involved in
the founding of the Stanford

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.660
d.school, or Hasso Plattner
Institute of Design.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.580
And spreading design thinking or
innovation was a big challenge.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.230
And executives were always
asking us, well, we've

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.630
got this one group
that's really great, how

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.680
do we spread it further?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.730
So I guess the headline
is, spreading something

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.630
good from the few to the many.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.900
And it's a simple problem,
but it's not easy to address.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.420
So that's the basic thing.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.100
HUGGY RAO: A very
complementary addition

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.640
to that would be that--
spreading good from one pocket

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.067
to many pockets.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.400
You can think of that problem
as a problem of diffusion,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.700
if you will.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.810
But there's also another
dimension of scaling.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.890
And that is, if you're
a small startup,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.940
as you grow rapidly and
become larger in size,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.210
how do you actually
scale successfully

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.830
in the sense of
not only achieving

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.110
a particular footprint
metric, but also making sure

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.130
you retain your mindset.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.460
Let me illustrate that
with a little example.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.920
One of the venture
capitalists mentioned

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.390
that the difference between
a startup and a large company

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.120
was, startups are
like beach volleyball.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.506
You've got two people.

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:15.630
You don't have substitutes.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.760
You don't have coaches.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.240
You know what the game plan is.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.940
You've got to make sure the
ball doesn't touch the sand.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.960
You're playing volleyball
still, you go from two to six.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.370
All of a sudden, if Prasad
serves from the other end,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.350
I receive the serve.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.830
Bob takes it and supplies
it to Cliff, here.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.720
Cliff arcs into the air and
smashes the ball into the net.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.790
I'm sorry, Cliff.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.906
The interesting problem
is, whose fault was it?

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:45.290
Was it Prasad's serve
that was unplayable?

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.210
Was it my fault that I couldn't
receive the serve well?

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.720
Or was it the way Bob supplied?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.860
Or was it Cliff's problem?

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.340
So you can see, when
you go from two to six,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.880
how very quickly it
becomes a problem.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.140
And you can extend
it, six to 60,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.627
to 600, to 6,000, to
60,000, and the like.

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:05.460
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.793
Thank you for that introduction.

00:05:06.793 --> 00:05:10.360
So given that as the
basis then, if you

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.350
have to summarize, what is
the advice that you would give

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.810
organizations on how they
should achieve scaling?

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.620
And specifically, how would
that differ for a startup,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.030
as you mentioned, versus,
let's say a large organization

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.590
like Google?

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.080
HUGGY RAO: Let me take
a quick stab at that.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.790
For a startup, I think
the advice that both of us

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.180
talk about in the
book is, smart scaling

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.430
means that you take time,
and you do it slowly.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.330
We just recently
had an organization

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.210
that actually was
acquired by Google, Waze.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.360
And we actually had
one of their executives

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.000
come and talk to our class,
and he gave a great example.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.860
They were growing in Israel.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.560
You've got all these resources,
and the VC is saying,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.750
now's the time to expand
higher, higher, higher.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.180
The top managers get
together and say, you know,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.670
now is the time to
have a hiring freeze.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.820
And that's sort of
somewhat counterintuitive.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.500
And people within the company
are astonished, how could you

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.780
say you have a hiring
freeze right when you've

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.980
got all this money from the VCs?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.620
And the argument
was the following.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.830
The moment you
expand, you actually

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.240
are going to get a lot of smart
people with very many ideas.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.920
And since you want to focus on a
particular product application,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.330
you're going to wind up
spending a lot of time

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.040
saying no to their smart ideas.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.960
And that's not something
you want to do.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.250
The other interesting
thing was, when

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.390
you hire people in a
startup, the smart people

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.820
assume they can hit
the ground running.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.790
But often many of them can't.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.850
And very quickly you've
shifted the ratio

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.360
of unproductive to
productive people, at least

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.117
for a short window of time.

00:06:55.117 --> 00:06:56.700
And the third thing
is, of course, you

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.890
increase coordination
costs enormously.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.920
So what they did was--
they did a smart thing--

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.030
which is hiring freeze.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.010
But they made sure,
during that period,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.080
every single
employee was focused

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.410
on one number-- improving
their retention of users

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.750
after three months.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.800
And pretty much every day,
you have one question to ask.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.270
What did I do today to
improve that number?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.970
So scaling smartly,
very important

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.530
for small organizations.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.940
I'll turn it over to you for
the larger organizations--

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.950
BOB SUTTON: --I
get the large end?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.810
Well, I would also
emphasize that there's

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.080
a lot of things
that are similar.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.290
And in particular, there's
kind of two principles that

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.910
are implied in what Huggy said.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.900
One is the notion that
adding more people

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.980
isn't necessarily good.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.500
This notion that many
hands make light work.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.080
And we were actually
talking about this at lunch.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.990
So in 2002, one of my other
co-authors, Jeff Pfeffer and I

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.910
interviewed Larry Page, when
Google was about 400 people.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.740
And Larry emphasized how
the venture capitalists

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.324
were giving all this grief that
he wasn't hiring fast enough.

00:07:58.324 --> 00:08:00.990
And that all of his friends from
Stanford were giving him grief.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.230
But he said, we really have
to slow down, and hire and get

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.670
the right people who
can grow with Google.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.020
And I'm not going
to back off on that.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.360
And then, for the book, we
interviewed Shona Brown,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.420
who was quite senior
here for many years

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.410
and helped grow sort
of the non-product part

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.210
of the organization,
in particular.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.140
And Shona said, we
constantly had this issue,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.970
where people are telling
us to hire faster,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.790
but we had to make sure we got
the right people in the seats.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.503
And I think that's a pretty
good philosophy, , see,

00:08:29.503 --> 00:08:32.390
even the small versus
a large company.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.100
But if I was going to talk
about large companies,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.570
one of things that becomes
increasingly important as they

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.330
grow larger is-- and this
is Huggy's expression--

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.250
is the notion that bad
is stronger than good.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.380
Or the path to greatness
is to get rid of badness,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.870
so bad to great.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.210
And so what happens as
companies get older,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.820
very often sort of bad
behavior or ineffectiveness

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.990
starts growing and growing.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.240
And if you just push the
good, and you don't get rid

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.822
of the bad, the
bad gets obscured.

00:09:01.822 --> 00:09:03.530
And there's lots of
evidence that, things

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.460
like laziness, incompetence,
all sorts of difficult things,

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.100
just overwhelm the goodness.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.980
So good companies, and
I'll sort of stop here,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.190
they view scaling as a
problem of more or less.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.200
They're always
adding more people,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.635
expanding the more
places and so on.

00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:22.260
But in the process,
they're getting rid

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.010
of things that are
getting in the way, are

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.160
no longer effective.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.200
HUGGY RAO: If I could just
add one more line to that.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.270
The big difference, I would say,
between a small company scaling

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.520
and a large company scaling
is that, in a large company,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.730
I would hypothesize that
the larger the company,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.020
the greater the probability
that the smart people inside

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.920
are going to become dumber.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.554
What I mean by that
is, obviously I

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:48.470
don't mean to insist--

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.678
BOB SUTTON: Take that Google.

00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:50.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:50.602 --> 00:09:52.060
HUGGY RAO: --I
don't mean to insist

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.170
that smart people become stupid.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.190
Clearly that's an untenable
position for me to argue.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.790
But what I would say is, that
smart people can become dumb

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.070
in the sense of being silent.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.360
And so in a large
enterprise, I would

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.005
submit that silence is the
real enemy of excellence.

00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:10.380
BOB SUTTON: So
just real quickly,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.010
I was at Pixar yesterday and met
with some of the senior folks.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.587
And one thing that they
did-- because Pixar

00:10:17.587 --> 00:10:19.170
is sort of at this
point in transition

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.130
where they've kind of grown
up and everything-- and so

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.713
Ed Catmull, who is
president of Pixar,

00:10:22.713 --> 00:10:25.130
was worried that too many
people were being silent.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.835
And the way Pixar actually
does movies is that, four

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:33.610
or five people who are the brain
trust-- John Lasseter, Pete

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.650
Docter, a number of other folks,
who make comments on movies,

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.670
and they write notes.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.850
But they had notes
days where everybody

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.280
wrote notes about
everything that

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.860
could be improved at Pixar.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.100
And it was because they
were worried they had grown

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.844
and the silence had
sort of sunk in.

00:10:47.844 --> 00:10:49.510
And as they had gotten
larger and older,

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.634
there was too much of that.

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:54.010
And that was a
countervailing force.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.630
MALE SPEAKER: The
technology industry

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.060
has grown rapidly over
the last few decades.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.620
And within that industry,
there are many companies

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.650
that have grown
very, very quickly.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.430
And given your vantage
and your knowledge

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.640
of what's happening
in that industry,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.060
do you see the
processes and tools

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.876
that technology
companies use to scale?

00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:19.250
Are they different
from what used

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.840
to happen a generation ago?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.609
Or different from how it
happens in the other industries?

00:11:24.609 --> 00:11:26.150
BOB SUTTON: What do
you think, Huggy?

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.820
HUGGY RAO: They are
certainly very different.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.900
I mean, if you take Google,
for example, and compare it to,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.579
let's say the median
firm in Detroit.

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:37.370
The way they scale is
very, very different.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.520
Not just in terms of
sheer pace, but also

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.250
as you very rightly point
out, the technology.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.140
One advantage is, you
actually have technology

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.650
that allows great
decentralization.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.940
But conversely,
technology also that

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.650
allows great monitoring as well.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.060
So you actually have both
dimensions of scaling.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.300
Whereas in the older
industries, as it were,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.760
the problem is the
costs of monitoring

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.220
are very, very high because
you really lack line of sight

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.610
into the enterprise.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.730
Coincidentally, by the way,
our operational definition

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.610
of excellence, since both
of us are social scientists,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.630
is not metric-related.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.200
But it simply
means, excellence is

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.100
when an organization-- when
people in an organization--

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.980
do the right thing, even when
nobody's monitoring them.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.850
Even when nobody is actually
watching over your shoulder.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.180
So I would say the older
generation companies perhaps

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.730
invest a little more
in the monitoring part.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.810
Here, the kinds
of individuals who

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.030
self-select, they presumably
disdain monitoring, in fact,

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.810
otherwise they wouldn't
actually join the organization.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.500
BOB SUTTON: One
thing I would also

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.492
add-- I tend to think
of similarities more

00:12:51.492 --> 00:12:53.200
than differences--
maybe it's because I'm

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.020
an old fashioned,
qualitative researcher.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.070
But when I look even
within tech firms,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.410
it's amazing how--
when organizations

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.450
have a different mindset
about how they're

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.900
going to do things--
how it affects

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.540
a whole bunch of different
decisions about how people are

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.917
hired, about how,
actually, a who gets fired,

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:16.250
the incentives, and so on,
and the nature of their work.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.791
And one thing-- and I actually
talked about this a little bit

00:13:18.791 --> 00:13:21.100
with your BizOps group about
three or four months ago--

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.139
when I think of-- and I already
mentioned this a little bit--

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:25.680
when I think of
Google, I think of it

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.054
as a place that has generally
leaned towards generalists,

00:13:28.054 --> 00:13:30.180
and people can grow in the role.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.787
And at least, my conversations
with Apple-- and I

00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:34.370
can't quote people
because, of course,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.510
they'll shoot me,
it being Apple.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.580
But my conversations
with people at Apple

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.300
is-- and I was told
this story directly

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.460
by a senior executive-- is
people get more senior here,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.100
they get more specialized.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.741
And if you have an
organization where

00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:49.240
you are assuming
people are becoming

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.670
more generalists versus
more specialized,

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.770
you have to run it in
completely different ways.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.210
And I think that's an important
difference between Google

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.750
and Apple, and it doesn't
work perfectly in all cases.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.260
You have certainly
specialists here,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.630
and they have generalists there.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.140
But a sort of exhibit
one-- and this

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.770
is what this guy
was talking about--

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.150
was what was going to
happen with Ron Johnson

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.760
when he went to JC Penneys.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.840
So Ron Johnson was just
extremely focused on,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.110
what's the experience
like an Apple store?

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.400
And the way it was described
to me, him and Steve

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.700
would argue for like an
hour over exactly what angle

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.530
an iPad should be in the store.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.070
And then you give a guy like
that an entire business to run,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.360
the supply chain, pricing,
you add everything.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.667
He would not be prepared
as much to be a generalist.

00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:31.750
If you took another company
like General Electric,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.520
it would be sort of the
opposite sort of career path.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.980
So I do think that
tech might have

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.580
some of its own
characteristics, but

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.900
the company-to-company
variation is just astounding.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.800
Even in the old days,
I remember sitting

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.890
in on new training for
Facebook employees.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.630
So this was like--
and half of them

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.080
were from Google, by the way.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.980
And I remember Chris Cox,
who's now head of products,

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.430
and then head of HR, saying,
yes, you can go in tomorrow,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.910
and you can touch the
code, and you can break it.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.740
And they'd say, we
can't do that at Google.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.720
So the point is that,
the different standards

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.740
in companies are very
important for scaling

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.510
because-- as Huggy would say--
that in good organizations,

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.580
people have a really clear
view of what is sacred

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.910
and what is taboo.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.160
And those vary from
organizations to organizations.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.200
And when everybody
agrees, it helps a lot.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.340
BOB SUTTON: As I was
thinking about your question,

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.630
what suddenly hit me also,
was the sheer difference

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:31.050
in the physical architecture
between the tech companies

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.930
and the old industrial giants.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.820
Open offices and
all of these things.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.000
And I think part of what
the tech companies do

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.140
is they provide way
more cues to individuals

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.070
to excel than, I would
submit, the large companies.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.280
Let me give you one research
study which actually shows

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.300
that when you have
bright lights,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.970
people actually resort
to much less cheating.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.630
Turn down the lamps, the
propensity to cheat increases.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.420
So lamps matter more than
cops, is one simple thing.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.525
And you can go to
any organization

00:16:06.525 --> 00:16:10.060
and simply look at, how
bright is the place?

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.410
How dark is the place?

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.400
That ought to give you
at least an initial kind

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.260
of working hypothesis about
what's likely to happen.

00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:20.070
MALE SPEAKER: One of
the scaling mantras

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.980
that you have in the book.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.294
It is very colorful, it's
called "Feel the Clusterfug"--

00:16:26.294 --> 00:16:27.710
BOB SUTTON: It's
"fug" not "fuck."

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.376
MALE SPEAKER: --and
the last few letters

00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:32.500
are F-U-G, because we know
this is going to be on YouTube.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.015
So tell us what
you mean by that.

00:16:35.015 --> 00:16:37.140
BOB SUTTON: You're looking
at me, why don't you go?

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.570
HUGGY RAO: OK.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:45.170
Bob, of course, is well
known to have a tendency

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.150
to really aim for very
provocated titles.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:54.992
His earlier books are inspired,
let's say by various parts of--

00:16:54.992 --> 00:16:56.450
BOB SUTTON: The
"no asshole world,"

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:56.750
you can put that, if you want--

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.250
HUGGY RAO: Well, there you go.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.730
So originally he was actually
wanting to think of the book

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.510
as, maybe we ought
to call it cluster,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.460
and then you know
what the expletive is.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.200
The four letter word
that follows cluster.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.740
And as we were writing
it, the editors of course

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.380
said, wait a minute you can't
use something like that.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.119
And fortunately, he
quickly sort of thought

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:25.579
of Norman Mailer, who used the
word "fug" to indicate the act.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.140
And very quickly we
thought of clusterfug.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.765
So that's kind of the
etymology of clusterfug.

00:17:30.765 --> 00:17:32.000
Do you want to talk about--

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.530
BOB SUTTON: --so you
get to do the fun part?

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.320
HUGGY RAO: --I get
to do the fun part.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:34.970
BOB SUTTON: So
where this came from

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.930
is, we were having a dinner with
a guy named Mark Hershon who

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.540
actually is a
professional namer.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.940
So he named the BlackBerry,
he named Swiffer,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.122
he's really a good
namer, Dasani water.

00:17:44.122 --> 00:17:45.580
And so we were
trying to figure out

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.105
what the opposite
of good scaling

00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:48.969
was so we came on
this word, clusterfug.

00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:50.260
HUGGY RAO: After a lot of wine.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.593
BOB SUTTON: After a lot of wine.

00:17:51.593 --> 00:17:55.050
And we realize that there's sort
of three characteristics you

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.960
would see, in particular, a
bad IT Rollout at Stanford,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.090
we were thinking of.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.730
Or you can figure out what
happened with Obamacare just

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.420
recently.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.980
And when bad things
happen, there's

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.280
three characteristics
we always would see.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.410
The first one would be illusion.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.790
That this is going to be so
easy, overconfidence, bias,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.650
we can just roll it out.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.650
So that's the first one.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.280
The second was impatience, and
this is classic with scaling,

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.710
we can do this really fast.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.760
No problem.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.380
And then the third
one is, the people

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.940
doing it are incompetent.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.180
And that makes
others incompetent.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.830
And to us, those three,
illusion, impatience,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.660
and incompetence, are the
hallmarks of both the causes

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.700
and the characteristics
of bad scaling.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.660
And I think that that
happened with Obamacare,

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.020
to name a company.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.109
If you sort of dig in to what
happened with poor Groupon.

00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:44.900
I hope nobody here used
to work at Groupon.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.370
But if you read the
CEO's resignation letter,

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:53.930
pretty much all three of those
things were raging at Groupon.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.600
And when I look at the
companies in the Valley

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.660
that have generally got it
right, they somehow or another

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.430
avoid that.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.340
Especially the impatience part
is sometimes the worst thing.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.910
HUGGY RAO: So the implication
behind all of this

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.190
is, really scaling up
is easy, but screwing up

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.740
is equally easy.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.510
And the problem of course
is when people screw up,

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.130
we typically only focus on
what's called, the sharp edge.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.090
You look at a person or persons
and promptly blame them.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.720
But when you really
understand what

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.780
causes them to make the
mistake or the screw up,

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.980
you quickly realize
there is actually

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.230
a confluence of a
couple of things.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.860
One is the psychology,
the illusion part.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.270
And the other is
circulation, or physiology.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.300
And this gets at
the impatience part.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.840
You hasten things, you do
things, you block circulation.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.495
And the third is anatomy,
the structure in who

00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:50.730
can occupy positions
in the structure.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.040
So all three of them
kind of to come together.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.080
And the result is, anything
from Sochi, from one extreme,

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.220
to the doping scandal in biking.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.880
So you can pick whatever
you want in between,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.430
you pretty much get an idea of
how attempts to reform usually

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.870
wind up in clusterfugs.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.300
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you for sharing that.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.930
I have a bunch more questions,
but if you have anything

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.880
please feel free to
line up at the mic.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.470
BOB SUTTON: We would love
to hear some questions.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.670
Torture us, we love that.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.586
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, and
while you're lining up,

00:20:23.586 --> 00:20:26.500
let me just continue
with a couple more.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:31.630
And one of them is, the
role of bureaucracy, right.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.000
And so we often hear
that organizations

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.720
grow by instilling a
lot of bureaucracy.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.420
But then that is not
something that people

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.750
find very pleasant to bear with.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.990
What is the role that
you see for bureaucracy--

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.020
BOB SUTTON: --let me
start out with that.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:54.346
So bureaucracy seems to
be used as a dirty word.

00:20:54.346 --> 00:20:56.220
And to me there's a
difference between having

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.960
just enough structure
and just enough process,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.369
versus having stuff
that weighs people down.

00:21:01.369 --> 00:21:02.910
And this is a big
scaling issue which

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.920
is, when and how
late you add process.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.195
But just to go to what
Huggy's little companies

00:21:07.195 --> 00:21:08.740
that-- so there's
a company called

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.436
Pulse started by two Stanford
students, Ankit and Akshay.

00:21:12.436 --> 00:21:13.810
So we went and we
talked to them.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.840
And they had about 11 or 12
people when we talked to them.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.740
And they were
describing how when

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.120
they got about
seven people, they

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.500
realized that they have to break
into a couple of teams, two

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.390
or three teams,
because it was too big.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.620
Teams over five or six
usually are a nightmare,

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.964
especially when you get to 10.

00:21:28.964 --> 00:21:30.630
And then when they
got to 11, and that's

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.750
about the time where
there are 11 or 12 people.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.649
They're all in one room, sort
of the street in Paulo Alto,

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:37.440
sort of the typical
startup space with sort

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.670
of rough floors and everything.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.410
But what they did is they had
them working in three or four

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.310
different teams.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.560
So they had division.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.180
And then they each
had a board that they

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.430
put with a Post-it note,
what they were working on.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.599
And then every
afternoon, each team

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:51.890
would say, this is what we
work-- they all turn around,

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.389
they would announce
the other teams,

00:21:53.389 --> 00:21:54.800
this is what we worked on.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.714
Here's the challenges we
need, can you help us?

00:21:57.714 --> 00:21:59.505
And to me that's actually
some bureaucracy.

00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:00.790
It's some process.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.160
It's some division.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.540
But the challenge,
and this is Chris Fry,

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.022
who is now head of Twitter,
some engineering group,

00:22:09.022 --> 00:22:11.230
and is going to bring me to
a Commonwealth Club event

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.280
with him next week.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.460
And Chris has this
great line which

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.640
is that, the
purpose of hierarchy

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.330
is to defeat bad
bureaucracy, basically.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.450
And I really like that line
because some time stuff that's

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.860
put in causes all this friction,
and that's bad bureaucracy.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.120
But sometimes, I mean you've got
to add a little bit complexity.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.430
And the things he has, his
test is, if what you put in

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.149
helps people get
their work done,

00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:36.190
but it doesn't feel like
they're walking in muck,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.670
then you're doing
your job right.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.070
And you've always got to
be sensitive to that sort

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.710
of balance.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.350
But bureaucracy has
become, appropriately so,

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.770
a dirty word because of
the way it's done so often.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.440
But you do need hierarchy,
you do need division of labor,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.510
and you do need process.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.500
Sorry, Google wouldn't work
without all those things, as

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.490
warm and fuzzy a
company as it is.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.580
HUGGY RAO: My quick take on
bureaucracy is the following.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.600
I was actually reminded
of the role of bureaucracy

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.450
when I was actually at a CTO
forum a couple of days ago.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.420
And one of the
participants, they put it,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.380
I thought, very cleverly.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.250
He said, look, the
great thing about brakes

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.940
is they also make you go faster.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.440
BOB SUTTON: He means
brakes on cars.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.106
HUGGY RAO: Yeah.

00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:19.780
Brakes on cars.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.420
We often think of
brakes, of course,

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.180
as something that limits speed.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.680
But you could plausibly argue,
when you have breaks you

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.650
actually go a little
bit faster too.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.850
And it's a little bit
like that for rules.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.275
And the real challenge about
rules and bureaucracies

00:23:34.275 --> 00:23:39.010
is whatever you do, you ought
not to increase cognitive load.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:43.100
And what we talk about in the
book is, if you increase load,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.990
you erode willpower.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.620
And one of our colleagues
did a beautiful experiment,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.670
which actually was a
variation on a theme.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.540
So what he did was
he took a large room

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.580
like this, randomly assigned
you to two conditions.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.880
One condition, you
actually had to remember

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.294
a unique two-digit number.

00:23:59.294 --> 00:24:00.960
The other condition,
you had to remember

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.600
a unique seven-digit number.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.030
And all that he does is,
he opens the door there.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.950
And along the
corridors, there are

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.620
two tables, one laden with
chocolate dessert, one laden

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.000
with fruits.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.370
And lo and behold,
what he finds is,

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.620
people who have been asked
to remember the seven digit

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.410
number.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.935
They're saying
238-9242 or whatever,

00:24:19.935 --> 00:24:21.810
and the next thing you
know is, you're really

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.530
kind of attacking the chocolate.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.150
And the guys were told to
remember the two digit number.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.640
They can resist the
temptation of chocolate,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.130
and actually go eat the fruit.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.050
And what we do in
organizations when

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.600
we increase
bureaucracy is, we're

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.240
actually increasing
demands on people.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.120
Everyone has to remember
the seven digit number.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.270
And then it's no use standing up
and giving a speech and saying,

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.260
use your willpower.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.190
They can't.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.390
Because it's all depleted
anyway, and that's the problem.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.640
BOB SUTTON: We got a question.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.120
ALL: All right.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.619
All right.

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:53.210
Thank you.

00:24:57.875 --> 00:24:59.250
AUDIENCE: My
question relates to,

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.083
one of things I'm hearing
as you're talking,

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:04.380
is that people who,
needing to scale up,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.880
need to change the way in
which they're doing things,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.699
obviously.

00:25:07.699 --> 00:25:10.240
One of things I'm thinking, if
I play a role in Google, which

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.820
is designed to help people
learn how to do that,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.787
can you teach
people to scale up?

00:25:14.787 --> 00:25:16.370
And if so, what are
some of the things

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.840
that are important to consider.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.465
BOB SUTTON: So that's
a great question.

00:25:19.465 --> 00:25:23.740
And in the mindset that at
least we try to instill, folks,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.980
is constantly think,
what got you here

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.790
that won't get you
to the next stage?

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:33.000
And two diagnostic things I
would start with, and then

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.520
Huggy maybe you can jump in, is
to go back to this size thing.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.470
Because there are things
that work at one size

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.650
that won't work in another.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.930
One of the classic ones,
and one of the companies

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.960
we know very well, IDEO.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.700
For years, when I was
doing an ethnography there,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.810
I would go to the
Monday morning meeting.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.040
There would be 60 people.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.380
David Kelly, the CEO,
would run it perfectly.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.620
It got up to 150 even--
everybody would talk,

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.120
there would be this
esprit de corps,

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.900
150 was just-- it
was a clusterfug.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.440
So they divided it up, and
you sort of had to do it.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.700
So that's one of the things.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.000
And then the other test is
that, back to this idea,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.980
it feels like people
are walking in muck.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.165
And one tool we've
been using-- in fact,

00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:16.950
there's a Fortune 500 company
that we just did this with,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.080
where the CEO basically
put $5,000 on the line

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.970
for each of the
group presidents,

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.840
is we call the subtraction game.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.390
And what we do is we have
people think about what things

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.830
are getting in the way,
and subtract stuff.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.082
And it's amazing when
you think about that.

00:26:31.082 --> 00:26:32.540
Well if somebody
came in your role,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.530
which part would you take out?

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.880
That can be quite powerful.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.100
You have some other
ideas too, but I

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.870
do think it's a mindset of
being aware of what is getting

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.100
in the way, in weighing us down.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.710
HUGGY RAO: Just as a
quick little extension.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.840
Given your role for us,
the key thing about scaling

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.340
is, scaling actually
has inflection points.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.130
So scaling is not
arithmetic, you

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.540
have to really think
calculus, if you will.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.390
So as you move from one
inflection point to another,

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.860
what worked if you scale,
let's say from zero to 50

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.490
units may not work as you move
from 50 to 100, then et cetera.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.390
So the way we think
about these challenges

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.970
is, you may start
out as a Catholic,

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.970
and by which we mean
you have a model

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.620
that you want to replicate.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.610
But as you quickly
go up in scale,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.740
the option that you
really want to think about

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.710
is, how can we actually
become Buddhist?

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:34.170
By which we mean that instead
of actually prescribing

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.960
every single thing you do, you
outline general principles,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.200
and you give tools to people.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.180
So starting out Catholic
becoming Buddhist

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.110
is certainly a useful thing.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.120
Conversely, in large
companies where

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.240
there's a lot of bad
behavior, there's

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.750
a lot of Buddhism with
respect to bad behavior too.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.500
So there, one of the
things you have to do

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.800
is, you have to be pretty
Catholic about what

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.060
the bad behavior is.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.260
Stop that one thing.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.670
So those are the
trade-offs that you

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.170
have to actually
think of making.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.200
BOB SUTTON: Good question.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.020
My question.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.770
At Google, oftentimes
we hear this principle,

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.540
and we act on them,
and I know I've

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.340
done, is "launch and iterate."

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.410
Because we don't have
time to scale slow,

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.539
that's the advice you
said in the beginning.

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:25.830
Because there's all these
demands that are coming to us

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.840
and we need to act
extremely fast.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.350
So how does your idea
of scaling slowly,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.320
would really work with this
"launch and iterate" principle?

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.670
BOB SUTTON: To me,
you sort of have

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.990
to decide which things
you have to slow down at.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.320
So you can do other things fast.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.300
So I hate to bring up
Facebook, but I will.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.670
They put an enormous
amount of energy

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.670
into hiring people and
brainwashing them properly.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.680
So they can move fast
and break things.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.820
So that's even more
extreme than iteration.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.750
And if you have the
right people, and people

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.780
who will learn fast
enough, and this,

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.820
we teach in the design
school, both of us.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.530
That's our whole
philosophy is rapid

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.620
prototyping and moving fast.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.387
And to me, the question is when
you do that, do you create--

00:29:14.387 --> 00:29:16.470
are you doing it in such
a way where it's actually

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.110
safe to fail?

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.780
And if you're moving
fast and breaking things

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.310
or doing rapid prototyping.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.290
To me that's just fast learning.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.730
And that should work.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.590
But if you're doing that in
a setting, where it's not

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:33.160
safe to fail, so surgery,
launching an airplane,

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.577
keeping the Google
site running, I

00:29:34.577 --> 00:29:36.243
mean if people can't
do a Google search,

00:29:36.243 --> 00:29:37.890
really bad things are happening.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.180
So I'm all for moving
fast and breaking things

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.530
or rapid prototyping
and the like.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.490
But the more skilled
people you've had,

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.660
so the more time you
spent hiring them,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.750
and the more they have
actually shared ideas

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.250
of what effectiveness
looks like and

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.470
doesn't, the faster
you can move forward.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.020
That's why Huggy's metric, Waze,
is that the name that company?

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.370
That their metric was, are we
acquiring customers or not?

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.819
So that's what success was.

00:30:02.819 --> 00:30:03.860
So theirs is agreed upon.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.280
But I'm not saying you
should oh, be a nervous Cindy

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.610
and not move fast.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.250
But there are times
in life-- there's

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.350
a guy named Jerome
Groopman, who writes stuff

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.370
on how doctors do
diagnoses, and sometimes

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:19.890
in life, the best advice he says
is, don't just do something,

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.990
stand there.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.420
And a lot of the key to life--
and this is Danny Kahneman,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.404
Nobel Prize-winning stuff
too-- is figuring out

00:30:27.404 --> 00:30:28.820
when you go to
that sort of system

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.510
too where you actually have to
do deep cognition versus boom,

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.310
we can go on automatic pilot.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.130
So I don't think there's any
hard, magic answers there.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.600
But knowing when
to hit the brakes,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.975
so then you can
accelerate later,

00:30:38.975 --> 00:30:41.890
to use Huggy's metaphor is a
lot of what scaling and all

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.515
of organizational life is about.

00:30:43.515 --> 00:30:45.140
HUGGY RAO: Very
quickly, if I can add--

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.223
BOB SUTTON: Good question.

00:30:46.223 --> 00:30:48.210
HUGGY RAO: I think--
very nice question.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.230
I'm often reminded of a
lovely Latin proverb that

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.880
goes something like this,
"Festina Lente," which

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.150
means "make haste slowly."

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.830
So here's the problem.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.220
The problem is when decision
makers want to scale,

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.670
they usually think of
desirability considerations.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.090
What's desirable?

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.090
And cognitively, when we
think of what's desirable,

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.220
we actually think in
very abstract ways.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.925
We call that the
air war in the book.

00:31:14.925 --> 00:31:16.860
You sort of think it's
an air-war problem.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.318
All that you've
got to do is you've

00:31:18.318 --> 00:31:19.360
got to launch it all out.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.234
You've got to do this,
you've got to do that.

00:31:21.234 --> 00:31:23.050
You think things are
going to really scale.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.690
But real scaling actually
requires great attention

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.750
to concrete details, and
to think feasibility.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.710
So you really have to
think about the ground war.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.520
And in order to
fight a ground war.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.960
As you can imagine, a ground war
also is intense, but arguably

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.081
that occurs on a somewhat slower
time scale than just an air

00:31:43.081 --> 00:31:43.580
war--

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.170
BOB SUTTON: And I would add,
back to your prototyping idea.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.840
So the great thing
about prototyping

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.350
is, if you're good
prototyper, whether it's

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:53.210
software or a product,
it's really tangible.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.810
You give people-- do you
want the latch like this?

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.250
Do you want A or B,
out of AB testing?

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.990
So the great thing
about prototyping

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.920
is, you actually
got tangibility.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.630
You're not thinking abstractly.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.250
That's like our definition
of a lousy group of Stanford

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.850
students or
executives, is they're

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.589
talking tangibly, and then
my buddy Diego Rodriguez

00:32:13.589 --> 00:32:15.630
from IDEO, when they talk
like that, and he says,

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:16.589
where's your prototype?

00:32:16.589 --> 00:32:18.546
And if they don't have
a prototype, he says, F,

00:32:18.546 --> 00:32:19.200
and he leaves.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.950
So tangibility is a big
part of that concreteness.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:24.450
Please.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.866
AUDIENCE: I have
another question,

00:32:25.866 --> 00:32:27.180
since nobody else is here.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:27.400
BOB SUTTON: Oh good.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:27.899
Yeah.

00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:28.420
Go for it.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.380
AUDIENCE: So you said that
you define excellence very

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.540
generally, when people do
the right thing when nobody's

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.180
watching, something like this.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.860
I think at Google, we
are very metrics-driven.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.500
So we need to define
excellence with metrics.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.010
So what do you discuss
about that in your book,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.722
or you just keep
it very general?

00:32:48.722 --> 00:32:50.430
HUGGY RAO: I think
what we talk about is,

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.930
when we think about
excellence, we actually

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.700
are talking a lot
about accountability.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.400
Accountability actually
has two dimensions.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.910
One dimension is, you feel
like you own the place.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:06.640
But you can actually do things
to influence development

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.970
metrics or whatsoever has been
actually entrusted to you.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:15.180
The second dimension
really is, but you also

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.670
feel the place owns you.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.720
So you need, I think,
the push of commitment

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.900
and the tug of obligation.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.060
And what's important
with metrics is,

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.590
you want to make
sure you preserve

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.530
that feeling of
ownership, and you

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.930
create that sense of obligation.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.000
If it's only metrics
that you have-- you

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.160
can actually get
to that footprint,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.080
but lose the mindset.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.750
A couple of weeks ago,
there was this company

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.780
called Health
Associates, which I

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.830
think is a Florida-based company
that actually was indicted

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.530
by the attorney
general's office.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.119
Why were they indicted?

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:52.910
Because they were
actually admitting people

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:56.540
into hospitals when there was
absolutely no reason to do so.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.910
And what was fascinating
was the emphasis on metrics.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:05.090
Every physician had a
color-coded ID, if you will,

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.690
on a scorecard.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.230
You beat target, you were green.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.850
You were close to
target, you were orange.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.190
You were below
target, you were red.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.210
And what do you think
these physicians did?

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.880
They were admitting
young infants

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.310
with temperatures of 98.7,
saying that they were abnormal.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.880
Let them actually get
admitted into the hospital,

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.139
because you're actually
increasing revenue.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:31.040
So there's also a dark
side of accountability.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.510
And the dark side
of accountability

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.060
often is realized on the
over-emphasis on metrics.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.870
And we talked at
length about that,

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.086
to be very mindful of that.

00:34:40.086 --> 00:34:41.960
BOB SUTTON: But I'll
get to what your saying,

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.334
but I want to-- and this is
actually very good question--

00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:47.395
I wouldn't necessarily directly
disagree with Huggy, but--

00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:48.270
HUGGY RAO: Please do.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.739
BOB SUTTON: --but I agree
that you have to-- that things

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:53.290
are more effective-- whatever
the metrics are, when there's

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.810
that feeling that, I own the
place, and the place owns me.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.120
And you know what
the larger thing

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.160
you're trying to accomplish
is, assuming it's ethical.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.564
Because this would work from
unethical organizations too.

00:35:01.564 --> 00:35:03.480
Let's have as many murders
as we possibly can,

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.070
might be, for some
organizations,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.440
a reasonable metric.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.860
But if you look at the
cases that we look at.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.682
And three points
in my career, I try

00:35:11.682 --> 00:35:13.640
to figure out what
organizational effectiveness

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.250
was.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.460
And each time I sort of
succeeded and sort of failed.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.931
And the best I
could do was to say,

00:35:19.931 --> 00:35:22.430
in every context you have to
ask the question, effectiveness

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.220
of what?

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.740
And effectiveness for whom?

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.340
And come up with a reasonable
metric in that situation.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.790
So one of the cases
we use in the book

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.790
is a group that does
routine knee operations

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.990
at a hospital in Boston.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.960
So for them, the
contextualized metrics,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.300
and you have them here at
Google as well, would be,

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.607
so how much does it cost?

00:35:43.607 --> 00:35:44.690
How much pain are they in?

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.481
And how many days are
they in the hospital?

00:35:46.481 --> 00:35:48.209
Those are pretty
reasonable metrics,

00:35:48.209 --> 00:35:50.250
assuming that they're
dealing with the exceptions

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.740
in an ethical case,
in an ethical way,

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.650
but I think the
notion of metrics--

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.850
I don't think that Huggy
and I would dismiss it.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.433
And believe me,
between the two of us,

00:35:59.433 --> 00:36:01.280
he's the one who
can count, not me.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.650
He's one of the best people
in metrics I've ever seen.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.610
But embedding it in the
context is very important.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.150
Please.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.680
AUDIENCE: And probably,
also what you're saying

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.540
is too many metrics
could be the dark side,

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.109
but just enough, that's
what you should go for.

00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:17.900
BOB SUTTON: So one of
my favorite examples,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.941
I can't remember if we
put this in a book or not,

00:36:19.941 --> 00:36:22.560
but Jeff Pfeffer and
I, once, years ago, we

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.870
were studying Citibank.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.140
And we were introduced to the
most effective Citibank branch

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.439
manager in all of the New
York metropolitan area.

00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:31.480
So we go in, and they got
this balance scorecard,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.010
they got like 30 measures.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.760
We say, what's the
secret to your success?

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.450
He said, I ignore
everything on the scorecard.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.324
And the reason they
think I'm the best person

00:36:38.324 --> 00:36:42.220
is that I have the best
profitability of any branch.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.290
And you notice that they
called me the best guy,

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.144
and that balance
scorecard is bullshit.

00:36:46.144 --> 00:36:47.810
And the other people
who are screwing up

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.810
are actually paying
attention to it.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:55.130
So absolutely too many
metrics are very bad.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.120
I like Huggy's case with Waze.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.980
AUDIENCE: Actually I would also
add that the right metrics are

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.210
just as important, right?

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.290
Metrics drive behavior.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.590
I think, the question that
I have on the table is,

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.260
when we talk about
scaling, I think

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:14.090
you touch upon people, process,
tools, so all those three

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.700
things we need to
look at them, right?

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.980
And how to prioritize.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.850
And I think you talk about
stopping bad behavior.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.730
And I find that
really interesting,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.670
and I kind of want
to hear your take on,

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:30.770
what are some of the things that
the highly successful companies

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.890
do in dealing with
the people issue?

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.980
Because you do hire
different people

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.090
with different capabilities
as the company grows.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.810
Because the needs change.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.550
So but you go enter with
different players on the field.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.094
How do you make them
work together, right?

00:37:48.094 --> 00:37:48.760
HUGGY RAO: Yeah.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.530
That's a great question as well.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.350
So the first thing
about bad behavior.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.930
The very basic finding,
robust finding,

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.830
is bad's way stronger than good.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.290
In one study of marital
relationships, what is it?

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.470
For every nasty thing you
tell your partner, or spouse,

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.500
you have to say five
good things at least--

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.083
BOB SUTTON: Or it's
not going to last.

00:38:09.083 --> 00:38:12.540
HUGGY RAO: --and you can
imagine the, sort of, asymmetry.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.880
The thing about bad behavior
is, bad behavior basically

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.654
is a signal that nobody cares.

00:38:19.654 --> 00:38:21.070
And that's the
reason why you have

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.020
to actually get to
it very quickly.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.940
And it might actually
have to do with waste,

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.610
it might have to
do with delay, it

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.870
might have to do with
outright malfeasance, whatever

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:38.360
the manifestation
of bad behavior is.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.950
But the important
thing to realize,

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.820
and we talk about
in the book is,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.560
you don't want to
leap to the conclusion

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.930
that bad behavior is the
product of bad people.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.090
Good people do bad things.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.660
Because they're mostly
responding to the system

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.500
that's there.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.380
And you guys at Google do a
marvelous job of making sure--

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:01.320
when you think of people
who aren't performing,

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.410
how you actually reduce
variance in performance,

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.970
by giving them a new
start and so forth.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.290
So very important to make sure
you come to terms with the fact

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.420
that why are bad people--
why are good people doing

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.340
bad things?

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.490
And here, context matters.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.440
At the other extreme, what
we talk about in the book is,

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.831
people do bad things
because bad involves thrill.

00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:25.580
And one of the things
you've got to you've

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.890
got to kill the thrill.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.350
We actually have an example of a
nice study done by psychologist

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:37.500
about a factory where they
were actually stealing tools.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.251
So what do you do?

00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.875
BOB SUTTON: Like big
tools, like things

00:39:39.875 --> 00:39:41.130
that weighed 1,000 pounds.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.796
HUGGY RAO: They're
all taking them home.

00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:46.650
So you can think of, oh my
god, I'm going to put fines.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.760
No, I'm going to appoint guards.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.790
No, we're going to
have video cameras.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.950
So these guys thought about
it, and they came back

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.270
with a very strikingly
counter intuitive solution.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.760
They said, hey, we actually
have a lending library here.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.890
You guys can borrow the tools,
and if you've been late,

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.030
there's an amnesty, you
can always turn it back in.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.430
So once there was no prohibition
about taking the tools,

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.900
the thrill of
stealing was kind of

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.876
lost because anybody
could take any tool.

00:40:14.876 --> 00:40:16.250
And of course,
these workers were

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.330
being pressured by
their wives saying,

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.660
you're messing up the art
and taking up too much space.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.400
Please return those damn
tools back to your factory.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.150
So they were able to
stop it like that.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:30.250
So those are the two
bookends, if you will of that.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.520
BOB SUTTON: In this story,
I like to use the metric.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.061
They went from having a million
dollars worth of stuff a year

00:40:35.061 --> 00:40:37.472
stolen to nothing, just by
saying, here it's yours.

00:40:37.472 --> 00:40:39.430
This was a great example
of killing the thrill.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:40.660
And they would just
steal things that

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.076
were hard to steal, just because
it was fun to steal them,

00:40:43.076 --> 00:40:45.876
not because they needed them.

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:48.000
HUGGY RAO: The other thing
you have to keep in mind

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.670
is-- and I just want
to connect the metrics

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.370
and kind of bad
behavior-- this isn't

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.950
a conclusion by any means,
but at least a good null

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.250
hypothesis.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.990
When there are lots of
metrics, a good null

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.760
hypothesis to begin is, you have
smart people who are afraid.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.490
Because if all of the metrics
were highly correlated,

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.270
they would all load
into one factor.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.000
So obviously you
don't need 30 metrics

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.559
because the intercorrelations
are so high.

00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:17.600
And the reason they're
not going to be correlated

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.040
is you going to look
good on some things.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.873
BOB SUTTON: I would
also add, independently,

00:41:20.873 --> 00:41:23.257
the fear-- I actually
did some early consulting

00:41:23.257 --> 00:41:25.840
work a litttle with HP on this
when they had too many metrics.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.200
And what ends up happening
is, in terms of having

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.080
the same mindset and
people in the same page is,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.270
the whole game becomes-- so
you're a general manager at HP.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.750
In the old days,
there's 54 divisions

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.910
and you're assessed on like
30 or 40 different metrics.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.330
Your job is to
convince everybody

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.789
that the one metric
you're great on

00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:45.246
is what you should
be evaluated on.

00:41:45.246 --> 00:41:47.080
So this whole
political gamesmanship

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.140
went on that had nothing
to do with actually

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.580
moving the company forward.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.410
Yes.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.060
You have a question here.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
here, and writing the book.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.496
BOB SUTTON: Thank you.

00:41:57.496 --> 00:41:59.360
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask about the step

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.980
before you worry about scaling.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.131
There is a lot of
theories, and Paul Graham

00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:06.130
I think wrote an article
a few months back that,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.100
startups should never
worry about scaling,

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.230
should just get the prototype,
learn as much as you can.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.500
And I've actually
managed startups

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.420
where we had a great product.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.982
We had the team of people
that were not aligned.

00:42:20.982 --> 00:42:22.940
And we had the three
issues that you mentioned,

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.920
incompetence, the
impatience, and the illusion.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.680
And I sort of said, OK.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.980
Let's stop.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.740
And let's try to figure
out what's going on.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.290
And improve it based on that.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.530
And then worry about scaling.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.650
It's not about getting
more customers, et cetera.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.274
BOB SUTTON: I think you answered
your own question brilliantly.

00:42:41.274 --> 00:42:43.424
And the way that we
say this, and it's

00:42:43.424 --> 00:42:45.590
one of those things that
is so obvious, it's stupid.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.520
But companies
sometimes forget it.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.200
Which is to spread
excellence, you

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.200
have to have
excellence to spread.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.810
And so you've got
to stop-- and that's

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:58.020
why to quote Huggy--
it's a ground war,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:58.940
it's not an air war.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.944
When you have real
excellence, you actually

00:43:00.944 --> 00:43:02.360
create that little
pocket in them.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.735
And especially if
you have money.

00:43:03.735 --> 00:43:05.076
Money's dangerous.

00:43:05.076 --> 00:43:06.742
And I think you're
Waze example is great

00:43:06.742 --> 00:43:07.825
because it's a temptation.

00:43:07.825 --> 00:43:10.320
Let's build it out and hire
a huge sales organization

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.510
before we have something
that we're selling

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.920
is a classic thing
that's happening

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.211
in many of our over funded
startups in the Valley right

00:43:15.211 --> 00:43:15.760
now.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.980
And that's one advantage
that Larry and Sergey took

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.700
a long time for
them to sell Google,

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.850
so they actually had to work on
making the thing even better.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.100
And just to give you an example,
in the IT rollout space.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.000
One of my favorite
cases in the book,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.910
at the end of chapter
two, is a great rollout

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:36.230
of medical care,
electronic medical care

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.590
records at Kaiser Permanente.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.730
And the way they did it, this
woman named Louise Lang led it.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.846
It was about six or seven year
process, cost about $5 billion.

00:43:44.846 --> 00:43:46.470
Kaiser's the biggest
health care system

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:48.500
in the country, private
health care system.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.450
They got it working perfectly in
the smallest region in Hawaii.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.822
They got it just, worked
and worked and worked.

00:43:53.822 --> 00:43:55.280
And once that
started working, then

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.070
they went to the next
region, once it was working,

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.020
went to the next one.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.660
So they didn't spread that
thin coat of whatever.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.890
They got it humming, and then
they spread that excellence.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.821
So your example in the startup,
I think, is exactly right.

00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:09.070
And that's one reason that--
probably most people know

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.490
this evidence-- there's a lot
of evidence of startups that

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:17.560
are started in downturns are
more likely to survive and grow

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.811
into larger companies than
upturns because they-- well

00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:22.268
first of all, don't have too
much money, and second of all,

00:44:22.268 --> 00:44:24.020
they have to take time
to do stuff right.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.660
And I remember when we
interviewed Larry Page in 2002,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.060
I could not figure out whether
he was the last dot.com person

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.937
standing, or actually,
he was on to something.

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:36.020
Because all the other
companies seemed to be dead.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.642
And then there was
this guy, Larry Page,

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:40.850
who claimed that he was
going to grow a huge company.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.840
And I guess he was right.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.055
So I think you've got it, man.

00:44:45.055 --> 00:44:46.930
AUDIENCE: So I guess
the core of my question,

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.880
and based on your
experience, and maybe it

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.280
might be your next book
which is, how do you

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.415
infuse excellence
in the first place?

00:44:53.415 --> 00:44:54.040
BOB SUTTON: OK.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:54.956
Huggy you answer that.

00:44:54.956 --> 00:44:55.814
That's too hard.

00:44:55.814 --> 00:44:57.230
Huggy gets all the
hard questions.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.063
He's the smart one--

00:44:58.063 --> 00:44:58.987
HUGGY RAO: I think--

00:44:58.987 --> 00:44:59.820
BOB SUTTON: --He is.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.210
If there was an IQ test right
now, [INAUDIBLE] happen.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.620
HUGGY RAO: So this
actually dovetails

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.610
quite nicely with one of
the core beliefs at Google

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.590
and really your own
experience here.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.150
I think the heart of
infusing excellence

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.570
is really how you hire people.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.300
That's one part.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.120
And real excellence
also means, how do you

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.840
get extraordinary performance
out of ordinary individuals?

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.980
So hiring talent
doesn't sort of mean,

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.060
well we're actually going
to get the very best people.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.490
And we're going to pay a
whole lot and so forth.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.840
You can actually get
amazing performance

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.880
from ordinary individuals.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.200
And here, changing
the context matters.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.990
One of the cases
that we talk about,

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:48.020
which was actually written by a
colleague of ours at Stanford,

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.400
is about a company called
Tomago-ya in Japan.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.060
And what Tomago-ya does is
they deliver lunch to offices,

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.300
$3.60 per lunch.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.360
And it's a little Bento box.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.630
So every day you can
order the lunch you want.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.080
The last order is at 10 o'clock.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.090
And you've got to
deliver the lunch by 12.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.510
The amazing thing is, their
factory is more than 2.5 hours

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.830
away from the business
district of Tokyo, Shinjuku,

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:17.530
but you've got to
deliver the lunch.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.980
So the problem is, how do you
actually wait until 10 o'clock

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.530
and deliver the lunch?

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:26.600
And every day they
serve 70,000 lunches.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.270
And the average
waste, if you will,

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.910
the underage, or in
their case, the overage,

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:38.630
is that on 46 lunches,
which translates to 0.06.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.094
My colleague, who wrote
the case, asked the CEO.

00:46:41.094 --> 00:46:42.260
He says, how do you do that?

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.890
Do you guys have very
sophisticated algorithms,

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.850
where you can process
orders, route trucks.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.140
He says no.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.440
How do you do that?

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.420
And he says, well, we
make sure our trucks leave

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.940
before the first order comes.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.780
And the guy says,
how can you do that?

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.790
How can you get trucks to
leave your facility at 8:00

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:04.600
in the morning to the farthest
the [INAUDIBLE] customers

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.580
even before you got the orders?

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.200
And the guy says, the key
people are our van drivers,

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.830
who deliver the lunches.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.930
They can actually
pick the customer.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.510
And once the lunch is over,
these are reusable Bento boxes.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.470
You can go and pick the
Bento box up, talk to people,

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.460
and quickly find out what the
nature of demand the next day

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.000
is.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.010
And in the evening,
they tell their boss.

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.870
By the way, a small
district actually

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:32.630
is managed by one of
these area managers.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.590
And then you'll
funnel it upwards,

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.450
and that's really what it is.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.180
And my colleague said,
now, who designed this?

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.720
And the founder said, you
know, me and the truck drivers.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.730
And he said, who are
the truck drivers?

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.550
And this is the
striking part, they

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:50.040
are all people who are
high school dropouts.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.900
Now, it's true that
there are bonuses

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.560
that link to any weigh stage.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.080
But the point is,
it's not just that.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.770
You've given them
a second chance.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.190
And you are really getting
extraordinary performance

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:05.810
out of people who could arguably
be labeled C or B, or whatever.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:09.939
So very important to
keep that in mind.

00:48:09.939 --> 00:48:11.730
AUDIENCE: I'll make it
a little bit harder.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:17.740
So you go into a startup,
small team, one star.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.450
Most of the others are B's
and a few, let's call, F's.

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:28.010
And you start getting rid of
the F's because it's just not

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.000
working.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.120
And then you end up
with a smaller team,

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.950
with the VCs shouting at you.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.880
And you're running out of
money, product's not performing.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.580
The excellence, the culture of
the company is just struggling.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.440
And all of the elements
are against you,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.000
as any other startup.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.630
And then to infuse a
culture of excellence

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:55.730
into a place that got used to
being sub-mediocre performance

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.820
is something I really
struggled with personally

00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.900
in a previous life.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.380
And I want to just see
what is your take on how

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.537
that could that be handled.

00:49:05.537 --> 00:49:07.370
HUGGY RAO: I can certainly
feel your pain is

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:08.530
one thing I can say.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.210
I'm being mischievous here.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:14.000
But in the hypothetical example,
or the reconstructed example

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.360
out of your experience that
you gave, you've got one star,

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.860
you've taken out
the F's, I assume.

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.342
And you've got the B people
as it were, so to speak.

00:49:25.342 --> 00:49:26.800
And one of the
things we talk about

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.190
is, scaling isn't just
about stars, it's actually

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.370
about your sherpas, too.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.740
I mean think of how you
get to the top of Everest.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.344
Three people get
there, that's true.

00:49:37.344 --> 00:49:39.010
But there's a lot of
people who actually

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.880
do all the heavy lifting
to help you get there.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.850
BOB SUTTON: The
Sherpas are the stars,

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.558
and the other people
just pay them money.

00:49:43.558 --> 00:49:46.400
So [INAUDIBLE] the question
where the stars is.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.310
HUGGY RAO: So the real challenge
is, how do you actually

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:53.120
get great performance out of
people who are at the B level?

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.040
And one simple place to start.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.010
It's by no means a
sure fire bullet is,

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.450
if you look at the evidence,
B-level players respond

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:09.200
way more positively to
gifts that are actually

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.170
given to them.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.680
So when I say gifts, I'm
not saying buying them off

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.990
with money, doing something
for them that's a surprise

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.260
that they actually value.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.830
And the reason is, if
you have B-level player,

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:24.770
you look around in the
market, and you sort of say,

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:26.700
I'm looking around,
I can't get a job

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.370
like I have in this company.

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.080
Here's a company that's
done something nice for me.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.090
And it could be as simple
a thing as something

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.160
for their child or
spouse or whatever

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.940
the specific
instantiation is, they're

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.400
actually going to
give you 10x back.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.010
If I'm an A-level player,
you do something nice for me,

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.640
I'm also going to scan
the talent market,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.920
and simply say, well
he did it because hey,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.720
that's the price at attention.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.780
Otherwise, I'm going
to go someplace else.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.930
So you actually have
very asymmetric responses

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.150
to gift-giving.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:00.230
And what you really
need to understand

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.470
is, what's the gift
that makes the most

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.000
sense for your B-level players?

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.340
And that, I don't have line
of sight to give you more--

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.400
BOB SUTTON: I'm going to say
something more cynical which

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.990
is, we hear about the--
including this one we're

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.010
sitting in now-- the
startups that all make it.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.150
Most of them die.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.690
Most of them deserve to die.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:21.350
And a lot of the
entrepreneurial game, I'm sorry,

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.110
it's just knowing when
to shoot the thing.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.770
And venture capitalists,
especially the good ones,

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.460
are really good at that.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.350
And I don't want to
damn your startup.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:35.360
But the typical startup
in Silicon Valley dies.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.620
And it should die.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.790
So in the thing to do
is to take that A-player

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:43.650
and maybe reform with another
set A-players and to go again.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.490
Because the great thing about
startups is, failure's cheap.

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:50.390
And most of you who start
firms in Silicon Valley-- this

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.170
is not Detroit-- you
can get another job.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.630
Most of you are quite talented.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.950
So my view of startups is, if
things are really screwed up,

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:59.930
well that's what
pulling the plug is for.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.870
And quitting is good.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:03.430
Never quit-- that's bullshit.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:06.550
HUGGY RAO: And
certainly, you don't

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.920
want to escalate commitment to a
losing course of action either.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.940
BOB SUTTON: That's
what I was saying.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.825
More fancy language.

00:52:14.825 --> 00:52:16.950
HUGGY RAO: This is the
conversation Bob and I have.

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:18.824
But usually over
a lot of wine so.

00:52:18.824 --> 00:52:21.240
MALE SPEAKER: So having said
all that, you aren't advising

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.573
people to go to startups, right?

00:52:22.573 --> 00:52:23.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:23.222 --> 00:52:26.400
BOB SUTTON: No, no.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.394
You all know the odds.

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:28.310
You all know the game.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:29.860
So it's just the way it works.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.210
So you go there, and Google
buys you or they come back,

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.001
you come back as an
employee after it died.

00:52:34.001 --> 00:52:35.440
Either way, it's OK.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.100
MALE SPEAKER: So do we have time
for a question or two, Cliff,

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.180
or are we set?

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.610
CLIFF: Yes, a final question.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.110
MALE SPEAKER: Any other audience
question for Bob and Huggy?

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.610
I had one more, which
doesn't have anything

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.350
to do with the book itself.

00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.870
Obviously, both of you
teach at the business school

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.290
at Standford.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:57.800
And many Googlers are
interested in going

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.030
to business school
getting their MBAs, right?

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:06.070
So what's the advice that
you'd give to a Googler who's

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.620
considering business
school, who has

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.660
other things that they could do?

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.320
And this is a question that
we and the people up scheme

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.020
get asked all the time.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.260
So since we have you, we can
ask the same question of you.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.580
And by the way, don't
make it too compelling

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.730
because we want these
people to stay here.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.386
HUGGY RAO: So Bob why
don't you actually be--

00:53:25.386 --> 00:53:27.760
BOB SUTTON: I don't teach in
a business school, remember.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.670
I'm an engineering
professor, so therefore, I

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.420
am free to be cynical.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.780
Our friend Jeff
Pfeffer would tell you

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.040
that, if you're interested
actually in lifetime income,

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.269
that you should only go to a top
eight-- in addition to the fact

00:53:40.269 --> 00:53:42.810
that it's a great vacation, and
all sorts of wonderful things

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.550
happen in business school.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:48.251
But you should only go to a top
eight or ten business school.

00:53:48.251 --> 00:53:49.626
Because other than
that it's just

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:50.830
going to take two
years of your life

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.720
and lower your lifetime income,
and there's very good evidence

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.850
to support this.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.704
So I want to play the,
sort of, Jeff Pfeffer card.

00:53:57.704 --> 00:53:59.870
But one thing I will say
about the Stanford Business

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.640
School, where I don't
teach, because I'm

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.310
a tenured engineering professor,
is that-- as my understanding--

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.847
is that if you go
to Stanford, it's

00:54:07.847 --> 00:54:09.430
actually a really
good financial deal.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:12.070
That on average, you're going
to come out ahead financially.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:14.836
And culturally, that's
sort of up to you.

00:54:14.836 --> 00:54:16.710
The final thing I would
say though, since I'm

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.710
from an engineering school
and I'm not engineer,

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.530
is we all know that
the characteristic

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.900
of the current boom is
it's much, much less

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:27.296
MBA-centric, and
much, much-- you

00:54:27.296 --> 00:54:28.870
know this much
better than I do--

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.310
and much, much more
engineering-centric.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.660
So it's the engineers'
days, and we're

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.227
winning, even on an engineer.

00:54:35.227 --> 00:54:37.910
HUGGY RAO: So one other
thing to keep in mind

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:43.200
is, business schools are
changing dramatically too,

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.200
so you don't think of the
MBA as a standalone degree.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.960
In fact, we have a number of
programs where you actually

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.120
have an MBA, you can
also get a masters

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.170
in computer science and
electrical engineering,

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:56.170
just to name a few.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:59.090
So there are lots of
options and combinations.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.240
Our experience certainly at
the Stanford Business School

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.110
is, pretty much, the kinds
of people who actually come,

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:10.450
they're overwhelmingly tilted
towards a startup option.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:14.230
By the end of year one, they've
already figured out an idea.

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.410
They're working.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.020
They're trying to do things.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.620
And as a matter of fact,
right before I came here,

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.740
I was actually teaching a course
along with a finance professor

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.725
and a marketing professor,
a course called "From Launch

00:55:26.725 --> 00:55:28.140
to Liquidity."

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.580
Once you start a venture,
how do you actually

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.930
think of your exit?

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:34.370
And I can certainly
tell you, our students

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:36.870
believe in very liquid futures.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.670
or at least, they kind
of anticipate that.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:39.690
BOB SUTTON: See,
I don't even know

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.410
how he was teaching this,
since I'm very focused.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.784
The course we teach in the
engineering school, especially

00:55:43.784 --> 00:55:45.710
the design school, we
wouldn't talk about it.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.250
We have a class
called "Launch Pad."

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.500
We put you in it, and
you'd start your company.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.250
And so there's a class
called "Launch Pad"

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.540
taught by Michael
Dearing and Perry

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.490
Klebahn, both who are
successful entrepreneurs

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.410
in their own right.

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:58.152
Although Michael did fail
in a big shoe operation.

00:55:58.152 --> 00:55:59.860
If you don't have a
product by week four,

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.450
you're supposed
to be thrown out.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:02.332
So little--

00:56:02.332 --> 00:56:03.790
HUGGY RAO: A number
of our students

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:05.100
actually do take that course--

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.460
BOB SUTTON: You can take that
as well in the business school.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.820
HUGGY RAO: So you have the
whole, sort of, university.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.110
But just to give underscore.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:15.650
Bob's point about how
attractive this is as an option.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:17.852
Once when I was
teaching a class,

00:56:17.852 --> 00:56:21.070
there was a young lady who
got up and told everybody

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.222
in the class, hey, I
have a proposal for you.

00:56:23.222 --> 00:56:24.930
And she looked at me
and said, professor,

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:26.050
can I make the proposal?

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:26.980
I said, sure.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.820
She looked at 80 kids
in the class and said,

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.870
I'm actually going to give
you $250,000 right now.

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:38.780
In return, I want 2% of
your lifetime earnings.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.320
what do you think was the
response of those 80 people?

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.930
Mull over that,
and that's where we

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:47.880
ought to appropriately
close on a puzzle.

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.630
BOB SUTTON: That's
like a Google interview

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:51.250
question, the old ones.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:52.250
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.390
Thank you Bob and Huggy
for coming over and sharing

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.060
all of your insights on scaling.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.747
Again, the book is called
"Scaling Up Excellence."

00:56:58.747 --> 00:57:00.330
BOB SUTTON: Thanks
for your questions.

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:01.490
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
thank you for questions,

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:04.230
and we have copies of the
book in the back, as well.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.434
So, with that, lets give a
warm round to Bob and Huggy.

00:57:07.434 --> 00:57:08.350
BOB SUTTON: Thank you.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.641
HUGGY RAO: Thank you very much.

00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:21.266
