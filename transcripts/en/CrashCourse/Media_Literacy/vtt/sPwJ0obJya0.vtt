Hello!

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.900
My name is Jay Smooth and as you may have
guessed from the title of this video, over the next 12
weeks I am going to teach you about Media Literacy.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.920
First, allow me to introduce myself:

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.420
I’m the host of New York’s longest running
hip-hop radio show the Underground Railroad, a
media commentator on TV, radio and interwebs,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.360
and I’m best known nowadays for my video blog
Ill doctrine, where I dissect the latest news and yell
at people about being nicer to each other.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.720
So what exactly is media literacy?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.400
We’re gonna talk more about this in our
first episode, next week, but here in the preview
I’ll at least tease that definition.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.700
For our purposes, in this course, media literacy is
“the ability to Access, Analyze, Evaluate, Create and
Act using all forms of communication.”

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.060
We’ll break down what that means throughout
this series, but for now I just want to drive home
the fact that media is all around you.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.900
And living in a saturated media environment,
it’s important to understand how to digest all
of that content.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.900
Like, how do I know if a piece of media is
trying to manipulate me?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.640
Spoiler Alert: It probably is.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
Or, how can I be sure that a piece of news
is fact based?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.391
Don’t worry, we’ve got some tips and tricks
for you.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.780
We’re going to explore the breadth of media
that surrounds you in your daily life.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.900
We’re going to look at why it’s created
and what its goals are.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.300
We’re gonna look at everything from popular movies
to propaganda to your date night text messages.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:25.720
Media literacy skills are about everything from
navigating popular culture, to being a better citizen, and
even being a better communicator in your everyday life.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.740
Which may or may not include yelling at people
to be nicer to each other.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.170
There’s a lot to cover and I can’t wait
to get started.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.980
I’m Jay Smooth and I hope you’ll join me on
this journey with Crash Course Media Literacy.
