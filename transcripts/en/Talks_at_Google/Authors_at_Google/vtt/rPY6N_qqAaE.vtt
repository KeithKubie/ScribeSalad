00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.640
ADAM FRANK: Thank you very much
for giving me the opportunity

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.806
to talk with you guys today.

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:11.840
So yeah, I'm a computational
astrophysicist.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.004
So my day job is not
thinking about aliens.

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:16.170
That's kind of my night job.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.090
So my day job is studying
things like how stars form

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.770
and how planets evaporate.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.420
I do magneto fluid--

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.760
large-scale
supercomputer magneto

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.810
fluid dynamical simulations
of astrophysical gas dynamics.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.385
But because I do a lot
of work with the public,

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:35.760
I've ended up having to think
a lot about climate change,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.035
because I write
about climate change.

00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:39.410
And over the years,
I've have had

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.480
to deal with a lot
of climate denial.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.940
And that is unbelievably
frustrating.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.570
And in doing that,
I came to start

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.030
thinking about the problem
differently about how--

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.360
ways of-- the ways in
which we frame climate

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.180
change entirely wrong.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.220
And so that's really
what the topic of my book

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.230
is, so "Light of the
Stars Alien Worlds

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.760
and the Fate of the Earth."

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.290
So what I want to
take you through

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.970
is kind of a
different perspective

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.130
on thinking about
climate change from what

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.250
I would call the
astrobiological perspective.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.830
So the idea here is you
can't solve a problem

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.180
until you understand it.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.270
And you can't understand it
until you can tell its story.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.010
And my premise here
is that the story

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.040
we're telling about climate
change is the wrong story.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.220
And it's not our fault.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370
It's just that we're in
a different position now.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.530
And we can tell a
different story.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.140
And the story we're trying to
tell about is the human future.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.464
What is the human future on
a climate changing planet?

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:37.130
But in some sense
really what I'm asking

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.890
you is what is the future
for any civilization,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.637
a large-scale industrial
civilization on any planet.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:46.220
I am going to take you through
why that's not a crazy question

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.190
to ask.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.190
So the problem we know
is climate change, right,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.130
that the anthropogenically
driven change in the planetary

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.080
state that we are switching
from a state for the last 10,000

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.110
years that's been
basically warm and moist,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.490
meaning most of
the stuff isn't--

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.410
most of it or not most--
but lots of the water

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.717
isn't locked up in
ice to something

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:09.800
that we don't know, right?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.619
We're pushing the
Earth into a new state.

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.160
And then there's
also coupled to this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.600
are issues of resource depletion
from fresh water to forests.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.060
So this issue of
sustainability comes up, right?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.166
Can we build a sustainable
version of our planet?

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.040
And when we think about
science and politics,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.300
right, because that
somehow whenever

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.800
we wanted to have
this conversation,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.130
it immediately falls into
the political domain.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.080
And while certainly
policy is a pol--

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.780
there's going to be politics--
the science itself is what gets

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.440
cast--

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.820
suddenly becomes political.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.945
And when you think about
this, it's really amazing.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.100
And when I did the research
for this book, I realized that,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
or I found that actually
a president in 1965

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.140
gave a speech to Congress
identifying CO2 and climate

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.100
change as a potential
problem, right?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.367
So the idea that somehow this
is this modern hoax that climate

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:57.950
denialists want to
tell you about is--

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.460
this gives lie to it, that in
1965 actually that should be

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.790
President Johnson gave a
speech before Congress where he

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.120
mentioned CO2 as--

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.220
and the climate change--

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.302
as a particular problem.

00:03:09.302 --> 00:03:10.760
But so we know
what's happening now

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.530
is this political polarization--
that somehow this science issue

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.560
got lumped into all the
other kinds of polarization

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.440
that we have.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.040
So if you have a certain set
of beliefs, for some reason

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.050
you also have to think
that climate change is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.350
a hoax or climate
change isn't happening.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.920
And that's part
of the dilemma we

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.260
face in trying to take
any action on the problem.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.380
So what is the real problem?

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.260
What is the real problem
that we're facing?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.220
And it's really one of
perspective, not politics,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.650
because the science has been
settled for a long time.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.282
My first job after
undergraduate--

00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:46.490
I took a year and a half off.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.531
And I did lots of crazy
things like planted trees

00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:49.490
in British Columbia.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.680
I was a bouncer at the
Rocky Horror Picture Show

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.690
on the 8th Street
Playhouse in New York.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.280
But I also got a job in 1985 at
Jim Hansen's Goddard Institute

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.930
for Space Studies.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.942
And I asked them--

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:03.150
I was a programmer basically
assigned to the program.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.250
And I said, what
are we doing here?

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.450
And they said, oh,
you know, we're

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.130
studying to see whether
or not the climate is

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.730
going to be changing.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.688
That's an idea we have.

00:04:08.688 --> 00:04:10.170
And I was like, whoa, right?

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.400
So this was 1985 long before
anybody else had heard of it.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.934
By 1988 Hansen gives that
very famous testimony

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:18.600
in front of Congress
saying, like, look,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.540
we actually have
found the signal.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.450
So the science is old.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.294
And so the science
is not the problem.

00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:25.960
It's the perspective
that's the problem.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.335
And our perspective-- and I
think the reason that we have

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.702
such a hard time--

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.910
the public-- and I deal a
lot with the public through

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.050
my science writing--

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.880
is that we think it's
a one-time story.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.070
We think we are a
one-time story, right?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.110
We think climate change is
something happening to us.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.800
And that's the only
time it's ever happened.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.620
And there's no guides,
no examples, no other--

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.100
no way of framing this that
allows us to see something

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.434
deeper in it.

00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:52.100
So all we end up doing
is fighting about

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.740
whether it's happening or not.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.480
So what I'm going
to argue in the book

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.260
is that we have to broaden the
perspective to truly understand

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.760
what is truly happening.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.440
That's the basic idea here.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.880
So what I mean by
that is we must

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.700
learn to think like a planet.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.250
And that is something
that over our history--

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.740
our 10,000 year history
of civilization--

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.470
we've never been called
upon to do it before.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.081
And by civilization what I mean
is agriculture, city building,

00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:19.580
right?

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.038
Clearly human beings have been
around for longer than that.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:23.870
But it's in the
post-Holocene or that--

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.880
after the ice-- last
ice ages ended--

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.400
not post-Holocene but
after post-ice age

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.930
that we started building
this kind of civilization.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.240
And it's only now
that we-- the planet

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.990
is starting to notice
that we're here.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.660
And in order to deal
with the problem,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.740
we're going to have
to start thinking

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.857
the way a planet thinks.

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:42.440
And what I want to
argue is we've only

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.630
learned how to do that
in the last 20 years

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.730
or so for a bunch of reasons.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.420
So a little test, which
of these is the Earth?

00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:53.230
AUDIENCE: Is it all of them?

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.590
Which--

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.100
ADAM FRANK: What?

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.670
AUDIENCE: Is it all of them?

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.135
ADAM FRANK: All of them.

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:55.630
Yeah, it's right.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.920
That's exactly the question.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.840
I mean-- oh, yeah, I'm always
glad when people see that,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.340
right?

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.720
So the idea here is here's
six different Earths,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.500
right, that this one is the
Earth in the Hadean right

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.520
after it formed.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.381
It was a liquid magma ocean.

00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:10.630
This is a version of the
Earth that was a water world.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.421
It took a while for
the continents to grow.

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:15.460
So when you see those animations
of the continents sliding

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.460
all around, those only go back
a few hundred million years

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.620
or so, because in the
beginning all we had were

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.310
what were called
cratons that were--

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.101
it took a while for
the continents to grow.

00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:25.384
So Earth was a water world.

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.800
There were periods
when the planet

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.590
has been so warm that it's
been virtually no ice anywhere

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.160
on it.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.445
So we've been a jungle world.

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:33.070
There's been periods
when the Earth has

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.670
been a snowball basically
glaciated almost from top

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.907
to bottom or from
a pole to equator.

00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:40.990
Here's the Earth we-- the
happy Earth we know now.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.360
And here is the Earth--

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.930
actually not all that long.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.230
In maybe another 2 billion years
or so that as the sun heats up

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.420
like any main
sequence star will do,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.170
the temperature's going
to get high enough

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.320
to push the Earth outside
of the habitable zone.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.350
So the point here is that the
Earth has worn many masks,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.850
right?

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.790
And what's happening
with us now is we're

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.440
changing the mask that the
Earth is about to wear.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.730
So we should get used to this.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.840
And it should become
part of our story.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.690
Now so as I said the Earth
has had worn many masks.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.520
I love this diagram that a
friend of mine or a guy I knew

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.160
drew, just a beautiful
representation

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.660
of all the different
eras and epochs

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.610
and eons of the Earth's history.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.212
And you see all of
the different times

00:07:23.212 --> 00:07:24.670
and the different
kinds of animals.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.700
But what's important is we're
up here in the Holocene, right?

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.500
And each of these
different Earths

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.750
represents wildly
different conditions

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.600
that the planet
has passed through.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.090
But what we have been living
in, in the last 10,000

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.940
years, which geologically is
not that long, is the Holocene.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.830
And here is a record
of temperature.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.120
And there's zero.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.030
This is variations from
the current average.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.170
And here is ice content.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.419
What you can see is the ice
has been going up and then

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:50.470
down, up and down.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.090
And these periods
when the temperature

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.300
sort of pokes above zero
is-- these are interglacials.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.420
So the Holocene, which
is the entire history

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.000
of human civilization, is
just the latest interglacial.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.250
So the whole of human
civilization-- all our history,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.580
all our wars and
hardship and creativity

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.010
has been in the Holocene.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.164
But if you look at the
Earth's history overall--

00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:15.580
and this is one
of the revolutions

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.310
I'm going to talk about that
we've undergone in the last 20

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.280
or 30 years that give us this
new perspective on what's

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.960
happening to us with
climate change--

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.170
you see how dramatically
life has played

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.430
a role in these transitions.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.020
So what-- here's
another question.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.520
These are the only two--

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.990
I promise-- the only
two test questions.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.460
What would've happened if
you landed on the Earth

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.350
about three billion
years ago and walked out

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.520
of your spaceship?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.720
What's the first thing
that would happen?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.490
You'd suffocate, very good.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.890
Because what's amazing-- even
though the Earth had lots

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.816
of life on it-- life had been on
the Earth for a billion years--

00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:47.690
there was no oxygen in
the atmosphere, right?

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.310
The oxygen-- it was a pure,
a nitrogen CO2 atmosphere.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:58.580
And most of the oxygen
got put in place

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.670
around 2.5 billion years ago
in what's called the Great

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.580
Oxidation Event.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.910
So this is a plot of oxygen
concentration versus time.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.640
And you can see the
oxygen content was

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.060
a million times less
than it is today back

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.640
then even though the
Earth was rich with life.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.070
And what created the
Great Oxidation Event?

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.290
It was blue-green bacteria.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.660
It was the invention of a new
kind of photosynthesis that

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.867
used water as a substrate and
burped out-- or farted out,

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:25.450
depending how you
want to look at it--

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.490
farted out oxygen, thereby
changing the atmosphere

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.560
of the entire
planet and changing

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.660
the entire evolutionary history,
the evolutionary trajectory

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.596
from that point on,
not just for life--

00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:40.220
though it had huge
consequences, right?

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.928
You couldn't have big
brains that like we

00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:45.360
have without the energy that
comes with oxygen metabolism,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.670
but also for the planet itself.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.336
By having all this
oxygen, it completely

00:09:48.336 --> 00:09:55.040
changed the chemical cycles that
regulated the planet's history.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.560
For example, it created ozone.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.140
Without an ozone layer,
you could never--

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.210
without ozone you
would completely

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.790
change the dynamics
of the surface.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.540
From the life's
perspective, without ozone

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.890
you could never
have colonized land.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.450
So it was the step in
the Great Oxidation Event

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.550
that actually allowed
the land to be colonized.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.624
So this is an example--

00:10:15.624 --> 00:10:17.540
and it's something very
important for us now--

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.680
that life is constantly
coevolving with the planet,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.180
right?

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.864
So in this plot, what
we see is on this side

00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:28.280
is things that have happened
in Earth's history going back

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.904
four billion years
and things that have

00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:31.290
happened in life's history.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.370
And you see there's this
constant feedback between them

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.600
where the development of
a methane eating bacteria

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:47.480
will drive the great snowball
phases of the Earth's history.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.230
Having oxygen allowed
sex actually to happen,

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.780
because it allowed organisms to
figure out sexual reproduction.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.460
So life and planets coevolve.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.180
That should be a lesson for
any life on any planet, right?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.440
What we've seen is that the
biosphere is an important actor

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.192
in the history of our planet.

00:11:08.192 --> 00:11:09.650
And we should expect
that it should

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.340
be a important actor in at least
other-- some other planets.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.960
So this leads to what is called
the Gaia hypothesis, which

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.760
was controversial.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.343
But let me tell you
a little about it.

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:24.196
It was proposed by
James Lovelock in 1979.

00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:25.820
And the idea was that
all living things

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.790
on Earth kind of function
as a super organism

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.170
that that creates--

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.330
self-regulates the
planet for life,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.440
right, that basically
even though the sun

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.900
is increasing in temperature,
the feedback loops

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.060
created by particularly
microorganisms

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.680
will regulate the
planet's temperature

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.070
to keep it cool even though the
overall solar radiation that's

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.350
hitting your planet is going up.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.100
And this was actually an
incredibly important idea--

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.935
here is--

00:11:51.935 --> 00:11:54.440
it was Lovelock and the
famous biologist Lynn

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.200
Margulis who got together and
sort of really built this.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.314
And it was a very controversial
idea when it was first proposed

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:01.730
and part of that
because it became

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.390
kind of a New Age sort of--
there were Gaian churches.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.140
And there were Gaian festivals.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.130
It became a very
New Age woo idea.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.960
And there was one
reason why scientists

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.000
didn't like it
though was because

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.620
of the idea of teleology.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.972
It somehow seemed like it
implied like the Earth wanted

00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:19.430
to go somewhere,
like the Earth had

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.660
a mind, that it was trying to
direct itself for some purpose.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.660
And of course, we know that
evolution is blind, right?

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.480
But over time both
Margulis and Lovelock

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.020
were able to show that
there's no teleology here.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.300
This is still blind evolution
but that these feedbacks do

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.000
in fact work.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.110
And so what happened was people
kind of dropped the name Gaia.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.892
And it became Earth
systems science.

00:12:41.892 --> 00:12:43.100
We now don't talk about Gaia.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.850
We talk about the
coupled Earth systems.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.140
And by that we mean the
biosphere, the atmosphere,

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.649
the hydrosphere, which is all
the water, the cryosphere,

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:53.690
which ends up playing a
huge role-- all the ice--

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.010
and then the lithosphere.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.530
So what we now understand is
that the Earth is this very

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.720
strongly coupled system.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.220
Coupled systems--
they all interact.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.930
And that life has been driving a
lot of this evolution for quite

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:06.840
a long time.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.404
So that was really the
main result of Gaia

00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:11.570
was to get scientists to
understand that life is not

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.790
some green scruff just
sitting on the surface

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.270
passively, that it hijacked
the planet a long time ago.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.220
And when we think
astrobiologically,

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.140
this is a key idea
for us as we go

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.876
hunting for other biospheres.

00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:24.500
So right now there's
an enormous amount

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.124
of work, some of it
going right on over

00:13:26.124 --> 00:13:30.470
at MIT, developing
models of exo-biospheres.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.480
And they're using
these kinds of ideas

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.120
as the fundamental way
we're going to detect life

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.900
on other planets.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.960
We're going to look for
signatures of biospheres,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.540
chemical signatures
of biospheres--

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.520
it's a very Gaian idea and
actually goes back to Lovelock

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.750
in 1963.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.560
He actually proposed that idea.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.434
So this leads us now to
the Anthropocene, right?

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:52.100
So now that we have
some background here

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.950
about life and
coevolution and planets,

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.740
we come back to ourselves,
which is our entry

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.060
into the Anthropocene.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.010
So the idea of the
Anthropocene-- it was first

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.130
proposed by Crutzen
and Stoermer in 2002.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.440
And they were thinking
in terms of strata.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.240
They were actually proposing
that a million years from now,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.670
you would be able to see the
Earth's entry or our presence

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.500
by a layer of strata
that would have

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.440
chemical or isotopic
signatures of our presence.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.510
But even more than that
it was the recognition

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:25.850
that human beings now are the
principal drivers of changes

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.480
in those coupled
planetary systems, right?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.550
And this has now been verified
in multiple ways, things

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.160
like we can--

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.850
it's human beings who move
around most of the phosphorous

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.720
on the planet.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.000
Climate change is
an obvious example.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.520
Land colonization--
there's many, many markers

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.100
you can find to show that
really it's human beings that

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.500
are driving how
this system behaves,

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.000
which means we're
pushing it, right?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.990
So the climate--
or those coupled

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.980
systems, this non-linear
complex system, right,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.320
now it's been sitting at
the bottom of a well, right,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.400
in potential energy so to speak.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.390
And now we've been rocking it
hard enough over the last 150

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.980
years that we're now--

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.050
it's starting to roll off
into some other state.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.370
So the Anthropocene is
something that is happening.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.320
And the question is
what are its outcomes.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.680
And do its outcomes
include us, right?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.540
So the entry into
the Anthropocene

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.820
raises profound new
questions about the nature

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.010
of human activity within the
coupled planetary systems.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.540
And what I want to show is
how by taking this 10,000

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.160
light-year view of
this, we actually

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.920
gained a pretty powerful
new way of talking

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.670
about climate change.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.800
One of these is--

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.950
I just had a New York Times
op-ed two days ago about this--

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.870
is that this is not
about saving the Earth.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.350
The Earth is going
to be just fine,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.475
thank you very much, right?

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:40.400
So this whole often
gets framed as like,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.730
oh, climate change, we
have to save the planet.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.480
But as I like to say,
you know, the planet

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.950
is not a little furry bunny.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.220
That's one of the lessons
of understanding the Earth's

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:49.850
history.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.500
There are five known
mass extinctions.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.500
Each one opened up
new niches for species

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.660
to evolve including like
this little critter here

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.820
who's your ancestor, right?

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.195
This was a mammal
that was around

00:16:00.195 --> 00:16:01.570
during the time
of the dinosaurs.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.380
And it was only
the mass extinction

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.450
that allowed she and her
progenitors to lead to us.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.180
So even though we're
driving a mass extinction

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.880
in terms of the long-term
history of the Earth,

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.340
the planet will just
use that for a new round

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.830
of evolutionary innovation.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.450
So when we talk
about sustainability

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.825
what we have to be very careful
is to understand what are

00:16:25.825 --> 00:16:27.404
we trying to sustain, right?

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:28.820
And what are the
moral imperatives

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.530
that we invoke for doing so?

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.440
So often, for example,
we show these pictures

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.260
of polar bears on
lonely ice floes

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.630
to drive some guilt and
some action hopefully.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.122
But the idea is there--

00:16:43.122 --> 00:16:45.080
when we think about this--
is that, oh, my god.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.240
We can't let the polar
bears go extinct.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.240
But on the other hand who's
crying for this guy, right?

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.940
The velociraptors
were once around.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.930
And they went extinct.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.180
Lots of species
have gone extinct.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.241
So we need to understand
what exactly are we

00:16:58.241 --> 00:16:58.990
trying to sustain.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.860
Is it the polar bear for itself?

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.179
Or is it the sort of our
framing inside the biosphere?

00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:06.845
Now I need to make
something very clear,

00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:08.030
right, because at this point,
some people are getting

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.020
really angry at
me, like, well, you

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.228
don't care about polar bears.

00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:11.869
I do care about
polar bears, right?

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.310
But the polar bears get fit
into this larger question,

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.560
which we're not asking.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.750
So for sure climate
change is an immediate

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.410
and possibly existential threat
to the project of civilization.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.630
It is imperative that
we act immediately

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.160
and with some force in
order to deal with this.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.570
So nothing I'm saying
here takes that away.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.540
But the problem is-- one problem
is why haven't we acted, right?

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.080
Why after years-- and
Johnson brought this up--

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080
why haven't we acted?

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.020
And part of my argument
here is that we've

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.120
had-- the story
we've been telling us

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.250
has been able to be co-opted.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.630
The main story
we've been telling

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.670
has been co-opted
by climate deniers

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.860
as a way of blunting
our activity.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.890
So what are we
trying to sustain?

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.150
What we really are
trying to sustain

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.630
if we're being honest is the
climactic conditions that

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.510
are amenable to a particular
kind of civilization-- ours,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.010
right?

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.240
It's technological.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.710
It's energy intensive.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.210
It's got a pretty
high population.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.626
I mean, hopefully we can bring
the population slowly down.

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:11.000
But unless somebody wants to
volunteer to off themselves,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.130
it's going to have a high
population for a while.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.830
And also what we want is
maximum human well-being.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.940
Actually what we want--

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.550
you can add to this maximum
biospheric well-being including

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.660
polar bears, right?

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.201
But we have to understand that
really what we're trying to do

00:18:23.201 --> 00:18:25.850
is we're trying to hold some
version of the Holocene, right?

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:33.397
We are having a great preference
for the Holocene, right?

00:18:33.397 --> 00:18:35.480
I mean we have to understand
why we're doing that.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.438
We should be honest about
why we're doing that.

00:18:37.438 --> 00:18:40.244
And as the Anthropocene goes
on, one of the things I'm saying

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.660
is what you're
going to be holding

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.270
is a version of the Holocene.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.567
It's not the Holocene
anymore, because we're here.

00:18:45.567 --> 00:18:46.900
And we're going to have impacts.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.910
So by sustaining the
Holocene in perpetuity

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.060
we take on the role
of planetary stewards.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.340
And what does that
actually mean?

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.410
What does that make us?

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.110
How do we fit into nature
in particular, right?

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.450
In some sense, the
view I'm advocating--

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.600
a city is no different from
a forest from the biospheres

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.440
perspective, right?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.510
We are what the biosphere
is doing right now.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.060
So and particularly
what is nature?

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.770
In a planet that has a
technological civilization

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:18.420
on it--

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.130
a large-scale energy intensive
technological civilization--

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.000
what is nature?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.130
What counts as nature anymore?

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.830
So now I want to come to--

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.750
this will be the second
half of the talk--

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.050
the astrobiological perspective,
how actually thinking

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.030
about planets
generically, which is

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.446
what we should be doing, because
that's what we've learned

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:38.390
over the last 20 or 30 years--

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.970
how does this change--

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.520
how does this reframe everything
I've just been saying?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.860
So astrobiology is a
relatively new field.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.684
It's about thinking about
life in its planetary context.

00:19:47.684 --> 00:19:49.600
It's about thinking about
what's happened here

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.140
and what might happen
elsewhere in a deeply

00:19:53.140 --> 00:20:00.150
scientific and deeply
interdisciplinary kind of way.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.100
So there's been
three revolutions

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.590
that have happened in
astrobiology that we

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.030
want to address.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.610
So clearly astrobiology
right now has an n equals

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.490
1 problem, right?

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.650
We can only have
one example of life.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.820
And you can say,
like, well, how do

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.460
you even have a field when you
only have one thing to study?

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.751
The thing is though that if
you take that point of view

00:20:16.751 --> 00:20:18.390
you're missing some
amazing things that

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.320
have happened, right?

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.690
So it's a very data
rich field in the sense

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.480
of these three revolutions--
the discovery of exoplanets,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.580
the exploration of
our own solar system,

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.287
and the unpacking Earth's
4.5 billion year history.

00:20:30.287 --> 00:20:32.370
So very quickly let's sort
of look what those are.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.200
So number 1, exoplanets--

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.030
so when I was a
graduate student there

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.020
were no other planets in the
universe except our own, right?

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.852
This question of
exoplanets dates back--

00:20:41.852 --> 00:20:43.810
you can see the Greeks
arguing about it, right?

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.030
So Aristotle felt
that the Earth was

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.360
the only world of its kind
in the entire universe.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.080
And other Greek thinkers,
the atomists in particular,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.720
were very sure that the
universe was full of planets.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.126
And all those planets had life.

00:20:59.126 --> 00:21:00.250
You follow through history.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.670
And you can see sort of people
switching back and forth.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.500
By the 1900s it was
thought that planets

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.119
were very rare,
because the way they

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:07.660
thought planets
would form was that--

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.451
the only way you could
get it was two stars

00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:12.720
passing close to each other and
getting gravitational extrusion

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.710
like taffy.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.884
So those collisions
would be so rare

00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:18.300
that it was thought
that planets--

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.940
one in a trillion stars
would have planets around it.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.210
And so this went on
until 1995 we discovered

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.167
our first exoplanet, right?

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:29.250
It's not often that you
get to live at a time when

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.520
a 3,000-year-old question
gets definitively answered.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.570
Since then something
remarkable has happened,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.528
which is particularly
the Kepler mission, which

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:39.960
uses transits when you look
for the planet passing in front

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.980
of the star so the light dims
a little bit that now suddenly

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.920
we went from sort of a
retail planet hunting

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.270
to wholesale planet hunting.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.610
And so now what
we know remarkably

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:55.080
is that every star-- pretty much
every star you see in the sky

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.150
has a family of
worlds around it,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.320
I mean that is a remarkable.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.840
Planets are everywhere
other than perhaps

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.630
the most massive stars which
themselves are very rare.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.280
Every star has planets.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.780
And if you count up five stars--

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.627
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:22:07.627 --> 00:22:09.960
one of them is going to have
a planet in the right place

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.830
for life to form.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.871
It will be what's called
the habitable zone where

00:22:12.871 --> 00:22:13.832
liquid water can form.

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:15.540
And we think water is
essential for life.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.020
So one out of every five is
in the right place for life

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.416
to form.

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:21.540
So that was one revolution.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.780
The other revolution
was we've sent robots--

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.290
robot emissaries now,
robot ambassadors--

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.010
to pretty much
every kind of body

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.080
in the solar system--
asteroids, comets.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.090
We've visited every planet
in the solar system.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.930
We've had rovers rolling
around at least one of them.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.670
But we've had stuff touch
down on a lot of others.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.294
And so we get pictures like
this, which could be Mars.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:43.710
Or it could be the
Mojave Desert--

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.880
turns out it's Mars, right?

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.940
But this has been
decades now that we've

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.770
been rolling around on Mars.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.790
And we've learned
amazing things.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.910
For example, we
now know for sure

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.650
that Mars was a blue world.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.900
In the early part of the
solar system Mars most likely

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.849
looked like this.

00:22:58.849 --> 00:23:00.390
It was had a much
thicker atmosphere.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.640
It had water-- at least
lakes if not oceans on it.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.000
There is strata that we can see
that you can do the estimate

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.920
to show that water
probably hip-deep

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.220
was rushing at about 3 feet
per second across that channel.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.330
So it's remarkable.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.960
So it shows us, especially
in dealing with climate,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.660
is to show people that
it's not like we just

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.910
have the Earth to study
when it comes to climate.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.450
We have tested our climate
models against Mars,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.025
against Venus, against Titan.

00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:30.150
And with those models all--

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.525
I can predict the
weather on Mars

00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:33.810
basically tomorrow with
great accuracy, right?

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.970
So the idea that these
climate models are just

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.620
kind of oh, something
somebody made up,

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.610
that's just completely wrong.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.610
We know how climate
works, because we've

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:46.290
seen how climate works now on
six different kinds of planets,

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.570
all very different.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.334
So our study of the
solar system has--

00:23:51.334 --> 00:23:53.250
that's what's taught us
to think like a planet

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.250
or at least taught us how
to think like a planet

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.700
without life, right?

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.830
And then through
the Earth study,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.980
we're able to think
like a planet with life.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.160
What's also important is
to show that sustainability

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.144
is-- just like
habitability-- is probably

00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:08.310
going to be a moving target.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.540
We're going have to
learn to think that way,

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.520
because the Mars
used to be habitable.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.220
But it certainly isn't
now except for maybe just

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.800
very extremophile
kinds of creatures.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.619
So that was revolution number 2.

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:21.660
And then revolution number
3 as I kind of already

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.150
went through is the unpacking
of Earth's history--

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.282
the Great Oxidation
Event, the thermal maxima

00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:30.240
that have occurred when
the planet was a jungle

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.010
world, the Snowball Earth.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.110
We now really have seen
that Earth is so many

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.690
different-- has been so
many different planets

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.270
that in some sense it gives
us all those different eras.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.942
It's almost like we've got nine
different planets with life

00:24:41.942 --> 00:24:43.650
to study by studying
the Earth's history,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.310
because they were so different.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.160
So where does all this lead us?

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.040
Well, by using the
astrobiological perspective,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.210
we can think about the
Anthropocene in a broader

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.750
context.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.390
And then this question comes up,
right, which nobody ever asks.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.140
We all know that we
have to build a system

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.542
version of civilization.

00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:02.500
But how do we know that's
even possible, right?

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.140
How do we know that's
something the universe does?

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.760
Universe has--
makes black holes.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.990
Universe makes comets.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.810
Universe makes
interstellar clouds of gas.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.080
How do we know it makes
long-term sustainable versions

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.270
of energy-intensive
civilizations,

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.400
right, because it may
be that there's just

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.990
no such thing like
that in the universe.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.570
So this-- by framing it
this way, suddenly we're

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.770
going to ask the questions
in a very different way.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.270
But of course obviously it
means taking exo-civilizations

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.860
seriously, right?

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.500
And I'm using exo-civilizations
rather than aliens

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.410
for a particular reason, right?

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.020
So now when I say this, I'm
not talking about detection.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.460
I'm not talking about
going out and finding them,

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.636
though that is definitely
an interesting thing,

00:25:44.636 --> 00:25:46.510
particularly in the era
that we're in when we

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.784
have all these new exoplanets.

00:25:48.784 --> 00:25:50.950
I'm not talking about the
details of their biology--

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.824
whether they look like
reptiles, whether they

00:25:52.824 --> 00:25:58.090
have nine fingers on each hand,
what kind of sex they have.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.050
That's not amenable.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.060
I don't have any
constraints scientifically

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.989
to actually address that.

00:26:02.989 --> 00:26:05.530
And certainly not sociology--
are they communist, capitalist,

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.730
peace-loving, not--

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.770
there's just nothing
I can do there.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.170
What I can do,
however, is I can focus

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.480
on the co-evolution
of civilization

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.750
and a coupled planetary
systems in a scientific way.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.885
I now know enough to run
models of this interaction

00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:23.350
and ask what the generic
response of a planet

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.555
is when it's got an energy
intensive civilization.

00:26:25.555 --> 00:26:27.180
And that's what I'm
going to convince--

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.420
I'm going to show you a
little bit of those results.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.378
We've run those models,
just actually published

00:26:30.378 --> 00:26:32.070
them just a little while ago.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.740
All right.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.400
So my emphasis
here is it's really

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.890
time to start doing this,
because it matters for us.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.990
And that means it's time to take
exo-civilizations seriously.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:44.230
And it's time to stop
snickering about it, right,

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.563
because any time you try and
bring up aliens it's always

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:48.030
like pffft, aliens, he he he.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.238
And that was a long time in
the scientific community.

00:26:50.238 --> 00:26:52.340
And it's because of
prosthetic foreheads, right?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.010
The reasons we can't
talk about aliens

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.370
seriously is because we've had
years of bad television science

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.060
fiction where everybody
looks like us.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.850
But they've got
maybe antenna on us.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.760
So we're in a different
universe now, right?

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.700
We recognize the
civilization that we've built

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.170
is the kind of
alien civilization

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.780
we've always been dreaming
of on a certain level, right?

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.470
So we need now to get past
the snicker factor and ask,

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.700
because that's our own--

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.327
it's related to our own
survival in some sense.

00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:21.410
So what I'm going to tell
you now for the next 10,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.784
15 minutes is
we're going to head

00:27:22.784 --> 00:27:26.650
towards a science of
exo-civilizations, theoretical

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.560
studies that are relevant
to the Anthropocene.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.299
So first of all, we
have to recognize

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.340
when we think about
exo-civilizations it's always

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.350
been a battle between
optimists and pessimists,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.350
right, if you look at the
history of this field.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.270
And what I'm going to argue
is that changes significantly

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.506
with the new data.

00:27:41.506 --> 00:27:43.630
So I'm sure many of you
are familiar with the Drake

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.680
equation, right?

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.900
So long interesting history--

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.910
the Drake equation
was basically a way

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.210
of figuring out how many
civilizations exist right now

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.830
that we could communicate with.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.750
And they did that by
breaking up the problem

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.550
into a bunch of
different pieces--

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.880
the number of stars in
the galaxy, the fraction

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.440
of those stars
that have planets,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.560
the number of those planets
in the habitable zone,

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.647
the fraction of those
planets that form life,

00:28:07.647 --> 00:28:09.230
the fraction of that
life that goes on

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.896
to intelligence, the fraction of
that intelligence that develops

00:28:11.896 --> 00:28:14.230
technology, and finally,
as I like to call it,

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.610
the final factor--

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.372
bum bum bum-- the
average lifetime.

00:28:18.372 --> 00:28:20.580
That's actually the thing
we're really interested in.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.740
What is the average lifetime
of a civilization like ours?

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.490
So I won't go into
this in detail.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.460
But in a paper that we
did in a couple of years

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.909
ago Woody Sullivan and I
used the Kepler data, right?

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:32.450
We've got all this
data about planets

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.010
now, which we
didn't have before.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.920
And we used it to sort
of figure out, well,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.980
what can you say about
exo-civilizations empirically

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.970
based on all this new data.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.570
And what we found is that if
you ask the right question,

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.439
you could say something
pretty remarkable.

00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:48.230
So here's what we ca--
we defined something

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.610
we called the pessimism line.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.310
And it answers the
following question.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.430
What does the probability
for a civilization evolving

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.520
on a random planet
have to be for humanity

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.680
to be the only time
it's ever happened?

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.380
What's the limit on that
probability from this new data

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.321
that we've gotten so that we're
the only time that civilization

00:29:05.321 --> 00:29:06.070
has ever happened?

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.028
And we can do this now.

00:29:07.028 --> 00:29:10.420
We can set an empirical limit
on this, because we now know--

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.590
if I go back, right, when
Drake wrote down this equation,

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.390
that was the only
term that was known.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.360
Now these two terms
have been nailed.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.660
So that's a pretty large
increase in your understanding

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.410
for this equation.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.640
There's only seven terms in it.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.560
So it turns out for us to be
the only time in cosmic history

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.930
that a civilization has
arisen the probability would

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.190
have to be 10 to the
minus 22 or lower.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.320
1 in 10 billion trillion.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.812
If the probability for forming
a civilization on a planet--

00:29:41.812 --> 00:29:43.270
nature is going to
set this, right,

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.645
through its
evolutionary process.

00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:47.770
If it's any larger than this
number, it's happened before.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.540
That's a pretty small number.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.210
You don't have to work very
hard in order to get higher

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.010
than 1 in 10 billion trillion.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.480
As long as it's bigger than
that, we're not the first time

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.430
there's been a
technological civilization.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.231
So what that means-- so if you
look at like famous pessimists

00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:02.730
in time--

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.140
Ernst Mayr or Brandon Carter--

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.820
I won't go through this--
these are people who are like,

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.500
no, civilizations are
really hard to make.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.250
They never happen.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.210
They're really rare.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.097
Their numbers are so much
larger than that pessimism line

00:30:12.097 --> 00:30:13.680
that there's has
been tens of millions

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.012
or trillions of civilizations
over cosmic space and time.

00:30:17.012 --> 00:30:18.720
And the reason why it
was important to do

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.610
this it was because
what we're really asking

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.360
is if you had a statistical
ensemble of alien civilizations

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.826
what would their
history be, right?

00:30:25.826 --> 00:30:28.200
They're all going to go through
what we're going through.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.075
That's part of the
argument is that it's hard

00:30:30.075 --> 00:30:33.000
not to trigger an Anthropocene,
because a civilization is just

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.430
a way of taking energy,
harvesting energy

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.764
from your planet and doing work.

00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:38.263
Second law of
thermodynamics is kind

00:30:38.263 --> 00:30:40.870
of going to demand that you
have some kind of feedback.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:45.450
So what this work shows is
that it's really not hard--

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.330
you don't have to work very hard
in terms of the probabilities

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.090
to end up with the
conclusion that there's

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.140
been lots of histories.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.390
And so doing--
thinking statistically

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.520
about Anthropocenes
is not a bad idea.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.522
So the Anthropocene-- it's
happened before probably,

00:31:00.522 --> 00:31:01.980
right, which is a
remarkable thing.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.240
So that's what this
idea that like we

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.320
look at what's
happening with Earth

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.070
and we have this huge
political debate.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.740
Everybody's freaking
out, because it's

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.050
as if like we're a
teenager who is going

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.557
through our emotional stuff.

00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:13.140
And we kind of feel
like nobody's ever

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.100
gone through this before.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.820
And then they talk.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.020
They get to an encounter
group or something.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.770
And they talk to others.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.300
They realize, oh, everybody's
gone through this before.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.487
So by modeling this
what can we figure out?

00:31:23.487 --> 00:31:25.320
So the claim is we know
enough about planets

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.880
and how they
respond to forcing--

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.640
meaning thermodynamic
driving-- to begin modeling

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.580
how any species will drive
feedbacks on their planet

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.260
through energy harvesting
and civilization building.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.310
So this is my call--

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.170
[LAUGHS]

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.910
--with tongue held
lightly in cheek

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.130
the theoretical archeology
of exo-civilizations.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.420
So how do we do this?

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.130
Well, what we're
going to do is we're

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.754
going to do dynamical
systems modeling.

00:31:48.754 --> 00:31:52.290
We're going to set up equations
for a population interacting

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.200
with its environment.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.840
And this is a
time-honored process

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.970
in population biology
going all the way back

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.340
to the predator-prey
model where you basically

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.235
have an equation for
the bunnies, an equation

00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:01.860
for the wolves.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.526
And they're coupled,
right, because when

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:05.820
the wolves eat the bunnies
they get more wolf babies.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.460
But too many wolf babies and
there's no bunnies left to eat.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.190
So you can write
down these equations,

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.750
solve them and you find
these oscillations that are

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.240
out-of-phase beautifully--

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.586
the data really match
this really well.

00:32:17.586 --> 00:32:18.960
So population
biology-- you don't

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.240
have to assume a lot about
population biology other

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.820
than you eat more resources,
you get more babies.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.090
That's the only assumption
I'm making in the models

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:27.840
that we're making.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.070
And maybe you can
say, OK, well, maybe

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.960
on life on another
planet doesn't do that.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.270
But that seems kind
of fundamental to what

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.870
we think of as life.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.630
So when we thought
about doing this

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.520
what we imagine is
we'd have some phase

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.830
space of planetary
parameters, right,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.620
like energy
consumption, population,

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.220
feedback on the planet.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.710
And what we imagine
is when we ran

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.410
the models we'd get
different kinds of solutions.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.720
So you can imagine you start
off with a very low population.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.720
And you're not using a
lot of energy per person.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.690
And what happens is as time goes
on, your technology increases.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.860
You start using more energy.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.940
Your population goes up.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.955
You make more babies.

00:33:03.955 --> 00:33:06.330
But eventually at some point
you're using so much energy.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.170
You're feeding
back on the planet.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.080
And your-- the trajectory
of your population

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.310
will end up heading
in this direction.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.800
And it gets too large.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.960
And perhaps the planet responds.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.630
You start having instabilities,
wild climate changes.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.757
And then your population
would come way back down.

00:33:20.757 --> 00:33:22.090
You'd basically collapse, right?

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.445
That's a collapse trajectory.

00:33:23.445 --> 00:33:25.320
Or you could have a
sustainability trajectory

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.040
where you figure out
how to deal with this.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.039
And you end up with some
nice steady state where

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:32.140
your population is stable and
your feedback on the planet

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:32.640
is stable.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.275
So this is what we were looking
to do when we built our models.

00:33:35.275 --> 00:33:37.650
And it's very interesting to
look at the Earth right now.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.750
This is the world
energy consumption

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.300
from 10,000 BC to now.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.040
So that's our energy per capita.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.190
This is CO2 concentration,
which is the planetary forcing.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.610
And this is global population.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.620
So those are those three
parameters for the Earth.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.080
And you see that,
yeah, like we're

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.360
pretty much on a
trajectory for something--

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.380
enormous increase, exponential
increase in world population,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.390
energy use, and the
feedback on the planet.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.960
So what happens
next generically?

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.190
So what we did is--

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.169
these models-- actually the
paper just came out recently.

00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:13.960
I won't go into the
equations that we used.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.039
These were actually--
these were,

00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:16.997
as you guys all understand,
a toy model, right?

00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:19.449
We tried to capture the
essentials of the interaction

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.690
between a population using
a planetary resource,

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.539
making more babies but having
that planetary resource feed

00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:27.380
back on the state of the planet.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.630
So that you end up--

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.909
the planet drifts
away from where

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.880
it was when you were
born as a civilization.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.860
So here's what the
solutions look like.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.170
So in these plots green is the
population of the civilization.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.639
And red you can think of
as planetary temperature.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.199
And what we found broadly
even in these simple models

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:51.080
were three classes
of trajectory.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.710
First was what we
called die off.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.420
So here you see the die off.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.930
The population
rises very quickly,

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.570
because it's consuming
the planet's resource.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.820
The planet heats up.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.220
The conditions on
the planet change.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.550
But then the population
overshoots the planet's

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.370
carrying capacity-- how
many of that organism

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:13.780
the planet can sustain.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.620
And then you get a big drop in
the number of the population

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.685
until you come to some
kind of nice steady state.

00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:20.810
But you do it at some cost.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:24.440
So you can lose in our models
up to 70% of your population.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.280
So imagine that everybody
you knew, 7 out of every 10

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.260
people you knew
disappeared because

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.559
of climate-related disasters.

00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:33.100
So it's not clear
that a civilization

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:33.891
could survive that.

00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:34.610
Maybe it could.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.220
But at least the
good news here was

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.200
you did get a steady
state in the end.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.670
There was also what we called
sustainable or soft landing.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.920
That was the really good news.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.336
Yeah, there's
definitely solutions

00:35:43.336 --> 00:35:45.250
where you change the planet--

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.600
red-- the temperature goes up.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.680
Your population goes up.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.060
And your energy use goes up.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.540
But you come to
some steady state.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.020
So the models admitted
that kind of solution.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.800
But there was also the
possibility of collapse.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.740
And there's enough in
there to be worrisome

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.330
where the population rises.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.610
The planet goes into
a runaway essentially,

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.476
just like Venus
went into a runaway

00:36:05.476 --> 00:36:06.850
with a runaway
greenhouse effect,

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.317
why Venus' temperature
is now 800 degrees.

00:36:09.317 --> 00:36:10.900
So this is a different
kind of runaway

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.250
but the same basic idea.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.690
And your population comes all
the way down to extinction.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.250
Now whether or not you
actually are extinct,

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.958
what really matters
is you can't maintain

00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:21.530
your technological, highly
coupled networked civilization

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.030
anymore.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.380
So that's in some sense
what collapse means.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.840
But also interesting we found
these oscillations as well

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.340
in there.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.399
The population rises and then
falls and rises and falls.

00:36:31.399 --> 00:36:33.190
But either way so these
were simple models.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.970
But they gave us a hint that
there are generic classes

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.120
of behavior in the models.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.190
So this leads us to
eventually-- so this

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.215
was a first cut at this.

00:36:43.215 --> 00:36:44.590
What the next step
is we're going

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.970
to build in real climate models.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.261
We're going to build in the
response of different kinds

00:36:48.261 --> 00:36:49.660
of energy sources, right?

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.060
There's only going to be so
many kinds of energy sources

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.637
a planet gives a
young civilization.

00:36:53.637 --> 00:36:55.970
You're going to have combustion,
maybe not fossil fuels.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.030
But if there's biomass,
you can burn it--

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.860
wind, solar, et cetera.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.290
So we can build that
into these and really

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:06.335
have much more physically
accurate kinds of models.

00:37:06.335 --> 00:37:08.710
And then we can run it for
all kinds of planets-- planets

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.860
that are close to the inner edge
of the habitable zone, planets

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.830
that are further out, planets
that start with oxygen,

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.540
planets that start
with less oxygen.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.250
We can do all different
kinds of things.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.416
And from that what we're
going to get is a predict--

00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:24.716
we're going to make a prediction
for this average lifetime.

00:37:24.716 --> 00:37:27.340
Now this really matters for us,
because if the average lifetime

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.860
of a civilization
is 200 years, we're

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.930
hosed, right,
because what it means

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.090
is there's very
little wiggle room.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.940
You don't have a lot of leeway
in the bets you make as you try

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.710
and navigate your Anthropocene.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.690
Almost nobody makes it, right?

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:45.100
On the other hand, if
your average lifetime

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.870
is two million years, yeah,
then you can make mistakes.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.270
There's a lot of-- you can
experiment and still make it

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.770
through.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.450
Lots of civilizations
managed to make it

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:53.711
through their Anthropocenes.

00:37:53.711 --> 00:37:55.960
So this is the thing that
we're headed towards seeing.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.320
And this itself sort of frames
what's happening to us now

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.124
in this sense that we are one
species out of many species

00:38:04.124 --> 00:38:05.290
that have gone through this.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.020
And we sort of need
to think more broadly

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.860
about our choices in that case.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.510
So more to the point
and because we're

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.407
almost done here the
astrobiological perspective--

00:38:16.407 --> 00:38:18.490
what it tells us is that
energy-harvesting species

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.490
and their civilizations
are simply something

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.062
that planets do.

00:38:23.062 --> 00:38:24.520
We can't keep
thinking of ourselves

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.130
as somehow special or unique.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:31.750
We are what the biosphere
is doing now, right?

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.150
The biosphere runs experiments.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.360
Planets with biospheres run
experiments over and over

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.180
again.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.272
And we are simply
one of those, right?

00:38:41.272 --> 00:38:42.730
Human beings and
our civilization--

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.540
we're just part of nature.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.110
The biosphere has done
lots of interesting things.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.790
It invented grasslands.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.070
That was a new
idea at one point.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.530
And then the grasslands spread
across the planet, changed

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.700
the planet's functioning.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.900
It invented dinosaurs.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.090
It invented blue-green bacteria.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.890
We are just what the
biosphere has invented

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.940
and is playing with now.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.648
And there's no reason
to think that we're

00:39:02.648 --> 00:39:04.930
going to be what happens later.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.230
So we're an expression
of the planet now.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.417
But do we continue to be an
expression of the planet?

00:39:10.417 --> 00:39:13.000
So one of these things, right--
so this is very controversial.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.720
I can get people really get
pissed off at me for this.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.900
What this means is climate
change is not our fault.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.030
One of the things I want
to push us away from

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.220
is this narrative we
have of that human beings

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.720
are a plague on the planet.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.872
We suck, right?

00:39:25.872 --> 00:39:27.330
When it comes to
climate change, we

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.550
don't have many stories,
right, many sort

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.620
of species-wide,
planetary-wide stories

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.770
about ourselves, because as I
said, it's a new transition.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.732
And the only story
we have either is

00:39:36.732 --> 00:39:38.190
it's not happening
at all, which is

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.615
what you get from the climate
denialists or we're terrible.

00:39:41.615 --> 00:39:42.240
We're horrible.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.080
We're a virus on the planet.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.054
And what I'm pointing out
here is that that's not true.

00:39:47.054 --> 00:39:48.720
So what do I mean by
this before anybody

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.980
gets really angry with me?

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:55.001
What I mean is that civilization
since its beginning has done

00:39:55.001 --> 00:39:55.500
what?

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.240
It has always looked
for energy sources

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.840
that it can power its buildings,
right, its irrigation.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.920
And we've been doing this since
the end of the Holocene, right?

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.020
So when we found oil it wasn't
like we were like mwahahahaha.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.184
I will destroy the planet
with this substance.

00:40:10.184 --> 00:40:11.850
It was like, oh,
there's this brown goo.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.812
And it's awesome.

00:40:12.812 --> 00:40:13.770
You can heat your home.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.630
You can build internal
combustion engines.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.879
It was great stuff.

00:40:16.879 --> 00:40:19.170
We didn't know we were going
to trigger climate, right?

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.990
It was an unintended
consequence of the adoption

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.110
of a particular energy
modality, right?

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.440
But now that we know if
we don't do anything,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.560
right, now not doing anything
about it would be our fault.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.580
It would be our failure.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.496
It would be our folly.

00:40:33.496 --> 00:40:36.930
It would be why we end up in the
garbage heap of civilizations

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.980
that couldn't manage their
transition to maturity.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.070
So this doesn't absolve us
some of the responsibility

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.041
of doing something about it
given how important it is.

00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:48.540
So what I'm trying
to do here really

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.220
is change the narrative, right?

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.430
The Anthropocene is not a
story of inherent human greed.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.175
It is not a story of our
unworthiness on the planet,

00:40:56.175 --> 00:40:58.660
that the planet's trying to
get rid of us in some sense.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.770
It's not a story of us as
being a plague on the planet.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.110
Instead the Anthropocene
is a story--

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.060
and that we're
just waking up to--

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.640
about planets and their
experiments, right?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.640
We didn't know about
Earth's 4.5 billion

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.980
year history of
life and coevolution

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.630
until very recently.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:17.880
That is a new
story for humanity.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.330
And now we have to recognize
is how we fit into this, right,

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:24.870
both because it's
true and also it's

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.920
the story we need to understand
to make it through the climate

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.090
change we've triggered.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.580
So for me the true lesson--
so "Childhood's End"--

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.070
any science fiction fans,
right, one of the great science

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.210
fiction books.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.770
The true lessons
of the Anthropocene

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.086
are that planets have rules.

00:41:40.086 --> 00:41:41.460
And we need to
learn them, right?

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.170
Planets are machines, right?

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:47.310
And we need to understand
how they function in order

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.860
to put ourselves back
into them, right?

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.350
Sustainability is
really in some sense

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.990
an awakened planet in
which both the biosphere

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.450
and the civilization can
flourish in entirely new ways.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.880
This is a paper
we wrote recently

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.421
where we looked at what would
be the thermodynamic properties

00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:04.580
of a planet with a large-scale
civilization on it.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.080
And the conclusions we came
to-- there's got to be some kind

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.710
of cooperative relationship
where the civilization makes

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.600
the biosphere even
more productive,

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.850
not just for itself but for--

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:19.270
not for the civilization's end
but for the biosphere's end.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.270
And it's really-- and
this is about the adoption

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:24.000
of what has been called
deep ecological values where

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.435
compassion and the
identification with life,

00:42:26.435 --> 00:42:28.185
because yeah, we're
part of the biosphere.

00:42:28.185 --> 00:42:29.250
We're not above it--

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.027
is a kind of primary value.

00:42:31.027 --> 00:42:32.610
And this is what's
interesting for me.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.564
It's actually the
completion of Gaia, right?

00:42:34.564 --> 00:42:37.230
Remember when I talked about one
of the big scientific pushbacks

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.930
on the Gaia hypothesis was
that it was teleological.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.590
It had meaning.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.880
It had a direction, right?

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.500
And we know that
evolution is blind.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.440
Yeah, it's blind until
something like us shows up.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.780
Once you get a
technological civilization

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.250
you're no longer blind, right?

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.650
The evolution is
no longer blind.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.750
We bring meaning.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.565
We bring direction now to
the evolution of the planet.

00:42:57.565 --> 00:42:59.940
So there's this idea that goes
way back of the noosphere.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.740
I don't know if anybody
ever heard of this.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.579
So there were two
versions of this.

00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:06.120
Teilhard de Chardin, which he
was a little bit more mystical.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.810
He was a scientist
and a Jesuit as well.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.790
And he sort of thought
of it as the world

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:15.420
being enshrouded in thought
or in the world's soul.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.330
But there was also Verdansky,
Vladamir Verdansky,

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:21.840
the great geochemist's
idea, which was more like,

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.570
yeah, once thought
appears on the planet

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.280
now just like
there's a biosphere,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.960
there's going to be a
sphere of thought around it.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.190
And the interesting thing
was de Chardin's version

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.070
of this, of the world
being covered in thought,

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.870
the more mystical
one was the one

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.204
that most people know about.

00:43:38.204 --> 00:43:40.620
But of course, what happened
is by-- and this is the great

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.560
place to talk about this--

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.487
we ended up building
a noosphere, right?

00:43:44.487 --> 00:43:46.070
I mean, by mistake--
we didn't know we

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.361
were going to make a noosphere.

00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:49.350
But like right now
this room is full

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.800
of electromagnetic radiations
carrying thought, right?

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.770
I mean everybody's cell phone
is picking up on the noosphere.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:59.400
So the idea of there
being a directionality

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.160
to the biosphere's
evolution once

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.511
a technological civilization
shows up may actually be--

00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:07.760
now that the world is covered
in the noosphere, right?

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.310
So these are the internet
links across the planet.

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.060
That may actually be a
natural part of the evolution.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.270
So with all of this
for me actually leads--

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.630
it's a story of hope, right?

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.710
So I did an Atlantic
story about those--

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.690
the study we did of the
different possibilities

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:29.340
of interaction between a planet
and a civilization, right?

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:30.090
And all the stor--

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:31.350
I did an Atlantic story on it.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.070
And it got picked up.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.260
And everybody was focusing
on all the trajectories

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.811
that led to death and disaster.

00:44:35.811 --> 00:44:37.560
And I had to be like,
whoa, wait a minute.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.420
One of the trajectories
was sustainability.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.820
So like even those simple
models point out to the fact,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.620
like, yeah, you can do this.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.260
I mean from that
simple perspective--

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.790
if the question is is
sustainability possible,

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:49.830
the answer is yes.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.970
It may be hard to achieve.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.590
But at least it exists according
to those very simple models,

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.380
right?

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.610
So I'm hopeful.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.890
So in its context--

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.910
in the cosmic context
in some sense,

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:03.750
the Anthropocene doesn't--
it's not a story with villains

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.350
in it, right?

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:08.790
As much as I am very angry at
the people who promote climate

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.530
denial, they're not villains.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.370
They're folly.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:13.470
They are the agent
of our folly that

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:17.700
will lead us to not
reaching our own potential.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.222
But from the
biosphere's perspective

00:45:21.222 --> 00:45:22.180
planets have histories.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.190
They have trajectories.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.310
And hopefully you can manage
to get yourself on a good one

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.192
and vote out the people who
are keeping you holding back.

00:45:29.192 --> 00:45:30.900
So it's a story about
winners and losers.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.316
And essentially
what I want to say

00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:34.890
is that we are cosmic teenagers
and that we need to grow up.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.780
So I think someone has done it.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.892
So why can't we?

00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:38.850
And I'll end with this.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.599
This is a picture.

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:41.850
Bill Nye came to the
University of Rochester.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.170
And he gave a talk.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.990
And I was ama-- i
mean, I knew Bill Nye

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.430
when I was a graduate
student in Seattle.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.399
But I didn't realize how much
the student-- how much the love

00:45:51.399 --> 00:45:52.440
the students had for him.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.315
And he was there talking
about climate change

00:45:54.315 --> 00:45:56.065
and how students can
solve climate change.

00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:57.314
And these guys were all there.

00:45:57.314 --> 00:45:58.420
And they were like, yeah!

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.200
I never saw so much
optimism and hope.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.030
So like I absolutely think
this is a solvable problem.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.260
But we have the wrong story.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.676
And until we change that story
we're going to kind of be--

00:46:09.676 --> 00:46:10.860
our options will be limited.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:11.980
So I thank you very much.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.949
I really appreciate
your time and listening.

00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:17.442
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:18.772 --> 00:46:20.730
I don't know if anybody
wants to ask questions.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.910
But-- yes.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:27.920
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
one part of one slide.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.340
Sorry.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.890
Possibility of civilization once
you're in the habitable zone,

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.500
I believe, was 10
to the negative 22.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.434
ADAM FRANK: Not the
possibility that if--

00:46:37.434 --> 00:46:39.600
we don't know what the
actual probability is, right?

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.013
AUDIENCE: True, true.

00:46:40.013 --> 00:46:40.771
This is the--

00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:41.520
ADAM FRANK: Right.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.770
The limit the pessimism limit.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.090
If it's below that,
then we're the only time

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.020
it's ever happened.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.490
If nature's choice for that
probability is above that,

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.449
then there's been lots.

00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:52.739
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if
though if you could expand--

00:46:52.739 --> 00:46:55.340
you basically said, well,
that's a really small number.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:55.560
ADAM FRANK: Right.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.240
AUDIENCE: At an absolute
value, it's very small.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.600
ADAM FRANK: Right.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.370
AUDIENCE: So therefore I'm
going to bet that it's larger.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.180
ADAM FRANK: Right.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.740
AUDIENCE: That doesn't
seem very satisfying to me.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.030
There are lots of
numbers in nature

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.680
that turn out to
actually be very small--

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:04.890
ADAM FRANK: Right.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.460
AUDIENCE: Smaller than
humans would have guessed.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:06.780
ADAM FRANK: Right

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:07.420
AUDIENCE: So there
was a turnout it

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.220
would be hugely bigger than
humans would have guessed,

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.830
because we tend to anchor
on numbers around one.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:14.760
ADAM FRANK: Right.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.387
AUDIENCE: So can you help--

00:47:16.387 --> 00:47:18.095
ADAM FRANK: Yes, no,
that's a good point.

00:47:18.095 --> 00:47:19.530
So that's why the
history of this debate

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.363
is important, right?

00:47:20.363 --> 00:47:22.380
That number doesn't
appear out of nowhere.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.381
I mean-- it comes from--

00:47:23.381 --> 00:47:25.421
that number doesn't appear
out of context, right?

00:47:25.421 --> 00:47:27.000
So there have been
over the years,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.550
over 50 years people
trying to approximate,

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.350
do some kind of
calculation that shows them

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.000
what this probability should be.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.760
And the best of them all is
what's called the hard step

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.080
model by Brandon Carter.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.340
And that's in-- the
hard step model has now

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.350
become you know actually
essential, because you

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:42.130
could actually calculate
probabilities out of it.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:42.838
And what he did--

00:47:42.838 --> 00:47:45.705
it's typical brilliant reasoning
where he just basically--

00:47:45.705 --> 00:47:47.830
he looked at the history
of the Earth and said, oh,

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.163
look the Earth is only going
to be habitable for another

00:47:50.163 --> 00:47:51.480
billion or half--

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.830
maybe a half billion years.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.100
And intelligence didn't show
up until the end, right?

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.683
So therefore it must
be-- intelligence

00:47:56.683 --> 00:47:57.750
must be hard, right?

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.560
And so then he came
up with this idea

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.030
there must have been
a bunch of hard steps

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:01.549
that evolution
had to go through.

00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:03.840
So from that he was able to
use the correct probability

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.340
distributions, et cetera.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.670
And he estimated there
were 10 hard steps, right?

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.760
And so then he calculated out of
that what that probability had

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.780
to be there for.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.055
And he got 10 to the 20.

00:48:14.055 --> 00:48:15.930
And he concluded in
that-- there's actually--

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:16.770
I put that quote in there.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.270
I'd have to switch
all the way back.

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:20.751
But he basically said, based
on this 10 to the minus 20.

00:48:20.751 --> 00:48:21.250
Sorry.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.106
He said, based on this,
we are the only time

00:48:23.106 --> 00:48:24.480
that civilization
has ever formed

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.650
in the history of the universe.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.047
Now you do the--
you've got data.

00:48:27.047 --> 00:48:27.630
You put it in.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.030
You find that no,
actually, in your model--

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.600
in Brandon Carter's
model there's

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.602
a hundred civilizations
that have occurred

00:48:32.602 --> 00:48:33.810
across cosmic history, right?

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.960
And we now know that there--
not know-- but now the idea is

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.380
there's not 10 hard steps.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.080
There's maybe only
five hard steps.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.157
Now again this is all
still controversial.

00:48:43.157 --> 00:48:45.240
We don't even know if the
hard step model is true.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.239
But it's the best one
that we have that actually

00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:49.830
gives us-- allows us to
do something or articulate

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.260
something numerically.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.830
And with five hard steps you're
down to 10 to the minus 15,

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:59.610
which means there would have
been 10 million civilizations

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.300
over cosmic space and time.

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.300
So when you look at
the history and what--

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.624
almost no pessimist historically
has gone that far down.

00:49:08.624 --> 00:49:10.290
So if they were right,
there would still

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.647
have been lots of civilizations.

00:49:11.647 --> 00:49:12.480
So I hope that helps

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.410
AUDIENCE: It does.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.326
ADAM FRANK: Yeah, I mean
it's still of course,

00:49:15.326 --> 00:49:17.867
we are in the realm until we
actually find one you're going

00:49:17.867 --> 00:49:19.950
to be dealing with--but
the best science we have--

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.810
the history of this
field-- people--

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:27.380
the best estimations makes
that number very, very small.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.604
Yes.

00:49:28.604 --> 00:49:29.780
AUDIENCE: I've also been
watching too much Sci-Fi

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:30.279
lately.

00:49:30.279 --> 00:49:31.420
[LAUGHS]

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.109
ADAM FRANK: Excellent.

00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:36.275
AUDIENCE: So I've been
watching "The Expanse" a lot.

00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:36.560
[GASPS]

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.226
ADAM FRANK: Fav.

00:49:37.226 --> 00:49:38.650
Best show ever, right?

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:39.300
Yeah.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.716
AUDIENCE: What do you think
the chances of humans actually

00:49:41.716 --> 00:49:44.390
getting to a full
solar system-wide--

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:45.082
Or--

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:48.140
ADAM FRANK: What I argue
often is that's the prize.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.030
If we make it through
climate change,

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.380
that's what's waiting for us.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:52.820
I mean, I really do believe--

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.040
interstellar travel-- I'm
actually right now writing

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.600
a paper about the
Fermi paradox--

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.030
interstellar travel may
be very, very difficult.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:00.680
But interplanetary
travel, especially

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.270
if you have some kind of
fusion engine will not be.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:06.410
And I think in another 200
years-- like, who knows, right?

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.870
There are obviously very
formidable problems.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.130
But I am hopeful.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:11.420
I'm a techno-optimist.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.500
And I'm hopeful that
in 200, 300 years there

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.020
can be a lot of people--

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.020
that the solar system has
a lot of nooks and crannies

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.206
that human beings can--

00:50:23.206 --> 00:50:25.080
and people say, well,
why would they do that?

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.930
Because basically
everybody wants

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.497
to create their own society.

00:50:28.497 --> 00:50:30.080
What I love "The
Expanse" gets right--

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.760
there's going to be
Mormons in space.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.740
For sure, so they can create
their own space settlement

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.615
and live Mormon life.

00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:36.690
And there'll be 1,000
versions of that.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:41.270
So I think, yeah, if we can
just figure out climate change.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.490
And they're related,
right, because you're not

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.157
going to be able to-- in
order to solve climate change,

00:50:46.157 --> 00:50:47.490
you have to think like a planet.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.690
But in order to have a
self-sustaining whatever bubble

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.830
civilization with a
million people in it,

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.860
you also have to understand
how planets think

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.720
and build a smaller
version of it.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.480
That's why "The Expanse"
gets so well in the scene

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.192
after after Call--
what is it, Callisto?

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:04.400
Or Ganymede-- after the
station of Ganymede collapses

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.130
and what's-his-name [? Pac ?]
recognizes that, oh, my god.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.290
The whole ecological
infrastructure of the thing

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:10.730
is going to collapse now.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.146
Is anybody watching
"The Expanse?"

00:51:12.146 --> 00:51:13.800
Are people watching
"The Expanse?"

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.760
It's really good.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.950
I really got-- and the
books are super awesome too.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:17.450
Yes.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.957
AUDIENCE: So you alluded
to it in a previous answer.

00:51:19.957 --> 00:51:21.540
But I'm curious what
your thoughts are

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.434
about the Fermi paradox and--

00:51:23.434 --> 00:51:24.142
ADAM FRANK: Yeah.

00:51:24.142 --> 00:51:25.559
AUDIENCE: --the
theory [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:27.308
ADAM FRANK: Well first
of all, I want to--

00:51:27.308 --> 00:51:29.660
there's two ways to think
about the Fermi paradox.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.880
The first one is the idea
that we haven't found anybody.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.850
We've been searching
the stars for signals.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:36.100
And we haven't found anything.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.141
And that's just not true.

00:51:37.141 --> 00:51:41.057
I mean there's never really
been a large-scale SETI

00:51:41.057 --> 00:51:41.640
effort, right?

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.260
SETI's never been
really fully funded.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.050
NASA started to do
a large SETI search.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.240
And then-- because William
Proxmire had stopped it.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.660
So as Jill Tarter
says, if the parameter

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.940
space we have to search
for looking for aliens

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.730
is the ocean, we have
looked at a thimble so far.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:59.220
So saying that we haven't
found anything that's

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.660
just not scientifically valid.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.810
So we've barely begun to look,
not just in radio but all

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:05.427
the other possibilities.

00:52:05.427 --> 00:52:07.760
But if you're asking about
the part of the Fermi paradox

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.470
that's why haven't we been
visited, like why don't we

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:13.410
have evidence for a
civilization, the colonization

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.580
part, that actually we find in
our paper is more of a problem.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.292
And so the solution to
that right now in the paper

00:52:19.292 --> 00:52:21.750
I think we're leaning towards
is that interstellar travel's

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:22.410
really hard.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.710
You don't get many successful
colonization missions.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.600
Obviously there's some
assumptions here in this.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.900
But again we just did a
paper recently where--

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.380
I did it with Gavin Schmidt
from Goddard Institute

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.030
of Space Studies
where we just asked,

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:36.000
how would you-- this was an
amazing question-- how would

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.124
you know whether there was
a previous technological

00:52:38.124 --> 00:52:40.582
civilization on Earth
20 million years ago?

00:52:40.582 --> 00:52:41.790
You actually couldn't, right?

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:44.819
There is really-- and there
would not be much left over.

00:52:44.819 --> 00:52:46.860
There would certainly
after-- by 20 million years

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.760
the surface has been
completely rescoured.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.280
So you're not going
to find ruins.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.330
Or you'd have to look
for isotopic anomalies

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.070
or something, which maybe--

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:56.056
AUDIENCE: Monuments on the moon.

00:52:56.056 --> 00:52:56.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:57.210
ADAM FRANK: Well,
that's the thing.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.677
No, no, he's right actually.

00:52:58.677 --> 00:53:00.510
That is exactly what
you'd have to look for.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.700
So when it comes to
just the Earth itself,

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.440
the Earth has been
weathered so heavily

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.102
and subducted that
it would be hard.

00:53:06.102 --> 00:53:07.560
And so there's been
a couple papers

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.330
on exactly that
about the best place

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.180
to look for this is going
to be on other bodies.

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.050
So-- yes.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.940
AUDIENCE: So kind
of related to that,

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.617
I think of-- seems to be the one
part where you really do have

00:53:17.617 --> 00:53:19.908
the n equals 1 problem is
what you were talking about--

00:53:19.908 --> 00:53:23.687
the noosphere, right, because
you have all this evidence

00:53:23.687 --> 00:53:25.270
for what happened
previously on Earth,

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:26.370
because we have
all these other--

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:26.610
ADAM FRANK: Right

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:27.660
AUDIENCE: --planets out there.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.743
But a lot of this stuff,
especially with the Fermi

00:53:29.743 --> 00:53:32.847
paradox, it seems to
me falls prey to this n

00:53:32.847 --> 00:53:34.230
equals 1 problem.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.470
We are sort of assuming
the intelligent--

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:41.750
or the civilization is going
to behave like we expect.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.770
ADAM FRANK: I think that's
what my models tried

00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:45.390
to have no sociology in them.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.850
It's ba-- the only assumption
was a civilization consumes

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:48.632
energy to do work.

00:53:48.632 --> 00:53:50.340
That's like the only
assumption in there.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.120
So I don't need a
noosphere or anything else.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:52.520
It's just that--

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.936
AUDIENCE: Did you
make assumptions

00:53:53.936 --> 00:53:55.604
about what sort of
energy production?

00:53:55.604 --> 00:53:58.020
ADAM FRANK: There's only so
much kind of energy production

00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.750
you're going to get as a
young civilization, right?

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.440
The planet is only
going to afford you--

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.676
if you have z-rays, some like
super hyper, high technology,

00:54:04.676 --> 00:54:06.800
well then you're already
passed this anyway, right?

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.280
If you have warp drives,
you're not really worrying

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.270
about your--

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:12.569
you've probably gotten-- your
science is so far advanced

00:54:12.569 --> 00:54:14.610
that you probably have
already gone through this.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.484
But if you're a young
civilization like ours,

00:54:16.484 --> 00:54:17.700
you've got biomass.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.500
Or you've got-- you
can burn things.

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.340
There's wind.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.240
There's solar.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.130
There's nuclear.

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:25.957
And there is geothermal, right?

00:54:25.957 --> 00:54:27.040
And that's pretty much it.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.580
It's-- you can't-- maybe on
some weird planet you could have

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.351
like super magnetic
fields or something.

00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:33.100
So what you can do for
each one of those--

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.340
you can evaluate what
the thermodynamic effect

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.570
of using it large-scale.

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.820
So for example, there was a
paper done a few years ago

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.800
where they looked
at trying to extract

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.950
from wind energy the power--

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:44.700
what would the
consequences be of powering

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.260
our civilization via wind?

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.350
And what you find is because
of turbulence downstream,

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.329
you end up with the equivalent
of like two degrees of warming

00:54:52.329 --> 00:54:54.120
so which is important
because what it means

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.092
is you can't power civilization
like this and have no impact.

00:54:58.092 --> 00:54:59.550
So this goes back
to nature, right,

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:00.250
the idea that
there's going to be--

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.458
we're going to be able to
return to pristine nature--

00:55:02.458 --> 00:55:04.380
not with us on
the planet, right?

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.240
You can have lower impact that
you're going to have to be.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.573
You're going to have to figure
out what kind of impacts.

00:55:08.573 --> 00:55:10.680
But the idea that you can
have no impact is just--

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.740
doesn't make sense.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.823
So yeah, you can evaluate
for every different kind

00:55:13.823 --> 00:55:16.590
of energy source at least make
a cut at what the impact would

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:17.090
be.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:18.449
AUDIENCE: So then one more--

00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:20.490
the assumption you're
making is that civilization

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.990
requires energy.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.802
That seems to be
that something that I

00:55:23.802 --> 00:55:25.820
think a lot of have--
that seems to be a very

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.270
commonist way of doing this.

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.630
ADAM FRANK: Well, I don't see--

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.440
I mean by-- in some
sense by definition,

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.749
an industrial civilization--

00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:35.790
I mean, Rome-- I'm not
interested in Rome, right,

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.914
because Rome wouldn't Rome
wouldn't push its planet

00:55:37.914 --> 00:55:39.306
into an Anthropocene, right?

00:55:39.306 --> 00:55:41.555
So if a civilization decides
to get up to Rome's level

00:55:41.555 --> 00:55:45.420
and never gets farther, yeah,
that's sort of out of the--

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.110
so you're right.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.590
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.177
But if you build an industrial
civil-- if you start har--

00:55:50.177 --> 00:55:52.010
it's all about the
energy per capita, right?

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:55.320
So right now all of us
have the equivalent of just

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.617
from our home-- when we go
home in our plugs 50 servants.

00:55:58.617 --> 00:56:00.450
That's the energy
equivalent of 50 servants.

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.861
And that doesn't say anything
about your transportation

00:56:02.861 --> 00:56:03.360
or whatever.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.980
So once the species
gets to the point

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.680
where the per capita
energy use becomes

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.532
more than one individual's
worth per individual,

00:56:10.532 --> 00:56:12.490
that's when you're going
to start feeding back.

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:13.520
So that's the only assumption.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.350
If they start doing
that, then they sort of

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.266
fall into the category
that I'm interested in.

00:56:17.266 --> 00:56:19.210
And then I don't really
care about sociology

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.820
or whether they develop
a noosphere or not.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.230
Maybe they do.

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.980
Maybe they don't.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.780
It's just that they're
harvesting energy

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.320
to do the work of building
their civilization.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:27.842
Yeah.

00:56:27.842 --> 00:56:30.657
AUDIENCE: So do you think
that the current problem we're

00:56:30.657 --> 00:56:33.618
facing is a matter of marketing,
that we have the tools

00:56:33.618 --> 00:56:38.300
and sort of the guidance that
we need to get through if we all

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.250
just somehow banded together?

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:41.720
ADAM FRANK: Yeah,
I think that's--

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.428
I was just reading
recently about a study

00:56:43.428 --> 00:56:44.390
that sort of showed--

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:46.190
a super detailed
study-- that you could

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:51.530
actually power the world with
renewables, with wind, water.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.320
But so it was a really
detailed plan for doing it.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.200
Of course, it required
this sort of World War II

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.419
Manhattan-style project
for the entire world.

00:56:59.419 --> 00:57:00.710
And so that's going to be hard.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.720
But in terms of like
technologically-- man,

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.930
unleash the innovation.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.180
Let us-- that's one of those--

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.846
when I go out and I'm
talking to people,

00:57:06.846 --> 00:57:09.170
one of the things I'm saying
is like, on one level,

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.420
climate change shows how
awesome we are, right?

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.720
I mean, as-- we've changed the
atmosphere of an entire planet.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.939
That's pretty good for a
bunch of hairless monkeys.

00:57:17.939 --> 00:57:19.730
And now the question
is are we smart enough

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:21.469
to innovate our
way into some kind

00:57:21.469 --> 00:57:22.760
of sustainable version of this.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.010
So it's-- it's not
just marketing though.

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.950
It's deeper than that.

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.110
It's myth, right?

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:30.020
Human beings always
need stories.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.690
As somebody said, stories
were the first technology.

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:34.730
And the problem is
here we have all

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:36.680
of these-- from the long
history of humanity--

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.410
we have these myths about the
coming of age, about marriage,

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:41.490
about old age.

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:43.730
But we don't have any--
and we have creation myths.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:47.060
But climate change we don't have
a myth for, because it's new.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.445
We've never done this before.

00:57:48.445 --> 00:57:49.820
And so what I'm
suggesting is, is

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.230
that a first--
it's not like this

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:52.800
alone is going to
solve anything.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.350
But if we don't
change the narrative,

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:57.590
we are stuck arguing with
people about whether we

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:58.910
change the climate or not.

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:01.760
From this perspective that
question just disappears.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.770
It's like, of course,
you changed the climate.

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:05.390
You built a civilization
that consumes

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:07.370
a quarter of the
entire biosphere's

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.290
productive capacity.

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:10.740
What did you expect?

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:11.614
So I think it just--

00:58:11.614 --> 00:58:14.030
one of things in revolutions--
in scientific revolutions--

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:16.057
that happen is that
the old questions--

00:58:16.057 --> 00:58:17.640
when you go through
a paradigm shift--

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.890
it's not that the old
questions are answered.

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:20.630
The old questions just don't
even become meaningful anymore.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.190
People ask a new
set of questions.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.570
And that's at least what
I'm proposing with this.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.580
Yeah.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.664
AUDIENCE: This might
tread a little bit more

00:58:27.664 --> 00:58:29.330
philosophical although
there are clearly

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:30.260
philosophical ideas that--

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:30.968
ADAM FRANK: Yeah.

00:58:30.968 --> 00:58:32.552
AUDIENCE: you put up there too.

00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:34.135
You mentioned that
you're an optimist.

00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:40.340
And piggybacking on the question
about marketing I sort of--

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:47.310
my worry is that
there is not, in fact,

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:49.970
at present in human
thinking the idea

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.900
that humanity is, in
fact, a single species.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.608
ADAM FRANK: Yeah.

00:58:52.608 --> 00:58:56.510
AUDIENCE: We can sort of
think about this as a collab--

00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:58.630
as a truly
collaborative project.

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:00.940
And I think one way to
be pessimistic about this

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.352
is to worry about factional--

00:59:02.352 --> 00:59:03.060
ADAM FRANK: Yeah.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.685
AUDIENCE: Factionalization
and whatnot.

00:59:04.685 --> 00:59:08.160
Do you have thoughts that make
you more optimistic on that?

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.540
Is it sort of-- and I'm not
saying that blind faith would

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.170
be unreasonable.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:11.540
Perhaps--

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:11.840
ADAM FRANK: Yeah.

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.276
[LAUGHS]

00:59:12.276 --> 00:59:13.570
AUDIENCE: There's another
way to think about this.

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:15.986
ADAM FRANK: Yeah, oh, I mean
it's gotten us through a lot,

00:59:15.986 --> 00:59:16.650
right?

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:20.590
But no, actually so I think
when you look across species,

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:24.430
I feel confident in my
bones that there have been

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:25.840
other civilizations, right?

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.640
Scientifically I can only
go far as the probabilities

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.900
that this has happened before.

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.700
And what I imagine
is the ones that

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:36.250
make it have either the
evolutionary background

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.560
to have the right kinds of
behaviors-- maybe hive mind.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.390
It's much easier if
you're a hive mind

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.790
to make it through this than
if you're the kind of thing

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:43.730
that we are.

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.570
But the other possibility is
that you evolve under pressure,

00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:47.230
right?

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:50.230
Selective pressure is
what determines evolution.

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:52.720
And perhaps this is
the agent by which we

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.470
start to create new behaviors.

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.130
Sure, the Paris Accord was weak.

00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:59.740
But the Paris Accord was
also remarkable in the sense

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:02.600
that we've got every
country to sign this thing.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.620
So that was a beginning.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.370
And then we took
a giant step back.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.470
But so I think--

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:11.890
the Anthropocenes
may be the agent

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.050
for some kinds of species,
perhaps like ours,

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:15.880
to develop new
evolutionary behaviors that

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.970
allow them to get through.

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:18.080
And if you make it through--

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.610
it's weird.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:20.770
Like if I put my hat on as
a dad, I'm like, oh, my god.

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:21.580
We've got to make it through.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.040
[LAUGHS]

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.610
But if I put my hat on as
an astronomer I'm like,

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:24.670
eh, some make it through.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:25.170
Some don't.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:26.628
AUDIENCE: Nothing
special about us.

01:00:26.628 --> 01:00:28.520
ADAM FRANK: Yeah,
nothing special about us.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.020
All right.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.260
Well, thank you very much.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.009
I really appreciate
you guys coming today.

01:00:32.009 --> 01:00:35.190
[APPLAUSE]
