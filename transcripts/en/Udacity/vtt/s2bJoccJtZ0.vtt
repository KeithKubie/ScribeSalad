00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.670
So the way this actually plays out,

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.770
it's easier to see in
the context of an example.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.780
So let's go back to our
example from the banana game.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So here is the U and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.960
the U bar matrix from the banana game.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.420
This is, actually I wrote
them backwards didn't I?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.590
&gt;&gt; Doesn't matter.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.160
&gt;&gt; So there's one player
who gets 0 no matter what.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.090
&gt;&gt; Yep, that's the friend, that's Curly.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was Curly before.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.890
And then there's one who
can get either 2, 0, or

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.110
4 depending on which
cell they end up playing.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.970
And we said that the Nash
equilibria were these two corner

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.950
cases, the 2 and the 4.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.090
So that gives us the purely
cooperative game,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.240
which is the average of the payoffs for
the two players.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.890
Which we're going to compute
the value of using maximax and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.710
the purely competitive game from
the perspective of the U player.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.670
So U- U bar / 2, which looks like this.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.200
So we're going to try to
resolve the value by minimax.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.330
Then there's the same quantity from
the perspective of the U bar player.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.590
So it's just the negation of that one.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.340
But we're going to compute the minimax
value for each of these different games.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.709
So from the perspective of the U player,
what's the maxmax value and

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.440
the minimax value for these games?

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.430
So let's start with this one.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.230
So what's the maximizing value?

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.350
&gt;&gt; It's the thing you're pointing at.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.750
&gt;&gt; And that's the case where
U plays the second row.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.730
And U bar plays the second column and
they get these payoffs.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.730
&gt;&gt; Right we get four bananas.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.002
&gt;&gt; Four bananas that we're
going to divide amongst us.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:24.890
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.238
&gt;&gt; So the minimax value, so
what's the score that the row player,

00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:34.900
the U player the maximum score
that it could get for itself.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.520
&gt;&gt; Minus one.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.990
&gt;&gt; You get a minus one.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.400
Right.
So how does it do that?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.340
By picking this cell,
the top row because the top row if

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.250
you're trying to minimize my gains,
you're going to choose the left column.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.600
If I choose the first row.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.413
If I choose the second row,
you're going to choose the right column.

00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:52.550
I'm going to do even worse.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.710
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So the best thing I can do

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.760
is choose the first row.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.000
&gt;&gt; And I know that, so
I'm going to choose the first column.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330
&gt;&gt; Good.
And if we negate that,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.220
we get a completely analogous analysis.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.480
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So, which column do you choose?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.120
This or that, given that you're
trying to maximize your value.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.180
It would be great if you
could choose a second column.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.830
But I'm trying to minimize your value.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.300
So I'm going to choose the first row
you can choose the second column.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.230
So the safest thing you can do is to
the first column and I'm going to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.668
need to choose the first row to keep you
from switching to go down to that too.

00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:21.130
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; All right so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.550
from the perspective of U,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.480
the coco value is the sum of
these two things which is one.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.980
And from U bar's perspective the coco
value is the sum of the min max game and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.786
the max,
max game which is going to be three.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.970
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Now we have to define side payments.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.917
So U's side payment, p,

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:42.785
is the coco value from U's perspective
minus the value that U gets

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:47.565
in the equilibrium which in this
case is zero but in general it's

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:53.340
whatever the utility is according
to U of the utility maximizing.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.740
Joint action and side payments for

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.410
you bar are the coco value from
the perspective of Q bar minus the value

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.060
that U bar gets in the utility
maximizing joint action.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.108
So, in this case that's one for you,

00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:11.360
minus how much does U
get in that game 0.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.890
So it's going to be 1.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.620
Whereas, from p's perspective,
the coco value is 3 minus the payment

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.440
that U bar gets for playing the
utility-maximizing action, which is 4.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.260
So we get minus 1.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.340
&gt;&gt; And that makes sense because
it better be the case that

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.930
they are opposite and equal.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.190
You know the transfer and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.620
now you've answered my question who
gets to transfer money from the other.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.140
&gt;&gt; That's right.
So,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.670
this the U player is
going to get one and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.330
the U bar player is going to give one
and that's the one banana exchange.
