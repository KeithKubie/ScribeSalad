00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Man] Alright, now
let's dig a little bit

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.060
more into analyzing perfectly
competitive markets,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.050
and in particular we're
gonna focus on the long run,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.180
and remember the long run
is the time span where

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.610
firms can enter and exit the market.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.800
Or, another way to think about it is,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.130
in the long run, fixed costs
actually become variable,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.610
you can shutter factories,
or you can build factories,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.250
in the long run.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.370
Now, in previous videos, we talked about

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.830
that in the long run, in a
perfectly competitive market,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.060
the firms that operate in that
perfective competitive market

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.410
are going to be operating
at zero economic profit,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.660
and you can see that
example right over here.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.560
As we've talked about
it in many, many videos,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.980
in a perfectly competitive market,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.890
the firms are price takers,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.510
that price is set by that
equilibrium point between

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.880
the supply and demand curves,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.210
and the firms just take that.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.860
And so, their marginal revenue curve,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.400
it would just be a horizontal line

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.920
that you see right over there,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.940
and zero economic profit
happens when you produce

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.860
a quantity where your average total cost

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.180
is the same as your marginal revenue.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.110
For each unit, the amount that you get,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.670
which is that marginal unit,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.650
that's also how much it
costs you to produce it,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.080
now remember, when we're
talking about economic profit,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.760
that includes your opportunity costs,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.620
so, that doesn't mean that these firms

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.290
are operating at zero accounting profit,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.950
they could still be making money,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.700
but, if you were to factor
in their opportunity costs,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.530
that's when you get things to zero.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.750
Now, what I want to think about,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.460
what happens in the short and long run,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.110
if something say happens to market demand.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.730
Let's say that this is
the market for apples,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.220
the fruit apples.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.600
So, this is the market for
apples we're talking about,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.570
this is the market as a whole,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.690
this is a firm that produces apples,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.160
it could be a farm of some kind.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.440
And let's say that a new study comes out

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.190
that apples actually are
super good for your health,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.020
and they can be used as a
performance enhancer for sports,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.100
and all sorts of positive results.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.630
Well, what is likely to
happen in the short run,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.950
and this is a little bit of a review

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.920
in terms of our supply and demand curves,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.300
and also what would happen
to Firm A's economic profits.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.020
Pause this video and think about that.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.790
Well, in the short run,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.120
your demand curve would
shift to the right,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.610
and so, because at a given price,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.350
people are willing to demand more apples

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.480
because it has all these
new and exciting benefits.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.060
And so, the demand curve might
shift someplace like that,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.510
so, that is D Prime,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.940
and if the demand curve shifts like that,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.150
now we have a new equilibrium
price in the market,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.600
our new equilibrium price in the market

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.260
is right over here, we also
have a new equilibrium quantity,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.850
so, our quantity is shifted
from there, to now there,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.440
so, a new equilibrium quantity,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.810
and we have a new equilibrium price,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.710
let's just call this P Prime.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.020
And, at that new equilibrium price,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.320
well now, we have a
higher marginal revenue

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.190
curve for Firm A,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.060
and now, Firm A, it'd be
rational for them to produce,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.990
remember, it's rational for
them to produce up until

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.960
the marginal revenue is
equal to marginal cost,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.290
because each of those incremental
units up to that point,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.570
they're going to be making money
on those incremental units,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.150
and so, now it's rational for them

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.640
to produce at this quantity,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.513
let me call that,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.670
Q Prime,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.750
and at this level,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.830
now all of a sudden Firm A
is making economic profit,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.860
because at this quantity,
that's revenue per unit,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.310
this is average total cost per unit,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.420
so they're making this height per unit,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.220
and then you multiply it, times
your total number of units,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.880
which is the base of this rectangle,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.780
and so, this area would represent

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.480
this positive economic profit.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.000
Now, you might be saying,
wait, hold on a second,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.420
I thought you said in the long run,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.710
firms don't make economic profit

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.630
in a perfectly competitive market.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.780
And that is true,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.100
at least based on the models
that we are constructing,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.620
because what happens when you have

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.630
this positive economic profit?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.030
Well, other firms will enter this market,

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.863
remember, we're talking about

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:04.400
a perfectly competitive market,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.690
there are no barriers to enter in,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.760
everyone is fairly non-differentiated,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.450
and they have similar cost structures.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.750
And so, what you could imagine is,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.310
in the long run, folks
will enter the market,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.600
and then, the supply curve
will also shift to the right,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.910
and assuming that that doesn't change

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.940
the cost structure for
the individual firms,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.750
and actually, let me show someone
entering into this market,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.620
so now, Firm B is entering this market,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.420
and when Firm B enters the market,

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.060
it has the same cost structure as Firm A,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.280
and it didn't shift either of their first,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.820
either of their cost structures,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.930
so, this is known as a

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.200
constant cost, perfectly
competitive market,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.450
where the entering or the
exiting of firms does not

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.910
affect the cost structures of
the firms that are entering,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.900
or that are in the market.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.110
And so, this situation,
these graphs look the same,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.740
but now we have more
firms entering the market,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.010
the supply curve will shift to the right,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.590
and it's going to keep
shifting to the right

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.270
until these firms that all
have identical cost structures,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.900
are no longer making
economic profit again.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.990
It wouldn't shift further
to the right because

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.610
no one's going to enter if
they're making economic loss,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.650
it'll keep shifting until no one

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.560
is making that economic profit.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.530
And so, you see what happened
in this constant cost,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.510
perfectly competitive market,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.870
that now, we are back to
this equilibrium point

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.410
where we are at a higher
quantity because people like all

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.620
the benefits of these apples,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.200
but we're at the price we were before,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.270
which is the same marginal
revenue curve that we were before

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.310
for the various players

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.470
in this market.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.720
And so, when you see
something like this in

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.930
a constant cost, perfectly
competitive market,

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.410
you can actually create
a long run supply curve,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.910
you could view this S and S Prime as

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.520
a short run supply curve,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.980
the long run supply
curve, on the other hand,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.900
for a perfectly competitive market,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.110
in which the cost structure
of the participating firms

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.790
do not depend on the number of firms

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.930
that are in or out of the market,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.740
then you're at long run supply curve

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.660
in what we could call

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.910
a constant cost, perfectly
competitive market,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.113
is going to be a
horizontal line like this.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.760
So, I will leave you there.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.830
In other videos, we'll think about,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.020
well, what happens if the
cost structure changes

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.940
for these firms depending on

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.030
how many firms are in
or out of the market,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.210
and that will be based on,

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.440
how do the costs of the inputs
into their production change

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.793
as you have people entering
or exiting that market.
