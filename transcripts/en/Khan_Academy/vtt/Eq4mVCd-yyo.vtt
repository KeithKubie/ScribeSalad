00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.540
We need to calculate 9.005 minus
3.6, or we could view it

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.130
as 9 and 5 thousandths
minus 3 and 6 tenths.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.630
Whenever you do a subtracting
decimals problem, the most

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.310
important thing, and this is
true when you're adding

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.180
decimals as well, is you have
to line up the decimals.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:31.880
So this is 9.005 minus 3.6.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.870
So we've lined up the decimals,
and now we're ready

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.270
to subtract.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.110
Now we can subtract.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.210
So we start up here.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.110
We have 5 minus nothing.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.860
You can imagine this 3.6, or
this 3 and 6 tenths, we could

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.750
add two zeroes right here, and
it would be the same thing as

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.210
3 and 600 thousandths, which is
the same thing as 6 tenths.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.860
And when you look at it that
way, you'd say, OK, 5 minus 0

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.820
is nothing, and you just
write a 5 right there.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.585
Or you could have said, if
there's nothing there, it

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.640
would have been 5 minus
nothing is 5.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.230
Then you have 0 minus
0, which is just 0.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.480
And then you have a 0 minus 6.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.070
And you can't subtract
6 from 0.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.620
So we need to get something into
this space right here,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.410
and what we essentially are
going to do is regroup.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.190
We're going to take one 1 from
the 9, so let's do that.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.680
So let's take one 1 from the
9, so it becomes an 8.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.310
And we need to do something
with that one 1.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580
We're going to put it
in the tenths place.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.340
Now remember, one whole
is equal to 10 tenths.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980
This is the tenths place.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.890
So then this will become 10.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.070
Sometimes it's taught that
you're borrowing the 1, but

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.730
you're really taking it, and
you're actually taking 10 from

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.440
the place to your left.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.940
So one whole is 10 tenths, we're
in the tenths place.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.835
So you have 10 minus 6.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:50.220
Let me switch colors.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.430
10 minus 6 is 4.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.550
You have your decimal right
there, and then you have 8

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.390
minus 3 is 5.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.675
So 9.005 minus 3.6 is 5.405.
