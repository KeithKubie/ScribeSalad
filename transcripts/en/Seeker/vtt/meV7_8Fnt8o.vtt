00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.080
Why is it that some people bite off parts
of their body, or push their hands together

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.419
until their joints make noises?

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:06.859
Humans are so weird.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.809
Why do we do this?!

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.419
Yo nail-biters, Trace here for DNews, what's
up?

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.720
Pia Hansen sent us a good question recently,
about why people develop weird habits like

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.720
nail-biting and knuckle-popping.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.590
So, I looked into it!

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.429
Firstly, nail biting is a bad habit, but unless
it becomes extreme, it's probably not harmful.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.880
If it's a regular, pathological thing, it
can become what's called "pathological grooming."

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.720
Which is uncontrolled, extreme grooming behaviors,
like nail biting, skin picking, or hair pulling.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.610
On the other hand, or… the OTHER other hand…

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.210
Scientists only recently learned what cracking
your knuckles is actually DOING inside your

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.210
fingers.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.570
The sound is caused by "cavitation via tribonucleation…"

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.960
Basically, gas dissolved in the fluid between
your joints forms a bubble, and the sound

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.450
is caused when the bubble FORMS, not pops.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.790
And though it's weird lookin', scientists
don't think it's harmful.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.800
But the underlying question, as I see it,
is why we have ANY HABIT.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Neuroscientists have tried to figure out where
habits come from, and traced the path back

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.800
to a part of the brain called the basal ganglia
-- it's connected with coordination and movement.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.671
It's likely not the only system involved,
because habits are complex behaviors, but

00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:21.890
numerous studies, keep coming back to the
ol' BG.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.050
From a psychological perspective, a habit
needs a few things to form: a trigger, an

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.080
action, and a reward.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.140
Together, they can form a habit-loop.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.430
The habit loop is built on the idea that at
some point, you got a reward for doing the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.681
action in the first place.

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.250
For example: Let's say you have a hangnail,
it hurts… you pick at it, but it just hurts

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.530
more… so you pull it out with your teeth!

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.840
Boom no more hangnail, no more pain!

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.520
Trigger, action, reward!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.170
Simple behavioral training.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.650
Finger cracking could be the same, though
the reward is somewhat more nebulous…

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.640
Dr. Rachel Vreeman told NBC News, it could
just be a "physical release!"

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.860
Maybe it just feels good?

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.050
Or maybe you just like the noise!

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.950
How that one moment of pleasure turns into
a habit is through repetition.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.060
If you bite a hangnail enough times, you'll
stop thinking about doing it, and then you

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.170
have a habit.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.770
Our brain is super lazy, so if we can offload
a task to our subconscious, we're going to!

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.390
So once a habit is established, we stop thinking
about it.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.770
Literally, we stop sending the behavioral
activity from the basal ganglia to the prefrontal

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.770
cortex.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.970
The PfC is where we make decisions… so if
we're not engaging that, we're literally not

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.920
"thinking about it" before we do it.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.470
Commonly, this can take from 15 to 254 DAYS
of training.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.160
Most of the time, if a habit isn't physically
harmful, it’s just considered a bad social

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.380
habit, but if a habit creates open wounds
or sores, begins wearing down teeth, or if

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.850
someone is literally pulling their hair out…
doctors can diagnose it as a psychological

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.850
condition.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.170
This means your brain has likely paired nail-biting,
for example, with relief of anxiety or stress.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.930
Damaging, compulsive nail-biting is called
onychophagia, and it's referred to as a "stress

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.360
removal habit" by the Indian Journal of Dental
Research and appears on the spectrum of Obsessive

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.060
Compulsive Disorders in the DSM-V.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.380
Why some people pair stress relief with a
habit isn't really clear.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.290
But a 1970s twin study found there may be
a genetic link.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.680
Nail biting was practiced by nearly one-third
of the 338 twin pairs, more in girls than

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.400
boys; and it was more common in twins who
came from the same zygote!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.550
Habits CAN be broken, but it takes work!

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.000
You simply have to remind yourself to run
your actions BACK through your prefrontal

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
cortex!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.190
That's why your mom put bandages or hot sauce
on your fingers to keep you from biting your

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.129
nails -- it reminded you to pay attention
so you could kick the habit!

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.300
I don't bite my nails, but I DO I shake my
leg a lot, like… a LOT a lot.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300
Why do we fidget?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.300
What's up with that?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:58.489
Luckily, a handsome devil looked into it over
here.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.489
Are you a nail-biter?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.489
A finger-popper?

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.640
Do you have tips to stop?
