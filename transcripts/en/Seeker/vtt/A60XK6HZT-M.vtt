00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.640
Better make that
dentist appointment,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.630
because it's only going
to get worse and not just

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.213
for your gums.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.800
Anticipation of pain
can be a major source

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.040
of anxiety for people who
deal with it routinely.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.460
It's also probably
the reason you

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.950
haven't been to the dentist
in, oh, three years.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.990
And a new study sheds
light on how dread of pain

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.480
can be worse than the
actual pain itself.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.030
We know based on prior
research that the fear of pain

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.730
can produce two responses
in people of confrontation

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.840
and avoidance, although
most people probably

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.880
exhibit some
combination of the two.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.590
Psychosocial factors
are big in shaping

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.880
in how you respond to pain.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.860
Experiences you've
had in the past

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.760
will determine how
you deal with it.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.630
But that avoidance
strategy-- i.e.,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.300
not making that
dentist appointment--

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.810
can have consequences
beyond cavities.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.210
It can result in a phenomena
called exaggerated pain

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.200
perception.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.600
But even newer
research has shown

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.440
that when faced with
inevitable pain,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.510
most people will choose
to get it out of the way

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.274
as quickly as possible and would
even accept worse pain quickly

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:00.690
rather than having
to wait for it.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.250
A group of
researchers in England

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.260
measured this by offering
people real painful stimuli--

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.210
electric shocks-- along with
choices on how to receive it.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.160
And what they found is
that the unpleasantness

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.630
of the dread of pain is actually
worse than the pain itself

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.650
and, even further,
that the dread can

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.472
get worse the
longer it's delayed.

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:18.680
Does this ring true with you?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.290
Do you tend to work through
pain and ignore it or prefer

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.415
to chill out and rest?

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.087
