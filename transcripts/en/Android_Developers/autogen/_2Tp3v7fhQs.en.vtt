like<00:13:43.450><c> if</c><00:13:43.660><c> I</c><00:13:43.810><c> am</c><00:13:43.930><c> somewhere</c><00:13:44.320><c> and</c><00:13:44.500><c> say</c><00:13:44.650><c> Seattle</c>

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:45.340 align:start position:0%
like if I am somewhere and say Seattle
 

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.430 align:start position:0%
like if I am somewhere and say Seattle
you're<00:13:45.850><c> saying</c><00:13:46.540><c> hey</c><00:13:46.750><c> we're</c><00:13:46.870><c> gonna</c><00:13:46.930><c> try</c><00:13:47.260><c> and</c>

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying hey we're gonna try and
 

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.930 align:start position:0%
you're saying hey we're gonna try and
match<00:13:47.620><c> you</c><00:13:47.830><c> with</c><00:13:47.920><c> other</c><00:13:48.130><c> people</c><00:13:48.550><c> in</c><00:13:48.730><c> the</c>

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:48.940 align:start position:0%
match you with other people in the
 

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
match you with other people in the
Pacific<00:13:49.420><c> Northwest</c><00:13:49.450><c> area</c><00:13:50.080><c> because</c><00:13:50.470><c> chances</c>

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.190 align:start position:0%
Pacific Northwest area because chances
 

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.490 align:start position:0%
Pacific Northwest area because chances
are<00:13:51.550><c> you'll</c><00:13:51.910><c> have</c><00:13:52.150><c> better</c><00:13:52.450><c> better</c><00:13:53.260><c> latency</c>

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:53.500 align:start position:0%
are you'll have better better latency
 

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.650 align:start position:0%
are you'll have better better latency
than<00:13:53.920><c> if</c><00:13:54.040><c> we</c><00:13:54.160><c> match</c><00:13:54.340><c> you</c><00:13:54.370><c> excited</c><00:13:55.030><c> I</c><00:13:55.120><c> end</c><00:13:55.300><c> so</c>

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:55.660 align:start position:0%
than if we match you excited I end so
 

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.590 align:start position:0%
than if we match you excited I end so
yeah<00:13:55.960><c> this</c><00:13:56.170><c> is</c><00:13:56.350><c> something</c><00:13:56.800><c> tricky</c><00:13:57.070><c> because</c><00:13:57.600><c> we</c>

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
yeah this is something tricky because we
 

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
yeah this is something tricky because we
don't<00:13:58.840><c> know</c><00:13:59.110><c> they</c><00:13:59.470><c> write</c><00:14:00.430><c> latency</c><00:14:01.030><c> after</c><00:14:01.870><c> they</c>

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't know they write latency after they
 

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.370 align:start position:0%
don't know they write latency after they
match<00:14:03.010><c> is</c><00:14:03.190><c> form</c><00:14:03.520><c> and</c><00:14:03.820><c> at</c><00:14:04.390><c> that</c><00:14:04.600><c> point</c><00:14:04.870><c> is</c><00:14:05.110><c> too</c>

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:05.380 align:start position:0%
match is form and at that point is too
 

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.650 align:start position:0%
match is form and at that point is too
late<00:14:05.620><c> to</c><00:14:05.920><c> choose</c><00:14:06.400><c> a</c><00:14:06.460><c> different</c><00:14:06.820><c> player</c><00:14:07.240><c> you</c>

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:07.660 align:start position:0%
late to choose a different player you
 

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.390 align:start position:0%
late to choose a different player you
can't<00:14:08.350><c> kick</c><00:14:08.500><c> someone</c><00:14:08.770><c> out</c><00:14:08.860><c> for</c><00:14:09.100><c> having</c><00:14:09.310><c> low</c>

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
can't kick someone out for having low
 

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.690 align:start position:0%
can't kick someone out for having low

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:12.700 align:start position:0%
lanes no of course not so what we have
 

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.330 align:start position:0%
lanes no of course not so what we have
to<00:14:12.730><c> do</c><00:14:13.030><c> is</c><00:14:13.360><c> to</c><00:14:13.720><c> collect</c><00:14:13.960><c> data</c><00:14:14.110><c> for</c><00:14:14.710><c> all</c><00:14:14.950><c> the</c>

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:15.340 align:start position:0%
to do is to collect data for all the
 

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
to do is to collect data for all the
matches<00:14:15.820><c> between</c><00:14:16.120><c> all</c><00:14:16.510><c> the</c><00:14:16.690><c> regions</c><00:14:17.140><c> around</c>

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.290 align:start position:0%

the<00:14:17.530><c> world</c><00:14:17.620><c> and</c><00:14:18.310><c> we</c><00:14:18.910><c> doing</c><00:14:19.300><c> that</c><00:14:19.660><c> data</c><00:14:20.020><c> we</c>

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
the world and we doing that data we
 

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.070 align:start position:0%
the world and we doing that data we
estimate<00:14:20.920><c> what</c><00:14:21.700><c> is</c><00:14:21.730><c> likely</c><00:14:22.540><c> to</c><00:14:22.810><c> be</c><00:14:22.960><c> the</c>

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
estimate what is likely to be the
 

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
estimate what is likely to be the

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
latency between two players in different
visions<00:14:27.010><c> so</c><00:14:27.790><c> it</c><00:14:27.850><c> doesn't</c><00:14:28.120><c> necessarily</c><00:14:28.510><c> have</c>

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:28.630 align:start position:0%
visions so it doesn't necessarily have
 

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
visions so it doesn't necessarily have
to<00:14:28.660><c> be</c><00:14:28.780><c> the</c><00:14:28.870><c> same</c><00:14:28.990><c> region</c><00:14:29.470><c> if</c><00:14:29.560><c> we</c><00:14:29.680><c> know</c><00:14:29.830><c> that</c>

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.010 align:start position:0%
to be the same region if we know that
 

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.830 align:start position:0%
to be the same region if we know that
for<00:14:30.190><c> some</c><00:14:30.370><c> reason</c><00:14:30.400><c> you</c><00:14:30.820><c> know</c><00:14:30.880><c> City</c><00:14:31.180><c> a</c><00:14:31.240><c> and</c><00:14:31.600><c> City</c>

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
for some reason you know City a and City
 

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
for some reason you know City a and City
be<00:14:32.020><c> have</c><00:14:32.230><c> a</c><00:14:32.260><c> really</c><00:14:32.770><c> good</c><00:14:32.950><c> internet</c>

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.430 align:start position:0%
be have a really good internet
 

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
be have a really good internet
connection<00:14:33.490><c> between</c><00:14:34.000><c> us</c><00:14:34.180><c> it's</c><00:14:34.840><c> our</c><00:14:35.110><c> gear</c>

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:35.470 align:start position:0%

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.990 align:start position:0%
connection between us it's our gear
system<00:14:35.800><c> would</c><00:14:35.890><c> say</c><00:14:36.010><c> oh</c><00:14:36.190><c> it's</c><00:14:36.220><c> ok</c><00:14:36.550><c> to</c><00:14:36.580><c> match</c><00:14:36.790><c> up</c>

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
system would say oh it's ok to match up
 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.590 align:start position:0%
system would say oh it's ok to match up
these<00:14:37.120><c> yes</c><00:14:37.630><c> exactly</c><00:14:38.230><c> so</c><00:14:39.000><c> yeah</c><00:14:40.000><c> I</c><00:14:40.030><c> essentially</c>

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
these yes exactly so yeah I essentially
 

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.330 align:start position:0%
these yes exactly so yeah I essentially
we<00:14:40.960><c> do</c><00:14:41.170><c> that</c><00:14:41.380><c> and</c><00:14:41.650><c> we</c><00:14:43.020><c> this</c><00:14:44.020><c> feature</c><00:14:44.440><c> we</c><00:14:45.070><c> get</c>

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:45.340 align:start position:0%
we do that and we this feature we get
 

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.030 align:start position:0%
we do that and we this feature we get
better<00:14:45.760><c> quality</c><00:14:46.390><c> in</c><00:14:46.750><c> the</c><00:14:46.990><c> matches</c><00:14:47.410><c> as</c><00:14:47.590><c> you</c><00:14:47.860><c> can</c>

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
better quality in the matches as you can
 

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
better quality in the matches as you can
see<00:14:48.250><c> in</c><00:14:48.310><c> the</c><00:14:48.400><c> graph</c><00:14:48.640><c> yeah</c><00:14:49.180><c> we</c><00:14:49.330><c> have</c><00:14:49.450><c> almost</c>

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:49.870 align:start position:0%
see in the graph yeah we have almost
 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.290 align:start position:0%
see in the graph yeah we have almost
fifteen<00:14:50.680><c> or</c><00:14:51.010><c> twenty</c><00:14:51.520><c> percent</c><00:14:51.880><c> improvement</c>

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:52.300 align:start position:0%
fifteen or twenty percent improvement
 

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
fifteen or twenty percent improvement
that<00:14:52.900><c> looks</c><00:14:53.080><c> like</c><00:14:53.230><c> is</c><00:14:53.410><c> yeah</c><00:14:53.830><c> so</c><00:14:54.310><c> were</c><00:14:54.520><c> there</c>

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.670 align:start position:0%
that looks like is yeah so were there
 

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.810 align:start position:0%
that looks like is yeah so were there
any<00:14:54.820><c> trade-offs</c><00:14:55.660><c> involved</c><00:14:55.990><c> in</c><00:14:56.470><c> it</c><00:14:57.040><c> is</c><00:14:57.310><c> always</c>

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:57.820 align:start position:0%
any trade-offs involved in it is always
 

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:04.050 align:start position:0%
any trade-offs involved in it is always
curve<00:14:58.330><c> so</c><00:14:59.610><c> if</c><00:15:00.610><c> we</c><00:15:01.480><c> have</c><00:15:01.780><c> a</c><00:15:02.080><c> match</c><00:15:02.710><c> or</c><00:15:03.040><c> we</c><00:15:03.670><c> when</c>

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.060 align:start position:0%
curve so if we have a match or we when
 

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.630 align:start position:0%
curve so if we have a match or we when
we<00:15:04.090><c> are</c><00:15:04.360><c> forming</c><00:15:04.780><c> a</c><00:15:04.900><c> match</c><00:15:05.110><c> we</c><00:15:05.590><c> see</c><00:15:06.220><c> that</c><00:15:06.250><c> this</c>

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
we are forming a match we see that this
 

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
we are forming a match we see that this
match<00:15:06.970><c> is</c><00:15:07.330><c> not</c><00:15:07.930><c> really</c><00:15:08.680><c> good</c><00:15:09.070><c> quality</c><00:15:09.760><c> or</c><00:15:09.970><c> the</c>

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
match is not really good quality or the
 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
match is not really good quality or the
latency<00:15:10.720><c> is</c><00:15:11.170><c> likely</c><00:15:12.040><c> to</c><00:15:12.070><c> be</c><00:15:12.510><c> not</c><00:15:13.510><c> so</c><00:15:13.780><c> good</c>

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:14.690 align:start position:0%
latency is likely to be not so good
 

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
latency is likely to be not so good
but<00:15:15.380><c> we</c><00:15:15.590><c> don't</c><00:15:15.800><c> have</c><00:15:15.860><c> other</c><00:15:16.310><c> players</c><00:15:17.030><c> they</c><00:15:17.510><c> are</c>

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:17.690 align:start position:0%
but we don't have other players they are
 

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.050 align:start position:0%
but we don't have other players they are
probably<00:15:18.350><c> we</c><00:15:18.620><c> have</c><00:15:18.830><c> to</c><00:15:19.100><c> wait</c><00:15:19.460><c> a</c><00:15:19.490><c> little</c><00:15:19.880><c> longer</c>

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.060 align:start position:0%
probably we have to wait a little longer

to combine the matches in in order to
 

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:28.730 align:start position:0%
wait for new players to arrive and see
 

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.710 align:start position:0%

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:35.770 align:start position:0%
better expected latency between them so
 

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.740 align:start position:0%
better expected latency between them so
this<00:15:36.770><c> is</c><00:15:36.800><c> the</c><00:15:36.950><c> trade-off</c><00:15:37.460><c> so</c><00:15:37.790><c> maybe</c><00:15:38.270><c> we</c><00:15:38.540><c> need</c>

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:38.750 align:start position:0%
this is the trade-off so maybe we need
 

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.310 align:start position:0%
this is the trade-off so maybe we need

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:01.190 align:start position:0%
to have to we're going to look for
 

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.830 align:start position:0%
to have to we're going to look for

somebody else with a better connection
 

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.780 align:start position:0%
somebody else with a better connection
and<00:16:03.260><c> so</c><00:16:03.620><c> it</c><00:16:03.740><c> might</c><00:16:03.890><c> take</c><00:16:03.920><c> me</c><00:16:04.220><c> longer</c><00:16:04.250><c> to</c><00:16:04.610><c> get</c>

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
and so it might take me longer to get
 

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.820 align:start position:0%
and so it might take me longer to get

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:08.990 align:start position:0%
play this guy in Australia yes but of
 

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.710 align:start position:0%
play this guy in Australia yes but of

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
course we don't want our players to wait
 

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.850 align:start position:0%
course we don't want our players to wait
too<00:16:12.020><c> much</c><00:16:12.070><c> so</c><00:16:13.070><c> what</c><00:16:13.490><c> we</c><00:16:13.850><c> also</c><00:16:14.260><c> estimate</c><00:16:15.260><c> is</c><00:16:15.620><c> the</c>

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:15.860 align:start position:0%
too much so what we also estimate is the
 

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
too much so what we also estimate is the

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
for this particular game and if we think
 

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
for this particular game and if we think
that<00:16:23.990><c> it's</c><00:16:24.500><c> going</c><00:16:24.710><c> to</c><00:16:24.830><c> be</c><00:16:24.920><c> too</c><00:16:25.160><c> long</c><00:16:25.570><c> we</c><00:16:26.570><c> don't</c>

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:26.810 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be too long we don't
 

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.830 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be too long we don't
wait<00:16:27.140><c> on</c><00:16:27.560><c> combine</c><00:16:28.280><c> the</c><00:16:28.790><c> players</c><00:16:29.150><c> right</c><00:16:29.480><c> away</c>

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
wait on combine the players right away
 

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
wait on combine the players right away
so<00:16:30.830><c> you</c><00:16:30.890><c> sort</c><00:16:31.220><c> of</c><00:16:31.310><c> you</c><00:16:31.580><c> change</c><00:16:31.910><c> based</c><00:16:32.600><c> on</c><00:16:32.870><c> you</c>

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.170 align:start position:0%
so you sort of you change based on you
 

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
so you sort of you change based on you
change<00:16:33.410><c> the</c><00:16:33.530><c> criteria</c><00:16:33.680><c> a</c><00:16:34.040><c> little</c><00:16:34.220><c> bit</c><00:16:34.340><c> based</c>

change the criteria a little bit based
 

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.890 align:start position:0%
are playing multiplayer at that time
yeah<00:16:39.830><c> exactly</c><00:16:40.040><c> and</c><00:16:40.550><c> this</c><00:16:41.180><c> is</c><00:16:41.390><c> something</c><00:16:41.660><c> that</c>

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:41.900 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly and this is something that
 

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.580 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly and this is something that
is<00:16:42.200><c> dynamically</c><00:16:43.150><c> adjusted</c><00:16:44.150><c> so</c><00:16:44.560><c> for</c><00:16:45.560><c> each</c>

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
is dynamically adjusted so for each
 

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.340 align:start position:0%
is dynamically adjusted so for each

application each variant and each moment
 

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.860 align:start position:0%
application each variant and each moment
we<00:16:49.220><c> calculate</c><00:16:49.700><c> all</c><00:16:49.880><c> these</c><00:16:50.060><c> variables</c><00:16:50.690><c> and</c>

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
we calculate all these variables and
 

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
we calculate all these variables and
decide<00:16:51.470><c> if</c><00:16:51.950><c> white</c><00:16:52.940><c> is</c><00:16:52.970><c> a</c><00:16:53.300><c> good</c><00:16:53.450><c> idea</c><00:16:53.780><c> or</c><00:16:53.930><c> not</c><00:16:54.200><c> so</c>

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.010 align:start position:0%
decide if white is a good idea or not so
 

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
decide if white is a good idea or not so
then<00:16:55.760><c> we</c><00:16:55.940><c> we</c><00:16:56.540><c> purifies</c><00:16:57.170><c> these</c><00:16:57.710><c> two</c><00:16:58.130><c> things</c><00:16:58.490><c> to</c>

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
then we we purifies these two things to
 

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.930 align:start position:0%
