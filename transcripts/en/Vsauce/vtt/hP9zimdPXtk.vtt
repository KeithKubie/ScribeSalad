00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.290
Cacti are perpetual victims and kitten heart.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.270
It's episode 34 of IMG!

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.940
When these guys get busy,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.049
you get this.
And when Adobe adds the force to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.670
Photoshop, you get Adobe WanKenobi.
If other brands did the same we'd have Jedi -

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.109
Do or do not; Sith puma; Hunt it your way

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.160
or Jabba the Hutt.
There's a smiley face on the surface of Mars

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.140
and starburst region NGC 3603 is the same.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.489
Wedding photography can be mopey.
Uhmmm...

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.960
Packing enough heat to warm the bun in the oven.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.120
A chair within a chair within a chair
within a chair chair-ception.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.260
A tree chair

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.430
and an ergonomic... really? Let's move on to
a kitten with a permanent top hat

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.550
and some lesser-known last suppers.
Popeye,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.809
cartoons, Team Fortress 2, other

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.770
video game characters and zombies.
If you're not hungry, skip the supper and just grab

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.300
a drink from Fremont coffee with

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.449
foam shaped into Batman, Darth Vader,

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.850
Frank from Donnie Darko or Pikachu.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.500
Though, of course, I prefer Cthulhu-achu.
They also have Boba Fett, but I prefer

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.760
girls dressed

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.060
as Boba Fett. Enjoy.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.040

Disney Princess fighters -

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.560
Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Snow White

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.610
and more.
Thanks to MoIllusions.com here

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.670
is some neon vomit. Stare at the black
dot in the middle and no matter what

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.270
don't move your eyes.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.850
Slowly, but surely, the surrounding
collars will disappear into the grey.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.340
Garret Steider designs alphabetical food posters.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.420
If you look closely, you'll get it all over your face.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.119
These pictures come from Mitsuko Nagone and finding them this week

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.399
made my week. On Facebook.com/vsaucegaming, Frederick showed us an

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.970
example of bad CD-rom design.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.160
And Caleb's image of perfectly round circles hurt

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.429
my brain to try to understand.
Finally,

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.430
'Fouad' gave us these important acronyms.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.660
And I'm not done there.
