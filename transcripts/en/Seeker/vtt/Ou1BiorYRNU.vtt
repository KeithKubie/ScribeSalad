00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.480
Scientists claim that the earth’s magnetic
poles will reverse within the next few thousand

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
years.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.540
So why does that happen?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.680
And what exactly does it mean for us?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:20.539
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and something
that’s always fascinated me, is the earth’s

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.539
magnetic field.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.909
Maybe it’s because we can’t see it with
our own eyes, so it’s this elusive thing

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.699
that we pretty much assume to be constant.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.769
Believe it or not though, the north and south
poles we know today, weren’t always that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.769
way.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.370
786,000 years ago - the earth’s magnetic
field flipped - and it’s remained constant

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.370
ever since.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.330
But before that happened, south was actually
north - and what we now know as north, was

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.330
south.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.010
According to scientists, every half million
years or so - the earth’s dipole magnetic

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.720
field, which you can imagine like a bar magnet
with a north end and a south end, starts to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.010
weaken, before eventually reversing completely.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.720
No one is really sure why it happens, but
it’s thought to be caused by changes in

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440
the fluid portion of the earth’s iron core.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.899
Up until recently, scientists presumed this
reversal process took a few thousand years

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:12.030
- but new evidence suggests that the most
recent major reversal 786,000 years ago - actually

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.280
happened in less than 100 years - roughly
the span of a single lifetime.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.810
Obviously, flips like this have occurred several
times throughout Earth’s history.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.560
But the next one, scientists say, may happen
within the next few thousand years.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.509
New evidence indicates that the intensity
of the Earth’s magnetic field is decreasing

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.130
at a rate 10 times faster than normal, leading
many geophysicists to believe that we’re

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.999
on the brink of another reversal.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.950
So what would happen if that did occur?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.709
Would there be any noticeable changes?

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:44.380
Well, the good news is - there are no documented
catastrophes associated with past reversals.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.499
So you shouldn’t expect the human race to
immediately die out.

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.700
But that doesn’t mean nothing bad could
happen.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.139
A magnetic reversal would almost surely wreak
havoc on our electrical grid, which could

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:55.689
potentially bring it down.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.369
It would also make us vulnerable to energetic
particles from the sun and cosmic rays - both

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.569
of which can cause genetic mutations.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.799
And that could happen before the reversal
even takes place.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.690
Like I described earlier, there’s a period
prior to reversals where the magnetic field

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.310
gets progressively weaker, and the genetic
mutations that arise from that, could potentially

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.940
increase cancer rates.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.510
So the longer it takes for that reversal process
to complete, the more harmful it would be

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.640
to us.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.910
Also worth mentioning, is the fact that even
though the last reversal only took 100 years

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.860
- it was preceded by a period of magnetic
instability that spanned over 6,000 years.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.060
Meaning if the next reversal happens within
a few thousand years, we could start seeing

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.820
the effects of it - very soon.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.250
Kinda scary to think about it.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.210
But at the same time - it’s not likely that
any of this will affect us in our lifetime.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.580
So, before you start packing up your family
and moving off the grid, Doomsday Preppers-style,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.100
just remember that.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.380
It’s probably not worth it.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.780
What do you guys think though, are you worried
about this?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.290
You can lay it all out for us in the comments
right down there - or if you wanna get in

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.020
touch with me on Twitter, you can do so at
@TaraLongest.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.410
That’s it for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching.
