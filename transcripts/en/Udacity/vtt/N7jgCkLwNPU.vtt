Here's the data. This party column is the time after or before eight o'clock,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.310
when the party starts, that you would arrive. If you arrive thirty minutes

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.860
before the party starts, so at seven thirty, then the value you get is negative

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.842
30. If you arrive an hour after the party starts at nine o'clock then your

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:26.520
value would be 60. When you make the chart, you're going to have to select

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:38.101
ranges. Since age is in column c, we want c1 to c62 then add another range. And

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:48.368
we want party I want i62. We also want to look at pets e1 to e62. So here we

00:00:48.368 --> 00:00:53.066
have our scatter part. It looks like party is really spread around and pets

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:58.737
remains kind of consistent. It might be easier to visualize each of these

00:00:58.737 --> 00:00:59.790
separately.
