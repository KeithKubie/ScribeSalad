00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.206
 - Men are in crisis,
 being too pushy,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.575
crying at parks,

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.045
Alfonso Ribeiro,

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.380
spending time at Arby's
when they're not eating.

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:15.815
 It's a mess.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.884
 Thankfully, I'm here to help.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.352
Now why am I qualified?

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.154
Coz I've got a a
gender neutral haircut,

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.057
  a popular podcast,
  and time to kill.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.658
I'm still in community college.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.160
This is Man Up.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.629
 (rock music)

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.836
 This week I got a call
 from Lauren in Culver City,

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.372
 or Lau-ren, as she says it.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.074
  And she said that
  her and her man

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.109
  are having some
  commitment issues,

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:45.545
 something I know a lot about.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.480
 I think I do.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:48.314
 I don't know if I do,

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:49.282
 I can't even, fuck,

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.917
 I can't even commit to this.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.953
 (upbeat music)

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.254
What's up man? I'm Theo.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.222
 - Hey, how's it going?

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.056
 - Good, nice to see you today.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:57.857
 Lauren, how are you?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.691
- Hi, I'm good.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:00:59.525
 How are you?

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:00.860
 - Very lovely.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.228
 Thank you guys for
 meeting me out here.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.529
Obviously we arranged to
meet you guys out here,

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:04.764
 by this ledge.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.966
 Lauren's reached out
 to me via my podcast,

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.935
  which is about helping men

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.604
 take that (screeches)
 off the universe

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.539
 and really get that, you know,

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:17.543
 that male gestation going on
 inside of our lungs and heart.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.146
- So, I called Theo because you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.050
  bought an engagement ring.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:24.884
- This is true.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.085
 I did.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.020
- A year ago and you've
been sitting on it.

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:29.288
- Yeah.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:30.223
 - You've been mother
 henning that thing.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:30.923
 They call that mother henning.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:31.924
  - Do they?

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.159
 Okay.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:34.660
  - And, I feel like
  you thought that

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.996
 you could just buy
 it and mother hen it,

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.999
 instead of taking that next
 step to actually propose.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.801
Like, you act like
you've proposed already.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.369
But you haven't.

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.204
 - Well, I wouldn't say
 I act like I proposed

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.740
 because, I mean, I'm
 not strutting around

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:50.510
 you know, talking like I'm--

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.411
 - You act like it's
 a huge step though.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.713
  - Well, it was kind of a--

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.947
 - The huge step would
 actually be proposing.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.215
 - It was an interim
 step, you know?

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.183
- Okay.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.618
  It shouldn't take a year.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.553
  - You're probably
  right about that.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.288
 - As men we have a lot
 of invisible hurdles,

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.689
some of them that you
can't even see as women,

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:06.259
 just coz we have
 our own blinders on.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.528
You know we're the only
animal in the kingdom

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.898
that runs forward at top
speed with blinders on.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.966
You can't name another
animal that can do that,

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.236
 unless it's a blind animal.

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:18.738
 Buying a wedding ring

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.341
and not giving it to a girl is,

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.545
 well now you're just a
 dude that owns a ring,

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.846
 a jewelry boy.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.517
 Alright so this is streets of?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.752
 - Rogue, yeah.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.520
  Streets of Rogue,
  this is my baby.

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:35.721
 - And you made this.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.124
- Yeah, over the course
of four plus years.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.358
 - Wow.

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.459
  How many levels
  are on this game.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.660
 - 15, I'd say.

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:46.899
 - And so if asking Lauren to
 marry you is like level 15,

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.001
 what level do you
 feel like you're on?

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:50.236
  Honestly.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.706
 - Probably 14 and
 three quarters ish.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.208
  I mean, it's pretty close.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.442
 But here's the thing,

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:57.643
  it's been on 14
  and three quarters

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:58.978
for like a year or two.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.713
 - Wow, how much sex
 were you getting

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.114
 before you guys settled down.

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:03.482
  Do you feel like
  you got enough sex

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.817
out there in the world?

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.886
 - I mean, I wasn't
 the best at dating.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.455
  I don't think, it
  wasn't the worst,

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:12.925
 but, you know, I'm
 no player, you know?

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.361
 - Yeah, I was good at dating,

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:18.064
  but I wasn't good at sex.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.632
 - Oh.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:20.866
- I am the worst at sex.

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.335
 I'm very bad.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.204
  - Yeah, what do you think
  the problem is there?

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:26.205
 - I just get nervous.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.273
 I'm like one of those,

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:28.574
you ever seen those animals that

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:30.409
 faint when they get
 nervous, you know?

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.544
 - (laughs) No.

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:32.979
What animals are these?

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.347
 - Yeah they're like
 goats on the internet,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.982
 and they faint when
 they get nervous,

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.216
 and that's how I am,

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.284
 like I hold my breath
 when I'm having sex,

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:39.819
 and then Ill just kinda faint.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:40.786
  - It's a problem.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.722
- Yeah, I'm not that good at it.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.323
  It sounds like he
  thinks his ding

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:46.459
  hasn't had enough
  ling, you know?

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.594
  He hadn't done
  enough tippy-tappy

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.630
 in that drippy-drappy.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:53.333
(ambient music)

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.701
 You've been sitting
 on the ring for

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:56.836
  2 and a half years, right?

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.104
- Yeah.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.105
  - If you're afraid
  to make that jump,

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.206
 one of the reasons could be

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.475
 because you're worried about,

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.277
  not being able to
  be single again.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.478
- Right.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.412
- So I thought I'd give
you the environment

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:07.580
of what it's like to be single.

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:09.415
 - Yeah it's not
 really an environment

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.850
that I'm familiar with--

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.118
 - That's okay.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.352
 I don't think anybody
 is comfortable in it,

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:14.287
  you know?

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.087
 I think sometimes that's just

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.955
 this idea we have that

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:16.889
there's a guy out there

00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:18.424
 that's comfortable in this.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.192
 Only a shark is comfortable
 in these waters,

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:21.427
  you know?

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.863
 It's not that hard.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.064
 Hey, how's it going?

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:26.299
- Oh, hi, sorry.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.466
 - Sorry I'm gonna
 wave my hand at you.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.135
 I'm not a harassment person.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:29.969
  - I'm Courtney,
  nice to meet you.

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.037
- Theo. Nice to see you.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.071
This is my friend Matt.

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:33.139
 - Hey.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:33.973
- Hi Matt, how are you?

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:34.807
  - How's it going?

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.975
- Good.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:37.610
 - I have, actually,
 adult asthma.

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:38.444
- Oh no.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:39.278
  - Do you have it?

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.513
 - I don't, no.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.148
 - I thought we might
 have some of the same

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.482
 issues and diseases.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:44.350
  - Oh, no.

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:46.652
  Have a good night.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.554
 - Okay, if you see me
 struggling to breathe,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.690
 you know what's up.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.158
  So, I think it went okay.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.392
- Yeah, it went alright.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.427
 It's a little weird.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.861
  - Yeah. Here's the thing,

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.229
 she hated me before
 she got here.

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:58.297
 She'll hate me later.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.899
But I conversated, I won right?

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.200
- Yeah.

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:02.134
  - So at least if
  I go home tonight,

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:03.402
  and masturbate by myself,

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:04.937
 at least I still have
 her voice in my ears.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.771
- Yeah.

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:07.239
 - You feel me?

00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:08.708
 - Yeah, I mean, you're still
 a winner in that sense.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:11.143
- Yes, you gotta take a win
where you can get a win, right?

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:12.078
- Yeah.

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:12.878
- So being single is just about

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:13.813
 getting little wins.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.414
 So to have that single vibe,

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:16.749
you can go out in here,

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:18.851
  I want you to meet
  a couple of girls.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:20.920
 - We gonna go together, or?

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.621
- I'm gonna stay here
and hold down the nest,

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:23.556
  you know?

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.558
  - God, I'm a jar of just,

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:27.927
  I don't even know.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.062
 I'm, God, freaking the
 fuck out right now.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:30.896
  - Are you really?

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:31.731
- Yeah.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:32.898
 - You're fine.

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:34.133
 Bro, you're big
 semen, I'm big semen.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:35.501
 We were semen look
 how far we've come.

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:36.335
- Semen?

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:37.169
- You got this.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.003
  - Alright.

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:40.640
 (upbeat music)

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:44.410
 - Hi.

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:45.244
 - Hi.

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:46.379
 - I'm Matt.

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:47.313
  - Hi, Brie

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:48.647
  - Good to meet you, Brie.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.915
- Jess.

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:51.016
  - Jess, hey, good
  to meet you, Matt.

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:52.251
- Nice to meet you too.

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:54.286
  - Hey, so how's
  it going tonight?

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.155
 - Good, how are you?

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:57.022
  - Not bad.

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.692
Can't complain too much.

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.761
  You guys having a
  girls' night here?

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.429
- Yeah, we are actually.

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:04.463
- I could maybe do that.

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:05.364
 (women laugh)

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:07.500
 What's the plans here?

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.268
- Probably go to Malibu.

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:10.202
  - The Bu?

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:11.837
 Okay, that sounds like fun.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.140
 You guys gonna do like
 lines of cocaine there

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.709
 and all kinds of crazy crap?

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:17.943
- Yeah.

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:18.744
 - I'm sorry, that's
 a little forward.

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:20.012
 I don't mean to like--

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:22.081
  - I'm sorry we're
  just like talking,

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:23.048
 me and my girlfriend.

00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:23.883
- Yeah.

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:24.717
 - It's girls night.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.651
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:28.354
 I don't wanna interrupt you.

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:31.891
What kind of girls night
are we talking here?

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.360
  - We just haven't
  seen each other

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.661
 - What do you mean?

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:36.595
 - I have no idea what I mean.

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:39.498
  I'm sorry, awesome, okay.

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:40.599
 - Have a good night.

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:41.667
 - ALright, you too.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.536
  (whistles)

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:44.603
 - Hi.
 - Hi.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:45.805
  - How's it going?

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:46.739
 - Good.
 - I'm Matt.

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:47.540
- I'm Elaine, nice to meet you.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.340
 - Good to meet you.

00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:49.275
  - What do you do?

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:50.443
 - I'm a video game developer.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:51.444
 - Oh, cool.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.445
 Sounds fun.

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.279
- Yeah.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.114
 - Sound very smart.

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:57.450
- Some people have maybe
said that in the past.

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:58.784
(Elaine laughs)

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:01.153
I guess I'm, yeah, I'm alright.

00:07:01.186 --> 00:07:02.021
 - Do you do well for yourself?

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:04.123
Do you make good money?

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.558
 - Yeah, I do alright.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.960
My game is doing alright, yeah.

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:09.328
 - You obviously have
 like a cool job,

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.997
  it seems like you do well,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.533
  I'm like really really
  struck for cash right now.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.235
And I could like hardly
afford this drink

00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.037
 to be honest.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.105
 Its really
 embarrassing but like,

00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:21.974
 is there any way you
 could spot me like

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:23.109
 1000 dollars?

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:27.546
- I mean I gotta say, I
literally just met you.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:28.481
  - I know, I know.

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:29.548
  - It's like a big request,

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:30.749
 and I know this is Los Angeles

00:07:30.782 --> 00:07:32.318
 filled with like billionaires,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.152
  but I do alright.

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:34.887
I'm not like a,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.789
 I don't have fuck
 you money, you know?

00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:37.623
- Oh, you don't?

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:38.457
 - No.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.560
(laughs)

00:07:42.127 --> 00:07:43.529
  Listen, I'm really sorry.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.465
I can't really do that.

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:47.333
  I gotta get to my friend.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.567
  - Oh okay.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.235
  - It was really
  nice to meet you.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.503
- I'm so sorry.

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:51.303
 I didn't mean for that
 to come across weird.

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:51.971
- I'm sorry about that.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.606
- Okay, alright.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.974
- Matt got thrown to the lions,

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.976
  female L.A. lions.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:01.013
The kind that eat
cocaine instead of meat.

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:03.216
  And they, they're naughty.

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:05.951
 How'd it go?

00:08:05.984 --> 00:08:07.453
- I'm gonna have to go with bad.

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.287
  - Really?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.755
- Yeah.

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:11.290
 - Dude, I'm glad you got a
 taste of the single life man.

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:13.158
Sometimes it's a naughty taste.

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.660
- Yeah.

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:16.629
 - Okay, it's like licking
 yourself when you shouldn't.

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:17.863
  And the kicker is,

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:20.232
 while you've been here
 being single with me

00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:21.834
  the whole time, of course,

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:25.838
 Lauren has been out
 being single as well.

00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:27.106
 I'm not trying to
 trick you or anything,

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.374
but I just want you to know that

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:29.475
  that's how it would work.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.510
I sent over my boy Tasty Jimmy,

00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:34.079
  he's chill, he's Italian.

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:35.447
 - Tasty Jimmy?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.082
- Yeah, I don't know
how he got the nickname.

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:38.117
A lot of chicks give it to him.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.485
 But that's his life.

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:40.553
  - I didn't know
  this was the deal.

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.420
- Right.

00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:42.621
Well how would you feel

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:43.822
if you're girl were
with some guy right now?

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.091
 - Not so great, not
 so great at all.

00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:47.026
- Okay,

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.460
 well I say we go and check out

00:08:48.493 --> 00:08:49.295
  what's going on with them.

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.129
How about that?

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:50.963
  - Alright.

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:51.797
  - Let me get this.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.332
(romantic music)

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.199
- You look really nice.

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:55.234
 - Thank you.

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.671
 Oh I was going to
 say this is vintage.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:08:59.939
 - It is very vintage.

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.641
 It actually reminds me
 of my favorite emoji,

00:09:02.674 --> 00:09:03.676
  the senorita one?

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.510
  - Oh yes.

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:05.444
 - Yes.

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:06.679
- I'm a walking senorita emoji.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.847
- Which is a compliment
in the biggest way.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.215
- Look man, that's what
single life is like,

00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:11.250
  you know?

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:13.018
 - Yeah, real disappointing.

00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:14.453
  - Right, and so I
  wanted to show you

00:09:14.486 --> 00:09:16.255
 if that's what single
 life is like there,

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:18.090
  then of course if
  you were single,

00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:20.526
  then Lauren would
  be single as well.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:21.760
 - What kind of
 position do you like,

00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:22.962
 I know we're at a cat place,

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.296
 but what about doggy-style?

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:26.165
 - I mean, (laughs).

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.166
 - It's Tasty Jimmy?

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.500
- Yeah it's him.

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:30.202
 He's Italian.

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:31.670
 - Sounds like a
 great time in there.

00:09:31.703 --> 00:09:32.905
- Right, I didn't wanna
have to show you this,

00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:34.340
 but it's like you know
 sometimes we don't,

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.408
we can't see what we can't see.

00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:37.676
- Yeah.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:40.045
 - You know until you
 see what could be

00:09:40.078 --> 00:09:42.181
if you don't make a
move on a special girl,

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.882
 then you don't know.

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:45.851
 And this is what that
 would look like man.

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:48.687
- This dude I don't know
and a bunch of cats?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.722
- Oh that's Jimmy dude.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:50.689
- Yeah.

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:51.957
 - And he's definitely, I mean,

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.192
 already has some,
 a little bit of ED,

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.560
  erectile dysfunction, but

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:56.428
  he makes up for
  it with his hands.

00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:57.596
 His great grandfather
 was a pianist.

00:09:57.629 --> 00:09:58.431
  - Oh God.

00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:01.133
 - So I'm just saying,
 sometimes look man,

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:02.601
I know you design games,

00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:04.303
sometimes you gotta
design that final level.

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:05.537
  - Alright.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.739
  - And I'm gonna
  be level with you.

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.140
 Last night, I broke
 into your house

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:09.775
 and borrowed these.

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:13.545
 - I don't recognize
 those at all actually.

00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:15.514
- Oh well these are somebody's.

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:16.949
 - Alright well, who?

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:17.783
 - I also got this man.

00:10:17.816 --> 00:10:18.951
 Is this yours?

00:10:18.984 --> 00:10:20.386
- That actually is mine.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:24.457
 That's the ring I was
 gonna give to Lauren, yeah.

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:27.627
 - Gonna give when, you know?

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:30.196
 - I, oh God.

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:33.732
 - How does it make you
 feel whenever you see that,

00:10:33.765 --> 00:10:34.900
  you know?

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:36.902
- I don't know, I
don't feel good at all.

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:38.437
- No time like the present guy.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.972
 - If you wanna
 bring another pussy

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:40.806
 in the relationship
 already, I will.

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:41.874
(Lauren laughs)

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:42.808
- You can't design this,

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.076
 but you gotta live it dude.

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:45.044
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.278
- No time like the present guy.

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:46.979
 - Yeah, I guess
 you're right, yeah.

00:10:47.012 --> 00:10:48.247
 - Final level.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.481
 No more Tasty Jimmys.

00:10:49.514 --> 00:10:50.583
 You got this.

00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:55.287
  - Hey Tasty, take a hike.

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.457
 Coz this pussy's mine.

00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:03.696
- (laughs) Matt?

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.431
 - Alright, Lauren
 hey come up come up.

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:06.665
 - What are you doing,

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:07.833
 I have a cat treat
 in my hand, hold on.

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:09.134
 - This is not really
 how I pictured

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.402
doing this here,

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:14.073
but Lauren, I'm sorry I
took so long to do this.

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:18.610
  And you know this is
  pretty weird way to do it.

00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:20.746
But, you know, you've
been waiting a long time

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:21.980
  and I do love you.

00:11:22.013 --> 00:11:24.516
- Aww (laughs).

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:26.318
 - Lauren, I--

00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:27.519
- Yeah?

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:28.887
 - Yeah, hold on a sec,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.290
 Jesus Christ, Lauren--

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.891
(Lauren screams)

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:34.760
Yeah, will you marry me?

00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:35.861
- Yeah.

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:37.362
 Yes, yes, yes,

00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:41.166
I didn't think you
would do this (laughs).

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:43.001
- Yeah, I know.

00:11:43.034 --> 00:11:45.170
 This is a real thing.

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:47.272
  - I can't believe
  this is happening.

00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:48.207
 Is this real?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.575
 - Yeah, this is a real thing.

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:50.976
 - Man this week was
 really really special.

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:52.611
 You know, they're
 committing to a lifetime of

00:11:52.644 --> 00:11:55.347
  love and matrimony
  and, you know,

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:57.583
 sharing mail.

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:01.653
 But, Matt's not the only one
 who walked out of that cafe

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:03.822
 with a new piece of puassy.

00:12:03.855 --> 00:12:05.257
  I met this person,

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:07.293
 Sugar.
