00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:12.277
Thor—son of Odin, god of thunder, 
and protector of mankind—

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:19.236
struggled mightily against his greatest
challenge yet: opening a bag of food.

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.126
It’d all started when Thor,

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:26.487
along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god,

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:32.281
set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.215
Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir,

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:40.256
who offered to accompany them and
even carry their provisions in his bag.

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:43.115
But when they made camp,
Skrymir dozed off

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:46.865
and Thor couldn’t untie the sack.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:51.287
Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:56.155
by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:00.135
But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:02.946
and went back to sleep.

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.016
The next morning, Skrymir departed

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:11.167
and eventually, the travelers reached 
a massive fortress called Utgard.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:15.905
Inside the long hall, 
they met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki,

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.806
who greeted his guests with a challenge:

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:23.367
each of them was to prove they were 
the best at some particular skill.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:28.646
Loki went first, declaring himself 
the world’s fastest eater.

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.964
To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi

00:01:31.964 --> 00:01:37.897
and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:41.386
Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed.

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:44.077
But when the contestants 
met in the center,

00:01:44.077 --> 00:01:48.186
Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food,

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:52.727
but also the bones 
and even the trough itself.

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:58.186
Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild.

00:01:58.186 --> 00:02:03.906
The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi,

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:10.103
who outraced Thjalfi easily.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:14.405
But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.755
This time, Thjalfi finished close behind

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:22.666
and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast.

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:26.897
Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it,

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:31.277
but Hugi was even faster than before.

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.747
Finally, it was Thor’s turn.

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:35.753
The king offered him a drinking horn,

00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:39.857
saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps.

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:41.396
Thor raised it to his lips

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:44.837
and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead

00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:47.282
in the longest gulp he could muster.

00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:48.826
Then a second.

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:50.407
Then a third.

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:55.368
But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered.

00:02:55.368 --> 00:03:00.357
To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge:

00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:03.407
lift his pet cat off the ground.

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:06.497
But this cat was as tall as Thor.

00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:09.513
Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back,

00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:17.157
and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:20.748
Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants.

00:03:20.748 --> 00:03:26.083
The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli.

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:29.535
Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her

00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:35.366
and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:39.726
The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled.

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:42.065
But as the king escorted them out,

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:45.936
he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed.

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:51.877
Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself,

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.107
devouring everything in its path.

00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:59.366
Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought,

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.987
always faster than action.

00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:05.785
And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age,

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:08.917
which weakens everyone eventually.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:12.217
As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.936
The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean,

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:18.766
and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides.

00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:21.666
The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world,

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.677
and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth.

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:28.487
And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise,

00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:34.047
deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains.

00:04:34.047 --> 00:04:36.986
The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess,

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:42.324
which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:46.018
Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:48.246
But in trying to achieve the impossible,

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:51.116
they’d pushed themselves 
harder than ever before

00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.819
and changed the world 
in ways no one had expected.
