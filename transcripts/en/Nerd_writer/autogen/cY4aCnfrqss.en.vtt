00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.460
('THEIR FIRST TIME' BY ADAM TAYLOR PLAYS)

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.640
Since around 2008,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.600
when the DSLR revolution put full-frame sensors

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.000
in the hands of amateur film makers and videographers,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.020
super shallow depth of field has become something of a cliche in indie film making

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.200
For a lot of film makers, myself included, this effect was used not just as a tool,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.820
but as a crutch to achieve that, "Cinematic Look"

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.020
These days, super shallow focus is everywhere

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.060
It's a fashion more than a technique,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.860
so it's really, really cool to see an episodic show like "The Handmaid's Tale"

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.900
incorporate the effect in a systematic way as a motif of its visual language

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.620
The director of the first 3 episodes of the show, the director who set the tone is

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.080
Reed Morano, a former cinematographer

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.780
She and her own D.P. for this project, Colin Watkinson, created an extremely concentrated aesthetic

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.060
One that is beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.620
To capture the dystopian world of Gilead meant choosing the right camera and the right lenses

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.740
Morano shot on the ARRI Alexa Minis in 4k and used

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.940
lenses that opened all the way up to apertures of 1.3 and 1.4, which means

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.160
your depth of field is going to be razor thin

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.640
and everything outside of that field is going to be blown out in a pretty uniform blur

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.960
Now this shallow focus serves the story in 3 ways

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960
First to capture the main character's point of view

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.760
Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss, is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.660
a theocratic and totalitarian state that has overtaken America in which women no longer have any rights

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.140
Handmaids are the last women who can still have children, the rest of society being largely sterile

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560
and they're forced to bear children for leaders of the regime

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.780
But it wasn't always like this, before the revolution, Offred lived in the America of our time

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.760
and the story of "The Handmaid's Tale" is really the story of the transition between America and Gilead

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.760
told through the experience of Offred

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.540
To dial us into that horror, Reed and Watkinson focus on the face

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.900
It's hard to remember a show that relied so much on one extreme close-up

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.560
but Elisabeth Moss is definitely up to the task

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.080
With a camera mere inches from her nose, the filmmakers combine

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.400
a wide 28mm ZEISS lense, used only for these shots, with a shallow depth of field

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.340
to create intense intimacy

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.060
And with her bonnet on, it's almost as if we're under a blanket with the character

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.160
The shallow depth of field extreme close-ups are an effective way to get the audience to identify with Offred

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.840
But they also point to an important theme,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.900
that as a slave in an authoritarian state, where your physical being is affectively controlled by someone else,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.440
your only agency is mental. The mind is where you have to retreat, to escape, to plan, and to remember

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.520
It's only a thin plane of focus, but it's still yours

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.400
The second, shallow focus is used to help create the world of Gilead

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.000
Unlike many dystopias you see in film and TV, Gilead is not a post-apocalyptic world of rubble and ruin

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.320
It's actually the opposite. A meticulously manicured New England full of sunlight and green foliage

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.080
Reed and Watkinson cite Kubrick as an inspiration, and they echo a lot of his one-point perspective framings

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.900
and definitely capture the creepiness of that

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.060
But, for the women of Gilead, what's notable about this world is how little they know about it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.380
Think of all the knowledge that's accessbile to you through the internet

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.960
In Gilead, women are not only prohibited from going online, they're prohibited from reading anything

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.540
The result is a perspective that's extraordinarily narrow

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.200
The shallow depth of field captures this perfectly, because it literally narrows the visual information in focus

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.940
"The Handmaid's Tale" is constructed in fragments

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.220
You have America, and you have Gilead, and the show gives you pieces in-between the two,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.080
but never the full time-line

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.400
This is in part because the show's primary characters don't have the full time-line themselves

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.260
This brutal new world, or at least the conditions that made it possible, snuck up on them

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.220
MAN: I have to let you go 
EMPLOYEES: What?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.400
But that doesn't mean it came out of nowhere; that they aren't somehow connected

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.880
For example, even though Reed and Watkinson adopt a more hand-held verite style for the flashbacks,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.140
the shallow focus remains

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.460
And they do this--I think--to suggest that both worlds suffer from problems of limited perspective

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:25.360
In Gilead, perspective is limited by force, but in our world, perspective is limited by choice

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.580
We keep our heads down, eyes glued to our screens, stuck in our echo chambers

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.060
while the blurry world around us changes

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.080
It brings home a vital message, that our rights are not guaranteed by the world

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.720
We fight for them, and have to protect them everyday,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.260
because they can be taken away from us if we don't pay attention to the world beyond our focus

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.175
Everyone likes shallow depth of field: it's beautiful

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.120
And because it's beautiful, everyone uses it to make their work look better, more professional, more cinematic

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.300
And as a result, we get used to seeing it

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.200
When I watch "The Handmaid's Tale,"

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.560
I was amazed at how much the depth of field influenced

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.020
my feelings about the characters, and the world, and the story

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.100
It's just rare that you see this device used with such purpose, so methodically, and so effectively

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.900
And it really is effective

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.520
If you don't believe me, binge-watch a few episodes of "The Handmaid's Tale," then go outside

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.940
I guarantee you'll have a newfound respect for how much there is to see

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.660
('I CAN'T TAKE IT' BY BLUE WEDNESDAY PLAYS)

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.360
One of the questions I get asked the most is what software I use to make these videos

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.340
To edit, I use Final Cut Pro X, and since X is so different from the version of the program that came before it

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.440
I depended a lot on online videos to teach me the new features

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.280
These days, you can pretty much teach yourself anything this way, and Skillshare is the perfect way to do it
