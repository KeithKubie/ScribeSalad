00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.269
So when you look at us—us as humans, as
apes, as primates, as mammals—when you look

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.209
at some of the most appalling realms of our
behavior, much of it has to do with the fact

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:23.910
that social organisms are really, really hardwired
to make a basic dichotomy about the social

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.430
world, which is those organisms who count
as Us’s and those who count as Thems.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.160
And this is virtually universal among humans
and this is virtually universal among all

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.190
sorts of social primates that have aspects
of social structures built around separate

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.370
social groupings.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.350
Us’s and Thems: we turn the world into Us’s
and Thems and we don’t like the Thems very

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.410
much and are often really awful to them.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.050
And the Us’s, we exaggerate how wonderful
and how generous and how affiliative and how

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.280
just like siblings they are to us.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.590
We divide the world into Us and Them.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.860
And one of the greatest ways of seeing just
biologically how real this fault line is,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.700
is there’s this hormone oxytocin.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.780
Oxytocin is officially the coolest, grooviest
hormone on earth, because what everybody knows

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.140
is it enhances mother-infant bonding and it
enhances pair bonding in couples.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.090
And it makes you more trusting and empathic
and emotionally expressive and better at reading

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.740
expressions and more charitable.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.400
And it’s obvious that if you just, like,
spritzed oxytocin up everyone’s noses on

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.939
this planet it would be the Garden of Eden
the next day.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.900
Oxytocin promotes prosocial behavior.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.210
Until people look closely.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.090
And it turns out oxytocin does all those wondrous
things only for people who you think of as

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.979
an “Us”, as an in-group member.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.890
It improves in-group favoritism, in-group
parochialism.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.050
What does it do to individuals who you consider
a Them?

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:06.010
It makes you crappier to them, more preemptively
aggressive, less cooperative in an economic

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.010
game.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.979
What oxytocin does is enhance this Us/Them
divide.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.800
So that, along with other findings—the classic
lines of Us versus Them along the lines of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.320
race, of sex, of age, of socioeconomic class:
your brain processes these Us/Them differences

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.150
on the scale of milliseconds, a twentieth
of a second, your brain is already responding

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.280
differently to an Us versus Them.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.400
Okay, so collectively this is depressing as
hell.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.220
Oh my god, we are hardwired to inevitably
be awful to Thems, and Thems along all sorts

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.620
of disturbing lines of: "Oh, if only we could
overcome these Us and Them dichotomies!

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.560
Oh no, are we hardwired to divide the world
along lines of race and ethnicity and nationality

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.310
and all those disturbing things?"

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.300
And what becomes clear is, when you look closely
is: it is virtually inevitable that we divide

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.450
the world into Us’s and Thems and don’t
like Thems very much and don’t treat them

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.450
well.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.709
But we are incredibly easily manipulated as
to who counts as an Us and who counts as a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.709
Them.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.160
And those fault lines that we view as, “Oh
my god, how ancient can you get?” that say,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.530
somebody of another race evokes limbic responses
in us, commensurate with they are a Them,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.580
they respond, they motivate automatic responses—"Oh
my god, is that just the basic fault line?"

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.920
And then you do something like have faces
of the same race versus other race, and either

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.210
they are or aren’t wearing a baseball cap
with your favorite team’s logo on it, and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.849
you completely redefine who's an Us.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.530
Us is people who like the Yankees and Them
are Red Sox fans.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.860
And suddenly you’re processing, within milliseconds,
what damn baseball cap they have, and race

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.330
is being completely ignored.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.569
“Oh my god, we are inevitably hardwired
to make really distressing Us/Them...”

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.480
We’re manipulated within seconds as to who
counts as an Us and a Them.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.669
Good news with that: we can manipulate us
out of some of our worst Us/Them dichotomies

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.479
and re-categorize people.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.599
Bad news: we could be manipulated by all sorts
of ideologues out there as to deciding that

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.500
people who seem just like us "really aren’t.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.469
They’re really so different that they count
as a Them.”

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:37.029
Okay, so a fabulous study showing this, this
double-edged quality to oxytocin, and this

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.370
was a study done by a group in the Netherlands.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.279
And what they did was they took Dutch university
student volunteers and they gave them a classic

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:51.879
philosophy problem, the runaway trolley problem:
“Is it okay to sacrifice one person to save

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.059
five?”

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.969
Runaway trolley: can you push this big, beefy
guy onto the track who gets squashed by the

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.860
trolley but that slows it down so that five
people tied to the track don’t...

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.619
Standard problem in philosophy, utilitarianism,
ends justifies means—all of that.

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:12.539
So you give people the scenario and people
have varying opinions, and now you give them

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.009
the scenario where the person you push onto
the track has a name.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:27.259
And either it’s a standard name from the
Netherlands, Dirk I think, this is like a

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.669
meat-and-potatoes Netherlandish name.

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.509
Or a name from either of two groups that evoke
lots of xenophobic hostility among people

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.449
from the Netherlands: someone with a typically
German name—oh yeah, World War II, that’s

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.780
right, that was a problem—or someone with
a typically Muslim name.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.229
So now they’re choosing whether to save
five by pushing Dirk onto the track or Otto

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.860
or Mahmoud and, in general, give them those
names and there’s no difference in how people

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.339
would rate them if they were anonymous.

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.949
Give people oxytocin, where they don’t know
that they’ve gotten it—control group has

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.110
just placebo spritzed up their nose—give
people oxytocin and, kumbaya, you are far

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.849
less likely to push Dirk onto the track, and
you are now far more likely to push good old

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.599
Otto or good old Mahmoud onto the rails there.

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.599
And you are more likely to sacrifice an out-group
member to save five, and you are less likely

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.490
to sacrifice an in-group member.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.189
All you’ve done there is exaggerate the
Us/Them divide with that.
