WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.640
Okay.
So we're in the,
uh,

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.410
payoff period of having spent all this time on quantum mechanics and we want to

3
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:15.270
see first whether what we've done is realistic or not.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200
So last time we looked at h h and h f in terms of what the bond strengths were

5
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.700
and we saw that indeed one of them was more,
uh,

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.680
stable for breaking into ions and the other more stable with respect to breaking

7
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.320
into two,
uh,
Adams.

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.250
But here's a more extensive reality check today,

9
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.900
which involves a lot more,
uh,

10
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
experimental evidence and it has to do with x h three that is the,

11
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:50.340
uh,
the molecules,
B,
h three c,

12
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.770
h three and Nh three.

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.950
And we're going to look at their structure and how they move and see how that

14
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.400
checks out with what we expect theoretically.
So first,

15
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.960
what do we expect theoretically?

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.990
Well be h three C h three n h three are the same except Boron has three valence

17
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:14.490
electrons.
Carbon has four and nitrogen has five.

18
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
Now each of the uses three of their valence electrons to share with hydrogens to

19
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.100
make the three x h three bonds.

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.640
But Boron then has no leftover electrons.

21
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.340
Carbon has one and nitrogen has to.

22
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.840
So we want to see what the implications of this are going to be for the

23
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:38.550
structure and a dynamic behavior of these molecules.

24
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.560
And then we'll check it against reality.

25
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.310
First we need to look at something that shows that the hybridization that you

26
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.060
use to make bonds should be related to structure.

27
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.710
Now suppose there's one of these atoms that uses an sp hybrid orbital that looks

28
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.500
like,
that.
See the little dot where the nucleus is.

29
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.130
And suppose that happens also,
uh,

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.000
in to use some other hybrid orbital to make another bond.

31
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.910
Now you want to have because of the Paoli principle,

32
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.980
and I'm sorry we don't have time to go into this.
Now,
uh,
you,

33
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.220
the orbitals that you're using must not overlap one another because if there's

34
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:24.381
net overlap between two orbitals then and you have electrons in both of them,

35
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.750
those electrons are to a certain extent the same thing.

36
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.550
If the orbitals overlap,
if they don't overlap,
then they're independent.

37
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.710
So to have only two electrons per orbital,
the orbitals must not overlap.

38
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.310
So we can use that as a criteria to say something about what other orbitals

39
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:46.260
could be used at certain angles.
For example,

40
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:50.460
suppose the other hybrid orbital that this Adam was using was sp three.

41
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.790
Now you'll notice that remember the,
the green,

42
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.080
let's suppose the green and the blue are positive and the red and the yellow are

43
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.420
negative.
Now how much overlap is there?
Well,

44
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:06.421
there'll be positive overlap where green overlaps blue and there'll be positive

45
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:08.740
overlap where red overlaps yellow.

46
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.580
But there'll be negative overlap where green overlaps red or yellow overlap or

47
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.500
where,
where,
uh,
no,
we're,
we're blue overlaps read or where green overlaps yellow.

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.230
Okay.
Is that right?
Where,
yeah,

49
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.980
where blue overlaps or red or green overlaps yellow.
That'll be negative.

50
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.760
And this,

51
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.470
there'll be some angle at which those things exactly cancel out and you get no

52
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.990
net overlap,
no overlap,
bended role.

53
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.740
And we are interested in knowing what that angle would be.

54
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.800
That is how should hybridization be related to angles be related to structure?

55
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.130
Well,
so the question is what's that angle?

56
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.240
And there's a nice formula that isn't too hard to work out.
Why?

57
00:03:55.241 --> 00:04:00.160
It should be that way.
Uh,
that relates s p m n s p.
N.

58
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.140
The values am an n to the angle that should be between them in order to have no

59
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:05.974
overlap.

60
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.350
So let's use that formula and look at several m s and what the angle is.

61
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:15.750
Let's look at s p with sp.
Sp squared with sp squared.
Spq Desk,

62
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.650
SB cubed and s p.

63
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.770
Anything with s p infinity.
What's sp infinity

64
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.510
that says the ratio of p to s is infinite.

65
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.060
So it's a pure p.
So what angle would a pure p orbital make with any hybrid?

66
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.880
Okay,
so those are the things we're going to talk about.
So first,

67
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:41.780
let's try the first one.
You can do the math,
the math for me.
Okay,

68
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.800
so it's s p one s p one m and n are one.

69
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.100
So the denominator is a square root of one.
That's one.

70
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.270
The Co sine of the angle is minus one.
What's the angle?

71
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.560
Okay,
why do angle has co sign of minus 180 okay,
good.

72
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.270
So that'll be linear.
And you knew that I'd been already,

73
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.280
didn't they teach you that in AP chemistry?

74
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.070
That if you have two s p orbitals that are linear,

75
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:13.930
or if you have bonds point opposite direction,
you use SAP hybrids for them.

76
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.780
If they didn't,
that's true.
Anyhow.
Okay.
Now how about sp squared?

77
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:20.740
Sp squared.

78
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400
So we're going to have m and n are both two square root of four is two so it's

79
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:31.810
the angle.
Who's co sign is minus one half?
Anybody know what that is?

80
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.410
I don't think 60 plus I have settling.

81
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.050
It's a 100 flood.
It'd be minus a half,
right?

82
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.420
It has to be greater than 90 to be negative.

83
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.400
So that's gotta be 120 degrees and that's triggered also sp squared hybrids make

84
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:55.570
an angle of 120 degrees.
Now how about sp?
Three hybrids.

85
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:59.630
That's square root of nine.
So one minus a third.

86
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.410
That one probably isn't stored in your head,
but it's an interesting angle.

87
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.570
It's 109 and a half degrees,
which is the angle in a tetrahedron,
right?

88
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.490
So the methane,

89
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:14.740
which makes sp three bonds that the carbon has tetrahedral angles,

90
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.710
109 and a half degrees.
Now how about sp?

91
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.610
Anything with n equals infinity.
What's the denominator?

92
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.290
<v 1>It's in Philly.</v>

93
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.670
<v 0>It's the uh,
uh,
what's the angle?
Who's co-sign is</v>

94
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.350
90 degrees,
right?

95
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.570
So that,

96
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:46.340
that means that is what makes things Sig Button Pie,
right?
A Pr,

97
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:50.850
but all with any other hybrid has to be perpendicular to it.
So you want,

98
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.480
that's what we talked about sigma and Pi last time.

99
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.340
So the p orbital is pie and it's perpendicular to anything else.

100
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.230
90 degrees,
no matter what other hybrid.
Okay,
so now how about this particular,

101
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.790
when we have here where they're not,
where,

102
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.820
which s p cubed in sp one that turns out to be 125.3 degrees.

103
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.950
So that's what the angle should be.

104
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.010
If the carbon rate making one bond with sp and one with SPQ.

105
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.720
Right.
But the important thing here is that there's a relationship between hybrid

106
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.130
hybridisation of two orbitals on the same Adam and what the angle should be

107
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:29.930
between them.
Know,
Angela,

108
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.270
<v 1>would you have an sp three and as high angels?</v>

109
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.820
<v 0>Well we have,
we're going to have to decide what determines the hybridization,</v>

110
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.560
right?
And it could be different for for two bonds from the same Adam,

111
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.290
and we'll see examples of that.
So you'll,
that will become answered.
So it's,

112
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.150
it's if they're bonded to different kinds of things,

113
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.160
they may have different hybridization and we'll see an example of that central.

114
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.290
So we want to optimize the hybridization that is to get,
yeah,

115
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.500
<v 1>this different weightings of the hybridized orbitals changed angle degrees there</v>

116
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:11.990
too.

117
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.990
<v 0>You could change the angle by moving the nuclei around for some other reason,</v>

118
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.290
whatever it is.

119
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.090
And that would then change the hybridization of the carbon that's making the

120
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.440
bonds.
So it works both ways to change the hybridization,

121
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:29.690
you change the angle to change the angle,
you change the hybridization.

122
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.050
Okay,
now we want to optimize hybridization.
What do we mean optimize?

123
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.810
We meet,
we want to get the lowest possible energy.

124
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:42.770
We want to choose the hybridisation that'll give the lowest hybridization and

125
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:47.510
therefore a particular geometry for x.
H three is certain angles.

126
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.000
Okay.
Now,
let's think about that.
We're going to have one x electro,

127
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.540
one of the valence electrons of the x out of,
in each of three bonding,

128
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:59.700
atomic orbitals bonding to the hydrogen,

129
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.390
and whatever's left over goes into the fourth atomic orbital.

130
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.260
And we want to minimize the energy,
okay?

131
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.890
Now let's first look at it from the point of view of the bonds.

132
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.250
We want to make the strongest possible bonds.

133
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.520
We want to maximize the overlap in the bonds.

134
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.180
What hybrid gives the best overlap?
Sp can you make,

135
00:09:23.181 --> 00:09:26.490
but we have to make three bonds,
right?

136
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.890
Sp you can only make two bonds.

137
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.150
So what's the best you can use if you want to make three bonds?

138
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.651
Sp squared.

139
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:39.180
So no matter whether it's Bh three ch three or Nh three,

140
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.930
all of the,
we'll overlap best in making three bonds.

141
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.010
If you use sp squared so that the bonds cry out,

142
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.840
use s use sp squared,

143
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.610
that'll maximize the overlap and minimize the energy of the electrons in the

144
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.170
bonds.
Okay?

145
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.980
But that's not the only game in town because there's also the other electron

146
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.820
that's on the atom.
If there is another electron,
hey,

147
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.840
because carbon has one in nitrogen has two other electrons.

148
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.830
So they should get a say in it too.
So the x atom,

149
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.060
which has to accommodate whatever's leftover says,
okay,

150
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:23.061
go ahead and make three bonds but get the lowest energy for the other electron

151
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:26.880
that I'm the only one responsible for.
Right.

152
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.640
So what's the lowest energy you could make for a pair of electrons or for a

153
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:37.590
single electron?
What's the lowest energy?
Valence.
Orbital.
Yes.

154
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.610
So the Adam says,
okay,
make your three bonds,
but make sure you,

155
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.470
you don't let s orbital go begging,
right?

156
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:51.120
Use the maximum you can have sr buttle cause otherwise you're using high energy,

157
00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:53.370
atomic orbitals when you might not need to.

158
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.700
Now sometimes these would agree and sometimes they would fight with one another,

159
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.980
the bonds and the Adam.
Okay.

160
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.550
So from the point of view of the atom Boron with only three valence or electrons

161
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:11.730
all being used in bonds doesn't have anything else.

162
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.240
So it would certainly want to use three sp squared and leave the p orbital

163
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:22.371
vacant that gets the maximum utility out of the s right.

164
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.400
Puts the s where the electrons are.
So that's what Boron says.

165
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:31.020
Use Three SP squared's for the bonds.
What does carbon say?

166
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.940
Well,
no,
probably what does nitrogen say?
Nitrogen,
if it wanted to be the best,

167
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:39.060
Adam would put two electrons.

168
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:43.420
The unshared pair into the SR battle and one into each of the,

169
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.280
of the remaining three P orbitals.
Right.

170
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.580
That gets the maximum use out of s you don't want to waste s by putting it where

171
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:58.180
there's only one electron on the nitrogen atom you want to use it were there two

172
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.900
electrons?
Okay,
so nitrogen says we'll,
I'll use,

173
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.670
I'd prefer to use three P orbitals to make my bonds and put two electrons into

174
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:11.530
the SR bubble.
Okay.
Now what does carbon say?
Carbon says,

175
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:14.260
look,
I got four electrons.

176
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.630
Three of them are going to be in some kind of hybrid that's gonna make the bonds

177
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:21.400
and one of them is going to be something else.

178
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.590
But if I take the s out of one place,

179
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:27.190
I'm going to put it into the other one over all the four I'm going to use up all

180
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:31.720
the s character.
There's one electron in each of them.
Who Cares,
right?

181
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:36.721
So carbon really doesn't care from the point of view of the carbon atom about

182
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.420
hybridization.
It'll care for making for the bonds,

183
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:44.290
but it doesn't care for the uninsured,
for the unshared electron.

184
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.990
Okay.
But now we have to reconcile these two considerations.

185
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.510
So the uh,
uh,
the,

186
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.770
the Boron,

187
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:02.190
once we'll make the best bonds if it uses sp squared and it'll make the best

188
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:07.630
Adam if it uses sp squared.
So great.
They agree.

189
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.490
So Boron should really want to use sp squared hybrids for its bonds.

190
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.520
Remember,
those are the ones that form 120 degrees.

191
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.500
So it will be the pattern of a Mercedes star.
Yeah,
you can do,

192
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.930
if you're just looking at a nitrogen atom,

193
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.500
it's going to have two electrons in one of its orbitals and one in each of three

194
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:39.070
other orbitals,
right?
So those two electrons,

195
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.720
that orbital,
that holds two electrons should be as low as possible at energy.

196
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.090
And that's s so put two in s and one in each of the three P's.

197
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.890
And that'll give the lowest energy,

198
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:54.750
Adam with one electron in each of the four orbitals of,

199
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.840
well pardon me with two in one and three and the others three one in each of the

200
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:04.570
other three.
Okay.
Okay.
So with any out with BH three,

201
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.860
they agree from both points of view of the strongest bonds in the Best Adam.

202
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.910
So it will certainly want to be flat and 120 degree bond angles.

203
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.770
Now how about ch three

204
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.380
ch three from the bonds wants to,

205
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.290
from the point of view of the bonds wants to be sp squared and the Adam doesn't

206
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:27.760
care so fine.
BSP squared,
B flat,

207
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.340
B Planar with 120 degree bond angles,

208
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.400
but it won't care quite as much as boron does.

209
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.190
So carbon says it'll,

210
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.940
it'll prefer to be plainer but not as strongly.

211
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.930
So it'll be easier to bend it,
right,

212
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.020
because it doesn't have this consideration of,
uh,

213
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.950
of leaving a p orbital vacant.
Okay.

214
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.650
And how about nitrogen?
Now you've got a fight on your hands,
right?

215
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.690
Because the bonds want to be flat at 120 degree bond angles,

216
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.610
but the Adam wants to use p orbitals 90 degree angles for the bonds.

217
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.140
So like the corner of a cube would be the nitrogen of the bonds would be going

218
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:13.400
out at 90 degree angles.
So here there's going to have to be some compromise.

219
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.770
Okay,
so,
so Nh three,
since it must compromise,

220
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.690
we'll won't be either perfectly flat or 90 degree angles,

221
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:28.040
but something in between.
It'll be pyramidal.
Okay.

222
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.600
Now are the predictions clear and the reason for them,

223
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.250
you and Judy is,
see now why it's the way it is.

224
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.240
Don't let me bully you into it if you don't really understand.

225
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.140
<v 1>Dana,
can you explain the difference in what one?
For nitrogen again?</v>

226
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.220
<v 0>Yeah.
What we want to do is get the lowest possible energy.</v>

227
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.760
The lowest energy for the bonds will be the best overlap.

228
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.470
You're making three bonds.

229
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.160
So sp squared will give the lowest energy as far as the bonds go.

230
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.500
But there also might be,
and that's the only game in town for Boron,
right?

231
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.400
But in carbon you have another electron you have to accommodate and there's a

232
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:11.940
question of what energy it will have,
even though it's not being shared.

233
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.170
And in nitrogen there are two of those other electrons.
Now,

234
00:16:16.171 --> 00:16:21.171
the best orbital if had Adam for an electron to be in the lowest energy iss and

235
00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:25.830
then in nitrogen they're going to be two electrons that want to be in an s

236
00:16:25.831 --> 00:16:30.450
orbital.
If they do that,
they use up the s orbital and the,

237
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.600
the only thing you have left over to make the bonds is the p orbitals.

238
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:35.340
So now you've got to fight on your hands.

239
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.840
Are you going to have sharp angles and have it have the unshared parent and low

240
00:16:39.841 --> 00:16:44.580
energy s orbital but weak bonds or are you going to have strong bonds sp
squared,

241
00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:49.230
but put the unpaired electrons in a p orbital.
Okay.
Kevin,

242
00:16:49.231 --> 00:16:54.030
did you have a question or that?
Answer it.
Okay.
Yes.

243
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:55.850
Can't hear very well.

244
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.270
<v 1>Is there such a thing as an sp three orbitals</v>

245
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.110
<v 0>yeah.
What does,
what does sp three mean?</v>

246
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.110
It means at a hybrid orbital,

247
00:17:04.111 --> 00:17:08.700
a mixture of s and p with three times as much P as s.

248
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.940
Okay.
You could have that.

249
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:17.180
You could have three s p cubed bonds and for nitrogen for example,

250
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:23.270
and then an s p cubed hybrid in which the unshared pair lives.

251
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.070
Okay.
That would be a possibility.
Sure.

252
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.400
And that's the kind of thing I'm talking about here by saying it would be

253
00:17:29.401 --> 00:17:34.401
intermediate between being 90 degree bond angles and hundred 20 degree bond

254
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:39.380
angles flat.
And he more questions.
Okay.

255
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.790
<v 0>Oh,
I'm going to get to that just shortly here.
So it,</v>

257
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.160
because we're talking about bonds,
bonds are local,

258
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.280
right?
Bonds don't go over the whole molecule.

259
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.400
Molecular orbitals go over the whole molecule.

260
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.720
And we've been talking thus far mostly in terms of molecular orbitals,

261
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.790
but now we're shifting to talk about bonds because what we wanted to do was talk

262
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:13.530
about bonds and I'll do a little about the philosophy of that shortly.
Okay.

263
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.450
So here are the predictions.

264
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.380
Bh Three should strongly want to be playing or be hard to bend.

265
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:22.290
Ch three should want to be plainer but be easy to bend.

266
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.180
And Nh three should be easy to distort out of plane so that it's not flat.

267
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.050
In fact,
fact,
not only should it be easy to distort,

268
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:35.550
it should prefer to distort in its lowest energy form.
Okay,

269
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:37.200
so now let's see if that's true.

270
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.320
Is it true that that unshared pair will compete for s character and therefore

271
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:46.140
make nitrogen pyramidal?
Now how do we know

272
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.590
there's our prediction distortion from the plane will weaken the bond and

273
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:56.430
deprive the electrons have s character.
So he doesn't want to be,

274
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.020
doesn't want to bend here.
Distortion from the plane weakens the bonds,

275
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.260
but it shifts s character to the loan electron where at least it's not wasted

276
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.030
because there is at least an electron there.

277
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.240
And in Nh three it weakens the bonds,

278
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:16.770
but it shifts as character from single electrons to a pair of electrons,

279
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.810
which is something good.
Okay,
so are these predictions true?
Well,

280
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:26.520
we need experiment.
How about X-ray for seeing the structure of,

281
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.590
of Bh three ch three Nh.
Three.
How about Nh?

282
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:35.820
Three have you ever seen an h?
Three have you ever smelled Nh?
Three.

283
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.710
It's ammonia.
So how about doing Xra audit?
Why not?

284
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.580
You can only use an x ray to see electrons cause the ones that are going to,

285
00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.220
now that's not the main problem.
Yeah,
you can make it a crystal.

286
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.910
Do you have to have a crystal to do x Ray crystallography at Nh three is a gas.

287
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.170
Now you might say,
okay,

288
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.060
we'll cool it way down to liquid nitrogen temperature and then maybe it will

289
00:20:02.061 --> 00:20:05.040
crystallize,
it'll be difficult to grow a crystal of ammonia,

290
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.300
but it's conceivable we might be able to grow a crystal of ammonia.
Okay.

291
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.570
Can we use the same trick for ch three and BH h three that one's a gas.

292
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.470
Okay.
Ch three unfortunately if you get two of them together,

293
00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:23.880
they react to get c two h six so you're never going to be able to cool them down

294
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:27.580
and get a crystal.
And the same thing is true of Bh three forms.

295
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.620
B Two h six right?
So forget crystals for this.

296
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:33.750
We can't use x ray crystallography,
the t,

297
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.910
the technique we've used so far to do this,

298
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.700
but there are other techniques for finding structure.

299
00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:41.610
And the one we're going to talk about,
actually we're going to talk about too,

300
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.130
but we're going to talk about not x-ray.

301
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.970
We're going to talk about IRR.
We're going to talk about spectroscopy,

302
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:54.390
infrared spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy.

303
00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.170
Okay?
We're going to talk more about infrared spectroscopy next semester,
right?

304
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.670
But I'll show you just enough to get through the question that we're interested

305
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:04.630
in.
Now,

306
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.850
does that remind you of anything that moves like this in a high wind?

307
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.010
It's like an umbrella,
right?
In a high wind.
It blows inside out.

308
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.060
Okay,
so this is sometimes called the umbrella vibration of x,

309
00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:28.061
h three and you can treat it with Arab and meets goldilocks as if it's one

310
00:21:28.861 --> 00:21:33.420
dimension.
Just how much motion of all these atoms,
right?

311
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.260
How much motion?
You know what the masses are.
The atoms are,
you know,

312
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:40.410
the kind of motion you're interested in.
It's all coordinated.

313
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.640
So you're changing really just one dimension and moving all of these things in a

314
00:21:44.641 --> 00:21:47.610
coordinated way,
back and forth,
right?

315
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.020
So you can treat it as an Arab and problem with a fictitious mass that reflects

316
00:21:52.021 --> 00:21:55.140
the amount of motion of each of the four atoms while that's happening.

317
00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:01.770
Okay,
so here's Bh three doing that out of plane,
bending vibration,

318
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.660
the umbrella vibration and ch three doing the same thing with its electron.

319
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.740
Now it turns out that Bh three vibrates 34 trillion times a second.

320
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:22.180
Okay?
And that's called 34.2 terra hurts.

321
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.060
That's how often it vibrates.
Ch three vibrates.

322
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.280
18.7 terra hurts.

323
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.220
So only half as fast as BH three.

324
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.800
How does this make sense?

325
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.270
Suppose the springs that your vibe that you're bending when you do this

326
00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:43.830
vibration,
suppose it springs,
which set of springs is stiffer?

327
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.240
Bh three or the this a stiff spring,
make a vibration faster or slower,

328
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.740
faster.
So it says the springs are stiffer.

329
00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.770
In Bh three it prefers to be plainer more strongly than ch three does.

330
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.900
Right now you might ask,
what might you ask at this stage?

331
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.150
When I tell you that it vibrates that fast,

332
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.990
<v 1>that's not the question I want.
How do you know?</v>

333
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.870
<v 0>How do I know that it vibrates at that frequency?
Well,</v>

334
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.860
so it would be a stiffer spring.
But how do I know?
Well,
when it vibrates,

335
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.240
the electric charge is moving back and forth,
right?

336
00:23:30.241 --> 00:23:32.220
So the direction of the die,

337
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.000
there's a dipole there plus minus and it's moving back and forth.

338
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:39.930
And what does that create when you have charges moving back and forth?

339
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.070
Electromagnetic radiation,
right?

340
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.890
So electromagnetic radiation is going to come out as this thing vibrates like

341
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:49.724
that.

342
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:55.750
And it comes out with a shorter wavelength for BH three then for ch three right?

343
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.860
And that turns out that the wavelength is such that for BH three there are 1100

344
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:07.840
vibe vibrations waves in a centimeter,
right?

345
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.430
Short wavelength,
and it's longer wavelength,

346
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:14.720
only 600 waves in a centimeter for ch three.

347
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.840
Now,
uh,
we can also,

348
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.850
so there are different light would come out in for a red light of these two or

349
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.270
different colors of light infrared light.
Get absorbed.

350
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.130
That's how you actually measure it and that the,

351
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.190
remember the frequency of light has to do with the energies of the photon.

352
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.330
So in,

353
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:39.440
if you take the quantum mechanical view that you go from one quantized state to

354
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:43.880
another quantized state when you absorb or emit light,

355
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.110
then we know from this frequency that in one case that the two energy levels

356
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:54.680
you're talking about are separated by 3.26 kilocalories per mole.

357
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.400
And in the other case,
by 1.73 kilocalories per mole,

358
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:01.940
only about half as much is everybody on board with this so far?

359
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.070
So it's from the absorption of infrared light that we know how fast they vibrate

360
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.090
and therefore how stiff the springs are.
Okay.

361
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.590
Now just how stiff are they?
Well,
we can use Arabic for this point of view.

362
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:17.390
We have the amount of defamation,

363
00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:20.690
which is our one dimension as it goes back and forth,

364
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.970
and we can assume that it's something like Hooke's law.
That's an assumption,

365
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.420
the distortion,
these springs,

366
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.600
and then we can adjust the potential,

367
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.930
how sharp the the Parabola is of potential energy until we get two energies that

368
00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:43.040
are spaced like that.
Does everybody see what we're doing?

369
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:49.050
So here we do it on the left we get these lowest two energy levels and we

370
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.430
there's the parabola that does the trick.

371
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.680
So that's a strong,
a stiff spring,
strong planar preference.

372
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.230
And in the case of ch three to get that lower energy separation,

373
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:07.340
you need a broader parabola.
It's easier to bend.
The springs are softer.

374
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:13.310
Okay,
everybody see how that worked?
Okay,
so,

375
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.180
so infrared spectroscopy then tells us that it first,

376
00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:22.181
that it prefers to be plainer and second that it stiffer for Boron than it is

377
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:27.140
for carbon just as we predicted.
Okay.

378
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.210
Now how about for Nh three
for Nh,

379
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:37.211
three ut you see two absorptions in the infrared and they're very near one

380
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:44.021
another 1968 and nine 32 wave numbers that is waves per centimeter.

381
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.910
If we translate that,
it means that there are two energy levels,
that there's,

382
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.200
there's a lower energy level and then there are two that are very close to one

383
00:26:55.201 --> 00:27:00.201
another in order to have these two different colors of infrared light being

384
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:05.010
absorbed.
How can we get this?
How can we get,
this is not Hooke's law.

385
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.210
Remember what happens with Hooke's law and the energy spacing?

386
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.240
What happens there even remember.

387
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.360
So this isn't anything like Hooke's law.

388
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.470
Where do you get to that are very similar to one another?
You remember

389
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.910
what I double minimum gives that?

390
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:28.830
So NH three must be a double minimum like this,

391
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.530
right?
And those must those,

392
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.850
the blue and the red one must be the one with three nodes.

393
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:37.290
And the one with two nodes,

394
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.540
there's also one with zero nodes and one with one node.

395
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.810
But those are both down at the bottom,
right?

396
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:49.110
They have the same energy because there's not enough overlap between the two to

397
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:51.960
make them split.
Right?
So these,

398
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.940
so the IRR spectroscopy of ammonia tells you it's a double minimum.

399
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.250
And also in order to get that spacing tells you how big the barrier is.

400
00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:07.230
It costs three kilocalories of mole to make Nh three planar.

401
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.980
It prefers to be pyramidal,
okay?

402
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.870
And that splitting,

403
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.200
that tunnel splitting that we talked about before for those two levels is 37

404
00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:19.380
wave numbers.

405
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.570
Remember there's also the two that are down at the bottom with zero and one node

406
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.100
and they're separated by only one wave number.
They're very close to one another.

407
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.810
But we can translate that into the tunneling frequency.

408
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.640
When you're down in the lowest energy levels,
how fast does it go back and forth?

409
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.190
And you remember how to do that.
If it,

410
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.410
if it's one wave number is two counts too small calories per mole,

411
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.970
not kilocalories.
And we use that,

412
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.630
that the thing that we talked about in lecture nine about how to go from,

413
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.920
from uh,
tunnels from splitting to tunneling rate.

414
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.910
And it turns out that in the ground state and the lowest energy state,

415
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.350
ammonia is flipping back and forth,
10 to the 11th times a second.

416
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:09.510
And in fact for a while that was used as a fundamental clock,

417
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:14.250
right here was something that you really knew the frequency of Hook when he was

418
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:18.360
trying to devise a clock that could tell where you were in longitude,

419
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.230
could have used ammonia if he'd had the technology to do it,

420
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.060
which would be an absolute frequency.
Okay,
so,
so,
uh,

421
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.120
so IRR shows completely confirms what we said before that Bh three is stiff and

422
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:33.751
flat.

423
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:38.751
Ch three is easily bent and flat and Nh three is not bent,

424
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.940
but can tunnel back to forth by the umbrella motion.

425
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.191
Okay,

426
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:50.110
so now the other technique I want to tell you about is electron spin resonance

427
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.080
spectroscopy.
And it turns out,
and we don't have time to go into this,
that,

428
00:29:55.081 --> 00:29:55.610
that,

429
00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:00.610
that what you know already that electrons are magnetic and some nuclei are

430
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:03.770
magnetic and you can get an inner,

431
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.360
a magnetic interaction between the nucleus and the electron,

432
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.380
which influences how hard it is to change the electron from being pointing one

433
00:30:13.871 --> 00:30:17.470
way to being pointing another way.
That's a kind of spectroscopy.

434
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.590
See what color of light you need to make an electron.

435
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:23.110
Flip from being pointed one way to the other way,

436
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.300
but it's influenced by the magnet,
which is the nucleus.

437
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.370
But there's a neat thing about it,

438
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.910
which is that influence can occur only when the electron is inside the nucleus.

439
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:45.090
Where in a one s orbital is the electric is the highest electron density.

440
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.810
Remember the formula for a one s electron?
What's the,

441
00:30:49.811 --> 00:30:53.400
what's the atomic?
Orbital.
It's a constant times what?

442
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.220
Either the minus row,
where's it biggest

443
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:03.820
inside the nucleus is the most dense part of the,
of the,
uh,

444
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.650
electron,
right?
So that when the electron is inside the nucleus,

445
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.980
it feels this effect when it's not inside the nucleus,

446
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:16.450
it does not feel the effect for the purpose of this spectroscopy.
Okay?

447
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.870
So we can measure how much s character there is in a hybrid orbital that holds

448
00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:29.011
an electron by seeing how strongly the nucleus interacts with the electron.

449
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:33.490
Cause it happens only to the extent that it's s right?

450
00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:38.020
So we can measure the percent of s character by measuring this,

451
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:40.780
the light that's absorbed by the electron,

452
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.210
<v 1>Christopher Nolan,
the deal up truck</v>

453
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:49.480
inside the [inaudible] time to save space.

454
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.530
There's different particles if we believe in it.

455
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.670
<v 0>In fact,
it's,</v>

456
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.730
it's a little more complicated than that because what's the kinetic energy if

457
00:31:58.941 --> 00:31:59.590
it's in

458
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:04.560
<v 1>the distance,
is zero
cool out big energies,</v>

459
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.680
<v 0>one over r suppose R is zero.</v>

460
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:14.530
<v 1>What's the kinetic energy infinite right now?</v>

461
00:32:14.691 --> 00:32:15.000
Well,

462
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.340
<v 0>that means the electron is really zinging,</v>

463
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.780
which means it becomes relativistic and its mass changes and all sorts of wild

464
00:32:21.781 --> 00:32:26.400
things occur.
So it's actually that which causes this interaction.

465
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.170
So it's,
it's,
we'll leave that across the way here in Sloan physics lab.

466
00:32:31.171 --> 00:32:32.004
Okay.

467
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:37.190
And take it from me that the amount of this splitting that you see in the Esr

468
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.710
spectrum depends on how much s character there is on the orbital.

469
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.030
Okay.

470
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:48.920
And you can worry about whether it's precisely inside the nucleus or just so

471
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:53.780
heavy and fast that it's,
that it's behaving weirdly.
Okay.

472
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.870
But anyhow,
that's the trick.
Okay.

473
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:59.600
So the singly occupied molecular orbital,

474
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.640
the one where there's only one electron in ch three,
uh,
we'll,
we'll,

475
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:05.240
uh,

476
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.240
we'll give rise to electron spin resonance and the magnitude of this effect will

477
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:15.890
tell you how much s orbital areas.
Okay.
So let's look at it.
So there's,

478
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:17.090
and this is what I just said,

479
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:19.820
there's a line separation duty magnetic interaction,

480
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.600
and it occurs only if the electron spends time on the nucleus,

481
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:27.890
which happens only for an s orbital.
So we can measure how much s orbital.
Okay,

482
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:31.550
so here's a picture of Planar ch three and the orbital,

483
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:36.140
the singly occupied molecular orbitals Somo that contains the electron.

484
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.660
How much time is it spending on the nucleus?

485
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.420
Zero.
There's a node at the nucleus.
It's in a p orbital.

486
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.500
Now suppose we bend it so it looks like that.

487
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.290
Or we could look inside and it looks like that.

488
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.570
Now it's got some s character in that orbital,

489
00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.100
right?

490
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.970
And if we make little boxes and blow him up to see what it looks like down near

491
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:02.804
the nucleus,

492
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:08.230
one of them has no density at the nucleus and the other has electron density at

493
00:34:08.361 --> 00:34:12.950
the nucleus.
So you'll see magnetic interaction.
In this case,

494
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.120
if it's bent,
you'll see magnetic interaction.
And the more bent,

495
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:22.610
the smaller that angle from 120 remember the smaller the angle.

496
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:26.660
So it'll go go down toward 90 the Morris character,
there'll be more of it.

497
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.450
Okay,
so here's what you see for ch three bear in mind,
it has to be,
see,

498
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.930
it has to be a magnetic.
See,

499
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:40.760
it has to be c 13 h three not see 12 in order to see the splitting.

500
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.650
But at any rate,
the amount of this effect is 38 Gauss,

501
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.660
which are the units can be measured in,

502
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:52.950
and that implies that on average it's 2% s.

503
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.570
Now remember we already said that it's lowest energy form is flat with no ass,

504
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.650
but it's constantly undergoing this umbrella vibration.

505
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.640
So it spending time with different amounts of s character,

506
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:12.170
not zero as it vibrates,
and the average is 2%.

507
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.700
Now suppose I made the hydrogens heavier

508
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.910
by making them do pterygium.

509
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.510
So I make the Adams heavier.

510
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.720
You remember how that changes the shape of the wave function?

511
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.780
If I make things heavier,
here's here it is,
four H's moving.

512
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.590
What if it were do pterygiums that are moving?
How will the thing change?

513
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.950
It'll get narrower.
So as it gets narrower,

514
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:43.650
that means it's not bending as much on average.

515
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.830
And what should happen to the 38 gals if it doesn't bend as much?

516
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.120
<v 1>I'll let you think about in a second.</v>

517
00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.790
<v 0>No,
it's only when it's bent that it has s character.
And you see this effect.</v>

518
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:05.920
If it were rigidly flat,
this splitting would be zero 38 would be zero.

519
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.100
What would happen if I change h two d so that it doesn't bend as much on

520
00:36:11.291 --> 00:36:12.124
average.

521
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.690
<v 1>So if you want me to say here,
right,</v>

522
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:20.930
if we're more rigid,
it would.
How big would the effect be?

523
00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:24.680
Bigger or smaller accounts?
Pardon me?

524
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.930
<v 0>36 right?
So again,
it confirms what we're saying,</v>

525
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.630
that it prefers to be flat.

526
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.870
It's only when it bends that you get this effect and it,

527
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.220
Ben's lasts with heavier atoms than with lighter Adams.
Wonderful.

528
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.910
So again,
it confirms what we said.
There's what CD three looks like it,

529
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.550
it's a little bit narrower and therefore a little bit less of this magnetic

530
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:51.384
interaction.

531
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.830
So this is a structural isotope effect.

532
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.170
Ch three spends more time,

533
00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:03.260
more bent than CD three and thus uses more s character and thus gives a bigger

534
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:08.820
magnetic interaction.
Okay,
so again,
we've confirmed what we predicted.

535
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.270
Now here's one that we didn't work on and predicting his seat.

536
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.690
F three now what's,

537
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:19.260
what's changing h to f got to do?
Well,
it's going to be heavier.

538
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.680
So the same deal that would happen with deuterium should happen here,

539
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:28.010
but there might be more to it than that because now we have more protons and a

540
00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:32.490
bigger nuclear charge of the atoms that were h before.

541
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.590
So they're going to to attract the electrons in the bond more.

542
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

543
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:40.973
<v 0>So,</v>

544
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.040
but there's another thing too that because the fluorines have a partial negative

545
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:49.490
charge and are bigger,
they have more electrons all together,

546
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.300
they'll repel one another.
Now what would,
if if the,

547
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:59.340
if the things attached to the central carbon get bigger and repel one another,

548
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.800
what effects should that have on it being bent?

549
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.810
Should it make it easier or harder to bend?
If these things are big here,

550
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.390
easier to bend from flat or harder if these things are harder.

551
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.300
Right?
So valence electron pair,

552
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:19.320
repulsion and all that should say that if c h three is flat,

553
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:24.480
what about CF three?
It should really be flat,

554
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.080
harder to bend if these things are bigger.
Okay.

555
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.260
But there's another point of view that you can take.

556
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

557
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.280
<v 0>Which is that fluorine has the lion's share of the bonding electron pair.</v>

558
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.730
The bonding electron pair in each of the CF bonds is spending more time near

559
00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:47.170
fluorine than near carbon.

560
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.370
So carbon being a kg sort of character says,

561
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.700
why should I waste my valuable s character trying to stabilize these electrons?

562
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:02.920
They're spending their time on fluorine anyway.
Right?

563
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.160
Why don't I use it to stabilize that other electron that's only on me and not on

564
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.990
fluorine?
You got the idea.

565
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.620
So if carbon uses it's s character to go to the odd electron,

566
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.260
forgetting the ones that are mostly on flury in any way,

567
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.000
then that would make it more bent.
That would favor bending.

568
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.040
If you put the s character in the odd electron rather than in the bonds,

569
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.900
that'll favor using more p character in the bonds and therefore more bending.

570
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.120
So this is exactly the kind of thing that,
that uh,
that bacon would have liked,

571
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.280
right?
This is a crucial experiment.

572
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:47.281
They're two opposite predictions and you can do an experiment and find out which

573
00:39:47.771 --> 00:39:52.030
one is true.
Is that that fluorine is bigger and negatively charged.

574
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.650
So it makes it more flat?
Or is it that the carbon says,

575
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:58.240
I want to put my electron,

576
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.470
the only electron I'm really solely responsible for in the car,

577
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.050
in the orbital with the most ass.
Right?

578
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.040
So this is a real horse race and you place your bets.
Okay.

579
00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.210
Now how many people think it's the,
well,
we'll guess ahead of time,

580
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:16.330
how many people think that Fluor Enes are bigger and negatively charged?

581
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.180
So it will be harder to bend away from playing charity.

582
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.510
And how many people think that it's the odd electron that you want to put s

583
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:30.490
character in?
Well,
this is very close.
Okay.

584
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.190
So we'll have to look at an experiment.
Okay,

585
00:40:33.191 --> 00:40:37.240
so this is the singly occupied molecular orbital of CF three.

586
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.750
It's mostly on the central carbon,
right?

587
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.340
But a little bit on the Fluor Enes.
And if you look in the middle,

588
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:48.160
you see that there's the s character on the carbon.

589
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.440
And if we measure the splitting,
it's 271 gauss.

590
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.480
What was it for methane

591
00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.040
38 this is 10 times almost or whatever number of times that maybe like eight

592
00:41:03.281 --> 00:41:07.690
times more s character than there was in that aid.

593
00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:12.490
What's the conclusion?
It's much more bent.

594
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:19.330
Much more of the time than ch three is,
right.
Okay.

595
00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:24.331
So that means it's 20% s that means that it's sp four in that almost sp three,

596
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:32.020
right?
So it's almost perfectly pyramidal.
Like methane would be,
right.

597
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.280
So it's the character of that odd electron wanting to be s that's,

598
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.970
that's uh,
controlling the geometry.
Okay,

599
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:42.860
now we're going to get to what Christopher wanted,

600
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:46.700
which is why the heck are we talking about bonds when we've been talking about

601
00:41:46.701 --> 00:41:49.220
molecular orbitals all the time?
Well,

602
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.160
one reason is we wanted to talk about bonds.

603
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.780
That's how we got into this whole thing and asking what bonds are.
Okay,

604
00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:02.260
but there are three different operators here and they have different motivation

605
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:04.160
and met and methods.

606
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.400
First there's the molecule deciding what to be and then there's the computer

607
00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:14.180
doing quantum mechanics,
deciding what sh what the molecule should do.

608
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.840
And then there's you,
okay.

609
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:22.700
Trying to understand all this and these are different and let's see the way in

610
00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:27.080
which they're different.
The experimental molecule,
all it wants to know it,

611
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.370
it doesn't care about Schrodinger all at once to do is get the lowest possible

612
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:34.190
energy.
So it minimize the total energy.

613
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:39.191
Kinetic plus Coolum energies of the electrons and the nuclei by just settling

614
00:42:39.411 --> 00:42:43.880
down into the most comfortable,
lowest energy arrangement.
Okay.

615
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.540
That's what the molecule does.
It just gets happy.
Okay.

616
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.200
And once it does that,
then it has a certain structure,

617
00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:54.320
a certain arrangement of the nuclei and of the electron clouds.

618
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.920
It has a total electron density,
which you can measure by X-ray.

619
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.370
It has certain energies that we showed measuring by IIR,

620
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:03.500
although you can measure them other ways as well.

621
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.120
It has nuclear electron density that we just measured by Esr.

622
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.700
It has dipole moment,
how much the,

623
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.380
there's a separation of positive and negative that you can,
that if it vibrates,

624
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:20.270
gives off.
IIR and so on.
So there are all these real things that come from the,

625
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.570
from the molecule,
just doing what comes naturally.

626
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.730
So it doesn't care about tritium.

627
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:30.530
Now you'll have a computer that comes along armed with Schrodinger's equation

628
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.850
and it knows it can't possibly solve the true Schrodinger equation.

629
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:39.530
It's too complicated.
So it'll do some approximation and tried to get,
uh,
an,
uh,

630
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.910
an approximate value.

631
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:45.830
So it'll minimize the total energy using the Schrodinger equation with some

632
00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:48.410
realistic constraints.
For example,

633
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:53.590
using orbitals are using configuration interaction or using density functional

634
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:58.390
theory or some approximation.
Okay.
And what,
uh,

635
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.470
so it'll use like a limited set of atomic orbitals only say two s and they won't

636
00:44:03.471 --> 00:44:07.400
use the five p orbital or the five g orbital or something like that.

637
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.640
Use self-consistent field or some correlation or delocalized molecular orbitals

638
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:15.230
come out.
Okay.

639
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:20.650
And what its goal is to get a useful prediction of the properties,

640
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.020
maybe the electron density,
maybe the energy,

641
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.030
maybe the vibration frequency,

642
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.960
maybe absorption of what colors of light get absorbed and so on.

643
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.170
So the goal of computer is to use any tricks that can get around.
It.

644
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:37.140
Can do and it doesn't care how hard it works,
right?

645
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.620
It's not something you have to be able to do on a piece of paper just to get

646
00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:43.170
something useful and it will be validated.

647
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:46.920
The approximations you've made by experiment.
If it agrees with experiment,

648
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:48.390
then you can believe the computer,

649
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.350
but that doesn't mean you understand that what the computer did,
right?

650
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:56.760
It's a really complicated calculation and that's different from what you want to

651
00:44:56.761 --> 00:45:01.761
do because your goal is to understand structure and reactivity with the

652
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:04.200
simplest,
realistic model,

653
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:09.290
not triggers fundamental equation because you don't have the brainpower to to

654
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.780
manipulate numbers that way and do all these integrals and so on.

655
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:14.010
Leave that to the computer.

656
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.910
You're goal is to try to look at things and understand,
oh,

657
00:45:16.911 --> 00:45:18.810
that should be reactive with this.

658
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.640
That bond should be very stiff that that molecular structure should be very

659
00:45:23.641 --> 00:45:27.810
stiff because the quote bonds are should be stiff.
Okay?

660
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:31.530
That's what you want to do is to develop an intuition that allows you to

661
00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:36.510
understand structure and reactivity and you want the simplest obviously,

662
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.750
but realistic model and that to be both simple and realistic.

663
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:46.230
May Not be possible.
Right?
There's a certain tension there.

664
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.560
Okay.
So what kinds of things you'll talk about?

665
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:54.840
You'll talk about localized bonds.

666
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:58.200
You won't talk about these big things that are complicated and go over the whole

667
00:45:58.201 --> 00:46:00.840
molecule.
I mean,
it's interesting to see,
for example,

668
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.920
that those are analogous to atomic orbitals and the kinetic energy plays a part

669
00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:05.430
in them,

670
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:10.430
but that doesn't empower you to predict the properties of things.

671
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.950
Okay.
So you want to talk about localized bonds,

672
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:17.550
maybe pretend they're springs or something like that and what makes a spring

673
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:18.990
stiff or not stiff.

674
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:24.090
And that Christopher is why we have been talking about about springs and things

675
00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:26.700
here rather than talking about molecular orbitals.

676
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.870
So you talk about these are as ideas,
bonds,
lone payers,

677
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.600
uh,
hybridization.

678
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.000
We talk about energy match and overlap and we'll talk beats talking soon about

679
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:42.210
homos and Lumos,
highest occupied,
molecular orbital,

680
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.770
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital,
and what a very important thing those are.

681
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.460
So we're gonna look at just little bits of things to try to find out what's

682
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:55.380
crucial and will allow us to understand,
we want them to be realistic.

683
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:59.640
We want them fundamentally to be based on something true like quantum mechanics,

684
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:01.050
not just on springs,

685
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.680
but we have to make it simple enough to understand.

686
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.810
So we're aiming for qualitative insight and we'll know when we're right,

687
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.790
if we agree with experiment,

688
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.760
and also if we agree with what the computer predicts,

689
00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:17.640
even though the computer doesn't know why it predicted it,

690
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.950
it just grinds through and gets you a number.

691
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:25.350
But we want to understand why the computer gets that number.
Okay,

692
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.550
so let me just do one thing quickly here.
The pathological bonding,

693
00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:34.020
or let me let you go to your next class.
We'll do pathological bonding next time.
