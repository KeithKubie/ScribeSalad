00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.480
When we're in a relationship,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.940
one of the haunting thoughts that can
make us especially snappy and bitter

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.060
is the idea that if only we were single,
we would be a lot happier.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.620
We can be so conscious of
the troubles of our current lives,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.880
we are naturally drawn to look back
and remember the nicer aspects of solitude.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.416
We remember being able to
get up whenever we wanted;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.816
we recall not having to fret
about where we threw things.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.976
We remember how inoffensive
our own bad habits were,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
when we were the only ones to witness them.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.456
We recall not having to justify
our meal choices, however eccentric;

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.618
we could go out somewhere
and never tell anyone;

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.176
we could (when we felt like it)

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.176
work through till 2 a.m. without
being accused of being obsessive or cold.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.120
Though we were sometimes sad,
we could always hope for a better future.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.680
It was also fulfilling, in comparison with
the life we lead now.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.336
But memory is a hugely unreliable
and therefore, reckless instrument,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.816
which isn’t a small point,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.200
for our power of record has a huge impact
on how we assess our lives in the present.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.976
We are editors of genius,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.936
who know just enough about
how to romanticise our single days

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560
in order to poison our conjugal ones.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.776
Some of our ingratitude might be eroded.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.736
If long before we met anyone,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.776
a talented film-maker were charged with
making a close observational documentary

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.960
about our lives as single people.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.576
They’d capture our face at 5.30pm
on a winter Sunday afternoon,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.856
as the sun is setting

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080
and we know we’ll be alone till
we reach the office on Monday morning.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.696
They’d observe us looking across the room
at someone at a party

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.656
longing for their kindly face

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.120
but lacking any courage to
go up and address them.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.056
They’d capture us spending
a lot of time at our parents’ house,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.240
and growing increasingly
tetchy in their company.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.216
They’d show us struggling to know what
to do when the fridge stopped working

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.360
or we felt a terrible pain
in the middle of the night.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.120
We will ideally be required to view
this documentary at regular intervals,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.920
especially after a bruising fight
with our partner.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.456
It would provide crucial evidence,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.216
which our own memories are
so good at strategically omitting

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.080
of how less than ideal
the single state can be

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.856
We would realise that
though we are sad now,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.320
we were also very sad then.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.148
We would accept, with good grace
and touch of dark humour,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.840
that life simply gives us
few opportunities to be content.
