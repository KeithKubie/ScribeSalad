00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.410
- [Instructor] In this video
we're going to talk about

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.640
measuring public opinion.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.060
And the first question to ask yourself is,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.030
why would we even want to
measure public opinion?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.930
Well if we live in a democracy

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.190
where a public has a huge
influence on our government,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.700
well you wanna know what they think.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.070
And you could think about
the major institutions

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.790
in our democracy.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.480
You could think about
people who are in office,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.750
and they when they're making a decision,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.080
they would love to know what
the public actually thinks.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.580
One, they wanna act on
behalf of the public,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.060
and if they wanna get
reelected by the public,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.790
it might be in their interest to know

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.210
what the public thinks.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.750
If you're in the midst of an election

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.520
and you want to get elected,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.150
well you might wanna
know what does the public

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.990
think about you.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.480
You might wanna know what are your chances

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.313
of winning the election.

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:46.450
How are your competitors doing?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.390
Or maybe what position
should you highlight?

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.750
Or maybe which positions should you listen

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.810
to the public on?

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.450
Similarly if you're an interest group,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.560
where does the public
sit on different things

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.300
or how does their
opinion change over time?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.682
And a lot of what the media does

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:04.030
is help communicate to the people

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.190
what is going on broadly in our society,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.680
and that includes what the
people themselves are thinking.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.840
So now that we know that we
want to measure public opinion,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.770
what are the typical ways of doing so?

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.830
You have the idea of a mass survey.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.160
So this is a way of just
asking a lot of people,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.920
you wanna randomly sample and say,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.330
what do you think about some position?

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.110
What do you think about some social issue?

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.220
What do you think about
some law that is up

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.240
for being passed?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.290
What do you think about
some type of candidate?

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.440
Now the next three kinds of
polls we have listed here

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.770
you could view as related in a lot of ways

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.050
to mass surveys or even a more specialized

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.950
type of mass survey.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.620
You have the idea of a benchmark poll,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.820
and this is where at the
beginning of say a campaign,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.210
you see how people feel
about a certain issue

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.760
or a certain candidate
and then all future polls

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.830
you can compare to that benchmark.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.450
Entrance and exit polls,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.390
this is when people actually go to vote,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.630
when they're about to enter
into the voting booth,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.090
you ask 'em hey how are you going to vote

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.810
or right when they exit the voting booth,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.310
they ask you, how are did you vote.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.630
And people aren't obliged to tell exactly

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.915
what they did, but this
will give an indication

00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:19.283
of what is likely to be the
outcome of that election.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.530
Related to both of these is
the idea of a tracking poll.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.360
This is a situation where
you might ask people

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.410
at the beginning of
some type of a campaign,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.980
it could be a campaign for a candidate,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.110
it could be a campaign for a proposition,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.514
where this time you see okay
what percentage of people

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:36.490
are in favor of something.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.480
So this would be the percentage in favor.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.510
And this is time.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.280
And then you periodically keep asking

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.800
the same group of people how they feel

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.870
about that candidate or that issue.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.820
And so you're going to
be able to figure out

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.738
how people's opinions about
that candidate or issue

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:56.170
change over time.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.870
You're going to be able to track that.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.830
And then a more I guess
you could say focused way

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.480
of understanding public opinion

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.850
which might not be as
representative of the population

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.930
as a whole but allows you to
get more maybe more nuanced

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.100
then and more conversation
than these other four methods

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.430
would be a focus group.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.130
This is where you try to bring
in a representative sample

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.890
of five, 10, 15, 20 folks

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.630
and have a discussion with them

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.630
about what they care
about and why they care

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.420
about these things.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.030
So I will leave you there.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.340
In the next video,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.000
we'll talk about what
makes for a robust measure

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.370
of public opinion.
