I work with youth hockey
in the Seattle area.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.790
And our league has a number of
ice rinks where the kids play.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.500
So with that in mind,
I decided to build a simple app

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.930
that highlights all of the rinks
on a map and here it is.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.570
As I move around the map, you can
see pins for the different rinks.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.080
As I touch each pin, it highlights with
the name of that particular arena.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.490
This is Kent Valley.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.203
This is the ShoWare Center.

00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:27.080
Or if I zoom up here,
this is my home rink at Renton.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.860
I could, of course, put more information
in here, such as an address, or

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.330
even the dates that I need
to be there for a game.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.760
But for
now I'm just going to show the pins.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.620
Let's take a look at how to
build an app like this one.
