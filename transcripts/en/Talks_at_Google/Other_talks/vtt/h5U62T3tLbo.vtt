00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:07.420
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.128
- I've always seen
puzzles in everything.

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:11.130
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.140
Windows can be Braille.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.810
Cards and coins
can be Morse code.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.160
Magazines can be bar code.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.050
Puzzles are all around us.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.800
I see them everywhere, which
is why I started making them.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.160
I have thousands of
ideas for puzzles

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.290
that I can make
for you to solve.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.480
And in my other life,
I perform puzzles

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.440
that I hope you won't solve.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.490
In fact, at this very moment,
I am making a puzzle for you.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.860
But we'll get back to that.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.660
Puzzles and games have always
been a part of my life.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.110
I've played them, I've studied
them, and I've designed them.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.830
I've been using this workshop to
make something truly wonderful

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.420
for you.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.990
It's part puzzle, part illusion.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.820
And it's all going
to happen very soon.

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:17.360
So prepare to look carefully.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.800
Can you crack the code?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.900
Discover the key?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.020
Will you unlock the
mystery, or find out

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.650
you've been wrong all along?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.800
There are puzzles in
everything, which is why

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.990
I want to share them with you.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.590
Remember I said I was making
a puzzle for you right now?

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.560
It's this video
you just watched.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.620
Don't go any further if
you want to solve it.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.901
Go back, and see if you can
find the secret message.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:48.484
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:50.077
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:51.160
DAVID KWONG: Maybe we'll--

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.740
maybe we'll-- you can think
about it over the next half

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.710
an hour.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.830
And maybe we'll play
the reveal at the end,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.080
or you can go online
and figure it out.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080
It's so nice to be here.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.460
Thank you for having me.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.108
I'm both a magician
and a puzzle maker.

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.150
I've basically taken the
world's nerdiest hobbies

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.199
and combined them
into one career.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.490
But I think I'm in good
company, which is really nice.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.020
I'm going to speak, today, about
"The New York Times" crossword

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.210
puzzle, and puzzle making,
and do a little bit of magic

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.710
as well.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.840
Why not?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.440
And did anyone solve
last Sunday's crossword

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.640
in "The Times" by chance?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.880
Oh good, that's great.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.620
The 21 by 21 in the
Sunday magazine--

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.460
I thought I would talk
a little bit about how

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.305
this puzzle came together.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:41.680
So the crossword rules-- has
anyone ever actually written

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.908
a "New York Times"
crossword, or--

00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:44.950
have you had one printed?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.943
DAVID KWONG: Oh, that's amazing.

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:49.900
Awesome-- some fellow
colleagues here.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.760
What I love so much
about the crossword

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.070
is that you have all
these rules that you have

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.550
to obey, all these parameters.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.320
And the biggest
one, of course, is

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.240
the size of the grid, 15 by 15.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.780
Or if it's a Sunday,
it's a 21 by 21.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.490
You have to only have
three-letter words or longer.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.680
Two letters-- too easy.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.030
There are no unchecked squares.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.620
That's pretty self-explanatory.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.800
And that also means if you
have some weird crosswordy,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.900
some obscure trivia,
that you cross it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.690
with something that's accessible
that everybody knows, right?

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.190
You get into
trouble when there's

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.100
two pieces of trivia
that cross each other.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.900
And there's rotational symmetry.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.510
Most of the puzzles,
the black squares

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.735
are rotationally symmetric.

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:37.360
So next time you open
up the newspaper,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.950
you'll see that
the black squares--

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.440
if you flip it upside
down 180 degrees,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.750
the black squares will
be in the same places.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.230
We sometimes have vertical
symmetry, sometimes horizontal.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.080
All these rules can
be broken, which

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080
is the fun thing about
the crossword puzzle.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.280
And I'm going to show you
some of the famous ways

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.070
that people have
broken those rules.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.770
I think that the puzzle really
tests constructors' abilities

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.460
to be creative.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.820
Because 365 days a year,
there's a brand-new puzzle

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.170
that obeys these parameters.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.360
So how can we come up with a
new trick, a new little story

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.210
each time?

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.420
And that's what I
think is just so

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.550
incredible from the people
that are mailing them

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.810
in all the time.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.310
They're always
pushing the envelope,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.540
coming up with something new.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.890
So this was what
I first envisioned

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.630
for the Trivial-Pursuit-themed
crossword puzzle, which

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.310
is what this was.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.050
It was called "Trivial Matters."

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.520
And I wanted to take the colors
from the original Trivial

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.280
Pursuit set, the Genus
edition, and have

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.480
those relate to the answers.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.260
So the first one I thought that
I definitely had to include

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.927
was Dan Brown as the answer
to the literature category.

00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:54.760
Yellow, there was a
little more flexibility.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.280
There could be yellow
fever, Yellow Sea.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.950
Pink, I was going
to do something

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.210
like "Pretty in Pink," or "The
Pink Panther," Pink Floyd.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.660
Blue was always tough
for a geography clue.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.810
Blue diamonds was this
rare stone that I found.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.000
And I was going to clue it as,
"This precious South African

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.660
export--" something like that.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.360
Sports, I was inclined to
go with Syracuse's team

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.260
and mascot.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.790
So I originally had Otto the
Orange, that big, rotund mascot

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.980
of the Syracuse Orange.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.540
And then science and nature was
many, many options with green--

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.490
green peppers, which
I originally had.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.070
This was the first
grid that I submitted.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.490
And I'm only showing you this
because it was completely

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.480
rejected by Will Shortz, the
editor of the crossword puzzle,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.450
the guru of all things
puzzles, a great friend of mine

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.790
and mentor.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.000
And I did this five years ago.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.880
So he rejected it
five years ago.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.340
And every year or so, I would
take it out again and try

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.430
to find a new version of it.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.242
And in the last year,
I came up with--

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:05.950
well, let me tell you
why he rejected it.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.660
He rejected it
because he thought

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.140
blue diamonds was not-- nobody
would really know what that is.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.910
And he was right.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.860
No one knows what that is.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.790
Syracuse's mascot,
you can see, I'm

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.950
clueing it down
there are the bottom.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.490
Syracuse's mascot,
Otto the Orange,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.440
he thought nobody would
know what that is.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.990
And I think he's wrong still.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.910
I think that you could get--
you could figure that out.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.940
But I revamped things.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.350
And this is what I came up
with for the fourth time

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.000
around that I made this puzzle.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.320
Dan Brown, Yellow Sea,
"Pretty in Pink"--

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.970
the Blue Hen state is Delaware.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.740
Orange Bowl seemed
to work nicely.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.040
And then evergreen
was my science clue.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.200
And I knew that
I wanted it to be

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.310
in a circle in the
shape of the pie--

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.450
the wedge carrier
from Trivial Pursuit.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.015
So I knew it was going to look
something like this in a 21

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:05.740
by 21 grid.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.460
I didn't know exactly where
those pieces were going to go.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.630
And it ended up--

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.630
I ended up finding
the best distribution.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.530
And it looks like this.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.050
So what you're seeing
here is symmetry

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.110
with the theme answers,
right, and the black squares

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.500
subsequently, right?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.820
So Orange Bowl and
evergreen are together,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.010
Blue Hen state,
"Pretty in Pink,"

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.470
Dan Brown, and Yellow Sea.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.560
You can see that,
right here, you

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.140
can't have a one-letter answer.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.760
So I had to fill that in, right?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.020
So you start plotting
these things.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.710
And then you have to
obey all the rules.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.010
So this is the first
shape that it took.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.620
And then from
there, I knew that I

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.550
wanted to do "Mellow
Yellow," the Donovan tune,

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.950
as coming down like that.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:03.750
Now "orange man," getting back
to the Syracuse reference,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.040
there was a bunch of
things to play with there.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.940
But I ended up
choosing "orange man"

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.530
because of what crosses it.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.822
I'll show you in just a moment.

00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:17.200
And "I'm blue" was the--

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.020
was a R&amp;B song that worked--

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.100
rhythm and blues song
that worked there.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:28.390
So "Delaware nickname" is
what went across "orange man."

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.500
And that refers to-- that's
part of the clue for "Blue Hen

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.580
state."

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.230
Now there's a little
more flexibility

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.240
when I was composing
"Delaware nickname."

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.080
It could be "What
Delaware is known as"

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.370
or "nickname of Delaware."

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.340
But it was that
sort of negotiation

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.450
between that cross, that area,
which allowed me to settle

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.550
on "Delaware nickname."

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.800
And then similarly,
up at the top,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.430
"always has foliage" was a--

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.720
for a clue for evergreen--

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.710
was also a phrase that I could
mess around with a little bit.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.740
"Never loses leaves," it could
have been, something like that.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.670
But I-- going through
Tom and ending

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.530
in E for the "Mellow
Yellow," it seemed

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.490
to work really nicely
the way that worked out.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:24.430
And then you get
into weeks and weeks

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.830
of googling things and
looking on Wikipedia, finally,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.070
to get something that
clue Orange Bowl.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.050
I discovered that
the Oklahoma Sooners

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.570
have won the most Orange Bowls.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.090
And that went right
through Dan Brown.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.540
That's when the crossword gods
are smiling on you, right?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.670
But that could have
been anything from--

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.050
the clue for Orange Bowl--

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.920
I was looking at
all these teams.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.220
I could clued as "that
team that won in 1982."

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.720
And it could have
been another team.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.930
But that worked
out really nicely.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.730
And similarly,
"Japanese victory"

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.580
went through "Yellow Sea."

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.205
That could have been "off the
coast of China" or something.

00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:04.330
Again, I had a little bit--

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.680
I was able to play there.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.540
But then it got really
intense and concentrated

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.000
with the last crosses
of the theme answers.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.810
And that was clueing "Pretty
in Pink" with "high school"

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.750
through "Oklahoma Sooners"
and "Dan Brown's book

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.440
has a secret code."

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.900
So when you can cross
your theme answers,

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:31.720
you have a more sophisticated
and elegant puzzle,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.510
in my humble opinion.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.510
But that's something that took
five years to do, basically.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.400
On and off, as I'm
watching Netflix,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.950
I'm working on this thing.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.040
Now you have to put
in the black squares

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.750
into the crossword puzzle.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.580
Again, you have to
obey the constraints

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.083
of rotational symmetry, right?

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.750
Now what I'm going
to show you here is--

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.400
I just mocked this up.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.160
This would obey
rotational symmetry,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.190
but there are too many
black squares here.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.770
Because if you can
break the grid up

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:07.090
into so many tiny,
little chunks like this,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.710
it's too easy to make.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.252
This is not hard to fill.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:12.460
And you can do it by hand,
or you can use a computer.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.143
You can hit a button, and
it'll fill it in for you.

00:11:15.143 --> 00:11:16.060
I'll talk about that--

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.710
I'm sure you have questions
about that-- in a moment.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.010
But that is why there's
another constraint

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.500
on building a crossword puzzle,
which is that you can only

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.060
have so many words.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.300
So for a 21 by 21, you're only
allowed to have 140 words.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.160
So this would be way over that.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.490
For a daily 15 by 15,
I think it's 78 words.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.060
And it really is
the perfect balance.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.580
It's made challenging
for us and for you

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:52.690
guys to solve, because
140, it's really hard.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.156
You're always hovering
at about 142, 144.

00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:56.720
And you just want
to be done with it.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.110
But you're forced to take
some black squares away.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.800
And it's very hard to
fill in what's left over.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.290
So it's really the
perfect balance.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.860
This is what I ended up being,
the black square distribution

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.040
that I ended up.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.010
So what I'm doing
here is I'm carving up

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.680
the areas into little--

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.230
into areas that I can fill,
the sections and areas

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.340
that I can fill.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.740
I'm also putting black
squares in places

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.910
that allow me easier fill.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.440
So for example, let's see, I
want I wanted this area here

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.217
to start with the
letter V and not

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:33.550
have the V be the second
letter, so I put a black square

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.740
right there.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.990
I wanted-- what's another
good example of that?

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.750
Yes, I wanted this, also, to
start with a V it was easier

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.940
for there.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:50.320
And notice that I put "pinkie"
as the cross for "pink," right?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.090
"Pinkie's" the cross for pink.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.620
That's because I
didn't want it to be

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.070
related to the color pink.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.920
It could have been "pinker,"
or "pinked," or "pinkly" maybe.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.820
But the pinkie is so
far-removed from the color.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.190
Now I wasn't quite able to
do that for all of them.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.660
But "I'm blue" worked well,
because it's an emotion.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.750
"Tom Green," "Dan Brown,"
you're getting last names.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.810
So it makes it more fun,
rather than just have--

00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:28.910
what would be a bad example?

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.710
Orange-- orange
ball or something--

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.040
I don't know-- for basketball.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.500
So that was another
constraint I wanted.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.940
This was a very tough area
here-- blank, I, blank, E--

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.190
blank, I, blank,
blank, W. I think

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.650
that ended up being "sinew."

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.630
But that gave me
a lot of trouble.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.070
And this area here was the
most difficult area of all.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.850
Here's what the final fill
ended up looking like.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.950
And I included
"genus" down here--

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.750
I'm sorry, I have
preference to this side.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.478
I've been unfair to
this side over here--

00:14:10.478 --> 00:14:12.020
"genus" down here,
to reference, just

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.000
because there have been a lot
of Trivial Pursuit versions.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.542
And I wanted to be
able to say, these

00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:18.860
are the colors from this one.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.740
And this was the most
difficult version up here--

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.030
I mean, area up here.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.845
For those of you
that solved it, I

00:14:24.845 --> 00:14:26.720
don't know if you had
trouble with that area.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.630
But that was the most
difficult version.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.420
Here is what it was when
I first submitted it,

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.310
this revised version.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.190
And the editors-- and
there's a dialogue

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.220
between Will Shortz, and his
team, and the constructors.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.120
They felt that this
area was too hard.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.610
This is what I originally had.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.780
I cut off the Y here.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.720
But this was Denmark Vesey, the
leader of a slave rebellion,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.620
an American vet.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.610
And this is very
"crosswordese" here, E-V-A-H,

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.690
which is from a Cole Porter
tune, "Have You Evah"--

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.630
"Have You Evah,"
something like that.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.960
And test solvers were
not figuring it out.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.580
And they thought it
was too difficult.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.410
I had "Mister Blue," which
is another song, to go there.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.630
So they suggested that
I change it to this.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.610
They actually made this edit.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.710
And it became-- this is "vines."

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.210
I cut off the letter S.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.400
But still had "evah" in there.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.440
There wasn't really
any way around that.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:31.250
But they thought that "yecch"
was legitimate and gettable.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.440
It's whether or not
it's gettable, right?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.640
And through the crosses--

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.980
"Taipei" crosses that.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.150
"Civil" crosses that.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.480
You make those accessible so
people can get that answer.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.340
That whole area, we tried
to clue as easy as possible.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.990
And the answers which appeared
just in the magazine on Sunday

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.200
looked like this, which
was really lovely.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.080
So that is the
completed Sunday puzzle

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.460
that I made, five
years in the making.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.030
So standard tricks for
the crossword puzzle--

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:11.870
this would be like the tricks
in a letter change puzzle,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.930
as we call them.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.490
So you could have a title
of a puzzle, or a theme--

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.950
a revealer of the puzzle
might be, like, "take five."

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.800
I've seen this before a couple
times in "The New York Times."

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.380
Taking the letter V, the
Roman numeral V, removed--

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.490
take five.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.320
You could have-- this
was one I enjoyed

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.830
solving many years ago-- "crop
circles" was the revealer.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.440
And you were to take
out the letter O.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.550
Or you could add letters.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.748
Like, if your
revealer was "artoo,"

00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:39.290
you would add the
letter R. So that's

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.300
kind of a standard trick.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.620
Here's one that I made, which
was a letter change puzzle.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.760
It was-- here the
clues for the themers--

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.100
"what a person in an
emergency might have to make."

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.990
And then the revealer was this--

00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:00.180
"World War I novel hinted
at by the above," which

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.555
is "A Farewell to
Arms," which is

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:07.180
a nice-- we love it
when we find things

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:12.099
that are 15 letters
long, or 21 letters long.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.560
And this changed things
like "death warmed over."

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.430
You say farewell to the A-R-M,
and you get "death wed over."

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.410
You get these punny,
silly phrases.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.738
So this is a standard word--

00:17:23.738 --> 00:17:25.599
a letter substitution puzzle.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.220
So then I took it
one step further.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.637
Here's one of my
favorite puzzles.

00:17:28.637 --> 00:17:32.650
I co-authored this with
my friend Kevan Choset.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.380
And in 2007, which
seems like eons ago,

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.370
we did a puzzle in the Sunday
"Times" called Magic Words.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.610
And once again, the crossword
gods were shining down on us.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:48.040
Because a perfect 21 across
is-- does anyone know?

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.790
Close, yeah, it's
another utterance.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.450
It's "now you see
it, now you don't."

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.200
So "now you see it,
now you don't" gave me

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.770
not just taking letters away
or adding them, but doing both.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.300
So adding-- now you see it--

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.460
I-T to "Bing Crosby,"
you get the silly phrase,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.900
"biting Crosby."

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.020
if you're taking "it"
away from "Great Britain,"

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.520
you get "great brain."

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.220
And those are the long ones
that run across the grid

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.620
here, here, here, here.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.970
So "now you see it, now
you don't" was, I think,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:25.518
one of the first puzzles to do
both taking away and adding.

00:18:25.518 --> 00:18:26.810
Here's a puzzle I did not make.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.768
But I love it so much,
because I think it truly

00:18:28.768 --> 00:18:33.380
exemplifies how crossword
puzzlers are often

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.810
messing with the conventions
of the crossword.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.580
That's my favorite
thing, is we--

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.070
as a magician, I suppose--

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.420
is we take things that you
know so well, that you're

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.460
familiar with, and
then we subvert

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.800
it, which is why we use
a pack of playing cards.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.170
Because you all know what--

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.920
you hold those in your
hands all the time.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.045
You know what that's about.

00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:51.840
And then we do crazy
things with them.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.820
Start of the quote, all the
way through end of the quote,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.650
was revealed as--

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:02.690
the start of the quote
was the letter Q, which

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.670
is a British waiting line.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.970
The next part of the quote
is U, second person singular,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.910
Oprah Winfrey's magazine,
drink with jam and bread.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.680
And the end of the quote,
E, is worldwide web prefix.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.760
So I really loved that puzzle.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.903
The most famous
crossword, I think,

00:19:18.903 --> 00:19:21.320
that's ever been in "The New
York Times"-- and Will Shortz

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.450
will second this--

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:27.680
was from 1996, the election.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.730
And many of you are probably
familiar with this story.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.290
Jeremiah Ferrell
made this crossword.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.790
I don't think it'll
ever be rivaled.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.800
It's the best one ever.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.970
"Forecast," the answer
was "prognostication."

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:44.840
"Title," for 39 across,
which is right here,

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.000
was "Mr. President."

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.970
And this was published on
Tuesday, on election day.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.970
And people were calling
up "The New York Times,"

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.210
furious that even though Bill
Clinton was leading the polls,

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.800
that they would
call the election

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.330
in the crossword puzzle.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.290
But this is what we call
a Schrodinger puzzle,

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.730
meaning the cat is alive
or the cat is dead,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.300
meaning two things work.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.730
So "Clinton" and "Bob Dole"
both worked in this 39 across.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.070
"Clinton elected"-- so
"black Halloween animal"

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.860
was either "cat" or "bat."

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.690
This is a humor--
great, humorous, clever

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.090
one-- "provider of
support, for short"

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:29.300
was either "IRA,"
"Roth IRA," or "bra."

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.580
"Trumpet" was, perfectly,
"boast" or "blast" for 35 down.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.700
That is the greatest
puzzle, I think,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.890
"The Times" has ever seen.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:46.550
So another Sunday puzzle I had
with my pal Kevan Choset, once

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.020
again, was "Abridged Edition."

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:53.690
And this one was for all of
you fans of "Mad" magazine.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.230
And that was sort of given away.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.950
If you look closely, you
can see these dotted lines

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.650
that are running down
vertically in the puzzle.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.590
And this was the inside
back cover of "Mad" magazine

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.400
for over 50 years,
Al Jaffee's fold-in.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.710
Are you familiar with
that piece of artwork?

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.820
He's still doing it.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.630
He's in his 90s.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.850
It's incredible.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:20.760
And this puzzle folded the
right side over to the left,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.746
yielding a new--

00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:24.022
new answers.

00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:25.980
And where the dotted
lines were, you actually--

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.820
if you look closely,
the "B" and "T bones"

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.190
would line up with
the "A" and "C clamp,"

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.430
and the "B" in "Eberts,"
and the "A" in "straight."

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.850
And the instructions
down, vertically,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:43.020
were "fold pages so "A"
and "B" are lined up

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.390
in the top and bottom rows.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.840
I also was able to sneak in
"Mad magazine" into the middle.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.760
And that's what you get
on the right-hand side

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.640
when you fold it over
in the gray bands that

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.080
run across the grid.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.500
All of these, things, by the
way, are things that fold,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.200
that were revealed--
"lawn chair," "oragami."

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.460
"Poker hand" came from
"poke at" and "overhand."

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.890
You can see it gave
you "poker hand."

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.590
"Origin" and "a
French friend," "ami,"

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.450
gives you "origami"--
so all things that fold.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.310
Now this is the first
puzzle I ever had

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.860
in "The New York Times," which
was published on April Fool's

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.510
Day, which is like the nerdy
trophy for crossword puzzle

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.660
constructors.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.990
Again, I did it with
my friend Kevan.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.780
He thought it was so
devious that it not only had

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.280
to be April Fool's
Day, but also had

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.790
to be a Saturday, which is sort
of the confluence of all things

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.430
diabolical.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.520
"What some letters in this
puzzle seemingly have?"

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.530
The answer was "no place to
go," "overfloweth," and then

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.680
"outside the box"-- how you
must think to solve this puzzle.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.960
And you had to put
"think" inside the margins

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.180
of the newspaper for that
April Fool's Day puzzle.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.100
So that's many, many moons
ago, but I'm still proud of it.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.200
And I'll finish
with a last puzzle.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.290
And this is my favorite puzzle
that I ever had in "The Times."

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.270
And this was published
on a Halloween,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.520
which is the other time where
you get to be really tricky.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.850
"Things worth looking into"--

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.090
"things worth looking into"
was-- in the vertical,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.630
coming down, was "mirrors"--

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.220
"mirrors."

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.520
And then I messed around
with Universal Studios' roles

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.620
in four sections, right?

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.770
So you could take a look
and see that "mirrors" were

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.953
the things worth looking into.

00:23:36.953 --> 00:23:38.620
In the upper left-hand
corner, you had--

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.660
"Wolfman" was the answer to
that Universal Studios role.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.170
But then it was clued as--

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.150
8 "acloss" was clued as--

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:51.780
"Wolfman, in 23 down"
gives you "namflow,"

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.080
is "Wolfman" backwards, right?

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.110
Next, you have "monster,"
Frankenstein's monster,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.510
reflected in the
mirror, is "retsnom."

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.710
You had it with "phantom."

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.625
But then, in the bottom, you had
"Dracula with no reflection"--

00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:09.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:09.990
--"with no reflection."

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.770
So you have to imagine what
the blank grid looked like.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:19.350
The blank grid-- people were
seeing 44 down as eight letters

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.160
long--

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.930
or seven-- is that
seven letters long--

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.810
seven letters long, when
it was, in fact, only six.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.150
So it was clued as
"Pacific Northwest city."

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.440
I was trying to bait people
into writing in "Seattle."

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.710
56 down, "cap," was clued as
"half of graduation attire,"

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.060
which was kind of--

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.730
yeah.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.620
50 down was--

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.450
I was hoping they'd
get the S first.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.910
And it was clued as, I think,
"winter precipitation."

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.580
I was hoping to succor
people into putting "sleet."

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.710
But that's my favorite puzzle.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:56.250
And I think it kind of
messes with the conventions

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.520
of the puzzle so much,
which is what I like.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:05.620
So now, that's just
half of my career.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.010
Oh, the aha moment-- let me
speak a little bit about that

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.810
before I do a little magic.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.100
The aha moment is this moment
when you, as the solver,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.890
unlock the puzzle, and
you crack it, right?

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:23.010
And what happens in that moment
is a simultaneous thing, which

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.930
is you feel smart for
having cracked the puzzle,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.148
and at the same time, you also
respect the puzzle creator

00:25:30.148 --> 00:25:32.440
for having come up with
something clever to begin with.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.290
So that's the real sweet spot.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.410
But this mantra that I
take from Will Shortz

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.200
and I try to apply in
everything that I do

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.920
is that a good puzzle makes
the solver feel smart.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.080
And you could come up
with a uncrackable puzzle

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.490
that requires all
sorts of cipher keys.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.690
And finally, people get it.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.210
And they're like, ugh, that
was not-- that wasn't fun.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.820
That wasn't worth it.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.350
A good puzzle makes all
of you guys feel smart.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.843
And that's what I try to do
in my show, "The Enigmatist,"

00:26:04.843 --> 00:26:06.510
is involve everybody,
and getting people

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.060
to stand up if they
know the answer.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.560
And we're going to do a little
bit of that in just a moment.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.290
But I thought I would
have a little fun

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.925
with a pack of playing cards.

00:26:14.925 --> 00:26:16.050
You want to see some magic?

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.310
DAVID KWONG: Yeah?

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.510
OK, good.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.716
Me too.

00:26:20.716 --> 00:26:23.250
If you said no,
I'd be in trouble.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.240
I'm going to make it a
little more difficult

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.420
and have a number
of cards selected.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.535
So let's try it.

00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:30.660
Let's just do it like this.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.167
Can I just have you say
stop for me, please?

00:26:33.167 --> 00:26:34.500
OK, will you remember that card?

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.050
And people behind you
can remember it as well.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.050
OK, great.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.550
Hi.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.075
Do you mind playing?

00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:41.700
Do you mind saying
stop for me, please?

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.350
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.980
DAVID KWONG: OK,
remember that card.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.440
You guys remember
that card, yes?

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.200
Let's see, I'll get the
sides in just a moment here.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.580
Can you just say
stop for me, please?

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.290
OK, a little further
down, like that--

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.180
OK, good.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:55.680
Hi.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.708
Do you want to say stop for me?

00:26:57.708 --> 00:26:58.580
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.925
DAVID KWONG: OK, very good.

00:26:59.925 --> 00:27:00.425
Excellent.

00:27:00.425 --> 00:27:03.090
Did you guys see that?

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.610
Hi.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.980
Do you mind just staying
stop for me, please?

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.760
OK, right there-- you
guys remember that card.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.530
OK, excellent.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.090
So let's see.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.806
And let's try this.

00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:18.980
Do you mind just saying
your favorite card for me?

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.160
Do you have a favorite card?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.890
I'll use one more.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.057
AUDIENCE: Seven of diamonds.

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.620
DAVID KWONG: Seven
of diamonds, OK--

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.400
let's try this.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.992
I'm going to see
if I can get each

00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:27.200
and every one of these cards.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.890
I'm going to do this
up on the camera

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.497
here so you all can see
I'm an honest magician.

00:27:31.497 --> 00:27:34.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.550
OK, let's try this.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.840
Here we go.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.730
OK, so this is how
this is going to work.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.580
I'm going to ask you
what card you chose.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.200
If you tell me what
you chose, I'll

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.700
try to find it in
the deck of cards.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.130
So I'll try to do this in order.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.280
What card did you-- what
card are you thinking of?

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:51.800
What did you see?

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.770
AUDIENCE: Four of diamonds.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.062
DAVID KWONG: Four of diamonds--

00:27:54.062 --> 00:27:54.660
OK.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:03.240
So this is called a swivel cut.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.630
This is called a swivel
cut, just like this.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.270
Should be the four of diamonds.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.580
That's number one.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.855
Let's see here.

00:28:15.375 --> 00:28:19.050
Let's see who else--
what card did you have?

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.150
The nine of spades, OK.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.220
So this is a table
cut, just like that.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.430
So that would just be
the nine of spades.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.560
Thank you.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.280
Who else had one?

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.120
I've lost track.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.540
Are you the next person?

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.290
What did you have?

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.180
DAVID KWONG: You had
the two of clubs, OK--

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.050
two of clubs.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.210
This is me showing off.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.390
That's the two the clubs.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.550
OK.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.825
And what else do we have here?

00:28:48.825 --> 00:28:50.110
AUDIENCE: Three of hearts.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.730
DAVID KWONG: Three of
hearts-- three of hearts.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.245
If I-- I'll do this
up here like this.

00:28:56.245 --> 00:28:58.120
If I reach out like
this, watch what happens.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.050
I get one card right out
of the-- oh, three of--

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.780
I was so close.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.730
Three of spades--
I was so close.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.320
It was three of
hearts though, right?

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.195
Actually, I'll just--

00:29:05.195 --> 00:29:05.740
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.830
DAVID KWONG: Yeah?

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.590
I'll just change that
there-- three of hearts.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.410
Oh, now he's getting good, OK.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.920
OK, what else-- who--
what did you have?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.580
AUDIENCE: Six of clubs.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.020
DAVID KWONG: The six of clubs--

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.460
OK.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.820
Let's try it like this.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.500
If I take the Jack of diamonds,
watch what happens here.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.810
Right here on the table,
the Jack of diamond

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.200
should just change, like
that, to the six of clubs.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.340
OK.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.440
And what was your card?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.700
AUDIENCE: Seven of diamonds.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.350
DAVID KWONG: Seven of diamonds.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.400
All right, for the
seven of diamonds,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.108
you know what, I'll
do this center-stage.

00:29:42.108 --> 00:29:44.240
The seven of diamonds--

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.430
I will attempt to cut
the cards with one hand,

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.610
get one card to fly through the
air about 10 and a half times.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.757
And I'll catch it
here in my right hand.

00:29:54.757 --> 00:29:55.340
So here we go.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.100
For the-- seven of
diamonds is your card?

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.900
OK, check this out.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.470
It's the top.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.220
It pivots to the bottom.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.040
That's a one-handed swivel cut.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.570
And one card, like this, should
be, just like that, the seven

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.194
of diamonds.

00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:10.586
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:10.586 --> 00:30:13.840
Thank you.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.510
OK, so how about we
play some puzzles?

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.562
Let's do some puzzles.

00:30:18.562 --> 00:30:19.520
I brought some puzzles.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.610
I made some puzzles
just for you guys.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.120
If you know the answer,
just stand on up.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.260
And I'll call on you.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.790
And we'll have a
little bit of fun.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.190
So here's the first puzzle.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:39.130
If you know the answer,
just stand on up.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.690
All right, what is your name?

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:41.440
AUDIENCE: Patrick.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.120
DAVID KWONG: Patrick-- what
are you seeing here, Patrick?

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.020
AUDIENCE: Greek letters.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.603
DAVID KWONG: Greek
letters is correct.

00:30:45.603 --> 00:30:47.680
Where are the Greek
letters, Patrick?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.250
AUDIENCE: In
between [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.750
DAVID KWONG: They're in between
all the words, that's right.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.960
So the answer to puzzle
number one is Greek letters.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.220
You can see omega
there in the first one.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.360
Greek letters-- Patriot
Act has iota in it.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.920
Final phase has alpha.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.330
Bar hopping gives us rho.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:07.540
And we have phi, or
"fee" in steep hill.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.290
Nice job, Patrick.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.240
All right, next one--

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.500
Yeah.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.860
Little bit of misdirection
in these, right?

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.435
Next one-- stand up if
you know the answer.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.650
Who's missing?

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.590
Anyone know what world
we're playing in?

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.090
Yeah?

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.090
You know world we're in.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.300
OK.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.470
There's an added
constraint on top of that.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.165
You got it?

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:37.830
You don't got it?

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.773
Well, what's your name?

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:40.398
AUDIENCE: Eric.

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:42.398
DAVID KWONG: Eric, what
world are we playing in?

00:31:42.398 --> 00:31:44.360
AUDIENCE: I think they're
names of presidents.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.110
DAVID KWONG: Yep,
pretty much all of them.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.570
But there's another constraint.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.300
Where did these mostly
presidents appear?

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.460
Yes, which one's missing?

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] money?

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.410
DAVID KWONG: Yeah, it is.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:02.180
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure
if it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.430
DAVID KWONG: It's the $2 bill.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.513
We got Jackson right here.

00:32:04.513 --> 00:32:05.470
These are in order.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, so--

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.540
DAVID KWONG: So
who's on the $2 bill?

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.080
AUDIENCE: Jefferson.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.455
DAVID KWONG: Jefferson-- I
know I picked the obscure one,

00:32:10.455 --> 00:32:12.100
but well done, guys.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.060
Jefferson-- OK, good job.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.350
All right, next one--

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.470
a little bit of movie trivia.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:25.914
Feel free to tell me
which one is missing.

00:32:25.914 --> 00:32:27.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.337
DAVID KWONG: That's correct.

00:32:28.337 --> 00:32:31.552
Does anyone know
which one's missing?

00:32:31.552 --> 00:32:32.510
Well, what's your name?

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.400
AUDIENCE: Schre.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:33.900
Schre.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.692
DAVID KWONG: Schre?

00:32:34.692 --> 00:32:35.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.200
DAVID KWONG: What world
are we playing in?

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.310
AUDIENCE: Chinese.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.538
DAVID KWONG: The Chinese
zodiac, that's right.

00:32:40.538 --> 00:32:41.580
And which one is missing?

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.990
Anyone know?

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.770
No, we have goat somewhere.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.410
Because goat and
sheep, I think, are--

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.810
it's not-- a tiger-- yes, tiger.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:57.790
Not easy to find a
movie with a tiger.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.878
I had that Colin Farrell
movie at one point.

00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:00.670
What's that called?

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.730
DAVID KWONG: Yeah,
you can't use that,

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:08.390
because the dragon gets real
confusing when you do that.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.060
Yeah, that's a fun puzzle.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.830
Here's another one
in a similar vein.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:15.640
Can anyone tell me what
the answer is here?

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.050
So who do we have in the
upper-left hand corner?

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.950
Yes, Beethoven.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.780
And?

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.825
Uh-huh, and?

00:33:29.825 --> 00:33:30.325
Uh-huh.

00:33:30.325 --> 00:33:33.590
And then who is in
the lower right?

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.090
Yes.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.958
What's her real name?

00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:36.750
Stephanie Clifford.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.300
OK, that's your hint now.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:44.755
Yes, what's your name?

00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:45.380
AUDIENCE: Mike.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.170
They're all dogs.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.580
DAVID KWONG: Mike, yes,
they're all dogs, movie dogs,

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.180
Beethoven, Marley,
Bolt, and Clifford.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.140
All right.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:01.570
Oh yeah, Stephanie Clifford,
thank you for existing.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.700
What do these five
have in common?

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.510
Yes, that's right.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.218
What's your name?

00:34:05.218 --> 00:34:05.940
AUDIENCE: Eric.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.648
DAVID KWONG: Eric,
you got that so quick.

00:34:07.648 --> 00:34:09.400
They all are exclamat--
they all have

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.659
exclamation marks in their
titles-- have an exclamation.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:18.969
All right, and then last one--

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.230
last one.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.050
Which one is represented
by this question mark?

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.550
These are all albums--

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.600
songs from albums.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:32.639
Yeah.

00:34:41.116 --> 00:34:41.949
Oh, you're standing.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:42.850
Hi, I missed you, sorry.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:43.649
What's your name?

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:44.409
AUDIENCE: Chris.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.326
DAVID KWONG: Chris, what
do you think that is?

00:34:48.393 --> 00:34:49.409
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.409
DAVID KWONG: Well, what
world are we playing in?

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.210
AUDIENCE: Monopoly.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.409
DAVID KWONG: Yes, it's
the Monopoly board.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.978
Does anyone know what is to
the right of chance there?

00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:56.770
AUDIENCE: Oriental.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.350
DAVID KWONG: Oriental is
correct, Oriental Avenue.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.280
Amazing.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:09.540
All right, so I
want to know if--

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.310
there's something
in puzzling called

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:17.020
the meta puzzle, the answer
that synthesizes everything

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.530
together.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.640
I want to see if you
guys can figure out

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.192
what is the meta answer here.

00:35:25.192 --> 00:35:25.900
What's your name?

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.600
AUDIENCE: Masten.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:26.950
DAVID KWONG: Masten?

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:27.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.320
DAVID KWONG: Masten, go to town.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.477
What are you doing?

00:35:33.477 --> 00:35:35.962
AUDIENCE: The fourth
letter [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:41.553 --> 00:35:43.470
DAVID KWONG: And what
does that spell, Masten?

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.600
AUDIENCE: Enigma.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.560
DAVID KWONG: Enigma--

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.890
OK, thank you.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.260
Let's give her a
round of applause.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.330
Yes.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.800
Wow.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.180
I don't even know that happened.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:53.735
That's crazy.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.030
In a moment, I'm going
to answer some questions,

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.020
have a little
conversation with Tom.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.860
But I just wanted to say that
I'm doing this show called

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.380
"The Enigmatist" at the
High Line Hotel, which

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.970
is right around the corner.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.500
And it's a lot of this.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.980
First of all, you have to
solve an escape room to get in.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.720
It's not that hard.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.190
Everybody gets into the show.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.680
There are ample hints.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.510
We get a hundred people through
that room for each show.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.722
So it's not like you're
trapped in there forever.

00:36:25.722 --> 00:36:27.680
And there's a lot of
this, stand up if you know

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.570
the answer, a lot of illusions.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.070
But my favorite
thing about the show

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:37.050
is that it's also a story from
over 100 years ago from 1915.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.300
And I'm just going to quickly
show you the characters.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.540
George Fabian was this
super-rich Willy-Wonka-type

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.260
character who bought a 350--

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.590
acre estate in Geneva, Illinois.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.380
And he bought it
in the early 1900s.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.690
And he called it Riverbank.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.040
And it was-- this
is Riverbank Labs.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.710
It is the first ever
privately funded laboratory

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:04.730
in the United States.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.060
And Riverbank Labs still exists
in Geneva, Illinois, actually.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.800
He had a Japanese garden.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.580
He had alligators roaming the
property, a giant spiderweb

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.540
that guests would climb on.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.860
He had this windmill.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.280
And he had bears and zebras.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.850
And it was totally insane.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.270
But he brought together some
of the world's greatest minds,

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.670
scholars, and scientists.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.310
And two of the people
that he brought together

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.790
were Elizabeth and
William Friedman.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.650
And these two would end up being
America's first code breakers.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.110
These are the parents of
American cryptography.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:49.700
And it's all about their
journey from his crazy estate

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.910
to Washington, DC
and all the code

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.600
breaking they did
in the world wars.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.800
So if you like puzzles, and
code breaking, cryptography,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.690
and magic, please join
me at "The Enigmatist"

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.580
at the High Line Hotel.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.770
And I hope you enjoyed that.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.270
And I think we're going to have
a little conversation now as

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.750
well.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:06.250
Thank you.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:09.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:11.632 --> 00:38:12.590
TOM SMITH: Have a seat.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.110
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.920
TOM SMITH: And we'll
have Q&amp;A in just a sec.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.073
But maybe now we can get the
rest of the video that we--

00:38:21.073 --> 00:38:21.990
DAVID KWONG: Oh, yeah.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.170
TOM SMITH: --paused at
the beginning of the show.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.920
DAVID KWONG: Sure.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.587
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:25.587 --> 00:38:28.856
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.400
- Now that the answer to
the puzzle is Riverbank,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.950
what do you do with it?

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.180
I've hidden a second secret
message in this video,

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.690
but I'm not going to tell
you where to find it.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.220
And for those who do find
it, there's a fun surprise.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.790
Either way, looking forward
to seeing you at my show,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.900
"The Enigmatist."

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.860
Happy solving.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.140
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.720
DAVID KWONG: There is a
second puzzle hidden in there.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.670
And it leads to a web page with
many more puzzles to solve.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.790
And you can get on the
board of expert solvers

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.140
that we place on the website.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.160
I'm very easy to
find on social media

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.840
if you want any hints
on where to look.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.070
But puzzles lead to more
puzzles, lead to more puzzles.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.030
It's a crazy puzzle
party, people.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.030
TOM SMITH: And my wife
and I have seen the show.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.960
And we walked out with
the best kind of headache.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.510
It's really, really a fun show.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.010
DAVID KWONG: What
makes me different

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.410
from all other magicians--
or 99% of them--

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.265
is I don't pretend to have
superpowers in any way, right?

00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:53.440
I say, at the top of my
show, that it's all a puzzle.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.890
And if you figure it out, if
you can decode it, good for you.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.470
So feel free to discuss it
and try to figure things out.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.453
And I love that you're
already thinking about things.

00:40:02.453 --> 00:40:03.870
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any sympathy

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.180
at all for people who
just go insane not knowing

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.500
how you do these things?

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.490
Because I can't see
a show of magic.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:12.220
I just-- it bothers me a lot.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.002
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:16.002 --> 00:40:17.460
DAVID KWONG: I
don't have sympath--

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.300
no, I love that.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:26.460
I think-- what bothers me is
when people pretend, beyond

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.150
what occurs in the theater,
that it's real, you know?

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.120
So mind readers
and mentalists kind

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.600
of border a little bit,
for me, on what's not fair.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.790
And then when you get to
people that really cause

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.470
harm are the fortune tellers
and these spiritualists who

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.080
tell you, you don't have
to go to the hospital.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.070
I'm curing you of your cancer.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.210
I think that's not OK.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.370
But within the context of a
show, of a theatrical show,

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.340
if I'm going to
leave you puzzled,

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.393
I'm totally OK with that, yeah.

00:40:59.393 --> 00:41:01.560
AUDIENCE: I'm always amazed
at some of these puzzles

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.000
that you pull off.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.360
Going back to the "New
York Times" crossword,

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.110
a lot of people are
doing them online now.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.180
And I'm wondering how
that changes your approach

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.170
to making puzzles.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:10.870
Is it easier?

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:11.940
Is it more difficult?

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.610
Do you have to do
fewer things if people

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.110
don't like filling
in a rebus puzzle

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.610
online-- things like that.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.340
DAVID KWONG: That's
a great question,

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.030
because it doesn't
change my approach.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.390
I suppose I'm writing it for
the good old-fashioned paper

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.260
puzzle.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.270
There was some
criticism that came out

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.520
about my puzzle
last Sunday, which

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.670
is that the whole thing
was in order to reveal--

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.368
if you solved it online,
the colors popped up.

00:41:38.368 --> 00:41:40.410
And there was a little
music, and some animation,

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.515
and a little dance--

00:41:43.515 --> 00:41:45.220
that that was the
purpose of the puzzle.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.700
And it wasn't, you know?

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.360
You can do that on paper.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.210
You can write the word
"blue" in with your pen.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.270
If you happen to have colored
markers, that's more fun.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.830
But no, I think
solving has changed.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.180
People solve crazy fast
now on the computer.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:03.930
A friend of mine--

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.990
I've never seen someone
solve this fast.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.380
The Saturday puzzle,
which is the hardest,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.790
he solved in, like, two minutes
and eight seconds or something.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.440
And they're only
doing the acrosses.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.790
And it's just unbelievable.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.750
And I think the mini puzzle
is a great thing, also.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.240
It's kind of a gateway drug
to the crossword puzzle.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.490
So I'm sure a lot of
you guys do the mini.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.760
I think it's all good that
it's going digital, yeah.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.468
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:26.468 --> 00:42:27.434
DAVID KWONG: Thanks.

00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:29.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.870
So I'm attending the American
Crossword Puzzle Tournament--

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:33.110
DAVID KWONG: Nice.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.068
AUDIENCE: --next month
for the very first time,

00:42:35.068 --> 00:42:36.430
and I'm super nervous.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.540
So I'm curious if
you have any advice

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.170
or experience with
competitive puzzle solving.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:46.250
DAVID KWONG: I've been to
the ACPT many, many times.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.900
I've never competed.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.160
I hang out and have fun.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.580
And it's the warmest,
friendliest, nerdiest people

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.290
in crossword costumes.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.000
And there are fun
games and meals.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.520
And I've never competed,
because I'm actually

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.490
a better crossword
designer-- that's

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.240
my way of thinking--
than a solver.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.630
And I would get totally
trounced by these people

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.950
that can solve so fast.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.612
But there are
different brackets.

00:43:12.612 --> 00:43:14.300
And everybody finishes.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.610
And even if a Sunday
puzzle comes out

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.810
and it takes you an hour
to do it, no one cares.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.847
So you're going to
have the best time.

00:43:22.847 --> 00:43:23.555
It's in Stamford?

00:43:23.555 --> 00:43:24.243
Or is it--

00:43:24.243 --> 00:43:25.410
AUDIENCE: Stamford, I think.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.260
DAVID KWONG: Yeah,
yeah, that's great.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.160
I wish I could go.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.210
That's awesome.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.777
Have fun.

00:43:30.777 --> 00:43:31.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.765
This was amazing.

00:43:32.765 --> 00:43:34.487
I do crosswords, and
have been doing them

00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:35.570
for a couple of years now.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.150
And one of the things I'm
really impressed with by people

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.000
who do them a lot is
meta-crossword knowledge,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.430
like knowing these tricks,
remembering this puzzle

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.830
from 2017, and
quickly accessing it.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.410
Did that come naturally to you,
or did you develop that skill

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.200
at some point in the past,
basically knowing the tricks

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.340
people use and remembering that
there's this crossword three

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.290
years ago that did this
that's a useful thing

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.370
to use as an example?

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.620
DAVID KWONG: Yeah, I'm
thinking about it all the time.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.230
And I've done every puzzle,
every day, for over a decade.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.630
So I do remember
most of the-- when

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.210
I try to come up
with a new trick,

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.030
I do my research to see if
anyone else has done anything

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.530
like that.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.132
And I try to make it fresh,
and new, and different.

00:44:16.132 --> 00:44:17.840
Also, I think your
question applies a lot

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:22.910
to solving, which is that
it is a computational skill.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.770
And like Scrabble also, it's
actually not really a word

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.910
exercise.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.510
It's and the people that win
the ACPT, the crossword puzzle

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.280
tournament, are more
often than not--

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.020
because it's based on speed--

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.790
math and music people.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.700
And it's people's
abilities to draw

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:45.380
from a database of
knowledge and knowing,

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.510
when they see the word
"hero," that it's not

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.540
talking about Superman, but
probably a sandwich, you know?

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.440
And it's just, like,
pulling really fast.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.232
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:54.920
So just lots of
practice, it comes.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.130
DAVID KWONG: Yeah,
and when you love it--

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:56.220
AUDIENCE: Good answer.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.380
DAVID KWONG: When you love
something, you just know it.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:58.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sounds good.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.540
Thank you.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.900
DAVID KWONG: Yeah, thanks.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.400
I really like the
cryptic crosswords--

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:03.770
DAVID KWONG: Yes.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.010
AUDIENCE: --that are more
popular in UK and Australia.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:06.280
DAVID KWONG: Yeah.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.600
AUDIENCE: And I've been really
disappointed that there's not

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.860
so many cryptics--

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.280
DAVID KWONG: There's just--

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.640
AUDIENCE: --here.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.170
DAVID KWONG: --one a month, I
think, in "The New York Times."

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:11.830
AUDIENCE: Oh, really?

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:12.370
Oh, OK.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:13.078
DAVID KWONG: Yep.

00:45:13.078 --> 00:45:13.780
Yep.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.370
You can get it--

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:18.125
they must not print it.

00:45:18.125 --> 00:45:20.500
Will Shortz is going to be
mad at me if it isn't printed.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:20.980
I apologize.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.910
But it's certainly online.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.080
And I solve it
online once a month.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:23.620
AUDIENCE: Oh, beautiful.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.560
AUDIENCE: You can't do it in the
app, but you can do it online.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.790
AUDIENCE: Sundays.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.950
DAVID KWONG: Is it in
the Sunday magazine?

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:28.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:28.975
DAVID KWONG: Yep.

00:45:28.975 --> 00:45:30.550
It's sometimes in
the Sundays, great.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:31.500
AUDIENCE: Oh, cool, once
a month-- all right--

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:31.770
DAVID KWONG: "The Atlantic"--

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.490
AUDIENCE: --thank
you for helping.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:33.865
DAVID KWONG: --does
one, I think,

00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:35.540
that's quite well-renowned--

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.280
"The Atlantic."

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.230
But the cryptic is--

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.690
I think it's the best type
of word puzzle out there.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.190
AUDIENCE: Do you
make them yourself?

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:43.080
DAVID KWONG: I've
never made one.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.913
I've never made one.

00:45:43.913 --> 00:45:46.140
I struggle through them.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:52.180
It's a type of word puzzle
that, half of the phrase

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.300
is the answer, and the other
half of it is a wordplay clue--

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.045
wordplay for that, a
synonym of the answer.

00:46:00.045 --> 00:46:01.670
And you don't know
which side is which,

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.515
and it's a lot of fun, yeah.

00:46:03.515 --> 00:46:05.140
But yeah, "The Times"
has a great one--

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:05.820
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thanks.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.237
DAVID KWONG: --once
a month, yeah.

00:46:09.787 --> 00:46:11.870
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about your construction

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.460
and how you got your word list.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.487
Because I've been constructing,
and I thought a word list.

00:46:16.487 --> 00:46:18.320
And I find that there's
a lot of junk in it.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.125
It takes a lot of time to sift
through how much acceptable bad

00:46:22.125 --> 00:46:22.750
stuff you take.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.980
DAVID KWONG: Yeah.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.020
AUDIENCE: So I don't know
what your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.010
DAVID KWONG: I'm so glad
you asked that, because I

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.510
said I would come back to it.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:30.850
When it comes to making
a puzzle with a program,

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.410
and you hit Fill,
it's going to populate

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.930
it drawing from a word list.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.720
And it's just full of junk.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:44.450
So you have to sift through it,
and delete stuff, and change

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.900
the values to make more
interesting words and longer

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.030
phrases, give them higher value.

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.780
I'm always adding
things to the word list.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.610
I walk around, I have
this, like, radar

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.940
for 15-letter answers.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.415
So you know, "Crazy
Rich Asians"--

00:47:01.415 --> 00:47:03.290
15-- like, I'm going to
put that in a puzzle.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.426
Don't you dare put that
in puzzle before I do.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.930
So yeah, I'm always filling
it and taking it out.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:15.200
And then there are some
crossword puzzle constructors--

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.160
there's a small, little
consortium of people--

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.020
we can talk about
this if you email me--

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.940
where it's a shared list.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.090
And people are updating it.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.965
And then everyone's
downloading a fresh list.

00:47:25.965 --> 00:47:29.510
And I'm sure someone here could
come up with a really great way

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.600
to do that.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.668
But yeah, you have to--

00:47:32.668 --> 00:47:34.460
I don't know why the
default lists that you

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.730
buy are just full of garbage.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they
have so many words

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.860
that no one would
ever deem acceptable.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.290
And they're scored in such
a way that it's surprising

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:43.330
why it's scored so high.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.500
So like, I would--

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.250
and I was happy to buy
it, because there's

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.453
a lot of really good stuff.

00:47:47.453 --> 00:47:49.370
But I just hope that
there's something better.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:51.110
DAVID KWONG: It
gets you started.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:54.040
And the mark of a great
puzzle, the fill--

00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:00.470
the fill, is that it's
all good, you know?

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.380
And if you get some
bad stuff in there,

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.080
you have to peel back the whole
grid sometimes and start over,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.802
you know?

00:48:07.802 --> 00:48:08.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:09.260
DAVID KWONG: Yeah.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:11.390
TOM SMITH: OK, We're
getting short on time.

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.140
I know we can do
at least one more.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.503
Let's see if we can get two.

00:48:14.503 --> 00:48:15.920
AUDIENCE: So I
remember crosswords

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.850
before Wikipedia existed
or Google was a thing.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.520
And you know, you had
to think, or ask around,

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.870
ask your friends,
go to the library.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.410
Now we have Google
at our fingertips.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.980
How has it changed crosswords?

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:33.402
Have they become harder?

00:48:33.402 --> 00:48:34.985
DAVID KWONG: To solve
or to construct?

00:48:34.985 --> 00:48:36.020
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:39.800
DAVID KWONG: Yeah, well,
I'll say that, once again,

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.780
borrowing from our
great leader Will Shortz

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.880
that it is OK to look things up.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.420
It's OK to look up answers.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.355
It's not cheating, so to speak.

00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:49.730
You do whatever you have to
do to get through the puzzle,

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.640
and appreciate the
construction of the puzzle

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.340
and the trick of the puzzle.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.020
But yes, so you used
to have to-- there

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.175
was a crossword
dictionary, right?

00:49:00.175 --> 00:49:01.550
And you would look
up a key word.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:02.480
And there would be
all these things that

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.750
might be associated with it.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.480
And those all exist
online now as well.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.360
And I think searching has made
constructing a lot easier too.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.760
And there are some
fantastic sites out there

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.900
where, if you're
looking for a word that

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.360
has a Q in the third
position, you'd

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.420
put in question mark, question
mark, Q, and then asterisk,

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.190
perhaps, to just say any length.

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:26.980
And there's lots of
engines for that.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.550
AUDIENCE: Are there things that
you would put in today that you

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.520
wouldn't, perhaps, 20 years
ago, because you would think,

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.230
no one would possibly be
able to find this out?

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.260
DAVID KWONG: New words?

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.330
AUDIENCE: New clues,
new ways of things

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:43.070
that would be too difficult
before this all existed--

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.390
have they become harder?

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:45.390
DAVID KWONG: Harder to--

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.117
I don't follow, I'm sorry.

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:48.200
AUDIENCE: Harder because--

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.550
TOM SMITH: Are you
giving harder clues

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.150
because of the availability
of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.470
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.928
DAVID KWONG: Oh,
well that would be

00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:56.260
assuming that people are looking
things up for the answers.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:01.250
So no, I think that it
hasn't changed the approach.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:05.690
It still needs to be common
knowledge or trivia, yeah.

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.580
But constructing has
become a lot more fun.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.735
Because you can run--

00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:10.110
some of the best
constructors now

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:15.170
are running programs
to find words that

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.580
fit these patterns and things.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.350
And you wouldn't be able to
do that 20 years ago, yeah.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.430
Thanks.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.160
TOM SMITH: OK, with
that, we're going

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.370
to have to wrap things up.

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:24.100
DAVID KWONG: There's one
more, one more person.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.063
TOM SMITH: OK.

00:50:25.063 --> 00:50:26.480
DAVID KWONG:
Literally, that's it.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.740
As someone who looks for
puzzles, maybe, and crosswords,

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.857
your show, escape rooms, are
there events, recommendations,

00:50:34.857 --> 00:50:36.440
other places that
you continue to look

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.937
for new puzzles in your life?

00:50:38.937 --> 00:50:41.270
DAVID KWONG: I haven't done
any escape rooms in New York

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:42.562
yet, because I just moved here.

00:50:42.562 --> 00:50:45.500
So I'd welcome your suggestions.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.370
There are great puzzle hunts
that people put out once

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.550
a year, twice a year.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.003
Every Labor Day, I
shut down my life,

00:50:55.003 --> 00:50:57.170
and go over to my friend's
house for a long weekend,

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.273
and do Mark Halpin's
puzzle hunt.

00:50:59.273 --> 00:51:00.690
Happy to send me
that information.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:05.270
There are these beautifully
artfully designed puzzles

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.980
within puzzles within puzzles.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.460
The big thing is
MIT's mystery hunt,

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.090
which is over the Martin
Luther King weekend.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:13.680
And there are a
bunch of those also,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.550
other festivals that pop up.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.765
But yeah, I think--

00:51:17.765 --> 00:51:20.390
I'm happy to give you a list of
some of the best ones of those.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:21.090
AUDIENCE: Cool, appreciate it.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.330
Thank you.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:22.430
DAVID KWONG: OK, cool.

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.060
TOM SMITH: And let's give
David a big round of applause.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.060
Thank you for having me.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.010
[APPLAUSE]
