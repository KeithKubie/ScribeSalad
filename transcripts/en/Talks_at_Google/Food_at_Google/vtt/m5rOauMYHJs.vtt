00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.330
AMAR JOSHI: Please
welcome Vikas Khanna.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.410
VIKAS KHANNA: Hi.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.260
AMAR JOSHI: Nice to
have you at Google.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.060
Thank you for coming again.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.143
VIKAS KHANNA: My pleasure.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.750
Hi everyone.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.580
AMAR JOSHI: So
thanks for coming in.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.171
You are Google New
York's favorite chef, one

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.420
of the favorite chefs up here.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.772
VIKAS KHANNA:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:31.250
AMAR JOSHI: I bet, yeah, right?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.320
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm
so proud to be here.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.140
This is my third
time here I guess.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.120
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.285
VIKAS KHANNA: Two times I was
just cooking food for everyone.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:41.410
And both the times, it
happened to be Diwali, which

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.750
is the big Indian festival.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.060
So I'm proud to bring a
piece of homeland to America.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.950
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.530
So we also have food
today from your book.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.620
It's in Hemispheres at
2pm, so go eat that.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.670
So you've been in New
York for how many years?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.860
Like more than few--

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.600
VIKAS KHANNA: I came here
in 2000, December 2nd,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.210
don't count years.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.720
AMAR JOSHI: Well--

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.900
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm not
the best with that.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
But it's almost 16
years, 15 years?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.916
AMAR JOSHI: Do you call
yourself a New Yorker?

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:16.900
Like do you look at New
York as home or is it--

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.470
VIKAS KHANNA: I was reading
this British, some philosopher,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.430
who said that, you're
born out of darkness.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.820
And you come to the world.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330
Same thing happened to me when
I got off number 7 train, which

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850
came out of the tunnel.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.940
So I felt exactly the same.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.960
Everyone remembers
coming to New York City.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.780
The first stop, the moment that
came up, the first side walk,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.825
the first building they saw,
it's so real, it's like--

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:42.870
AMAR JOSHI: It's like
you're here finally.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.953
VIKAS KHANNA: You made it.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.660
AMAR JOSHI: Nice, yeah.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.460
So your new book, "Classic and
Contemporary Indian Dishes,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.820
Indian Harvest," tell
us something about why

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.654
you have a vegetarian book.

00:01:57.654 --> 00:01:59.070
It's all vegetarian
dishes, right?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.986
VIKAS KHANNA: These are
all vegetarian dishes.

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:03.840
It's a book by
Bloomsbury USA, and I'm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.180
very proud for this association.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.229
I think even the name
is very beautiful.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.230
It's about harvest.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.380
The most essentials of our life.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.980
It's something of
gratitude, it's

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.100
something about, something about
humanity in that word, harvest.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.760
I think something very powerful.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.990
And many of the tribal to
urban to suburban festivals

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.030
are always based on harvest.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.820
So we suggested that we
should call it harvest,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.030
as a word gratitude.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.210
So it's vegetarian because
I thought that there's

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.520
such a large market now.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.120
There's so much of awareness
of vegetarian food.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.890
I wouldn't say that it's a fad.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.490
It's here to stay.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.950
And it's great.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.070
That I, being an Indian
and being an Indian chef,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.877
that vegetarian is not like some
which you are like, you know.

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:54.335
I remember when we had eggs
for the first time in the home,

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:55.570
we didn't eat it.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.070
Our grandmother
wouldn't let us eat.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.340
She said, think about the hens.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.470
And I'm like, really, why?

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.330
You stole somebody's babies.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.880
I remember it's
like 1980 something.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.400
It's like so true in a way.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.700
But we never had, until I
was 17, I went to college.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.710
And I had, started
enjoying, and understanding

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.670
seafood and everything.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.420
Because where I come from,
it's only fried fish sometimes,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.340
if you're rich, and
you've saved money

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.360
on the first Sunday
of the month.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.790
But this is a
fantastic opportunity

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.849
to talk about the
culture through food.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.390
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah,
there's certainly--

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.806
VIKAS KHANNA:
That's what this is.

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:31.210
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, I think
this perception of vegetarian

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.270
being like a substitute,
like especially

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.310
in some Western culture,
that's like think--

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.472
looks like yours go a long
way in correcting that.

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:40.930
VIKAS KHANNA: It's
good that we can

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.221
talk about something different.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:42.970
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.261
VIKAS KHANNA: It's like not
just giving the market what

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:47.610
they want to consume.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.650
It is also giving
something which matters,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.860
something which is essential,
and something you believe in.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.420
And there's a dedication
page-- it says it all.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.670
I'm not a vegetarian at all.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.870
I eat everything.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.280
There's a page here that says
dedicated to all my gurus,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.830
who taught me how to
cook and roll breads.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.880
And most important, they
were all vegetarian.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.460
They truly showed me the
power of food and love.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.560
So this first page itself,
is like it's for me,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.890
this is not just a book.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.630
It's a dedication to all those
wrinkled hands, what I say.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.380
Who stood by me and kept no
secret from me in the kitchen.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.510
And without even
knowing that eventually

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.860
you'll be running
Junoon in New York.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.310
They did not.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.620
It's a big leap from
where I come from.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.630
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, so
speaking of Junoon, right,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.346
congratulations on winning your
fifth Michelin star, right?

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:40.220
Did I get that right?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.011
VIKAS KHANNA: Yeah.

00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:43.566
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:47.480
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, it's great
to be in that category, right?

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:51.490
VIKAS KHANNA: There are
too many great restaurants,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.090
and too many great Indian
chefs in the world.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.910
I'm proud to be part
of the fraternity.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.490
AMAR JOSHI: Nice, so what does
it take to earn a Michelin star

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.730
and keep it for five
years, and hopefully more?

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.070
VIKAS KHANNA: It's
like-- it's something

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.040
which is very strange that you
know-- In 1990, when I joined

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.490
college, my principal or the
people who gave me admission,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.406
said we will give you
admission on a condition

00:05:15.406 --> 00:05:17.790
that you're going to learn
English, which I actually

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.346
failed in the first semester.

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:21.420
And I think they forgot
about that condition,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.972
and they let me
go in the college.

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:25.430
But I read this magazine which
talked about Michelin stars.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.030
This is the first time I've
heard of a Michelin star.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.008
I had no idea about the
Michelin star also then.

00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:33.340
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.610
VIKAS KHANNA: But
and the last line

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.580
said that this is the glorified
kitchens of the world.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.300
Earn a Michelin
star and everything.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.030
And said unfortunately,
India, even

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.510
with such large
population, love for food,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.160
a chef would not
be able to get it.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.440
And I think that was a
very powerful last line

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.250
about someone telling a
child who's starting off

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.120
in the industry saying that you
will be exempt from the glory.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.160
And it was like, for me
it was like a very big--

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.270
that line was trapped
with me forever.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.440
I said once in my
lifetime I want to get it.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.670
And they call you.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.660
They call you in the afternoon.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.830
It's very difficult.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.960
I will not be able to
explain properly in English.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.480
If you're talking Punjabi,
I can explain right and left

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.180
what I was feeling that time.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.880
So they call you around 1
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.074
And I pick up the phone
and they said yes.

00:06:25.074 --> 00:06:26.490
I'm going from the
Michelin guide,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.280
we just want to-- And
I'm like, I was so numb.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.350
I didn't understand.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.300
Did I win it or
did I not win in?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.800
First time.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.450
So everybody's asking me
standing there, chef, what?

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.450
I said, I didn't understand
what she was saying.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.050
I was like, did
you get it or not?

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.157
But this is when the [INAUDIBLE]
was not, like you know now,

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:46.490
you can see the list right away.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.240
But we got it.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.260
It was-- I think no one should
be exempt from experimenting

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.850
with their life.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.710
AMAR JOSHI: It's nice that you
take on the challenge and--

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.626
VIKAS KHANNA: That movie's
really inspired me.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:02.290
It's funny to talk about
a rat at this stage.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.160
But Ratatouille
really inspired me.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.010
And that line about that a great
artist can come from anywhere.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.010
AMAR JOSHI: That's true.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.980
VIKAS KHANNA: It can
come from anywhere.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.350
But I also feel that coming
from humble background,

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.760
it's an amazing hunger
and you have 24 hours.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.610
And you don't take
a day for granted.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.780
Because you don't know
that this must be something

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.257
which is greater than you.

00:07:26.257 --> 00:07:27.465
AMAR JOSHI: That's inspiring.

00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:29.770
Thank you.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.100
So the menu at Junoon,
right, how is that,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.080
is that like completely,
did you think

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.040
about making creating a
completely Indian menu

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.501
or is this like sort of get
with the Western palate and--

00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:42.625
VIKAS KHANNA: It's as pure.

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:48.160
I think it's almost nine years--
nine or 10 years ago, when I

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.430
first met Mr. Rajesh Bhardwaj.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.990
He's the, I want to say
that he is the main brain.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.730
And I happen to
be on the journey.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.610
And it's fantastic when you
first talk about Indian food.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.530
And he kept telling one
thing, which was so,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.320
it was a very
powerful message what

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.680
he wanted to give the world.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.520
If you want to have a--
a fine dining restaurant

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.140
which serves Indian food, not
just an Indian restaurant.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.429
We want to give an experience
that the moment you

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.970
walk into a restaurant,
that you feel

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.970
that this is like the gravity of
Indian culture cuisine flavors.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.530
So you have to be
pure in your flavors.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.770
But you should also be evolving.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.250
It should always be evolving.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.980
There should always be something
new in your plate every time

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.770
you come in.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.030
There should always be
something new to be offered.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.309
Because that is what
New York is about.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.929
If you have to
survive here, you've

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.240
got to be re-inventive
all the time.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.850
So it's cuisine which is
totally Indian on the soul.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.810
But you might feel that it has
been presented in absolutely

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.932
new norms and new faces.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:55.640
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.040
Have you considered doing
some like, something

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.420
like Punjabi dhaba, upscale
restaurant you know?

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.610
VIKAS KHANNA: [SPEAKING PUNJABI]
Dhaba means a small kiosk.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.570
I've been running
it since I was 17.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.780
It's really interesting
that my father used to say

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.860
don't call it a business.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.090
Call it a charity.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.670
Because if somebody will
come to eat our food,

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.420
we'll be so happy, we'll
give them for free.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.910
And if somebody would
complain, we won't charge it.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.160
My dad would always be
like, when are you going

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.290
to learn how to make money?

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.340
It's like, I said you know, as
long as-- my grandmother would

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.350
always stand by me and
she said, as long as he's

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.060
happy in what he
does, it does not

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.510
make any difference otherwise.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.630
And I love that.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.060
It stuck with me.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.880
My first job was, of course, as
an apprentice in the kitchen.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.020
But it was also, my first
business was running a dhaba.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.490
In the backside of my house,
in a very narrow lane,

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.820
where only one car can come.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.880
But we did the best,
what we could do,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.990
in our ability of making
three, four dishes which

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.240
I knew how to cook.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.020
That's what.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.750
And charging 22 rupees.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.390
And whatever people can really
eat, it was all you can eat.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.444
So it was always like--

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:13.860
AMAR JOSHI: 20
rupees is 10 cent--

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.568
VIKAS KHANNA: 20 rupees
is like how much?

00:10:15.568 --> 00:10:17.732
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, it-- 40 cents.

00:10:17.732 --> 00:10:19.190
VIKAS KHANNA: 30
cents or 40 cents.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.975
So it was like
amazing that you'll

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:23.470
have people who will
say, oh, you know what, I

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.860
didn't enjoy the food so much.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.693
I couldn't eat much.

00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:27.400
And can you just
pack the rest for me?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.331
It's like, OK.

00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:32.140
But it was a great
training ground.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.870
People discount the
fact that starting small

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.790
is something that--
I'm telling you,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.950
even the next glorified
Indian chef, or anyone who'll

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.980
get the Michelin star, will come
from a very similar background

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.790
and belief, that it was
the little things you

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.190
learned while you were
doing the smallest of jobs.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.340
I still don't forget
my first [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.720
He bought 24 plates,
white plates.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.640
We got 23 chairs.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.650
It was crazy, when we had more
than 24 people to cook for,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.310
we'll have to go back and wash
the plate, and bring it back.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.090
So I'm just waiting for
somebody to finish fast, man.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.220
So that is the most
important training ground.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.325
Most important training
ground is to start.

00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:14.866
AMAR JOSHI: Invaluable
lessons there.

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:16.710
VIKAS KHANNA: Well, how
much you learn from there.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.043
And the kitchen was not covered.

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:20.680
We didn't have resources
to cover the kitchen.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.934
So every time it would
rain, it says like we--

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:26.100
AMAR JOSHI: Oh, by cover,
you mean a physical cover.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.300
VIKAS KHANNA:
There was no shade.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.400
OK, but want do you call?

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.180
Roof.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.679
There was no roof
on the kitchen.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:37.720
So everytime it would
rain, people find it very--

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.172
how can you have a kitchen?

00:11:39.172 --> 00:11:40.630
Yeah, the kitchen
was never covered

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.120
for the first few years.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.980
And the worst was
when you had to make

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.480
the breads in the tandoor
and it begin to rain.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.610
It's very clear visual.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.430
In the book, I write
about some stories.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.140
My mother or grandmother
would stand with an umbrella

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.920
near the tandoor.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.919
And they would protect me
from making the breads.

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:59.460
And so many times you feel the
initiative to-- my grandmother

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.400
would also say, save your face.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.160
Save your face.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.150
It's like, OK, I need
to go inside the tandoor

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.220
to get the bread out.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.360
No, take it out from far.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.060
Save your face.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.790
She was always
worried about that.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.040
That keeps you going.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.740
That keeps you going.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.750
That's the real you.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.850
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.359
So at Junoon, right, there's
a speciality spice room.

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:21.650
VIKAS KHANNA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.030
AMAR JOSHI: That's, for
me, that's the thing that

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.320
stood out in memory
from when we went there.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:26.820
It's--

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.900
VIKAS KHANNA: It's a spice
room, and you go down

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.650
in the restaurant,
there's a spice lounge,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.447
and there's a spice room.

00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:33.530
You'll see so many spices.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.800
But now I've become a
little bit more normal.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.560
I've become more empathetic.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560
I learned that.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.424
I've become more empathetic
to people's reaction

00:12:41.424 --> 00:12:43.340
towards telling them I
have a thousand spices.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.050
You freak people out.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.570
So now we have little, we
have more on display this

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:53.807
but a lot of spices we buy
from all over the world.

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.390
And my latest research,
which is going

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.160
to come a few years
from now, will

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.750
be about how the spices actually
grow from the flower stage

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.430
to the stage in
which we consume.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.230
So the spice room,
it's the essential.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.410
It is the soul of Indian food.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.620
And to have a masala room.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.839
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah.

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.630
VIKAS KHANNA: And I
feel that sometimes you

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.720
have so many people who
just come for the-- just

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.092
to see the spice room.

00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:18.800
And you should them
how you grind spices.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:26.980
And it's like life cannot be
just black pepper and salt.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.920
Shit.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.094
AMAR JOSHI: There's
definitely more to that.

00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:32.260
VIKAS KHANNA: But it's also
so very interesting when

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.593
you have a lot of Americans
who come to your restaurant,

00:13:34.593 --> 00:13:36.720
and they'll say, can you
pack the stuff for us?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.980
And I'll say, go
home and experiment.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.540
They had the
greatest things which

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.806
happened by nature to food.

00:13:43.806 --> 00:13:45.435
It's fantastic.

00:13:45.435 --> 00:13:47.310
AMAR JOSHI: Right, it's
like if you look back

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.004
at the explorers
who came to India,

00:13:50.004 --> 00:13:51.920
they originally came in
for the spices, right?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.545
It's like that was
the trade commodity.

00:13:53.545 --> 00:13:56.128
VIKAS KHANNA: And Indians are
no problem, it is on the street.

00:13:56.128 --> 00:13:57.270
Pick up the black pepper.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.100
It's like really?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.070
It's like black gold.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.500
It's more expensive-- and in
India, it grows everywhere.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.900
I think it's also, in the
book I do mention that, about

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.560
the fertility of soil, the
placement of the country.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.750
Imagine a country which
wears the crown of Himalayas.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.210
Himalayas, that one was right.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.030
Hima-- Himalayas.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.970
So imagine a country
which has a crown

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.460
of the mountains,
the grandeur of them,

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.150
just to protect
the soil literally.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.619
So I was reading this article
by this American person who

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:30.910
was researching on Indian soil.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.640
It said that it's amazing
that how much it's

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.790
covered with water on all
the sides, and on top,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.330
it has these grand mountains.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.010
It has every possible
climate in the world, which

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.895
makes the soil so fertile.

00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:47.794
So when you look at
Junoon, the only colors

00:14:47.794 --> 00:14:49.210
which you'll see
in the restaurant

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.250
are the pallet of
soils from India.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.940
It's so, so amazing
that I collect soils

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.070
from different regions
of the country.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.350
And they all look different.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.860
They became different.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.140
They grow different spices.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.610
But a lot of people they
control, they mistake, no.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.417
A lot of people mistake--
that's a big problem.

00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:11.625
Sometimes I have to remember
this tenses so that they

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:15.420
always right in grammar.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.190
Many people do not
understand this.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.610
Every time I repeat it,
it's going to be the same.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.500
And remember this
well-- every time

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:27.710
you look at Indian-- I'm going
to say it in my own language.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.220
Every time you
look at India, it's

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.197
not just the soil
which grows the spices.

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:32.530
There are too many more factors.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.700
It's the sun.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.290
It's the rain.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.492
It's the waters.

00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:36.200
It's the climate.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.890
It's the season.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.040
It's the nurturing.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.090
It's also the manpower.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.440
But water is the most
essential after sun.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.670
And then it's-- the soil
is continuously changing.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.750
And a lot of spices, like black
pepper, why it could not grow?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.740
Why it was so prized?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.140
Because I write in this
book about, I show it.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:02.500
Black pepper has this
amazing, natural phenomenon,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.490
nature's precision of
being water pollinated.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.360
It's like, OK, what's
the big deal, right?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.410
We would say.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.920
What pollinated means that the
first time the flower opens,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.730
it has the pollen, the
water or the raindrop

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.590
has to fall right on
that point to take

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.240
that pollen to the next flower.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.560
Imagine the precision of nature.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.470
Did I say it?

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.860
Did I explain it, book English?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.151
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, that's great.

00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:31.920
VIKAS KHANNA: So and
if it rains too much,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.878
you look at the leaves.

00:16:32.878 --> 00:16:36.460
They look like umbrellas
or what of black pepper.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.180
It's crazy.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.080
And if it's windy,
it does not work.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.440
You would not have the
pollen at the exact spot.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.550
If it rains too hard, the
water would not reach there.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.900
And the worst thing is, if
it does not rain exactly

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.730
at the same time,
you will not have

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.935
the pollination of back pepper.

00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:56.060
AMAR JOSHI: Wow, you can't
do that with irrigation.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.825
VIKAS KHANNA: No, I
should be less passionate

00:16:57.825 --> 00:16:58.780
when I talk like this.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.570
Looks like it's a possible
risk for my whole life.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.010
If the water drop, man!

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.720
It's like, what's
the big deal, man?

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.220
Get over it.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:11.280
It's like no, it's so-- it's
so-- OK, I'll be normal now.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.135
AMAR JOSHI: It's amazing how
much nature works to get--

00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:16.260
VIKAS KHANNA: And how much
research goes into this.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.910
It's like you're
talking about yeah, man.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:23.210
It's like, some of chefs,
you just can't get over it.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.329
And I've been to research star
anise in Vietnam last year.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:31.032
And it's crazy the
spices, which star anise

00:17:31.032 --> 00:17:32.800
also grows at our
[INAUDIBLE] that's

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.300
a Northeastern part of India.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.290
It is phenomenal how
this turns into the star

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.230
anise, the beautiful piece
of architecture by nature.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.390
That how much processes
it goes through.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.966
And again it's not
water pollinating.

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:50.240
OK, I will not talk
about it again now.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.050
AMAR JOSHI: I think
everyone's here

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.280
to see your passion about
food, and it's great.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.090
VIKAS KHANNA: It's crazy that
how nature has applied itself.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.210
It's so, and this is one of
the books in which I say,

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.430
you have to read
the last page first.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.720
So some people would know that I
host "Master Chef India," which

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.720
is like the biggest
cooking show in India.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.590
So we shoot at RK Studios.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.110
It's in Mumbai, a little
bit outside the main city.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.955
So I have told the main guards
that if somebody comes to meet

00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:24.790
me, you have to call me.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.880
So I go out, and I see
this woman sitting outside.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.650
She's of course
begging on the street.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.640
But I see her trying
to feed her daughter

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.462
a small piece of bread.

00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:37.170
And she's telling her
a story, and making

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.455
a little helicopter out of it.

00:18:38.455 --> 00:18:42.400
And it was so heavy for me too.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.480
And people are like, what's
the big deal about that.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.982
So I got so inspired, I wrote
a poem in my native language.

00:18:49.982 --> 00:18:51.190
AMAR JOSHI: Which is Punjabi?

00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:54.610
VIKAS KHANNA: And
then the editors

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.714
are banging their head,
like what is that?

00:18:57.714 --> 00:18:59.380
But I have some good
people I work with.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.740
So we did-- I wrote
a whole poetry

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.080
about the cycle of
nature, that how

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.040
that little piece of bread
which is swinging in the air,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.060
and with those imaginary
stories and sparrows,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.490
while she's telling the story.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.382
Can I read that?

00:19:12.382 --> 00:19:13.090
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.095
Yes please.

00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:15.803
VIKAS KHANNA: You're
going to say this is

00:19:15.803 --> 00:19:17.650
like, this is not my glasses.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.240
They're Rajesh's glasses though.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.050
I most of dropped them
somewhere in the kitchen.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.530
So this is how I want
the book to be read.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.290
"It takes a million
hands to feed a child.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.030
From the strong
hands that ploughs,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.180
to the precise hands that sew.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.620
From the loving hand
that waters, and waits

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.410
for the sprout to grow.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.740
From the nimble hand that cleans
to the rough hand the grinds.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.060
From the experienced hand that
backs to the vendor's hand

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.510
that binds.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.840
From the story hand that
kneads, to the practiced hand

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.070
that rolls.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.860
From the careful
hand that begins

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.780
to poke and notice our souls.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:05.200
And finally, to the
loving wrinkle hand,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.520
which gently breaks away a
little piece of bread and blows

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.300
cold air to make
it cool every day,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.740
and begin to tell the
folklore of imaginary sparrows

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.720
that flew afar, to the immortal
heroes, angels and fairies,

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.890
that live on a distant star.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.090
The mythical men who attain
magical strength when they eat.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.970
She ran after the
little princess

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.670
everywhere, still
holding the plate.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.480
Then a little mind that
travels a distant journey

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.300
and suddenly stops.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.250
A little morsel is
eaten completing

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.590
the journey of divine crops.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.060
Even the God's mother
also ran after them

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.260
for the sacred chase.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.400
A new sun brings a
new cycle of love,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.150
full of gratitude and grace.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.420
It takes a million
hands to feed a child."

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.100
AMAR JOSHI: Wow.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.597
VIKAS KHANNA: It's
brilliant, right?

00:20:56.597 --> 00:20:58.930
At my college, people said
if you don't pass in English,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.310
we are not going to
get you admission.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.840
AMAR JOSHI: This shows them.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.440
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm
writing poetry.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.820
I think that begin
the source, it

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:13.120
becomes a very humble source
for you to write literature.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:20.000
It becomes a source of not
making it look too large, not

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.540
making it too glorified,
not making it too glamorous,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.330
but to make it real and humble.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.410
To make it like the roots of a
cuisine of such an old culture

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:33.200
like India, belongs to those
little imaginary sparrows.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.280
I think it was like--
I mean, sometimes

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.950
you read this to your--
I read this to my mother.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.950
I wish I had a
camera to tape it.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.060
My mother was like, you
remember those stories?

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.160
I was like, no, mom, I don't
remember those stories.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.140
But that is how a culture
is in continuation.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.087
That is how the stories
pass on from one to another.

00:21:58.087 --> 00:21:59.920
AMAR JOSHI: Right, it
becomes a part of you.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.045
VIKAS KHANNA: And when
you're doing what we do here

00:22:02.045 --> 00:22:03.900
in America, we can't
disconnect ourselves

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.960
from the real truth,
the real truths

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.208
of the cuisine and the culture.

00:22:09.208 --> 00:22:09.916
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:10.632
Yeah.

00:22:10.632 --> 00:22:13.090
So that's where you get your
inspiration for all the books?

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.720
VIKAS KHANNA: Simplicity.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.011
AMAR JOSHI: So it's not just
your publisher pushing you

00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:20.470
to write two books every year?

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.350
He's looking at the publisher.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.060
VIKAS KHANNA: No, I
write what I feel.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.160
I can't be scripted.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.620
I have a very big problem.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.210
See?

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.650
I was scripted that line to
talk about, even sometimes

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.610
the restaurant, I've been
scripted what to say,

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.720
I can't say it.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.410
It becomes very hard for me
to explain something which is

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.540
organic and which is internal.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.540
It is not scripted.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.000
It can't be.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.350
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.890
So in the process of coming up
with the book or a new dish,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.830
right, how do you weigh
innovation versus tradition

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.640
as in you know
this formula, dish,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.019
and then how do you make
it more presentable?

00:23:00.019 --> 00:23:02.185
VIKAS KHANNA: Amar, you
think I believe in formulas?

00:23:02.185 --> 00:23:03.040
AMAR JOSHI: Well, exactly.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.920
No, not formulas.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.460
But what's your
creative process like?

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.976
VIKAS KHANNA: Creative
process is extremely simple.

00:23:08.976 --> 00:23:10.850
People try to make a
very big deal out of it.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.002
It is not.

00:23:12.002 --> 00:23:12.870
It is not.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.917
It's just food.

00:23:14.917 --> 00:23:17.250
And you know, I said something
which was like little bit

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.840
off-- should be off
the records actually.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.247
It's like when
people having dinner,

00:23:23.247 --> 00:23:25.330
and said this is one of
the best meals of my life,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.900
people tell you at Junoon.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:32.870
So I always interrupt and
say that food doesn't matter.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.790
Food doesn't matter.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.970
It's the people you're
having dinner with.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.700
AMAR JOSHI: That's true.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.440
VIKAS KHANNA: Well,
it was off the record.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:48.170
But it's like really, like
how much work goes into it?

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.800
We adjust the backdrop.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.510
We adjust the furniture.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.010
And I'm not talking
about the chair.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.480
I'm talking about you.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.700
The food is the backdrop.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.720
It's the people.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.290
It's that energy.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.060
It's that moment.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.460
Restaurants will come,
and restaurants will go.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.734
It's such a transient world.

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:06.150
There was something
before Junoon.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.640
There's something after Junoon.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.677
That's the true.

00:24:10.677 --> 00:24:12.010
I'm a big follow the Dalai Lama.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.230
That's why I say that.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.230
But it's that moment that you
spend there in that restaurant

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.410
and said, do you
remember my 21st birthday

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.180
when the chef actually
got the cake out?

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.649
Do you remember that moment
when we had that dinner?

00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:25.190
You remember?

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.620
Oh my god, I miss
my grandmother.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.460
You remember the last
meal we had with her?

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.390
It was at Junoon.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:36.040
My publisher, because of
whom this book is there.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.104
Mr.-- talk or something.

00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:41.020
AMAR JOSHI: All right.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.700
So you mentioned the
Dalai Lama, right?

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.115
You wrote a book about
him on his 80th birthday.

00:24:46.115 --> 00:24:46.906
VIKAS KHANNA: Yeah.

00:24:46.906 --> 00:24:47.270
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.280
What was it called?

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.060
"Timeless Legacy."

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.580
VIKAS KHANNA: Oh my god!

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.210
It was such an
amazing experience.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.246
I made a cake for him.

00:24:53.246 --> 00:24:54.620
I'm not going to
get too excited.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.703
I want to say it normally.

00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:57.755
I made a cake for him
from his native breads

00:24:57.755 --> 00:24:58.820
from his hometown.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.290
I lived in Tibet.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:04.210
So I can make like almost
16 different breads

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.440
of Tibetan culture.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.800
Totally different.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.660
So I made this bread,
I made it very thin.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.560
And I made like layers of cake.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.870
So I wanted to get 80
layers in that one cake.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.320
So 80 years.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.360
I couldn't do that because it
was becoming like this big.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.820
I'm wondering how
he's going cut it now.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.540
So I made only like,
almost like 14 layers.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.410
So and I take it to him.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.220
You'd be surprising
when you hear this.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.590
So I put 80 candles on him
and I said his holiness,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.587
it's your 80th birthday,
and I want you to cut that.

00:25:33.587 --> 00:25:35.920
So I'm sitting there and I'm
waiting like him, that he's

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.250
going to blow the candles.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.400
So I said, and you don't
instruct people of that status,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.290
that blow the candles!

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.280
Make a wish.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.930
So and he's there.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.570
And it's one of the
very powerful moments.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.990
So candles are burning, and
he starts taking the candles,

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.026
and starts putting
them on the side.

00:25:54.026 --> 00:25:55.980
So I'm like, I
just looked at him.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.330
I said, did you make a wish?

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.220
He's saying, in my culture,
you don't cut somebody's life

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.410
off to wish for a longer life.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.470
I can't cut the
life of this candle

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.580
so that I can wish
for my long life.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.830
I thought--

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.630
[SPEAKING PUNJABI]

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.940
Sorry, how did he
think about this?

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.580
I would have never even
would've cared that you just

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.940
cut the life of that candle.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.290
It was amazing.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:30.320
And what was the greatest
part was on social media,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.150
I post a lot of stuff every day.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.180
Wrong English.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.646
I put something.

00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:36.020
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah,
just a plug in.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.020
You should all follow
him on social media.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.960
He's great.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.472
[SPEAKING PUNJABI]

00:26:41.472 --> 00:26:42.930
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm
not promoting it.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.980
But then I'll have
somebody, JR or somebody

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.850
is like you should consult
with us or when you write,

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.280
it's totally wrong English.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.150
And then say, OK,
people liked it.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.980
For what?

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.480
So I put it on
social media that I'm

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.230
meeting his holiness
on his 80th birthday,

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.710
and I want you to ask
any questions to him.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.650
So there's going
to be 80 questions.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.000
You would be amazed by the
amount of questions we got.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
And my favorite question
was, do you ever wear jeans?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.420
A little kid asked from school.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.300
And American kids can be so--
they can think so openly.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.630
It's amazing.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.330
And he asked do you
ever wear jeans?

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.590
So I asked his holiness,
the first question was

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.320
do you have a driver's license?

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.020
And he says no.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.240
I says me too.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.080
I didn't know how react to that.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.120
And then I asked him,
do you ever wear jeans?

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.740
He says that, and
he just kept quiet.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.430
I said is the yes or is that no,
because I'm writing it kind of.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.190
I was behaving like an
Oprah moment for my life.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.370
And he said that I
would pants one time.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.190
And he had to leave Tibet.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.800
They had to-- he
had to disguise.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.010
And he said that when I
reached the Indian borders,

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:58.120
he said there was a Sikh
guy who was standing there.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.510
And I was getting a pant.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.360
That's all I remember.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.314
And I left my country.

00:28:04.314 --> 00:28:09.240
I'm like, oh my god,
this man is brilliant.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.700
And I love him, not because
he say about religion.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.950
He talks about something,
that you don't need religion

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:14.980
if you educate them.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.850
And I love that.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.567
He's such-- and he
loves scientists.

00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:23.650
More than anything else,
he says I love scientists

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.010
because they give you facts.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.402
They don't misguide you.

00:28:26.402 --> 00:28:27.860
They're trying to
find the research

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.600
of the true cycle of nature.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.960
And I'm like, I'm your big fan.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.970
Can I tell you that?

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.870
But I was really star
struck talking to him.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.370
And he didn't
understand my English.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.320
Neither did I
understand his English.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.746
So it was OK.

00:28:39.746 --> 00:28:41.995
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, some say
he's like an eight-year-old

00:28:41.995 --> 00:28:43.510
in an 80-year-old body.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.940
VIKAS KHANNA: He is beautiful.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.980
And there was once
intense, I asked him about,

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.870
was that, about mother.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.690
And it is like, and
the photographer, I

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.042
told him don't click picture at
this time, because both of us

00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:01.500
were almost on the
verge of crying.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.460
And he's saying that's
from where the child gets

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.680
the compassion from.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.460
That's as sacred as the soil.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.270
And here it is.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.980
AMAR JOSHI: That's beautiful.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.982
So your mother,
your grandmother,

00:29:15.982 --> 00:29:18.440
you've mentioned that they are
big influences in your life,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.940
right?

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.850
Did you learn cooking
from your grandmother?

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.730
How was it, like
growing up in India?

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.770
Did you have a
garden or a house?

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.186
VIKAS KHANNA: We
had a small piece

00:29:27.186 --> 00:29:30.060
of-- back of the house,
a small strip of soil,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.620
in which I would try
to think that I'm going

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.520
to be a farmer when I grow up.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.160
So I'll try to grow
everything there.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.300
And we had a small
container, a brass container.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.740
A lot of Indians of my
generation will relate to that.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.190
You people are three, four
generations younger than me.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.880
But it was a small
container of cardamom.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.640
And I loved cardamom.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.600
But cardamom will
not be used in food.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.780
I know that's a
very strong comment.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.840
Because it was very expensive.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.620
So only when the son-in-law
will be coming home,

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.390
the rice pudding will be
made with one cardamom.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:06.080
And somehow it just
lands up on his bowl.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.740
Right on top of his bowl.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.380
And I'm like waiting for him.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.720
I said, and didn't
care about cardamom.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.280
And I'm the one
who's watching it.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.580
So I'll try to steal it
after they're finished.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.410
And I'll try to go
and sew in the soil,

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.000
in the back of my garden,
expecting that one day,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.670
I'm going to have
a cardamom tree.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.400
See, we were born in
non-google, again Google office,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.880
we were born in
non-google world.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.420
So we didn't know how
cardamom plant looked like.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.060
Now you can ask Google anything.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.810
Back then I didn't
know how cardamom grew,

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.790
and how it happened.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.560
So I write a story
here in this book.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.590
It says will cardamom grow?

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.680
And it is the honest
truth about nature.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.410
Is that it says that
will cardamom grow?

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.506
And I write about
that it never grew.

00:30:47.506 --> 00:30:49.130
I would come, back
running from school,

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.200
searching that I would
have a cardamom plant.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.150
It never grew.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.500
So my garden was
as failure as me.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.109
Nothing grew there.

00:30:57.109 --> 00:30:59.150
AMAR JOSHI: I bet a lot
of people would disagree.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.070
VIKAS KHANNA: But
I would pretend.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.250
We had a tomatoes one time.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.890
I'll never forget.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.264
We had a tomato, and we got
so excited, me and my sister,

00:31:04.264 --> 00:31:06.180
we kept touching it
and it fell down.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.214
So it actually never grew.

00:31:09.214 --> 00:31:10.380
AMAR JOSHI: Your excitement.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.080
VIKAS KHANNA: It's like the
homemade ice cream, you know?

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.664
Homemade ice cream
never freezes.

00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:15.580
Because every child wants
to go in the freezer

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.970
and check if it's ready.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.410
So eventually you
get to drink that.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.280
It's like same thing
when people like us

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280
when you try to farming.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.110
And we have one crop coming out.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.720
We all touching that crop
all the time that it dies.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.490
It's like, guys, leave me alone.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.350
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.760
So tell us something
about how you started off

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.710
as-- before Junoon, your
career as a restauranter.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.640
Things that worked out,
things that did not,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.135
I find those things
very inspiring.

00:31:46.135 --> 00:31:47.640
You have a great story.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.710
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm
still work in progress.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.009
I think it's OK.

00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:54.550
This country was
based on resilience.

00:31:56.924 --> 00:31:58.340
This country teaches
you something

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.990
which is called not giving up.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.190
And failing is OK.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.442
Not a big deal.

00:32:05.442 --> 00:32:06.775
I've been a failure all my life.

00:32:06.775 --> 00:32:09.010
So It's like it didn't
even affect me when

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.400
we used to close a restaurant.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.570
It's like OK.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.410
But one thing would
always hurt you,

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.510
that little thing back
when somebody told you

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.930
that you can't do it.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.030
You somehow felt that
you lost yourself.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.300
That's a big defeat.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.000
And one day, we kept working.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.850
I was working in this restaurant
called Spice Root at the Loot

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.010
Palace on Fulton Street.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.940
I get a call from the
producer, Gordon Ramsay.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.790
And they said we
want you on the show.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.920
And I go there.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.500
And it was an
amazing experience.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.200
Everything I spoke in English
was translated in English.

00:32:53.989 --> 00:32:56.030
It's like, great, what
language were you talking?

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:59.890
I said, I was also
trying to speak English.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.790
So I said, we are in
the middle of Manhattan.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.930
And we can do it here.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.490
And it was written, V are
in the middle of Manhattan.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.540
V can do it here.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.050
So I'm like, oh god,
this is amazing.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.359
I told my dad I did a
show with Gordon Ramsey.

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:14.650
And he says, he speaks Punjabi?

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.830
And I was like, no, I
did the show in English.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.510
He said, you can speak English?

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.520
I was like, kind of.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.000
I'm working very hard to learn.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.210
But later you realize that
communication, failure,

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.540
everything is not important.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.990
It's a matter of heart.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.810
I'm starting a very good museum
in India, about Indian dishes

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.330
and utensils and how you know?

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.870
Because India has everything,
from the Portuguese,

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:48.002
to Dutch, to French, to Mongols,
to native Indian, intertribal.

00:33:48.002 --> 00:33:48.960
There's so many dishes.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.000
So much of India is infinity.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.440
So last week, there was a
big shipment of my plates.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.600
I'm obsessed.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.565
Junoon is the right name.

00:34:03.565 --> 00:34:04.940
AMAR JOSHI: You
got to have that.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.773
VIKAS KHANNA: It's like
so many plates which

00:34:06.773 --> 00:34:09.820
been to the college where
we are doing this museum,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.590
they all broke.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.940
All these plates.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.179
Hundreds of years old plates.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.260
Everything crushed.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.520
So I called Rajesh in the middle
of the night, freaking out,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.371
all the plates.

00:34:21.371 --> 00:34:23.870
And he's like, well, did you
take insurance on the delivery?

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.020
I said, no, I didn't
ask for that thing.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.290
So later I realize, and
hung up the phone with him,

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.280
I totally was in a
fit for some time.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.070
It was like I give a piece
of my life to something

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.425
and it just crashed.

00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:41.340
And nobody would witness that
piece of history, what I had.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.284
Had painted work
and amazing, one

00:34:44.284 --> 00:34:46.080
of the first plates
which must be literally

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.130
created in India by some of
the immigrants and everything.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.050
The Jewish plates.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.449
And we had a plate, a
Passover plate I had,

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:55.760
which is one of the
oldest Passover plate.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.730
India has the
oldest living Jews.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.730
They were one of the
first immigrants to India.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.270
Their plates, everybody who
trusted me with their heritage

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.100
and gave it to me, I broke.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.790
Later I wrote a message
to my principal,

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.350
saying that they
were just plates.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.030
Life is actually
the matter of heart,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.486
as long as the
heart doesn't break.

00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:20.040
So even if you feel, it's OK, as
long your heart doesn't break.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.810
Breaking of the
heart is a big deal.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:26.810
I'm not saying it as a chef,
or an emotional Indian,

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.610
I'm seeing it as
an honest person

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:33.610
who says that sometimes it's
that unbroken heart which

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.900
makes you go on and on.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.900
And you don't see night.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.500
You don't see 24 hours.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.520
My watch doesn't work.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.190
A lot of people know that.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.235
To work with me,
it's always 12:15.

00:35:44.235 --> 00:35:45.680
It's always 12:15.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.120
That's the time I
landed in New York.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.242
It's a matter of heart.

00:35:51.242 --> 00:35:52.960
AMAR JOSHI: Wow, thank you.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.180
Very inspiring.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.190
VIKAS KHANNA: Feeling is good.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.410
Poverty teaches you a lot.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:02.610
There's nothing more which
you are taught in colleges

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.877
and everything than poverty.

00:36:04.877 --> 00:36:06.460
Poverty turned me
into a photographer.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.460
I took most of the
pictures myself.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.280
Because it was so expensive
to get photographers on board,

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.620
and to be cooking at their pace.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.274
And they're like, man,
we are getting late.

00:36:15.274 --> 00:36:16.690
Eight hours are
going to get over.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.970
The food is not ready.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.770
And you could rush the
food and the food burnt,

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.270
so you learned how
to take pictures.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.744
But that extended forward.

00:36:23.744 --> 00:36:24.910
You couldn't afford editors.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.500
You started writing yourself.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.760
And then you met somebody so
fantastic like [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.220
from Lake [INAUDIBLE] that
everybody can write English.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.770
But not everybody
can tell a story.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.530
So it's all good, as long
as the heart doesn't break.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.396
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:36:42.396 --> 00:36:43.440
All right, next question.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.595
I don't know how to
follow up on that.

00:36:45.595 --> 00:36:47.470
VIKAS KHANNA: See, I
have remembered answers.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.150
Of whatever question
you ask, doesn't matter.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.910
I'm going to give the
answer what I remember.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:51.743
What I've memorized.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.720
AMAR JOSHI: You worked
with Gordon Ramsey.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.580
You've been on Martha
Stewart, Bobby Flay,

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.830
and now you're a judge on
"Master Chef India," right?

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.495
VIKAS KHANNA: I
was many shows ago.

00:37:05.495 --> 00:37:07.230
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah, so
and also one more--

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.990
VIKAS KHANNA: "Twist of Taste."

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:09.198
AMAR JOSHI: "Twist of Taste."

00:37:09.198 --> 00:37:13.260
So how does that TV
experience, the glamour life?

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.900
VIKAS KHANNA: Oh,
TV's very funny.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.860
TV's really funny.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.270
TV doesn't-- TV
has its own brain.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.180
Camera has its own brain.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.780
So when I go for the first time
for audition of "Master Chef

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.580
India," they were like, is he
really coming from America?

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.100
He doesn't have an accent.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.430
We thought he'd be.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.340
And my Hindi's also
not real Hindi.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.689
It's Punjabi.

00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:37.980
And I think I'm speaking Hindi.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.810
And this happens to
everybody in my family.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:46.740
So and it was funny that you had
to really work very hard, very

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.710
hard to make sure
what you're trying

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.557
to explain within that duration
of time, that you explained.

00:37:53.557 --> 00:37:56.140
So many times I'll get excited,
I wouldn't be able to explain.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.780
And my director will,
OK we take a retake.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.280
It's OK.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.660
Don't get too excited.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.440
So TV is fantastic, because
TV gives you retakes.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.636
Sometimes life doesn't
give you retakes.

00:38:06.636 --> 00:38:07.510
TV gives you retakes.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.350
And one thing which
I hate about time

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:15.790
is that sometimes doing
big projects it's very sad.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.550
TV for me, "Master Chef"
for me, is not just a show.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.250
It's something which is
very much bigger than that.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.930
People, I can't even explain it.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.300
It's like for me home coming.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.400
Homecoming is big.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.291
It could be for birds or
animals or humans or anyone.

00:38:29.291 --> 00:38:31.040
I lived in America for
almost eight years,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.990
and I get this opportunity
to step back to my country.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.180
And not that I was
doing well there.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.504
I couldn't deliver what they
wanted, and I left the show.

00:38:41.504 --> 00:38:43.920
And I told my mom, I called
her around 11:30 in the night.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.660
I said, mom, I'm
going back to America.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.118
This is never going
to look for me.

00:38:47.118 --> 00:38:50.700
She says, you know, this is the
first time your homeland has

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.240
asked you for something.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.860
There are a lot of kids who
are waiting to hear your story.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.541
Don't give up.

00:38:57.541 --> 00:38:59.500
I said, OK, that's
all I wanted to hear.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.687
I told the driver,
get back to the hotel.

00:39:01.687 --> 00:39:02.770
So I go back to the hotel.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.290
I practice a lot,
what I have to do.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.174
Whatever I have to speak to
be clear in small sentences.

00:39:09.174 --> 00:39:10.840
That's a problem from
where I come from.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.350
My sentences are too long.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.460
And there's no
comments and stuff.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.300
AMAR JOSHI: Right.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.980
VIKAS KHANNA: So TV's amazing.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.230
TVs a culture.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.920
TVs like a religion.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.860
TV has an impact.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.140
TV can inspire you.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.720
TV can do a lot of stuff
to your next generation,

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.820
to that next generation
of Michelin star chefs,

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.950
who are getting ready in small
villages and small towns,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:42.570
small kitchens, smart homes,
without any resources,

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.600
TV gives them hope.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.350
AMAR JOSHI: I see.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.040
They can see your story.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.300
VIKAS KHANNA: TV.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:54.226
They're all getting ready
to hold the next flag.

00:39:54.226 --> 00:39:55.650
AMAR JOSHI: Cool.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.570
So we have mics around the
room for audience questions,

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:04.360
if you want tips on
cooking or something.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.954
Ask away.

00:40:05.954 --> 00:40:06.620
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.430
VIKAS KHANNA: Hi, how are you?

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.730
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.360
Good, thank you so
much for being here.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.880
VIKAS KHANNA: Pleasure.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.580
AUDIENCE: So I
have a friend who's

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:17.770
trying to teach me how to
cook various Indian dishes

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.100
because her daughter isn't
interested in learning

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.190
how to cook.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.610
So I'm like her surrogate
daughter for that.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.350
And I'm having a really
hard time because she

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.990
doesn't measure anything.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.010
She's just like, you just
know when it's right.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.176
When it's right, it's right.

00:40:32.176 --> 00:40:35.380
So what tips would
you give someone?

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.830
VIKAS KHANNA: My grandmother
would say that if you measure,

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.820
[SPEAKING PUNJABI] what
is barker in English?

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.420
Anybody knows Hindi?

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.320
AUDIENCE: Prosperity.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.361
VIKAS KHANNA: Prosperity.

00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:47.570
If you measure, it reduces
the prosperity of that dish.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.690
So she would not measure.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.150
She would think it's infinity.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.250
What?

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:55.460
Infinity salt, can I
put that in a book?

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.360
You need to have infinity oil.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.330
OK, that's a very big
problem, I know that.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:03.890
But the problem is that their
cooking is always consistent.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.935
And we are always measuring
and still not consistent.

00:41:06.935 --> 00:41:09.060
AUDIENCE: Mine just, it
doesn't come out like hers.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.380
VIKAS KHANNA: You got
to remember two things.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.385
Whole spices first.

00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:12.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.526
VIKAS KHANNA:
Ground spices later.

00:41:13.526 --> 00:41:14.079
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:15.620
VIKAS KHANNA: A lot
of Americans whom

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.432
I teach Indian food,
when you're heating oil,

00:41:18.432 --> 00:41:19.890
you've got to put
the whole spices.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.556
That is how the base
of the cuisine are.

00:41:21.556 --> 00:41:23.940
You're actually what you're
doing, scientifically,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.071
you are, again this
has been memorized.

00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:29.320
You're heating the oil, when
you add the whole spices,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.070
you're infusing the
oil with those flavors

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.889
of the spices, which have
the all-natural oils.

00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:34.930
I can say that 100 times.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:35.971
It will be the same line.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.369
But that is one mistake
which people take.

00:41:41.369 --> 00:41:42.910
When you add powders
in the beginning

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.575
of the cooking
process, you might

00:41:44.575 --> 00:41:45.700
think that that might work.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.160
But when powders burn, they
become extremely bitter.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.060
AUDIENCE: That would
explain a lot actually.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.680
VIKAS KHANNA: That
will explain a lot?

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.013
VIKAS KHANNA: My pleasure.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.040
AUDIENCE: I have
a quick question.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:09.300
Sometimes we try to cook,
as like 9-5 working people,

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:15.230
but when we go to home to cook
dinner, and it's like 8 PM,

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.280
there isn't much
we can cook from.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.880
And we cannot-- I
can steam broccoli,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.485
but I cannot cook like
a full Indian turka,

00:42:25.485 --> 00:42:27.870
aloo gobi or like
rajma or something,

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:31.480
because it takes time to
first put the whole spices

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.650
into the oil, first put the
oil, warm it up, whole spices,

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:38.240
onions, then bring the turka
in, then put the veggie--

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.480
vegetables, the whole process
kind of takes about how one

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.100
hour.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.030
So is there like something?

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:49.500
I tried buy premade
spices, premade gravies,

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.680
and then put them,
that into the oil.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.710
But it doesn't
smell that well as

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:59.070
the fresh spices, whole
spices, into the oil smell.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.579
So is there a trick-- how do,
I'm always amazed, at how do--

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:04.620
VIKAS KHANNA: I'm telling
you the biggest problem

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.810
is a lot of Indian women.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:11.106
They have attained such great
standards of Indian food,

00:43:11.106 --> 00:43:12.980
that sometimes it's hard
for us to beat that.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.950
I'm talking about--
I'm being honest.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.580
They make the simplest
potatoes taste like heaven.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.860
And they seem to be
so without any effort.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.710
The food is ready.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.550
It is sitting on the table.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.970
And the bread magically
comes fully puffed up.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.030
OK.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.170
They have raised the
standard of Indian cooking

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:36.690
so high that they
have destroyed us.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:40.302
they're not helping us
anymore, in a very good way.

00:43:40.302 --> 00:43:41.510
You're so right in some ways.

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.080
When we go back
home, I don't want

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.120
to think about making
all this infusions.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.490
I don't want to do that stuff.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.082
I agree on that.

00:43:48.082 --> 00:43:49.580
But if you read this book--

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.022
AMAR JOSHI: Plug-in
for the book.

00:43:55.022 --> 00:43:57.230
VIKAS KHANNA: --you'd be
surprised at how easy it is.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.590
You steam the broccoli, right?

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.910
How much time you stem it for?

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:00.830
Three to four minutes?

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.128
VIKAS KHANNA:
Maximum five minutes,

00:44:03.128 --> 00:44:06.340
thinking of how hard it is,
or how fresh it is, right?

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.950
I can do that broccoli for you
in less than three minutes.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.140
OK, you need to heat
the oil, add some cumin,

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.270
add whatever spices you want
to add to it, be creative.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.600
You just toss in the broccoli.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.470
You just toss it.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:20.700
It has to be crunchy.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.197
It takes lesser time.

00:44:22.197 --> 00:44:23.780
One of my editors,
she was vegetarian,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.780
she got really inspired.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.540
And she would only
eat boiled vegetables.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.290
And later she told me,
she said, you know,

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.040
I'm not feeling too
good about this.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.360
Because you know why, because
when you don't add spices

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.510
to it, you need the
heat from metabolism,

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.280
so that comes from
those little spices,

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:43.120
which are actually part of such
a medicinal chain of ayurveda.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.070
It just would not
take so much time.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.870
We make a very big
deal out of it.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.735
[SPEAKING PUNJABI]

00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:53.564
AUDIENCE: All
right, sounds good.

00:44:53.564 --> 00:44:55.480
VIKAS KHANNA: Is it posed
as really an answer?

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.150
it is not so hard.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:03.280
You need to keep that spice box,
which is in every Indian home.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.090
You fill it up.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.770
It comes out magically
on the table.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:07.650
You heat the oil.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.770
Through anything you want.

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.885
Food is the odd expression.

00:45:11.885 --> 00:45:13.260
And whatever
vegetables you have.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.430
In America it's so-- I think
it's much easier to cook here

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:17.690
because of the convenience
of you can get everything

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:21.590
pre-cut, pre-set, pre-prepared,
so much is-- it's so easy.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.040
There's no reason not
to have great food here.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.456
Or anywhere in the world.

00:45:28.456 --> 00:45:30.330
AMAR JOSHI: I don't know
if it's that simple.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.961
Now like, I've had experiences
where, sorry, well, you

00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:34.960
make it sound so simple.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.189
VIKAS KHANNA: You're
supposed to be on my side.

00:45:37.189 --> 00:45:38.730
AMAR JOSHI: There've
been cases where

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.247
I'm on video call
with my mom, and I'm

00:45:41.247 --> 00:45:42.580
like, how do you make this dish?

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.829
VIKAS KHANNA: That is amazing.

00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:44.670
That's amazing.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.390
See, it is not about that dish.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.100
That you can learn
from a YouTube video.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.290
It is about that face time.

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.580
AMAR JOSHI: Yeah that's what--

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.163
VIKAS KHANNA: People
don't understand.

00:45:54.163 --> 00:45:56.150
It's about that face time.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:00.620
And she feeling so fantastic
that somehow she feels

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.030
that she is nurturing you.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.760
It is amazing for her.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.060
She is thousands of miles away.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.540
At that time, she's going
to call all her relatives,

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.040
and all of the
mothers are the same,

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.400
I'm not stereo-typing them.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.720
She'll go oh today, I
taught him how to make that.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.400
You know, he must
be missing home.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.110
That is what.

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.600
I give him all the tips.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.110
She's called 40
people after that.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.150
That's amazing.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.780
Do that, even if you
know how to make a dish.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.880
Just call home and say, I miss
those little, what you used

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.570
to make, those kidney beans.

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.111
80% of the things you will not
understand because she doesn't

00:46:32.111 --> 00:46:33.264
know how to tell a recipe.

00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:35.930
And somehow it'll start with the
conversation about this recipe.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.360
Oh, you know that aunt
came over that day?

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.990
She's not looking
too good, not it.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.700
But she kept asking
that, well, when are

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.820
you guys going to get married.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.361
But you know.

00:46:43.361 --> 00:46:45.890
I said, mom, that thing
we were talking about.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.260
But it's fantastic.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.700
It's therapeutic.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:54.429
And you'd be surprised at how
food keeps a whole culture

00:46:54.429 --> 00:46:55.720
of going to psychiatrists away.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:59.680
I'm not against psychiatrists.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.011
I go to psychiatrist to
see, I'm obsessed passion.

00:47:04.011 --> 00:47:04.510
I don't.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.890
But they keep you
so-- it's so fantastic

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.110
that you have that link.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:10.680
It's amazing.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.010
And the day that link goes
away, you don't care for food.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.262
You don't care for anything.

00:47:16.262 --> 00:47:17.220
You can buy everything.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.640
You guys are doing so fantastic.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.300
But you can't buy time.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.470
So give them that time.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:24.640
Call them for unnecessary tips.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.220
So mom, how do you
boil the water?

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.640
She'll be very happy telling
you a half an hour story

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.681
on how to boil the water.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.174
It's not the food.

00:47:37.174 --> 00:47:38.050
Hi

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.820
So one of the issues that I
personally have in the kitchen

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.010
is that I find myself
sort of settling

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.220
into a very comfortable
routine of the 15 dishes,

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.570
10 to 15 dishes that I make.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.070
VIKAS KHANNA:
Everyone is like that.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
also I think I've gotten

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.640
my husband very used to those.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:56.592
So it becomes hard to
justify experimenting almost.

00:47:56.592 --> 00:47:58.050
So I wanted to ask
you, how you get

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:03.680
into this culture of trying,
experimenting Indian cuisine,

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.360
and putting new dishes together,
combining American dishes

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.886
and Indian dishes?

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:10.510
How do you start
moving that direction?

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.551
VIKAS KHANNA: I'll just
step back for one minute.

00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.220
It is cooking-- when you talk
about very divided cooking

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.280
by cultures, you will
be surprised to notice

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.362
that there's not
much difference.

00:48:21.362 --> 00:48:22.195
It's the techniques.

00:48:25.265 --> 00:48:27.640
Once you've figured out, that
I figure out that technique

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.760
works perfectly.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.390
If you know that I can make
this lamb absolutely succulent,

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:35.990
absolutely perfect, and I
figured out a technique, now

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.610
you have the full control.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.780
You can add chilies and
lot of cilantro to it.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.030
You can make it Mexican style.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.970
You could make it Indian style.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.284
You can make it European style.

00:48:43.284 --> 00:48:45.450
It is that little technique
of getting that chickens

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:48.190
right to that temperature.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.260
It is that simple.

00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:52.840
It is that simple.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.010
And I'm not plugging
in the book on this.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.200
I'm just telling you.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.610
It is that simple.

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:02.719
It is just understanding
that yes, I figured out--

00:49:02.719 --> 00:49:04.510
Day before yesterday
I was hosting a class,

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.700
and they asked one question.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.530
How do you make
perfect basmati rice?

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:12.360
I said, if you have a recorder
on your phone, record me.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.410
And I'll give you
exactly in 60 seconds,

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.960
how to make perfect
basmati rice every time.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.360
You soak the rice
for 20 minutes.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.110
You heat the oil.

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.755
Add any spices you
want in it, right?

00:49:23.755 --> 00:49:27.665
You drain the water, rinse
the rice and put it into it.

00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:29.800
You've got to put
double the water

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.510
and cook it exactly
for 10 minutes.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:36.680
You will see that all the
water has been absorbed almost.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.280
You take a kitchen towel.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.030
You wet it.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.860
You put it right on the rice.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.820
Put the lid over it.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.280
Reduce it to minimum heat.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.820
And cook it exactly
for five minutes.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.050
And then I'll be pretending
that I'm mother Jeffrey.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.660
I'm a big fan of hers.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:50.640
You take a fork.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.280
And you lightly fluff the rice.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:53.800
See?

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.550
It is that simple.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:57.555
Now, how do I make the rice
into something different

00:49:57.555 --> 00:49:58.760
of different cultures?

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.260
You have the technique
in your hand.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.860
You knew exactly how
to control that rice,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.890
to that perfect
grain to grain rice.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.180
You add the flavors you want.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.950
You want to add
chipotle chilies to it?

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.140
Fantastic.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.590
You want to add spinach to it?

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.680
Amazing.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.740
You can now do
all the variations

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.700
because you've got
hold of the technique.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.910
Don't get ahold of the dish.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:21.090
Get hold of the technique.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:22.052
Sorry.

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.176
AMAR JOSHI: That's awesome.

00:50:23.176 --> 00:50:25.760
VIKAS KHANNA: It
was long answer.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.340
AMAR JOSHI: So a
question for you.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.110
You've cooked for heads
of state, president Obama,

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:33.860
you did a fundraiser for him.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.450
When prime minister,
Narendra Modi, he was here,

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:39.930
you cooked food for him as well.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:43.280
So how do like-- do
they just call you?

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.605
And like, hey, Vikas can you--

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.590
VIKAS KHANNA: It's
a long planning.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.260
There's a lot of trail work.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.610
There's a lot of planning
that goes into it.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.670
No pressure, you're just
cooking for Mr. Modi.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.824
It's like oh yeah?

00:51:01.824 --> 00:51:03.740
And this was funny, that
I'm cooking for this,

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.530
and somebody's asking, chef
it's a trillion drama club.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.424
It's a $4 trillion people.

00:51:08.424 --> 00:51:09.840
You know how many
zeros are there?

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.160
And I was putting the
amuse-bouche together.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.320
So I said six, seven.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.820
And she kept
looking Interesting.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.986
You know a trillion dollars?

00:51:16.986 --> 00:51:17.542
I said, yeah.

00:51:17.542 --> 00:51:21.180
And I'm like
pretending five, four,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.100
I don't know how many
zeros are in there.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.640
AMAR JOSHI: It's
too big a number.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.240
VIKAS KHANNA: The food
would have more power

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.360
than all of them.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.740
They could be trillion, in
the trillion dollar club,

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.923
they still need that
comfort of food.

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:33.910
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.220
So is there someone from
the Secret Service standing,

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:36.490
making sure--

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:37.823
VIKAS KHANNA: [SPEAKING PUNJABI]

00:51:37.823 --> 00:51:41.742
AMAR JOSHI: What you
put in-- supervision.

00:51:41.742 --> 00:51:42.950
VIKAS KHANNA: No supervision.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.610
They taste every
dish which goes out.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.010
So I was not doing it.

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.530
I was not dealing with them.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.280
Because I was a high mode.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.360
So I pushed, Rajesh
was doing that.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.530
Secret Service, he was--
I was not dealing with it.

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.380
I was telling him
to deal with them,

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.389
because it was like
too much of no, that

00:51:59.389 --> 00:52:00.680
sauce you didn't make us taste.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.510
It's like, well yeah,
that's a little garnish

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.050
which goes inside.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.490
They're are three different
sauces of the garnish.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.860
And they're like,
balls on the side?

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.680
Well, we didn't taste
those little balls.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.369
It's like, OK, bring
the plate back.

00:52:10.369 --> 00:52:11.660
So I was not dealing with that.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.840
But it happens.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.860
It's fantastic.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.068
These are the people who
are inspiring the world, who

00:52:16.068 --> 00:52:17.240
are the world leaders.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.140
So much of world economies
are based on them.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.599
So and to get the
opportunity to cook for them,

00:52:22.599 --> 00:52:24.390
and this is the only
thing you know and you

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.800
represent your whole nation
with that few dishes.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.110
And you've got to
full justice to it.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.220
It's world transient.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.890
AMAR JOSHI: Comes
back to that theme.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.360
VIKAS KHANNA: It holds standard.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:47.930
Yeah, but you know, da Vinci,
he never completed "Mona Lisa."

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.910
Did you know that?

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:50.778
You can google it.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:54.990
You can google it.

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:56.570
"Mona Lisa" was never completed.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:00.180
It was always an
incomplete painting.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.994
And so is Junoon.

00:53:02.994 --> 00:53:04.410
And when we were
about to open it,

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:09.700
I did everything in my power to
get my grandmother there once

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.761
to complete the restaurant.

00:53:11.761 --> 00:53:13.510
But maybe that's why
it was a masterpiece,

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.759
because it was never complete.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.900
I begged ever year.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.800
She was 94.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.820
I begged everyone.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.280
I figured out, they
said she's too fragile.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.240
I just wanted her to
step into the restaurant

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.720
once, once, to make it complete.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.470
But that's a Mona Lisa.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:36.550
It's as beautiful as
the world sees it.

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.760
But only da Vinci knew
that it is incomplete.

00:53:41.486 --> 00:53:42.152
AMAR JOSHI: Wow.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.780
Next question.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.530
AUDIENCE: We are so
glad to have you here,

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.430
because I'm personally
a big fan of you.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.680
I watch all the
Master Chef shows,

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.780
and I've been following
that show a lot.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.820
Thank you for coming here
and being so candid, so open,

00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.910
and being yourself.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.410
We're enduring your talk.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:06.220
The question I want to ask
is with your life always

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.200
being on the road
with the food, I'm

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.200
sure you're always busy
with the events of the food.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.240
How do you get time
to cook for yourself?

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.780
Or is there someone
else who cooks for you?

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.610
And one more
question before I end

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:22.570
is in spite of being surrounded
by food all the time,

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:24.900
we see you in the best
shape all the time.

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.520
So how do you marry food
and fitness together?

00:54:29.652 --> 00:54:32.110
VIKAS KHANNA: There were a lot
of hidden questions in that.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.110
I just eat a bowl of
daal every single night.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.800
I sit on the same
steps of Junoon.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.950
I eat the same daal
every single night.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:50.380
While you're in the service,
you tend to taste too much.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.950
And yes, I'm extremely
disciplined when

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.147
it comes to work.

00:54:55.147 --> 00:54:56.563
Some people who
work with me, they

00:54:56.563 --> 00:54:59.860
are surprised at how come
I can around the clock.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.120
I think it's an opportunity.

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.620
I take it from where
I was 20 years ago.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.950
Sitting here.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:16.320
It's really-- I begin to believe
in miracles after I'm here.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.410
But I think one thing that
you said is about discipline.

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.220
Discipline is
extremely essential.

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.070
People can't see it.

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.000
But people who work
with you can tell

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.390
that yes, you're always being
there when it is required.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:34.050
You always, you're always
writing literature.

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.720
My next work has taken me
12 years to write, 12 years.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.410
It's also by Bloomsbury.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:45.010
It's took me 12, do you
know how much is 12 years?

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:47.530
It's crazy.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.640
I shot the whole book,
maybe like four times.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.390
I was never happy.

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.510
And today's a big day.

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:54.490
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:58.160
It's we worship the
power of Mother.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.220
And it's fantastic that
you got this opportunity.

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.200
And I still remember one thing.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.970
When first time I met
Rajesh, he said me one thing

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:08.340
which is stuck in my mind.

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:14.320
He is saying, whatever you
do, it has to be the best.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.240
So whenever we are
writing about anything,

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.820
which is about discipline,
what serve as something

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:23.932
that you'd be remembered
for far after you're gone?

00:56:23.932 --> 00:56:25.890
To the next generation,
to the next generation.

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:29.450
Every Indian festival, ceremony,
ritual, traditions, custom,

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:33.990
are food from tribal to urban
to adopted to immigrants to Rosh

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.450
Hashanah to Diwali to Hannukah.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.220
Everything is in that book.

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.279
I try to bring that book.

00:56:41.279 --> 00:56:43.570
And you know, I gave it to
President Clinton last week.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.680
And it's just such a heavy book.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.910
And he hold it like this.

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:49.380
I said, I want people
to hold this book

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.300
as they're holding their
daughter for the first time.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.440
And it's like, when
you hold your daughter

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.610
for the first time, I don't
know, holding my niece,

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:59.930
it was like hard for me to
believe that my extension.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:02.800
And first thing you do is you
put it close to your heart.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.470
I want people to hold
[INAUDIBLE] like that.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.610
And he replied to me saying,
India's not just a daughter.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:12.240
She's also the mother.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.450
She's taught us so many things
about philosophy of life.

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:18.180
Of course it's a forever
work in progress.

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:22.620
But that motivates you.

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.307
That motivates you.

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:25.140
AUDIENCE: Beautiful.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.360
Can we get the recipe for that
daal which you eat every day?

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:34.467
[SPEAKING PUNJABI]

00:57:34.467 --> 00:57:36.550
VIKAS KHANNA: It's the
simplest food in the night.

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:38.510
Night you eat for yourself.

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:42.910
That's a moment you eat for
yourself We have to close up.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:44.360
AMAR JOSHI: Yes, we are.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.821
So we can take one
quick question.

00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:50.320
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, what
other cuisines do you enjoy?

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.672
And do you get inspiration
from other cuisines

00:57:52.672 --> 00:57:53.380
for your cooking?

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.546
VIKAS KHANNA: Oh absolutely.

00:57:56.242 --> 00:57:58.700
I'm not going to think about
the cuisines which you already

00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:59.199
know.

00:57:59.199 --> 00:58:00.590
But I'm going to
think about some

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:03.200
of the greatest cuisine which
I discovered in my lifetime,

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.160
was from Bhutan.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.780
Bhutan is a landlocked
country, which

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:11.760
was not open to the
world A few years ago.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.430
It is the mo-- please google it.

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:19.010
It is the most beautiful
country you will ever

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:20.990
find on this planet.

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:25.740
And the cuisine has
really, really inspired me.

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.860
Just a few ingredients.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.640
That is how the great food
should be, just put together.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.111
It's so much of
integrity and love.

00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:36.360
AMAR JOSHI: They say Bhutan
is like the happiest place

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.040
on earth, like people
there are very--

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.970
VIKAS KHANNA: I had failed so
badly that I want to run away.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:45.200
So I found Bhutan
as a great place.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.610
I'd lost almost everything.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:49.970
So I go to Bhutan, and I really
felt that I was literally

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.740
born again.

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.010
It's an amazing country.

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:58.200
Even travelling in Tibet, not
just Lhasa but around Tibet.

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.260
It is so beautiful.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:07.029
There are many worlds in this
world, and beautiful ones.

00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:08.570
But yeah, besides
that, a real answer

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:14.800
would be I'm inspired by French,
Spanish, Italian, Japanese,

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.429
Chinese cuisine we all love.

00:59:16.429 --> 00:59:17.970
A lot of people
don't know in America

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:22.510
that Chinese cuisine is
the favorite Indian cause.

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:24.780
Because you made Chinese
cuisine also art.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:27.360
You put-- everything has spices.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.860
AMAR JOSHI: Nice.

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.344
Yeah, we're out of time.

00:59:33.344 --> 00:59:34.760
VIKAS KHANNA: Thank
you very much.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.070
AMAR JOSHI: Thank you
for coming in, Vikas.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:37.070
VIKAS KHANNA: Thank you.

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.720
[APPLAUSE]
