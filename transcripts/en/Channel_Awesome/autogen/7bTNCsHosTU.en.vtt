00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:04.470
because that would be about the only
 

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.260
because that would be about the only
reason you're seeing this if it looks

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:06.270

which was pretty new in the eighties and
 

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.720
which was pretty new in the eighties and
that was it so I was like if you had one

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:13.730
that was it so I was like if you had one
 

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.660
that was it so I was like if you had one
of those Falls good yeah like that was

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:16.670
of those Falls good yeah like that was
 

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.300
of those Falls good yeah like that was
it yeah so there's an idea like they can

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:19.310
it yeah so there's an idea like they can
 

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:21.550
it yeah so there's an idea like they can
experiment a little bit more now too and

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560
experiment a little bit more now too and
 

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.720

they also like to kind of have the
formula but they have also enough wiggle

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800
formula but they have also enough wiggle
 

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.110
formula but they have also enough wiggle
room as I let's do some a little

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:26.120
room as I let's do some a little
 

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.850
room as I let's do some a little
different in this formula as well like

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:27.860
different in this formula as well like
 

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.410

a more month goodbye there sure but
there's that wiggle room of like let's

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.350
there's that wiggle room of like let's
 

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.170
there's that wiggle room of like let's
have fun let's try this like a week we

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:35.180
have fun let's try this like a week we
 

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.260
have fun let's try this like a week we
have we have space to fail I mean

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:38.270
have we have space to fail I mean
 

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.900
