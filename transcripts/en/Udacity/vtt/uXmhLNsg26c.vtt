00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.628
To type x is less than or equal to
5 using Mathquill, you would type

00:00:05.628 --> 00:00:11.470
x\le followed by the space
bar followed by a 5.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.760
For x is greater than or equal to 5,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.220
you would type x\ge followed by
the space bar, followed by 5.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.740
Don't forget, the backslash is not
the same as the forward slash, and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.580
you need to use a space bar at the end.
