00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.380
You may not want to admit it, but at one time
in your life, you’ve talked to an animal.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.550
Maybe it was letting a dog know it was a good
dog or asking a cat where it’s been.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.660
Maybe you gave words of encouragement to an
elephant or scolded a sheep.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.060
Whichever animal it was you talked to, one
thing is for sure; it probably didn’t talk

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.060
back.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.310
But what if it could?

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.970
Scientists are working on ways to not only
understand what animals are saying, but to

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.960
one day talk back, forever changing the way
we think about them.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.180
So, how close are we to talking with animals?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.760
Okay, I know what you’re all saying, animals
do “talk”, just not with words.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.320
They make noises, they have facial expressions
and body language.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.200
But, this isn’t exactly what we’re talking
about.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.489
I think it's important to distinguish between
what we call communication and language.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.031
Communication is the more general term and
it really refers to this exchanging of signals,

00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.640
sharing and exchanging messages or signals
in a meaningful way.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.470
Language is a word that is fraught with interpretations
and involved in many debates, whether other

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530
animals have language or they're communicating.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.921
Well the truth is that we suppose that animals
have language, but in a lot of cases, we have

00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:17.430
to actually prove this experimentally.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.200
But a lot of people are enchanted with the
idea of animals having language.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.430
No one has yet proven that an animal or a
species has language, partly because the idea

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.890
of what constitutes a language hasn’t really
been established.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.850
But in the broad sense, language should be
a distinct and organized pattern of communication,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.720
with a near infinite number of combinations,
that has been learned and used voluntarily,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.299
not in a reactionary or instinctual manner.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.340
When your dog barks when a squirrel runs past,
this is a predictable and instinctual response,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.399
so we don’t consider it language.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.970
But there have been studies that have shown
some do communicate in a very complex manner

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.479
that show traits of language.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.369
Now we just have to figure out how to decipher
what they’re saying.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.200
I think the possibility of us having a Rosetta
Stone with an animal is very real.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.090
What we have to do is we have to do the experiments
to determine the context in which animal signals

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.180
are given.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.950
That context is going to give us the Rosetta
Stone.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.620
And that’s exactly what’s happening.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.450
Dr Con Slobodchikoff has been studying prairie
dog calls because within those high-pitched

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.030
chirps, they actually are saying a lot.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.290
They are able to tell each other what the
species of predator is, and the alarm calls

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.390
are given in response to a predator.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.879
The prairie dogs tell each other whether the
predator is a red-tailed hawk, is a coyote,

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.390
is a domestic dog, or is a human.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.040
They can describe the physical features of
the predator.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.400
With humans, they can tell each other about
the color of clothes that the person is wearing,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.269
about the general size and shape of the person,
something about the speed of travel of the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.269
person.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.000
Combining years of recorded prairie dog alarms
with AI technology, he may one day be able

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.590
to create a prairie dog to English translator.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.239
Unfortunately, determining that animals have
language is a difficult process.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.190
It's not an easy one.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.780
It takes a lot of effort and time, and it
takes a certain amount of money.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.989
One of the main obstacles that slows us down
from communicating with other species is that

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.819
we don't have a shared code.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.879
While Dr Slobodchikoff is trying to use prairie
dog language as the shared code, others are

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.180
looking to create a new code, one that can
hopefully bridge the gap between humans and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.180
animals.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.349
We've now created a four by eight foot touchscreen,
an interactive underwater touchscreen for

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.489
dolphins that will allow them again choice
and control and it will allow us to try to

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.379
understand what the kinds of signals they're
using and their own interests, more about

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.709
their cognitive abilities.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.189
Dr. Reiss and her team will observe the dolphin’s
choices and compare that to their vocalizations

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.030
and mannerisms with the hope of decoding some
parts of the dolphin’s speech.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.360
Again, to create a Rosetta Stone to help translate
and hopefully one day talk to dolphins using

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.400
their language.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.069
In our lab, we try to give the dolphins a
means of communication using a keyboard so

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.709
that they could request and identify different
objects and that's what we're working on now

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.490
so that they can produce a code themselves.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.530
Again, it's such a challenge though to come
up with a shared language.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.370
Well, if it’s so hard to learn their language,
can’t we just teach them ours?

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.050
Isn’t that an easier way to have an interspecies
conversation?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.050
Well, maybe.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.870
&nbsp;For decades scientists have been working
with apes to teach them American Sign Language

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.780
in order to learn more about both the species
and the origin of human language.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.080
8:00 - “So the first Chimp was Washoe, she
was wild caught by the Air Force.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.690
They were collecting chimps for the space
program...instead of going into space she

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.780
joined this sign language project.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.440
She was raised like a human child...all over
her caregivers used American sign language…”

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.640
Washoe was able to learn over 200 signs, talk
to scientists and even taught another chimp

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.840
how to sign.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.070
More studies popped up, most famously with
Koko the Gorilla, and for a moment the lines

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.830
between human and animals blurred ever so
slightly.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.210
Some were still skeptical, arguing that these
apes were just mimicking signs for a reward

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.539
instead of voluntarily conversing.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.160
But other studies were done that showed apes
talking amongst themselves with signs and

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.310
having private conversations with each other.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.870
They seemed to be using language voluntarily.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.840
Now, even though great progress has been made,
some in this field feel uncomfortable with

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.190
the idea of bringing in new apes, or any animal,
into captivity.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.700
As someone that’s been doing this for a
long time, I feel that this research should

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.280
never be repeated...but the chimps that do
have sign language, i feel it's important

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.120
for us to continue to document it, study it…i
feel that it's important work because it helps

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.732
us understand more about chimps and see the
continuity between our species and other species

00:05:56.732 --> 00:05:57.732
on the planet and i feel that if we understand
them better we’re more likely to treat them,

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:58.732
and the rest of other beings on the planet
in a better way.

00:05:58.732 --> 00:05:59.732
And that is what may be at stake here.

00:05:59.732 --> 00:06:03.620
That’s why scientists are interested in
studying interspecies communication and closing

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.600
that gap between us and them.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.090
I think if we could talk to animals, it would
really change our relationship with them because

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.770
people would realize that they are much more
like us in many respects.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.770
They have emotions.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.770
They have thoughts...It becomes much more
difficult than to treat these animals as property,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.770
as disposable creatures…

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.680
MJ “We are taught with our culture...that
we’re so special and superior to other beings...when

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.639
people see the chimps signing, it’s like
the chimps are reaching across that imaginary

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.150
boundary that our culture has put up...for
a lot of people that helps them widen their

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.440
circle of compassion…

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.130
.it's going to really perhaps end what Loren
Eiseley has called The Long Loneliness of

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.870
us being the only species that can communicate
with each other.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.000
That would be very exciting to be able to
communicate with other species on this planet.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.430
If we were ever able to have a conversation
with an animal, we first need to decode every

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.630
sound and movement they make when communicating.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.190
This would be our Rosetta Stone, the groundwork
for being able to talk back, a scenario that

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.010
might change how we think, govern, work, innovate
and of course, eat.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.669
So, how close are we to talking to animals?

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:19.050
We really have to abandon our arrogance, and
it’s our arrogance that keeps us from communicating

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.020
with other humans in other cultures...and
it's our arrogance that has probably slowed

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.650
our progress in understanding what non-humans
are talking about.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.930
We're already communicating with animals in
simple ways.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.440
If we then ask the question how close are
we to having a more sophisticated dialogue

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.849
or exchange with other animals using a shared
set of symbols in sophisticated ways, I would

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:46.280
say, we still have a long way to go and we're
just in the infancy of understanding how to

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280
do it.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.789
I think it really requires decoding more of
what they're doing in their own natural systems

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:58.930
and finding ways of incorporating that into
what we want to create as a shared code.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.990
It's complicated but it's intriguing.
