00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay. And the answer is:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Whatever I typed in the box will appear in the URL.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's a small chance that the value of the "q" parameter

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
could have been "hunter 2"--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
if that's what I typed in the box, but it's not what I typed in the box.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's go ahead and see this happen, for real, in the browser.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Here we are; I click Submit,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and you can see that "q" equals what I typed in the box.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In this case, it was the text, "some dots".

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So this is important to know:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you should use the password form element

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or the password input type when you're collecting passwords on your site,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but you should know that that password is not sent securely to your Server.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's sent either in the URL or in a POST parameter,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
just like any other parameter--so it's really only to prevent

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
somebody from looking over your shoulder.
