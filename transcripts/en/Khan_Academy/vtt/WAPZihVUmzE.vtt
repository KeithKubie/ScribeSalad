00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.400
What we're going to
do in this video is

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.090
take the region
between the two curves,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.119
y is equal to square
root of x on top and y

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.240
is equal to x
squared on the bottom

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.780
and rotate it around a vertical
line that is not the y-axis.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.030
So we're going to rotate it
around the vertical line x

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.690
is equal to 2.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.310
We're going to rotate it
right around like that.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.990
And if we rotate
it like that, we

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.150
will get this shape, so
this strange-looking shape.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.500
It's hollowed out in the middle.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.680
You can kind of use the y equals
x squared part kind of hollows

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.690
out the middle.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.630
And it's really the
stuff in between

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.810
that forms the wall
of this rotated shape.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.080
So let's think about how we
can figure out the volume.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.524
And we're going to do it using
the disk method, sometimes

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:43.940
called the ring
method-- actually,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.773
it's going to be more
of the washer method--

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:47.760
to do this one right over here.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.070
So we're rotating
around a vertical line.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.210
We want to use our disk
or ring or washer method.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.290
And so it'll be
really helpful to have

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.770
a bunch of rings stacked
up in the y direction.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.530
So we're probably going to want
to integrate with respect to y.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.560
Let me make it clear
what I'm talking about.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.330
Each of our rings are going
to look something like this.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.280
So let me do my best
attempt to draw.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.150
So that's the inner
radius of the ring defined

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.120
by y is equal to x squared.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.110
And then the outside
radius of the ring

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.500
might look something like this.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.660
My best attempt to
draw it reasonably.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.590
The outside radius of the ring
might look something like that.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.950
And the depth of the ring would
be a little dy just like that.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.440
So let me draw the depth.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.944
So let me see, right over here.

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:46.110
You could kind of view it
as the height of the ring,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.550
because we are thinking
in a vertical direction.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.050
And that would be
a ring for a given

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.840
y for, say, this
y right over here.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840
It's essentially
the ring generated

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.100
if you were to take this
rectangle of height dy

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.012
and rotate it around
the line x equals 2.

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:06.470
And we're going to
construct a ring

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.730
like that for each of
the y's in our interval.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.540
So you could imagine stacking
up a whole set of rings just

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.710
like this and then taking
the sum of the volumes of all

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.160
of those rings and
the limit of that side

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.336
as you have an infinite number
of rings with-- or close

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:25.710
to infinite-- or
really, infinite

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.470
number of rings with
infinitesmally small height

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.130
or depth or dy.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.470
So let's figure out
how we would do this.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.235
Well, we know that
all we have to do

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:36.360
is figure out what the
volume of one of these rings

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.940
are for given y
as a function of y

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.825
and then integrate along all
of them, sum them all up.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.200
So let's figure out what the
volume of one of these rings

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.980
are.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.480
And to do it, we're
going to express

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990
these functions
as functions of y.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.350
So our purple function, y is
equal to square root of x,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.040
if we square both sides,
we would get y squared

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.695
is equal to x.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.070
And let me swap the sides so
it makes it clear that now x

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.462
is a function of y.

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:07.600
x is equal to y squared.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.300
That's our top
function the way we've

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.350
drawn a kind of outer
shell for our figure.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.800
And then y is
equal to x squared.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.642
If you take the principal root
of both sides of that and it

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:22.100
all works out because we're
operating in the first quadrant

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.600
here.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.380
That's the part of it
that we care about.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.590
So you're going to get x is
equal to the square root of y.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.310
That is our yellow
function right over there.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.630
Now, how do we
figure out the area

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.470
of the surface of one of these
rings or one of these washers?

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.982
Well, the area-- let
me do this in orange

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.440
because I drew that
ring in orange.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.100
So the area of the
surface right over here

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.240
in orange as a
function of y is going

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.130
to be equal to the
area of the circle

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.810
if I just consider
the outer radius,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.370
and then I subtract out the
area of the circle constructed

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.210
by the inner radius, just
kind of subtract it out.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.010
So the outer-circle
radius, so it's

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:14.560
going to be pi times outer
radius squared minus pi-- let

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.042
me write it this
way-- outer-- well,

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:19.500
I'll just write
it-- outer radius--

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.830
this is going to be as a
function of y-- outer radius

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.490
squared minus pi times
inner radius squared.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.680
And we want this all
to be a function of y.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.610
So the outer radius
as a function of y

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.149
is going to be what?

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.190
Well, it might be easier
to visualize-- actually,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.190
I'll try it both places.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.570
So it's this entire
distance right over here,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.550
essentially, the distance
between the vertical line,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.940
the horizontal distance
between our vertical line,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.035
and our outer function.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.970
So if you think about
it in terms of x,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.370
It's going to be
2 minus whatever

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.970
the x value is right over here.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.540
So the x value right over
here is going to be y squared.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.610
Remember, we want this
is a function of y.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.580
So our outer radius,
this whole distance,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.480
is going to be 2 minus the x
value here as a function of y.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.410
That x value is y squared.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.770
So the outer radius
is 2 minus x-- sorry.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.350
2 minus y squared.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.390
We want it as a function of y.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.774
And then our inner radius is
going to be equal to what?

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:39.440
Well, that's going
to be the difference,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.570
the horizontal distance,
between this vertical line

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.950
and our inner function,
our inner boundary.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.440
So it's going to be the
horizontal distance between two

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.420
and whatever x value this is.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.140
But this x value as a function
of y is just square root of y.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.200
So it's going to be 2
minus square root of y.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.960
And so now, we can come up
with an expression for area.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.350
It's going to be-- and I'll
just factor out-- actually,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.350
I'll leave the pi there.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.730
So it's going to be
pi-- right over here--

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.070
it's going to be pi times
outer radius squared.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.500
Well, the outer
radius is 2 minus y

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.153
squared-- and let me just--
well, I'll just write it.

00:06:18.153 --> 00:06:20.890
2 minus y squared--
and we're going

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.740
to square that-- squared,
minus pi times the inner radius

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.330
squared.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.760
Well, we already
figured that out.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.240
The inner radius is 2
minus square root of y.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.340
And we're going to
square that one, too.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.330
So this gives us the
area of one of our rings

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.670
as a function of y, the
top of the ring, where

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.712
I shaded in orange.

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:44.920
And now, if we want the
volume of one of those rings,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.294
we have to multiply it by its
depth or its height the way

00:06:47.294 --> 00:06:49.070
we've drawn it right over here.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.030
And its height-- we've done this
multiple times already right

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.580
over here-- is an
infinitesimal change in y.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.840
So we're going to multiply
all that business times dy.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.660
This is the volume
of one of our rings.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.631
And then we want to sum up all
of the rings over our interval.

00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:07.130
So we're going to sum up all
of the rings over the interval.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.630
And when you take
the integral sign,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.260
it's a sum where you're
taking the limit as you

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.690
have an infinite number of rings
that become infinitesimally

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.970
small in height or depth,
depending on how you view it.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.880
And what's our interval?

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.550
So we've looked at
this multiple times.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.180
These two graphs-- you
could do it by inspection.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.763
You could try to
solve it in some way,

00:07:24.763 --> 00:07:27.190
but it's pretty obvious
that they intersect at--

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.150
remember we care
about our y interval.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.355
They intersect at y is equal
to 0 and y is equal to 1.

00:07:38.404 --> 00:07:39.320
And there you have it.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.900
We've set up our
integral for the volume

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.106
of this shape right over here.

00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:46.980
I'll leave you there,
and in this next video,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.120
we will just evaluate
this integral.
