00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.714
Welcome to "Google Developers
Weekly" for October 28, 2013.

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:06.630
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.879
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.570
on the set and off.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.150
As an innovator,
you want to protect

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.899
your work and your inventions.

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.440
In the first episode
of "Root Access"

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.564
this week, Don Dodge talks
about New Zealand's move

00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:20.140
to ban software patents,
how skunkworks projects

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.260
in big companies operate, and
takes questions from viewers.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.190
But as you no doubt
know, big ideas

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.214
don't always result
in big results.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.880
In addition to hard
work and innovation,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.390
sometimes you need to be lucky.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020
I joined Don to talk about the
intersection of skill and luck

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.519
and how companies
need to constantly

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:35.970
be aware of changes
in the market

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.910
to deliver what customers want.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.660
From Berlin, Martin
Gorner is back

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.910
for another episode in the SQL
versus NoSQL debate, with guest

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.660
Nacho Coloma, the CTO of
Koliseo and author of SimpleDS.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.380
The pair offer tips and tricks
to help you tackle new NoSQL

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.980
databases such as the
App Engine Data Store.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.250
And from New York,
Ikai Lan shows us

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.460
the tricks he uses to
debug OAuth token issues

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.440
in the YouTube API.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.950
He demonstrates how to use
our token info tool, as well

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.182
as some tricks for using the
OAuth playground for debugging.

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:05.640
And heavy page weight is bad
for your bandwidth [? belt, ?]

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.420
especially when you're browsing
the web on a mobile device.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.730
Colt McAnlis, resident
web performance hacker,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.960
tells us about new and exciting
ways to compress CSS, JSON,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.720
HTML, XML, and JavaScript
data on the web,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.900
and how GZIP sometimes helps
but can also get in the way.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.180
And then we take GDL on the
road to the San Francisco office

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.020
of App.net, where Googler
Brett Slatkin talks

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.090
with Dalton Caldwell about their
platform as a service offering

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.190
and how it differentiates
from others in the market.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.300
From our Android friends, we
saw a pair of shows last week.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.690
First, the Android
design team, consisting

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.120
of Nick Butcher, Adam
Koch, and Roman Nurik

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.390
took the time to deliver
some best practices on how

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.940
to show photos and
thumbnails in your apps.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.640
Bruno Oliveira followed on with
part three of his Play Games

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.830
series, focus on threading
and lifecycle management.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.300
And a few months
ago, we announced

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.090
Google was making
the CardDAV contact

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.750
standard available to all users.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.880
Now we've added some
cool features, including

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.650
big, high-resolution photos,
improved battery life and data

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.100
usage, and more.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.390
There's also a new developer
doc you can check out

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.740
at developers.google.com

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.070
Also, for AdWords API users, we
announced that flexible bidding

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.600
strategies have now
graduated from beta.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.060
This feature enables you to
set up your bidding strategies

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.540
and share them among
campaigns and ad groups.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.060
You can also learn more on
the AdWords API documentation

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.780
on developers.google.com.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.540
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the world

I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you here in the studio.
