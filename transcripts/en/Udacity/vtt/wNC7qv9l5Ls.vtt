00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I want to gather a little bit more data,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and here, again, there is no right or wrong answer

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
even though the interface may tell you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that your answer was right or wrong,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I just want to do this sort of as a sociological experiment

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to see where people are.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So just tell me what your crossover point is.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Again, there is no right or wrong answer,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but what's the number of dollars--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or euros, if you prefer that--at which you'd be indifferent

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
between accepting this gamble and holding?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And put that in as an integer number,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
not the number of millions.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, if your crossover point is 1 million,

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
write 1 million here, don't write 1.
