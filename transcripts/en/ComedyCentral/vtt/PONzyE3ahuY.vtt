00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.409
- My dad, I don't know he's
got a very small penis.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.242
- [Daniel] Does he?

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.661
- Yeah, I remember taking a
shower, you know when you're

00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:06.494
a kid taking a shower---

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:08.111
- And usually your dad's
supposed to look huge

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:09.077
just based on the fact---

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:09.910
- No, no---

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.743
- Just based on the
fact that you're small.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:11.576
- Even as a five year old, I was like,

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:12.960
why do I have a bigger dick than you?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.633
- Even though his father was
there his dick still looked

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:15.466
far away.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.991
- Oh that's so sad to know about your dad.

00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.180
Was it weird?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.013
- Yeah it's bad. Well, me and Yannis,

00:00:19.013 --> 00:00:19.846
Yannis Pappas is one of my best friends

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.366
we have our podcast History Hyenas,

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.920
and we bond over that,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.721
like his dad has a little dick too.

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.554
- [Nikki] Oh my God.

00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:26.387
- It's like something that we both know

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:27.220
it's like wow,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.053
why do our dads have such small dicks?

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:29.109
- My dads fucking hung like a horse.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.942
- [Nikki] Really?

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:31.283
- And that is hereditary.

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:32.116
- Yeah, goddamn

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:32.949
- Bang

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:33.782
- [Nikki] Oh my god.

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:34.977
- I don't even want to
think about my dads--

00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:36.600
- My mom has big nipples and I got them

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.433
- I did find out on my show

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.357
- Yeah I got my moms nips

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:40.190
- No way.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.335
- You got your moms dick
as well by the size of it.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:42.168
- Yeah I did.

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:43.001
It's pretty cool.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.072
- Good for you man.

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:44.905
- It's adorable.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:48.209
(upbeat rock and roll)

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:51.290
- And we're back it's
You Up with Nikki Glaser.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.123
Full studio right now,

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:53.423
we've got Chris Distefano

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:54.686
- Mhmm, what up girl?

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:55.519
- [Nikki] What up?

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.706
- I would get you foot
inserts for Valentines Day,

00:00:57.706 --> 00:00:58.897
that's what I would get you.

00:00:58.897 --> 00:00:59.977
- That's so nice!

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.973
- [Chris] Or I would get
you like a treatment for

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:03.538
you pronation, because
that's what you said

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:04.533
you suffered from, right?

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.793
- Not anymore though.

00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:06.626
It would get---

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:07.664
- I just want to touch your feet.

00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:08.993
I'm just trying to say it publicly,

00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:11.074
in not a creepy way, I
would just like to touch

00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:12.394
your feet for Valentines Day.

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:13.344
- No you don't!

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:14.177
- No, I do

00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:15.760
- [ Nikki] I've got some gnarly feet

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.802
- Girl, you haven't seen anything until

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:17.635
you see my puppies.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:19.919
- [Nikki] Really? Really?
Oh let's have a foot off.

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:20.752
- Oh, it's disgusting.

00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.232
Like Golem from Lord of the Rings

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:23.539
- Mine are so gross.

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.431
I would never take out my foot.

00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:27.876
I would rather get, like my feet right now

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:29.939
are so gross I should
have gotten a pedicure

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.772
yesterday

00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:31.605
- But like when you,

00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:33.188
- [Nikki] because I would
love to bring them out.

00:01:33.188 --> 00:01:35.254
I know that's how you feel,

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.867
but like when you popped
them out on your Comedy

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:38.928
Central show, I pressed pause.

00:01:38.928 --> 00:01:39.761
- [Nikki] (laughs)

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.186
- [Chris] I did!

00:01:41.186 --> 00:01:43.151
- Dude! That was the
grossest picture ever!

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:43.984
- I didn't think so.

00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:45.898
- Oh my god, you like me for me.

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:46.838
- You know what I think it is?

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.147
Because I think it depends on like,

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:53.078
what was like forming in
your brain as whatever--

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:54.788
- Yeah, something happened with feet.

00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:57.072
- My mom and my aunts feet are like,

00:01:57.072 --> 00:01:58.850
hideously disgusting.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.905
- So, you like a mom foot.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.486
- Yeah, I don't mind it.

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:03.319
- I keep saying that.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.983
Well, let me just intro
the rest of the room.

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:06.032
Andrew Collin is here,

00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:08.447
don't forget it puddle boy,
and then we have Daniel

00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:10.426
Sloss in studio, comedian Daniel Sloss,

00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:11.606
I'm excited to have you here,

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:13.015
I've watched all your Conans,

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.511
I'm well aware of you from that.

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.795
You've a two hour special
out now on Netflix,

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:19.912
two separate hours in one batch,

00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:20.745
- [Daniel] Yeah.

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:23.150
- On Netflix currently
called, Dark and Jigsaw

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.983
- Yeah.

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:24.816
- [Nikki] So, one's called Dark,

00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:25.649
one's called Jigsaw.

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.482
- [Daniel] Yeah.

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:27.391
- What's difference between these two?

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:28.454
- One's about my dead sister,

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:30.654
and one's about ended at 75 marriages.

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:31.670
- [Chris] Hilarious.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.845
- Wait, one's what?

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:33.678
- One is about my dead sister,

00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:36.363
and the other one it
has ended 75 marriages,

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:38.873
and 20,000 relationships.

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:39.868
- Wait, what do you mean?

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.155
- The show has caused 20,000 breakups,

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:44.317
and I'm being cited in 75
separate divorce papers.

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:45.150
- What?!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.983
- [Chris] Oh Shit!

00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:47.837
- Wait! What? How? That's awesome!

00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:48.670
- [Chris] That's awesome!

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.272
- Wait, okay can you,
(fumbles) That's crazy. Why?

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.811
Can you give me a short answer?

00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.321
- Yeah, it's my opinions on love,

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.480
and my opinions on love are correct.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.804
- Oh my god,

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:01.121
let's get into it.

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.820
What are your opinions on love?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.212
- I think we have romanticized
the idea of romance,

00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:07.540
and I think it's cancerous,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.274
I think people are so desperate

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:10.107
to get into relationships

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.149
that they're willing to
settle for just something,

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.100
because we'd rather have
something than nothing,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.115
and when you're raised in a
world of Disney princesses

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.492
and princes you sit there and go,

00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:18.365
If I'm not in a relationship

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.683
I'm a broken human being,

00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:21.393
and I hate people in relationships

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:22.985
that brag about their
relationships as if they're

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:24.576
more secure than I am in
themselves when they're

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:25.409
- Good

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.155
- Not because you never
learned how to love yourself,

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:29.475
so you employed someone
else to do it for you.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.875
- Fuck yeah dude!

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:31.708
- Yes!

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:32.541
- [Chris] I love it.

00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:35.388
First of all, number one
I feel like your Scotish

00:03:35.388 --> 00:03:36.221
me.

00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:37.054
- Yeah.

00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:39.837
- I feel like you and I,

00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:40.670
you're from Scotland right?

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.503
- I'm not into feet though.

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:42.336
- You're not into feet?

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.169
- No

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.002
- Well, no but when I

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.785
- I mean, I'll suck a to I'm not like a---

00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.533
- Yeah, but you didn't
have a weird childhood

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:49.708
foot thing happen.

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:50.541
- No.

00:03:50.541 --> 00:03:51.930
- Everyone wants their mom.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.825
Do you agree on that?

00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.465
That's my theory is that
when a guy rejects you,

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:57.265
my friends always go,

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.247
you know like he said he didn't

00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:00.204
want to be in a relationship,

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:01.169
and now he's dating this girl,

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.676
and she's not even as cute as me,

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:03.532
she's not as funny,

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:05.632
and I go, yeah because
he's looking for his mom,

00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:06.861
and she's like, but
she's not funny or cute,

00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:07.893
and I'm like neither is his mom.

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:09.537
His mom is not funny or cute,

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:12.157
and he finally found her
don't you think there's

00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:13.067
some truth to that?

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:15.957
- Sure, I'll only like a
girl if she'll fuck my dad.

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:18.367
(laughter)

00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:19.561
- That's awesome.

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.285
- So, nothing like your mom.

00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:23.535
(laughter)

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.420
- Yeah, I had a kid,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.952
like with a women that I barley knew like,

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:32.344
second, third date in got
pregnant we had a child,

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:33.947
and before I had that,

00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:37.112
I was like the opposite
of what you just said.

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:38.818
I was like, oh I want a wife,

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:39.651
and I want this,

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:41.735
but now that I have a
child I kind of understand

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.370
what like the real love towards her is.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.112
I'm with you where I'm like,

00:04:47.112 --> 00:04:48.416
I feel like some of my closest friends,

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:50.252
I knew when one of my
friends was getting married

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:51.572
I'm like you're just doing
this because you think

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:53.558
you have to do this because everyone in

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:54.737
the neighborhood is getting married,

00:04:54.737 --> 00:04:56.885
and I'm like, and I
wouldn't say this to her,

00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:59.330
I'm like this isn't
going to work in my head,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.261
you're just trying to
follow some trend right now,

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.367
you don't really love this guy.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:04.508
- Yeah.

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:05.751
- I just went and had fun at the wedding,

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:06.812
and now they're divorced.

00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:07.645
So, I'm like, you see,

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:09.665
I knew that this was going to happen.

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:11.644
It wasn't real none of it was real,

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.740
you're just,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.634
you're just a follower.

00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:16.437
- We do it emulate the rest of society,

00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:18.278
and when the rest of society
is in a relationship,

00:05:18.278 --> 00:05:20.601
and that's the pressure
that the rest of the world

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:22.001
puts on you.

00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:23.301
Nobody talks about how
shit their relationship

00:05:23.301 --> 00:05:24.134
actually is.

00:05:24.134 --> 00:05:24.967
- Yeah.

00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:25.800
- Because we live in the
Instagram generation of,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.637
Me and this one going for coffee,

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:29.343
climbing a goddamn fucking hill together.

00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:31.575
You're like, oh my god Sarah loves John,

00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:32.642
and John's a dick.

00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:35.183
So, therefore, it must be worth it to stay

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:36.184
in this relationship with this terrible

00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:37.017
fucking human being,

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:38.796
and then you just end up banging someone,

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:39.629
and they make you cum,

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:40.971
and you're like fucking this will do.

00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:41.804
- Yep.

00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:42.745
- [Daniel] This is me forever.

00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:44.087
- Because marriage it's kind of like

00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:45.801
an archaic principle anyway.

00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:48.220
You only used to know the
people in your village

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.281
when marriage was a thing,

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.036
it was a business decision.

00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:52.774
- And also, all of our
grandfathers were stalkers.

00:05:52.774 --> 00:05:55.250
Every single one of our grand
fathers every story is always:

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.262
So, your gran didn't like me at first,

00:05:57.262 --> 00:05:58.834
and then I wore her down,

00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:00.563
you're like, gee she's
not a fucking horse,

00:06:00.563 --> 00:06:03.089
what are you talking about?

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:04.722
- Yeah. I agree man.

00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:06.288
- [Nikki] It is, but there,

00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:08.443
okay I've always been on like this,

00:06:08.443 --> 00:06:11.505
marriage is an archaic thing,

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:12.566
and I don't need it,

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.597
and it's bound to fail,

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:17.497
you change too much to
be with someone forever,

00:06:17.497 --> 00:06:21.969
but then I do see marriages
where it looks like,

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:22.837
there are some good ones,

00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:25.190
but they're few and far between.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.406
- Yeah, yeah, I'm not
against relationships,

00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:28.791
and I'm not against true love,

00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:30.722
what I am against is people getting into

00:06:30.722 --> 00:06:33.251
fucking relationships because
they feel they have to.

00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:35.744
Like I do believe, I want to get married,

00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:36.653
and I want to have kids,

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:37.486
I know that for a fact.

00:06:37.486 --> 00:06:40.298
But, I'm not gonna fucking
jam the first person

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:44.145
that walks into my goddamn
life into that place.

00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:45.539
I'm not going to force it to happen,

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.208
and I believe that 90%
of relationships are

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:49.041
- [Chris] I agree

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.461
- People that force
these things to happen,

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:52.119
and that's why the
divorce rate is so high,

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:53.449
and I know it's true because my show,

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:54.438
when I say this opinion,

00:06:54.438 --> 00:06:56.324
has caused 20,000 fucking breakups.

00:06:56.324 --> 00:06:57.741
I know I'm right.

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:00.658
- Great.

00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:04.083
- What do you think the secret
is to a good marriage though?

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:06.033
- Love yourself--

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:07.597
- You love yourself, that is essential.

00:07:07.597 --> 00:07:09.479
- Yeah because otherwise
if you don't love yourself,

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.285
you're going to employ
someone else to fucking do it

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:12.118
for you.

00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:13.306
- Or you're going to pick
someone who doesn't really

00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:15.108
love you either because
if you don't love yourself

00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:17.747
you can't love someone
who actually loves you

00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:18.785
because you're gonna be like,

00:07:18.785 --> 00:07:19.654
you have bad taste.

00:07:19.654 --> 00:07:21.134
You're not going to really trust them.

00:07:21.134 --> 00:07:22.829
- Yeah, you don't respect them.

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:26.946
Just like how could you possibly
fuck me on a regular basis?

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:31.749
- Yeah, you have to love
yourself, (fumbles),

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:32.582
yeah, I don't know.

00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:34.368
- Also, I think curiosity man.

00:07:34.368 --> 00:07:35.201
I think when you're in your twenties,

00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:37.081
shag fucking everything, right?

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:40.011
Curiosity is the number
one cause of divorce.

00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:41.717
I reckon, you sit there,
people get married too young,

00:07:41.717 --> 00:07:43.681
and then they get to 28 or 30,

00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:44.763
and they go fuck,

00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:45.596
What if I was single?

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:46.429
What if I was single?

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:48.444
I reckon I'd get so much pussy or dick,

00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:49.277
and you wouldn't,

00:07:49.277 --> 00:07:50.845
but you don't know that because you've got

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.143
married when you were fucking 19.

00:07:52.143 --> 00:07:54.270
- And I think it happens
naturally because 20s,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.793
even like early 30s, I was like that,

00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.978
Just, whatever I just
wanna get with girls,

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.179
I wanna have sex, sex, sex, whatever.

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:01.336
But now I'm 34, now I'm
like I don't want to just

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:03.096
keep hooking up with women,

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:05.400
because I don't want to get mono.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.734
I just don't want to get sick.

00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:10.779
- I'm sorry, your biggest,
the STD you're most scared of

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:11.987
is the fucking kissing disease.

00:08:11.987 --> 00:08:13.135
- Mononucleosis. Absolutley

00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:13.968
- [Nikki] He just makes-out.

00:08:13.968 --> 00:08:14.926
- [Andrew] And athlete's
foot, he hates athlete's foot.

00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:16.839
- [Daniel] You don't
get mono if you eat ass,

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.672
that's the secret.

00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:19.624
- Hey, I don't know about that,

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.932
you could it depends.

00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:25.149
- Jigsaw though, is the one
that people have cited in their

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:25.982
divorce papers.

00:08:25.982 --> 00:08:27.820
- Yeah I've got somebody come into my show

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.057
in New York next week,

00:08:29.057 --> 00:08:30.686
and she's bringing her divorce papers

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:32.158
because I want to get photos of it

00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:33.628
because people genuinely question,

00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:34.622
are you making these up.

00:08:34.622 --> 00:08:35.455
- That's dope.

00:08:35.455 --> 00:08:36.288
- And I'm like no, no, no.

00:08:36.288 --> 00:08:37.121
This is all true.

00:08:37.121 --> 00:08:39.719
- I feel like, I've had
couples like breakup---

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:40.552
oh, you know what?

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:42.129
Couples bang after my shows.

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:45.190
There's a lot of anal
that's been happening from

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.193
my comedy, and like banging,

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.385
but I also think I make
people look at their

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:50.218
significant other,

00:08:50.218 --> 00:08:52.134
and kinda go, what's going--
it's nice raise those---

00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:53.866
- You know what's interesting?

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.465
There was a girl who went
to your show last night,

00:08:55.465 --> 00:08:57.287
I guess you did the Cellar
last night, you did?

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.120
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.294
- She DM'd me at like 2am she's like,

00:08:59.294 --> 00:09:02.458
just saw Nikki's show are you up? So...

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:03.291
- What?

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:04.625
- Yeah so she was just like you know?

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:05.458
- She was horned up.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:07.391
- [Chris] So you made
somebody horny, yeah.

00:09:07.391 --> 00:09:09.046
- Dude, I swear to God
I make people horny,

00:09:09.046 --> 00:09:10.344
and it's not my intention,

00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:11.582
but if you're talking about sex,

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:13.562
and I'm telling guys like what to do,

00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:15.592
and so I think they want
to go home and like do it.

00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:16.425
- [Chris] Yes.

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:17.258
- [Daniel] Yeah, yeah,
it's like the life lesson

00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:18.091
they go, I'm gonna go home,

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.976
and take this new knowledge
that I've gathered,

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.037
and absolutely take it home--

00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:23.202
- It's pretty much a TED
talk at this point in my act,

00:09:23.202 --> 00:09:25.468
and I don't care, it's like
I do it in a funny way,

00:09:25.468 --> 00:09:27.201
but like people are learning stuff,

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:30.001
and it sounds like people
are learning stuff from this.

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:31.595
- Absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:32.987
and also there's other things as well,

00:09:32.987 --> 00:09:35.217
there's I talk about
shaving your ass in my show.

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:36.050
Not a lot of people know.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.457
- Oh right, wait what, you're for it?

00:09:38.457 --> 00:09:40.099
- For it, yeah, absolutely.

00:09:40.099 --> 00:09:42.460
Like nobody wants to
look at a hairy ass hole.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.675
- [Nikki] It's the easiest
thing to shave dude.

00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:46.351
- I've never, I've never
done anything with the ass,

00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:49.047
I've never received any
ass stuff or given any

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:49.880
ass stuff to the woman.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.713
- Man, get a digit up the
shit, it's fucking the best.

00:09:50.713 --> 00:09:51.546
- I gotta do it?

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:52.633
Yeah alright, I'm in.

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:54.374
- It does, like, it
does feel pretty great.

00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:56.147
- I just don't have a good asshole for it.

00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:57.638
- [Chris] I just feel
like it's a nightmare.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:58.471
- [Daniel] It's self care.

00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:00.229
- No, I know--

00:10:00.229 --> 00:10:03.604
- No, he has, he has a lot of ass issues.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.215
- [Daniel] I will shave
your fucking asshole.

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:06.411
Nothing gay about it.

00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:07.966
I absolutely will. I'll be graceful.

00:10:07.966 --> 00:10:09.630
But like with a close shave razor,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.094
like the Turkish barber sort of thing.

00:10:11.094 --> 00:10:14.759
- [Andrew] Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Like a bowling ball?

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.643
- [Nikki] If women, I would
love to grow out the front,

00:10:16.643 --> 00:10:17.935
and have nothing in back,

00:10:17.935 --> 00:10:19.340
because the back it doesn't
even hurt to remove like,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.881
that part of getting your---

00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.229
- Like the opposite of a mullet kind of

00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:23.458
- Vagina waxed is the best part

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:24.291
- You know when you get in,

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:26.134
and you get a complete waxing Jen?

00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:26.967
- [Jen] Yes.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.963
- Okay, the front part
hurts so much, it's the,

00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:29.855
- [Jen] Yeah

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:30.979
- It's the, I mean I've stopped
doing it because it's like,

00:10:30.979 --> 00:10:33.162
I'm subjecting myself to
the worst pain imaginable,

00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:34.134
and I get stressed before,

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.169
and after, and I hate it,

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:37.786
but the best part is when she's like,

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:39.192
can you bend over and I'm like,

00:10:39.192 --> 00:10:41.151
Oh yeah! Let's get back there. It's like,

00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:43.487
you don't even feel it at that point.

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:45.722
For some reason it's
much more enjoyable an

00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:46.555
experience back there,

00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:47.587
- [Jen] Yes.

00:10:47.587 --> 00:10:49.219
- Than the front.

00:10:49.219 --> 00:10:51.660
- And how long does the
Brazilian last? What are you---

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.923
- How long is a piece of string?

00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:55.163
- A week and a half before it's

00:10:55.163 --> 00:10:57.102
- A week and half though
you're doing this pain

00:10:57.102 --> 00:10:57.935
for a week and a half.

00:10:57.935 --> 00:10:58.768
- I personally like a bush.

00:10:58.768 --> 00:10:59.623
Personally I don't mind hair--

00:10:59.623 --> 00:11:00.456
- A full bush?

00:11:00.456 --> 00:11:03.439
- I don't know, I've
just never thought one---

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:06.393
like once I'm in the mode
sexually I just don't care--

00:11:06.393 --> 00:11:07.246
- Exactly.

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:09.587
(chatter)

00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:11.210
- [Daniel] I don't want a mustache.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.043
- You want a buffer.

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:13.809
- [Daniel] I'm just not
used to facial hair.

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:15.995
- I get not like, like
it would be preferable

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:19.242
if we were all had no
hair because hair is like,

00:11:19.242 --> 00:11:20.174
it's not ideal,

00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:21.007
but like...

00:11:21.007 --> 00:11:22.487
- What's the point of pubic
hair, I guess there's---

00:11:22.487 --> 00:11:23.987
- It keeps, insects,

00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:26.904
so if you feel the bugs getting in,

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:29.433
and warm

00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:31.350
- [Andrew] Warm, warmth

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:34.119
- But, why's it not on
the rest of my dick then?

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:34.952
That makes no sense,

00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:36.259
like my bellend's not fucking hairy.

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:37.691
- [Nikki] That's a good point.

00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:40.416
- [Andrew] Speak for yourself.

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:42.531
- Is that why you all get
circumcised over here?

00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:44.346
- Oh yeah, yeah that's a...
It looks a little cuter.

00:11:44.346 --> 00:11:45.179
- Oh yeah.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:46.451
- You look like you have a cute piece.

00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:48.365
- It's very cute. That's
exactly how I would describe

00:11:48.365 --> 00:11:50.631
my dick. It's adorable.

00:11:50.631 --> 00:11:53.564
- Yeah so when they say, aww
it's like a Disney character,

00:11:53.564 --> 00:11:54.397
it's got like---

00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:56.723
- It's a good look it's just not (mumbles)

00:11:56.723 --> 00:11:57.806
- Yeah, put googly eyes
on it occasionally.

00:11:57.806 --> 00:11:59.456
- [Nikki] It's not what?

00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:00.347
- It's not filling really.

00:12:00.347 --> 00:12:01.180
(laughter)

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.463
I'm not a grower or a shower really so,

00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:05.579
- No, I would say you have
a nice, average size, good

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:06.412
piece.

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:08.905
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:12.020
- Nothing wild about it.
Is it me? I'm just about

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.853
six-seven, it's just fine.

00:12:12.853 --> 00:12:13.757
- Six-seven?

00:12:13.757 --> 00:12:14.590
- It's just fine.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.506
- [Chris] Maybe, maybe six, I don't know

00:12:15.506 --> 00:12:17.541
- Between six and seven
is a very big difference.

00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.341
- You know what my cross to bare is?

00:12:19.341 --> 00:12:21.279
So, I have an over active Cowper's gland.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.281
- [Nikki] Yeah

00:12:22.281 --> 00:12:25.227
- It makes sperm, so like, I---

00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:26.060
- Have huge loads?

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.014
- I have huge loads,

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:29.812
but it takes a while to rejuvenate so,

00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:31.002
my doctor once told me,

00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:34.674
I'm a perfect guy if a
woman wants to have children

00:12:34.674 --> 00:12:36.479
because I have a lot of sperm per load.

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:39.600
But if they're just looking to have--

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.462
- Are you like filling
her up like a fucking

00:12:40.462 --> 00:12:41.295
cream pudding?

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.443
Just coming out of her eyes
like that bit in Wolverine.

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:43.600
- But like in your situation
with like the Texas

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.524
lesbians, I'm not the right guy because

00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:47.720
I can't have, like if I have sex once,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.840
I can't have sex now again for a few days.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.673
- Wow

00:12:50.673 --> 00:12:52.308
- But, if you're looking to have a baby,

00:12:52.308 --> 00:12:55.297
I can get you pregnant every shot.

00:12:55.297 --> 00:12:56.488
- [Nikki] Right

00:12:56.488 --> 00:12:58.082
- [Andrew] Wait, you
can't cum more than once

00:12:58.082 --> 00:12:58.915
every couple days?

00:12:58.915 --> 00:12:59.780
- [Daniel] It's a numbers game.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.936
- Well, I can, but it (fumbles),

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:04.450
I certainly can't have sex twice in a day.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.573
But I really never could.

00:13:05.573 --> 00:13:07.712
- [Andrew] This guy came
twice on a plane in a hour.

00:13:07.712 --> 00:13:08.545
- I know

00:13:08.545 --> 00:13:09.378
- [Chris] I know.

00:13:09.378 --> 00:13:10.433
- [Daniel] It's the sequel
to Snakes on a Plane

00:13:10.433 --> 00:13:11.779
- Maybe you can't have kids.

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:14.452
- But, that's my cross to bare with shit.

00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:17.443
- It's that you need a couple days buffer

00:13:17.443 --> 00:13:19.755
before you're ready

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:21.252
to give a good load.

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:22.572
- If you want a kid though,

00:13:22.572 --> 00:13:23.546
I'm your guy.

00:13:23.546 --> 00:13:25.260
- Every couple days if you want a kid.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.599
- Every couple days, if you want a kid,

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:28.579
we can try this because
it's so much sperm per load.

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:31.052
But, it takes a while---

00:13:31.052 --> 00:13:32.786
- I love that this is a selling point,

00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:34.109
but who wants that.

00:13:34.109 --> 00:13:36.276
(chatter)

00:13:40.795 --> 00:13:43.992
- Would you do that for a lesbian couple?

00:13:43.992 --> 00:13:44.825
- Sure.

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:47.157
- Because I think that you would be a---

00:13:47.157 --> 00:13:50.449
you're offering this
right now, on the show.

00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:53.476
- No, I donated sperm when I was twenty---

00:13:53.476 --> 00:13:54.309
- Seven cups.

00:13:54.309 --> 00:13:56.275
- Twenty seven, yeah,

00:13:56.275 --> 00:13:58.467
but I signed papers to never know,

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:00.345
I didn't want to know anything so,

00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:01.178
I could have a child.

00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:02.413
I possibly do.

00:14:02.413 --> 00:14:03.473
- Whoa!

00:14:03.473 --> 00:14:04.435
- [Daniel] By the sounds of things,

00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:05.601
you've got thousands.

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:08.696
- Well, yeah I was told by
the people at the clinic,

00:14:08.696 --> 00:14:10.684
that, It's up to me---

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.124
- Please stop this is too much.

00:14:12.124 --> 00:14:13.175
- No, they tell you like,

00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:15.564
where they think your sperm

00:14:15.564 --> 00:14:17.711
- We're gonna need a bigger boat!

00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:19.162
(laughter)

00:14:19.162 --> 00:14:20.486
- And they were saying because of---

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:21.319
- [Andrew] Get the bowl!

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.005
- Yeah because of how
much, yeah, absolutely,

00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:25.045
I probably got used.

00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:25.878
- [Nikki] You definitely got used!

00:14:25.878 --> 00:14:26.711
- [Andrew] When you jerked off when you--

00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:28.533
- Is there like a picture of you?

00:14:28.533 --> 00:14:29.366
- There's a picture of me,

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:30.337
and a level of education---

00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:31.828
- Yeah, yeah, yeah you got used.

00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:33.571
- [Chris] Those were the things.

00:14:33.571 --> 00:14:34.404
- [Andrew] Oh wow.

00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:36.542
- Yeah, so they were like,
this is prob... most likely--

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:37.390
- You have kids out there--

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.315
- Probably

00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:39.379
- [Nikki] (screams)

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.247
That's crazy!

00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:41.080
- Probably I do.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.913
- [Andrew] More kids.

00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:42.746
- More kids, more kids, yeah.

00:14:42.746 --> 00:14:43.579
- You'll be on Maury soon.

00:14:43.579 --> 00:14:44.412
- Absolutely.

00:14:44.412 --> 00:14:45.245
- [Andrew] Yeah

00:14:45.245 --> 00:14:47.374
- But they can't ever
contact me, they have no way,

00:14:47.374 --> 00:14:48.207
of well---

00:14:48.207 --> 00:14:49.160
- [Daniel] They'll know when they see you

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.740
how fucking huge their loads are,

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.097
and when they have their first wank,

00:14:53.097 --> 00:14:57.171
and they're like oh my
god he's my father---

00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:58.556
- What if they take a picture of you,

00:14:58.556 --> 00:14:59.389
- I know.

00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:00.222
- What if they took a picture of you,

00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:01.198
and then they see you on T.V,

00:15:01.198 --> 00:15:02.959
and they go that's the
guy who's load they chose.

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:04.602
- They might if they
reach out, they reach out.

00:15:04.602 --> 00:15:06.374
I wouldn't mind, but at the time.

00:15:06.374 --> 00:15:08.005
- [Nikki] Yeah, but you're not gonna

00:15:08.005 --> 00:15:09.198
- Yeah I mean at the
time it was just like,

00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:10.391
you know I'm just doing this because

00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:12.264
- Did you notice as a kid when you like,

00:15:12.264 --> 00:15:15.731
jerked off early on that you
had and insane amount of cum?

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:17.606
- Well, I just,---

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:18.985
- Compared to your friends---

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:19.818
- Yeah

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.125
- That you were jerking off next...

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.517
I mean, like, what are
you comparing it to?

00:15:22.517 --> 00:15:24.037
- Yeah it's definitely a lot.

00:15:24.037 --> 00:15:24.870
- [Nikki] It is just what you have.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.703
You just think it's normal probably.

00:15:25.703 --> 00:15:27.038
- Yeah I just didn't know,

00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:28.085
but it is, it is,

00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:30.522
but I noticed after having
sexual encounters with

00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:33.408
girls would be like how much
fucking cum do you have dude?

00:15:33.408 --> 00:15:34.972
Like, it was so much.

00:15:34.972 --> 00:15:38.720
I was like, I don't know
what it's supposed to be.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.865
- The girl afterwards is just like,

00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:40.835
I think I put on weight.

00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:42.540
- [Chris] I just thought
it was supposed to be,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.671
it was so white, and I was just like,

00:15:44.671 --> 00:15:47.286
I don't know I thought
that this is what it was.

00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:52.137
- Wow. What have people been
learning from your special?

00:15:52.137 --> 00:15:53.642
Your special just came
out a couple weeks ago so,

00:15:53.642 --> 00:15:55.544
Size 38 Waist, what's the
feedback you're getting,

00:15:55.544 --> 00:15:57.491
what are people taking from that?

00:15:57.491 --> 00:15:59.486
- You know what the
feedback actually has been?

00:15:59.486 --> 00:16:00.773
Which I'm actually happy about,

00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:04.769
is a lot of people have
been saying similar things,

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:06.477
like hey I'm happy there's a comic

00:16:06.477 --> 00:16:07.870
like nowadays that's like,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.961
taking a chance in the sense of like,

00:16:10.961 --> 00:16:12.650
saying words that you really

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.483
shouldn't say,

00:16:13.483 --> 00:16:15.096
like in my special I say
my dad calls me a homo

00:16:15.096 --> 00:16:16.486
for eating blueberry yogurt,

00:16:16.486 --> 00:16:18.687
and their like, I'm
happy that you said that,

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.208
and like gay people too have been like,

00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:22.240
you're not censoring your words,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.159
and you're saying what it is

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:25.257
- Well, you're being honest

00:16:25.257 --> 00:16:27.736
- We like that you're
being somewhat honest.

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:28.982
- What do you mean somewhat?

00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:30.105
- Well, no, I mean, you know...

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:31.689
- Everything's exaggerated for humor.

00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:33.058
- He never said homo

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.373
(laughs)

00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:36.045
- My dad? No my dad does---

00:16:36.045 --> 00:16:37.374
- We all know what he actually said

00:16:37.374 --> 00:16:41.345
- Oh yeah exactly.He used
the other word that,---

00:16:41.345 --> 00:16:43.533
- Faghips, that's what he said.

00:16:43.533 --> 00:16:45.241
- Yeah, yeah, so,

00:16:45.241 --> 00:16:47.663
that has been the overwhelming

00:16:47.663 --> 00:16:48.626
- Sure

00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:50.511
- And a lot of people have been saying,

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.584
I feel like you're just
having a conversation with me.

00:16:52.584 --> 00:16:53.719
Which, I like.

00:16:53.719 --> 00:16:55.897
Because I'm not the comedian who's like,

00:16:55.897 --> 00:16:57.493
oh here's my joke, here's my joke.

00:16:57.493 --> 00:16:58.582
I like it when people like,

00:16:58.582 --> 00:17:00.910
oh you were just being funny for an hour,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.401
as opposed to: here's my next joke,

00:17:02.401 --> 00:17:03.234
here's my next joke.

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:07.711
So, the feedback that I wanted
is what I've been getting.

00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:08.544
- That's great.

00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:12.123
- And so far, nobody
has shit on it too hard.

00:17:12.123 --> 00:17:13.347
- Then that means it's good.

00:17:13.347 --> 00:17:14.180
- Yeah, yeah

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.391
- Noa watched it, right?

00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:16.541
- [Off Camera] Yeah!

00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:17.374
- Loved it.

00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:18.207
- [Noa] Loved it.

00:17:18.207 --> 00:17:19.040
- [Chris] Thanks!

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.873
- [Nikki] She was like,
yeah she really loved it.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:21.908
- That was my Bay Ridge girl.

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:23.870
- She's being modest right now,

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.703
but you like.

00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:25.536
- [Chris] Enjoyed it.

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:26.849
- Yeah, no, it was awesome.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.449
I watched it a couple of times

00:17:28.449 --> 00:17:30.082
- You watched it a couple of times?

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:30.915
Girl.

00:17:30.915 --> 00:17:33.700
You spaced it out over
a couple of days right?

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.330
(laughter)

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.838
- Yeah.

00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:39.469
- You didn't want to get pregnant watching

00:17:39.469 --> 00:17:40.302
- I did get pregnant.

00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:42.465
I took a pill though, sorry Chris.

00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:43.298
- Hey,

00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:45.297
- With the size of his loads
you need like seven pills.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.880
- The pill was Daniel's special.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.880
(laughter)

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.380
(upbeat rock)
