The last topic I want to cover in

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.939
this lesson is architectural styles. So, let's see

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.400
what those architectural styles are. There are certain

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.240
design choices that when applied in a given context

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.420
regularly result in solutions with superior properties. What

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.290
this means is that, compared to other possible alternatives,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.952
these solutions are more elegant, effective, efficient, dependable,

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:25.560
evolve-able, scale-able, and so on. Architectural styles capture exactly

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.490
these solutions. They capture idioms that we can

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.870
use when designing a system. For a more formal

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.160
definition, let's look how Mary Shaw and David Garlan

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.480
define a architectural style. They say that an architectural

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.000
style defines a family of systems in terms

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.550
of a pattern of structural organization; a vocabulary of

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.880
components and connectors and constraints on how these components

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.620
and connectors can be combined. So in summary we

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.650
can say that an architectural style is a named collection

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.680
of architectural design decisions applicable in a given context. And I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.100
want to stress that it is important to study and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.670
know these architectural styles for several reasons. Because knowing them allows

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.660
us to avoid reinventing the wheel. It also allows us

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.330
to choose the right solution to a known problem and in

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.910
some cases it even allows us to move on and

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.400
discover even more advanced styles if we know the basic ones.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.340
So we should be familiar with architectural styles, what

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.000
they are, and in which context they work, and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800
in which context they do not work. So as

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.090
to be able to apply them in the right situations.
