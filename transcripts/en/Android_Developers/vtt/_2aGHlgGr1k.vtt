&gt;&gt; JACK: Hi. My name is Jack and I work on
the calendar application for Android. I'd

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.560
like to tell you about two features today
that I really like about the calendar application.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.209
One is that you can have public calendars
on your phone. So, for example, if you forget

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.429
one Easter's, you can have the Christian holidays
on the phone. You can also have all the U.S.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.960
holidays. And there are many other public
calendars that you can load. Another thing

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.890
I like is the auto-link feature. For example,
if you have a web URL imbedded in anywhere

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.399
in the text of the event, that URL is automatically
linked, so that if you select it, it will

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.340
take you to the browser and bring up that
web page. Likewise, if you have a phone number

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.559
and you select that phone number, it will
take you to the dialer where you can make

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.989
the call.
