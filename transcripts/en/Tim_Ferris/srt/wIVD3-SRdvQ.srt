1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,490
I used to drink coffee every
morning and I still love coffee,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,520
but I prefer a new cocktail
and the ingredients are
black and green tape blended

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,970
coconut oil and butter
from grass fed cows.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,710
My favorite teas are polarity,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,960
which is an aged black tea from China
has some critical applications for fat

6
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:21,040
loss among other things.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,900
Then that comes in these large bricks
that are typically uh, air dried.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,940
You can also get embers,
but they're very,

9
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:32,650
very hard to find and green tea
from Japan. Could we say sentia,

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,890
K B U s C.
Sencha.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,780
The way I'm going to make
this team because I have a
canister tea basket full of

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,240
the who error in green team.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,510
I'm going to pour hot water
over that and it can really,

14
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:49,840
you can really beat the hell
out of it who Eric can tolerate.

15
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,240
Very high temperature especially.

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,970
Typically what I like to do with this
too is I will let this steep the first

17
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:02,620
steep for about 30 to 60 seconds.

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,070
If you ever want to decaffeinate
your t here's a, here's a tip.

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,270
You steep it really quickly and hot water.
I mean say 180 degrees or hotter,

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,710
I mean I'd let it,

21
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:15,010
let it cool off from boiling for a few
minutes and then pour out the first

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,210
Stephen, that'll get rid of 70 80% of
the caffeine from the leaves themselves.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,810
So let that sit and then we're going to
do the same thing in another because I'm

24
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:29,590
actually gonna use this to drink the tea
and there are many different ways to do

25
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:33,010
this. This is one that's, that's
helpful for doing it on the road.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,740
So I'm gonna let this steep
for about two minutes.

27
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,770
In the meantime I'm going to do is get
my butter and I'm going to put in a

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,180
tablespoon for me to intestinal comfort.

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,370
One tablespoon of coconut oil,

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,950
which is about 40 to 60% medium
chain triglyceride by weight.

31
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,770
That's why you putting it in there, MCTs,
and then you're going to let him out.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,560
You watch it all.
You can stirred up

33
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,510
all that fatty deliciousness
coming to the top.

34
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,840
We'll take our second bit of tea.
Now

35
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,343
put an m.

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,770
And what I found through experimentation
is that you can certainly blend this

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,660
and I actually travel with a small
pocket size blender for that purpose,

38
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,050
but just as easily you can grab a couple
of mixing sticks or spinning and mixed

39
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,020
up and you're in good shape.
If you want to head on it like a Guinness.

40
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,980
Then she uses the blender

41
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,440
is delicious.

42
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,870
