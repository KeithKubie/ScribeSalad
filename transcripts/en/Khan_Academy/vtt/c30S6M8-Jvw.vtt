00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Instructor] in this
video I want to look

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.645
at popular uprisings in
late medieval Europe.

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:05.977
So we're talking about between roughly

00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:08.541
the 14th and the 16th centuries.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.508
And these are sometimes
known as peasants' revolts,

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:13.539
and we'll talk a little
later about whether or not

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.025
that's a really an appropriate term given

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:18.740
who actually participated in the events.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.910
But for now, we'll refer to
them as popular uprisings,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.788
which means that they involved
a lot of common people.

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.249
As we look at these events,

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.533
we want to keep two questions in mind,

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.538
sort of big-picture questions.

00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:35.845
The first is why did
people choose to revolt

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:37.052
against their government?

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:39.531
And especially after about the 1320s,

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:43.448
we see a huge number of
these popular uprisings

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.852
in a way that just didn't
happen prior to this point.

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:49.314
So why did this happen?

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:51.020
Why did people rebel?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.378
And secondly, we want to think about

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:54.898
were these uprisings successful?

00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:57.009
And if so, what does success look like

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.731
in these circumstances?

00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.101
So I want to start with
a specific example,

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.255
and that example is the
Peasants' Revolt in England.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:09.146
This occurs in the year 1381.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.093
So we have a picture here,

00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:15.086
and this is a picture from The
Chronicles of Jean Froissart,

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:18.583
and he is writing his
chronicles of what's going on

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.815
at the same time that
these events are occurring.

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.089
So it's a contemporary account.

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:24.838
The picture is actually from later.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:26.821
It's added back into the Chronicles later,

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:30.048
so the picture is not entirely
accurate of the period,

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.972
but it does give us a sense
of what it might look like

00:01:32.972 --> 00:01:34.355
for the king to be confronted

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:37.652
by thousands of angry subjects.

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:39.963
But to go into what they were doing there,

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:41.489
I want to start with a quote

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.270
and this again comes from The
Chronicles of Jean Froissart

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.529
that I mentioned and this is a quote

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:49.373
that he attributes to John Ball.

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:53.540
John Ball is an English priest
who is preaching at this time

00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.776
and is considered maybe
one of the instigators,

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:02.608
one of the people who helps
start this revolt in 1381

00:02:02.608 --> 00:02:05.007
and part of that is he's spreading ideas

00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:08.005
that challenge the existing
authority structure.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.327
And he goes on and says,
"Ah ye good people,

00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:14.700
"the matters goeth not
well to pass in England,"

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.935
and that's kind of an
old-time way of saying

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:19.569
things aren't going well in England.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.030
And then he goes on and says,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.365
"Nor shall not do till
everything be common

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:27.168
"and that there be no
villains nor gentlemen,

00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:29.808
"but that we may all be united together

00:02:29.808 --> 00:02:33.750
"and that the lords be no
greater masters than we be it."

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.750
So what he's saying there is we have

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.017
this structure of society in England

00:02:38.017 --> 00:02:39.797
where there are the gentlemen,

00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:41.547
the people who are part of the nobility,

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:42.815
and they have this access

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:45.989
to political power and economic power.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.292
And then we have all these other people

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:52.008
who have to basically do work
to support this nobility.

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.316
And he says we should really all be equal

00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:59.051
and things aren't going to be
well in England until we are.

00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:00.629
So that's a pretty radical message

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.212
especially for a medieval
European country.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:07.003
And he goes on and askes this question

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.012
and says, "What have we, what
have we the common people

00:03:10.012 --> 00:03:14.143
deserved or why should we
be kept thus in servage,

00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:16.067
servitude or bondage,

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:17.819
"We be all come from one father

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.134
"and one mother, Adam and Eve,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.043
"whereby can they say or show that

00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:24.562
"they'd be greater lords than we be."

00:03:24.562 --> 00:03:26.757
And what he's doing
there is making an appeal

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:29.025
to the Old Testament of the Bible

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.034
and saying that everybody is descended

00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:33.619
from the same pair of people.

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.813
So we all really are equal in that sense,

00:03:35.813 --> 00:03:39.068
so why is it that the nobility have access

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:41.303
to this greater power and wealth.

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:43.535
I should point out that
this idea of challenging

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:46.290
the social hierarchy is not the
only thing that's motivating

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.305
rebels in the Peasants'
revolt in England here.

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:50.557
There are a lot of other factors,

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:52.516
and we'll talk about those a little later.

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:54.752
So when we talk about
medieval European society,

00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:57.230
before this point we have a structure

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.230
that has three estates, three levels

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.414
or classes you could think of this as.

00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:06.873
And we have the clergy
which are priests or friars,

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.558
and basically anyone
involved with the church

00:04:09.558 --> 00:04:12.561
and that is the group of those who pray.

00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:15.318
You have the nobility and this
is going to be your Knights,

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:19.012
your people who are in control
of large tracts of land

00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:23.153
that they hold in service to
the king and to the kingdom

00:04:23.153 --> 00:04:25.022
and those are the people who fight.

00:04:25.022 --> 00:04:27.459
And then at the bottom you
have the people who work,

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.467
which is including most of the population.

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.874
Remember this is a low
technology agricultural society.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:37.078
We're talking about probably
90% plus of the population

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:40.119
is involved in agricultural
production in some way.

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:42.350
So this is the largest chunk of society

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.506
and they refer to that as the peasantry.

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.806
So to recap that your your model is

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:49.044
you have those who pray, those who fight,

00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:50.511
and those who work.

00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:54.218
The society needs all of these
roles to function properly,

00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:56.052
so all of them are important.

00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:57.913
So we want to think about how do we go

00:04:57.913 --> 00:04:59.427
from this situation where we have

00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.699
this relatively stable social order

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.283
where the different estates are seen

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:06.980
as more or less equally
important members of society

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.908
to what we see in England in 1381

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:11.855
where the people rise up and challenge

00:05:11.855 --> 00:05:14.454
the authority of the king.

00:05:14.454 --> 00:05:17.992
So there are three broad areas of analysis

00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:20.224
that we can use to better understand why

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:23.275
we see these popular revolts breaking out

00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:25.509
throughout the 14th century.

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.543
The first one of those is demographics

00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:30.030
or the study of population.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.183
And we have two major
events that significantly

00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:34.699
impact Europe's population here.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.098
The first one is the Great Famine

00:05:37.098 --> 00:05:40.015
which occurs between 1315 and 1317,

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:45.590
and that refers to a sequence
of poor agricultural harvests

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.690
due to poor weather for
agriculture at this time.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.354
The other event that has a major impact

00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:54.809
on Europe's population is
the outbreak of the plague,

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.800
the Black Death it's called,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.133
which occurs between 1347 and 1349 here.

00:06:01.788 --> 00:06:04.028
And this ends up killing between a third

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.259
and a half of Europe's population.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.511
So what you see is a big increase

00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:11.594
in how much it costs to hire workers.

00:06:12.577 --> 00:06:14.930
And you actually see
in England for example,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.347
in 1349 and 1351,

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:20.289
you see a couple of laws passed

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.838
that try to keep workers
wages at pre-plague levels.

00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:27.072
So it's a response to the fact that

00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:29.028
there are now fewer workers and that makes

00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:30.471
workers more expensive.

00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.027
On top of that, you also
have the Hundred Years' War

00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:34.705
going on between England and France.

00:06:34.705 --> 00:06:37.664
It starts in 1337 and drags on actually

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.048
for more than a hundred years,

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:41.244
but that's the name they've given it.

00:06:41.244 --> 00:06:42.732
But that's expensive.

00:06:42.732 --> 00:06:46.383
That costs both governments a lot of money

00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:49.187
to keep fighting and
maintaining militaries

00:06:49.187 --> 00:06:50.728
and so at the same time that you have

00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:53.290
these economic problems and struggles,

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.168
you also have government's
raising taxes on people

00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:58.889
to try and pay for this conflict.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.046
And the last thing that helps explain

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:03.477
some of these uprisings
these popular uprisings,

00:07:03.477 --> 00:07:06.280
we saw a little bit already
in John Ball's quote,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.681
but we have religious and cultural issues

00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:10.059
going on as well.

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:11.702
The mendicant orders,

00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:14.791
the Franciscans and the
Dominicans who are friars,

00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:18.081
who go around and preach to common people

00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:22.708
and preach the value of
poverty and simple living.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.101
So when you have nobility who are living

00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.350
very lavish and extravagant lifestyles,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.350
you have some some pushback
against that as being

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.702
perhaps against the popular
religious attitudes of the time.

00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:38.543
I mentioned at the beginning
that we would talk a little bit

00:07:38.543 --> 00:07:40.568
about whether or not a peasant revolt

00:07:40.568 --> 00:07:42.894
was the proper name for these events.

00:07:42.894 --> 00:07:47.208
And we have in 1358 an event,
known as the Jacquerie,

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:50.150
which is a popular uprising
in the north of France

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.847
spurred because of issues relating

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.046
to the Hundred Years' War, actually.

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:58.258
And the Jacquerie gets
its name from the fact

00:07:58.258 --> 00:08:02.744
that common people kind
of generically called,

00:08:02.744 --> 00:08:04.186
Jacques Bonhomme,

00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:06.750
like a regular guy was a Jacques Bonhomme,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.498
and then that just translates to something

00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:10.855
roughly like, Jack Goodfellow.

00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:15.160
So what you see is the elites,
the clergy, the nobility

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.047
are applying this notion
of being a peasant,

00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:19.508
of being a commoner,

00:08:19.508 --> 00:08:22.801
in kind of a derogatory or insulting way

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:25.973
to anyone who's not part of
the nobility or the clergy.

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:29.068
And remember that when we
said what a peasant really is

00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:32.256
it refers to a rural agricultural worker.

00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:34.262
These revolts, these uprisings,

00:08:34.262 --> 00:08:38.690
included a lot more than just
rural agricultural workers.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.860
What they're trying to do
is to dismiss the uprising

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.207
as just bad behavior from people

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:46.366
who don't know their place in society.

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:50.011
But in reality, it's much
more complex than that.

00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:51.798
So hopefully this starts
to give us a sense

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:53.748
of why did people revolt

00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:55.581
against the government at this time.

00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:57.656
We had these demographic changes that lead

00:08:57.656 --> 00:08:59.809
to these economic changes,

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:02.059
and that leads in some ways to changes

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:05.039
in how people view their roles in society.

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.709
To think about whether or
not these were successful,

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:10.837
we want to think about more
than just military success,

00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:13.722
because the fact is most
of these popular uprisings

00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:16.101
lost militarily-speaking.

00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:18.550
The government had more than enough

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.168
manpower and money to put
down these popular uprisings.

00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:23.466
So when we think about whether or not

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:25.656
these popular uprisings were successful,

00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:29.149
we want to think about did
they lead to any major changes

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:32.236
in the social or political structures.

00:09:32.236 --> 00:09:34.795
Even if they didn't
win military victories.

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:36.055
And in most cases,

00:09:36.055 --> 00:09:40.222
we do see some of those
changes start to take shape.
