00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:03.190
- [Instructor] This table
gives us a few values

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.966
of the function g.

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.753
So we know what g of x is
equal to with these values

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:08.751
right over here.

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.143
X is equal to negative two,
negative one, zero, and one.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:15.310
It says Rafael said that
since g of one minus g of zero

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:20.905
over one minus zero is equal
to negative five, there must be

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:24.745
a number c in the interval in
the closed interval from zero

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:28.912
to one for which g prime of
c is equal to negative five.

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:35.174
Which condition makes Rafael's
claim true and they give us

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:36.674
four choices here.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.992
So I encourage you to pause
this video and try to work

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:43.380
through it on your own.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.311
Alright before we even look
at these choices let's just

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.243
revisit what's going on over here.

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:53.076
So Rafael is saying since this,
so he's looking at g of one

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:57.243
minus g of zero, so this is
g of one, minus g of zero

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:03.421
that's this right over here,
over one minus zero, over one

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.338
minus zero.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.406
So what is this?

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:10.573
This right over here is
the average rate of change,

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:17.105
rate of change between x equals
zero and x is equal to one.

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:28.332
Another way to think about it
this is the slope of the line

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:32.082
that connects the point
0,8 to the point 1,3.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:37.292
And that average rate of
change is negative five.

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.708
And that he's saying
there must be a number c

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:43.630
in the interval, in the closed
interval from zero to one

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.797
for which the derivative of
that x value what x is equal

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:52.940
to c is the same thing as
this average rate of change.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.436
So this is what the mean
value theorem is all about,

00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:57.833
it's this notion that...

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:01.548
We plot it a little bit
just as a bit of a review,

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:04.811
so we're going from 0,8 which
is maybe right over here

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:08.978
to 1,3 so that's one, 1,3
might look something like this.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.040
So we're seeing the average
rate of change, the slope

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.886
of the line that connects
those two points is like this.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.092
What the mean value
theorem tells us if we have

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:22.386
the conditions for the mean
value theorem, that let's say

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:25.697
that our function does
something like this, as long

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:27.984
as our functions meet the
conditions of the mean value

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:30.709
theorem, which essentially
has to be differentiable

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.588
over the open interval and
continuous over the closed

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:37.569
interval, then there has to
be a point c where the slope

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.088
of the tangent line at point
c is equal to the average

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:42.097
rate of change.

00:02:42.097 --> 00:02:46.769
So over here the slope of the
tangent line looks the same

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.505
as our average rate of
change, right of there just

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:50.642
like that.

00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:52.896
So this is the mean value
theorem, but in order to make

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:57.479
this claim that in order to
apply the mean value theorem

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.024
to say there must be a c in
the interval where the slope

00:03:00.024 --> 00:03:02.794
of the tangent line at x equals
c is the same as the average

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:05.748
rate of change, we have to
feel very confident that we are

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:08.471
meeting the conditions for
the mean value theorem, namely

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.495
that the function is continuous
over the closed interval

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:14.920
and differentiable over the
open interval from zero to one.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.328
So let's look at the choices now.

00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:22.648
G is continuous at x equals
zero and x equals one.

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:24.727
Well that by itself isn't
sufficient, we also have

00:03:24.727 --> 00:03:26.807
to be continuous at all the
points in between, so that alone

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:29.965
does not make this claim true.

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:33.647
G is continuous over the closed
interval from zero to one.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:36.305
So that's nice, but that
doesn't ensure that we're

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:39.835
differentiable over the open
interval from zero to one,

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:43.353
we have to be continuous
over the closed interval

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:46.879
and differentiable over the
open interval, so we can rule

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.642
that one out, that's not enough.

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:51.662
G is differentiable over the
open interval from negative one

00:03:51.662 --> 00:03:55.829
to one and so that includes
this right over here includes

00:03:58.457 --> 00:04:01.636
the open interval that we care about.

00:04:01.636 --> 00:04:04.541
This includes the open interval
from zero to one, that's

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.664
what we care about, so
that is a check that we're

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.206
differentiable over the
open interval and continuous

00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:13.731
over the closed interval
from negative one to one.

00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:17.137
Well once again this includes
the closed interval that we

00:04:17.137 --> 00:04:18.159
care about.

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:22.326
This includes the closed
interval from zero to one

00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:25.613
and so this is looking good.

00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:27.761
What we care about is that
we're differentiable over this

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.665
interval and if we're
differentiable here we're definitely

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.568
differentiable here and
then we're continuous over

00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:32.567
this interval.

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.400
So I like this choice.

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:37.697
This right over here says
g is differentiable over

00:04:37.697 --> 00:04:41.425
the open interval and at x
is equal to zero, so this

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:44.160
is getting us close because
if you are differentiable

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.919
you are continuous.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.159
So one way to interpret this
is that we are differentiable

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.385
over the interval that is
from zero to one that includes

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:53.635
the point zero.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.722
Now this is close if they said
that we are differentiable

00:04:56.722 --> 00:05:00.033
for over the closed interval
from zero to one, that actually

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.113
would have been sufficient
because if you are differentiable

00:05:02.113 --> 00:05:04.517
then you are also continuous
but they did not say that.

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:07.314
So we can rule this one out
as well, we would have to know

00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:10.561
this last choice still does
not make us confident that

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:13.539
we are continuous at the
point one, that's what being

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.836
continuous over the closed
interval would have told us.

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:18.798
Let's do one more example
that's a little bit different

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:19.965
than this one.

00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:26.657
So here we are told that g
is a differentiable function

00:05:26.657 --> 00:05:30.002
once again they've given us
the function sample that some

00:05:30.002 --> 00:05:31.264
values of x.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:34.971
Max was asked whether
there's a solution to g prime

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:38.860
of x is equal to two on the
closed interval from three

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.693
to six.

00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:44.084
So we see three here, we see three here.

00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:49.402
So we want to care about the
closed interval from three

00:05:49.402 --> 00:05:50.235
to six.

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:53.767
So the first thing he did,
he says okay let's find

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.971
the average rate of change
from x equals three to x equals

00:05:56.971 --> 00:06:01.138
six, so this is our change
in our function, so g of six

00:06:02.156 --> 00:06:06.515
minus g of three over six
minus three, let's see g of six

00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:10.682
is equal to one, g of three
is equal to negative five,

00:06:11.864 --> 00:06:13.562
this is three.

00:06:13.562 --> 00:06:16.103
One minus negative five over
three, that's six over three,

00:06:16.103 --> 00:06:18.270
it is indeed equal to two.

00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:20.792
So that step makes sense.

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:22.711
The reason I'm going through
they say is Max's work correct?

00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:24.648
If not, what is his mistake?

00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:26.229
So let's look at step two.

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.899
The mean value theorem so Max
is now saying alright I found

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:32.359
the average rate of change
between x equals three and x

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:35.176
equals six and then he
says the mean value theorem

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.930
guarantees a solution where
g prime of x equals two

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.347
on this interval.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.491
So we have to be careful here,
because he just immediately

00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:47.052
applies the mean value
theorem without establishing

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:49.878
the conditions for the mean value theorem.

00:06:49.878 --> 00:06:52.502
So I would say even though
it does say that we're

00:06:52.502 --> 00:06:55.475
differentiable over it, I would
make it, I think his mistake

00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:59.000
is that he did not make this clear.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.651
He should have said step two
should have been something

00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:04.984
like because g is differentiable over...

00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:14.807
It sounds like it's a
differentiable function so we could

00:07:14.807 --> 00:07:18.557
say for all x is differentiable for all x.

00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:24.174
We can say the mean value theorem
applies over this interval

00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:34.349
if you wanted to be really
careful you could've said

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:37.055
because g is differentiable
for all x is definitely

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:40.122
differentiable over this
closed interval and if it's

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:42.235
differentiable over the
closed interval it's also

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:44.973
continuous over the closed
interval and so the mean value

00:07:44.973 --> 00:07:47.227
theorem definitely applies
and then say the mean value

00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:49.294
theorem guarantees a solution.

00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:51.634
So the reason why it's
important to stress is if you're

00:07:51.634 --> 00:07:54.364
taking a test especially
things like the AP exam,

00:07:54.364 --> 00:07:57.746
if you're going to apply one
of these, really any theorems,

00:07:57.746 --> 00:08:01.275
they're going to want you to
put down all the conditions

00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:03.644
for the theorem to ensure
that you can apply it as part

00:08:03.644 --> 00:08:05.061
of your argument.
