00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.740
Hey guys.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.380
Hi.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.460
Hi Melissa!

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.520
Did you dye your hair?  You look so pretty.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.660
Oh, no I didn't.  Thank you though.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.840
I like your romper.  That's cute.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.320
Oh thank you.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.020
Oh, Steve, I gotta talk to you.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.500
Okay, so I guess she's like being nice to you now.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.400
She's been talking so much shit about you behind your back.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.380
Seriously?

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.240
Yeah.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.460
All right boys.  Looks like we've got a Frenemy.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.020
Phil, do we have any backstory on the target?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.840
Uh, yeah they actually went to High School together so we got tons of gossip.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.740
Give me something nasty.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.140
Well this is good.  She fell down at a school assembly in front of a group of boys.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.960
Hit the ground so hard she farted.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.900
Lets use it.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
*ding ding*

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.660
Shit talk complete.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.720
Great.  Mitch, do we have any eyes on the BF (boyfriend)?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.520
Ok we've got him sipping a Lacroix with his bro.  Should we approach?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.000
Abso-fuckin-lutely.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.280
You're more like--

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.000
Hey James.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.640
Oh hey Melissa.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.320
Hey.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.940
Hey.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.960
You look big.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.080
Have you been working out?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.540
Uh yeah.  I mean, a little.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.100
Well it's working.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.840
Out.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.080
Are you sure she should be doing this?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.040
Yeah I heard James is horrible in bed.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.220
We're not actually going to sleep with him you idiot.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.480
We're just stirring the pot.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.920
Well maybe we should talk to her, you know.  Clear the air.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.320
What did you say?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.920
Clear the air.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440
This is war Mitch.  We're not--...

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.640
actually that might not be a bad idea.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.600
I never said anything bad about you.  You're one of my best friends.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.460
I know.  You're one of my best friends too.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.620
And actually I was trying to avoid drama and not tell you this but

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.080
Courtney is actually the one who has been talking shit.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.480
*laughing*

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.440
Buckle up boys.  We're not going home yet.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.720
Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed that command center sketch.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.640
It was a fun one and we have about I think like one or two more in the works for you so yay!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.580
Just a quick heads up--these are my upcoming shows.  I hope to see you if you are in California.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.600
Especially this one.  It's going to be great.  It's me and 3 of my favorite Asian female comics

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.680
and of course a white guy for diversity

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.380
so you'll see Brad as well.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.920
My parents are going to be there and I have a lot of jokes that they've never heard so

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.720
I'm like kind of nervous so we shall see.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.960
And on that note I do want to say thank you so much to JCPenney.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.360
A few weeks ago I flew out to New York to take part in one of their campaigns and I got to model

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.140
on the streets of New York and get my make-up done

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.680
all for a great cause.  JCPenney is promoting women who are empowering their communities

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.980
and their environments and I was on as someone who is an advocate for suicide prevention.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.300
So you can check out the LookBook.  I'll put a link below

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.360
and of course all of these fabulous outfits are on JCPenney's website.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.120
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
