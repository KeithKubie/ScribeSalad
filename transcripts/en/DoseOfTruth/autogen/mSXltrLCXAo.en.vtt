what we need is no orthodoxy that's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
what we need is no orthodoxy that's
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.179
what we need is no orthodoxy that's
what's fatal orthodoxy so if you have if

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
what's fatal orthodoxy so if you have if
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.800
what's fatal orthodoxy so if you have if
you have to feel like sociology or

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
you have to feel like sociology or
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.140
you have to feel like sociology or
social psychology in which it's two or

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
social psychology in which it's two or
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.730
social psychology in which it's two or
three to one left to right that's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
three to one left to right that's
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.150
three to one left to right that's
totally fine with me that's totally fine

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160
totally fine with me that's totally fine
 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.620
totally fine with me that's totally fine
because if someone makes some claim

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
because if someone makes some claim
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.010
because if someone makes some claim
that's just like ideologically blind

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020
that's just like ideologically blind
 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.229
that's just like ideologically blind
someone will say you know common sense

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
someone will say you know common sense
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090
someone will say you know common sense
other evidence that you've missed and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
other evidence that you've missed and
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.150
other evidence that you've missed and
then the system works but what what I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
then the system works but what what I
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.650
then the system works but what what I
learned when I started down this road in

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
learned when I started down this road in
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.200
learned when I started down this road in
2011 I gave a talk at the big conference

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
2011 I gave a talk at the big conference
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270
2011 I gave a talk at the big conference
of social psychologists I gave a talk

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
of social psychologists I gave a talk
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069
of social psychologists I gave a talk
about this problem that we're losing our

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
about this problem that we're losing our
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.889
about this problem that we're losing our
diversity that I could only find one

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
diversity that I could only find one
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.170
diversity that I could only find one
conservative in the entire field and I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
conservative in the entire field and I
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.889
conservative in the entire field and I
gave a talk on this and and so what I've

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
gave a talk on this and and so what I've
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.310
gave a talk on this and and so what I've
learned since then is that the ratio in

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
learned since then is that the ratio in
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440
learned since then is that the ratio in
psychology was between two to one and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
psychology was between two to one and
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570
psychology was between two to one and
four to one left-right all the way up to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
four to one left-right all the way up to
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340
four to one left-right all the way up to
the early 90s we've gathered together

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
the early 90s we've gathered together
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.899
the early 90s we've gathered together
all the studies we could find so all the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
all the studies we could find so all the
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.640
all the studies we could find so all the
way up to the early 90s it's only three

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
way up to the early 90s it's only three
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.899
way up to the early 90s it's only three
or four to one left to right which would

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
or four to one left to right which would
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.800
or four to one left to right which would
be okay but then between 1995 or four

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
be okay but then between 1995 or four
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.780
be okay but then between 1995 or four
and 2010 it goes to fourteen to one do

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
and 2010 it goes to fourteen to one do
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.300
and 2010 it goes to fourteen to one do
you have any idea why and why that time

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
you have any idea why and why that time
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.140
you have any idea why and why that time
yes so so it you get the same story

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
yes so so it you get the same story
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149
yes so so it you get the same story
whether you look at Republican Democrat

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
whether you look at Republican Democrat
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920
whether you look at Republican Democrat
ratios or liberal conservative there

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
ratios or liberal conservative there
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.230
ratios or liberal conservative there
they tell the same story so the two the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
they tell the same story so the two the
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149
they tell the same story so the two the
big things going on there are one is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
big things going on there are one is
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.340
big things going on there are one is
that the greatest generation which had a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
that the greatest generation which had a
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.490

off to World War two they they're on the
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450
off to World War two they they're on the
GI Bill they enter the Academy in the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
GI Bill they enter the Academy in the
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.149
GI Bill they enter the Academy in the
1950s a lot of them are conservative or

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
1950s a lot of them are conservative or
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.060
1950s a lot of them are conservative or
republican so you have a lot of them but

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
republican so you have a lot of them but
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160
republican so you have a lot of them but
in the 60s and 70s one of the main

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
in the 60s and 70s one of the main
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.480
in the 60s and 70s one of the main
reasons to go to grad school and the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
reasons to go to grad school and the
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149
reasons to go to grad school and the
social sciences is either a to stay in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
social sciences is either a to stay in
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.920
social sciences is either a to stay in
school to escape the Vietnam War draft

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
school to escape the Vietnam War draft
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.800
school to escape the Vietnam War draft
or B to fight for social justice and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
or B to fight for social justice and

against racism
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889
against racism
so in sociology and psychology in

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
so in sociology and psychology in
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.210
so in sociology and psychology in
particular in political science maybe

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
particular in political science maybe
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.700
particular in political science maybe
I'm not sure you get a huge influx of

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
I'm not sure you get a huge influx of
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.830
I'm not sure you get a huge influx of
left-leaning people who are there to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
left-leaning people who are there to
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.560
left-leaning people who are there to
pursue social justice so you know the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
pursue social justice so you know the
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020
pursue social justice so you know the
motives are fine and if it was balanced

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
motives are fine and if it was balanced
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.170
motives are fine and if it was balanced
to be totally fine but as you get these

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
to be totally fine but as you get these
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180
to be totally fine but as you get these
young junior people on the Left come in

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190
young junior people on the Left come in
 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.770
young junior people on the Left come in
in the 70s and 80s and then you get the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
in the 70s and 80s and then you get the
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630
in the 70s and 80s and then you get the
older people that are more politically

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
older people that are more politically
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.760
older people that are more politically
balanced retiring in the 80s and 90s by

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
balanced retiring in the 80s and 90s by
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.680
balanced retiring in the 80s and 90s by
the time you get to the late 90s it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
the time you get to the late 90s it's
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.530
the time you get to the late 90s it's
all baby boomers and so do you get up do

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
all baby boomers and so do you get up do
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.670
all baby boomers and so do you get up do
you get a positive feedback loop

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
you get a positive feedback loop
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
you get a positive feedback loop
developing in there like you said it's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
developing in there like you said it's
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050
developing in there like you said it's
like 3 2 1 it's ok but maybe when it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060
like 3 2 1 it's ok but maybe when it
 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.480
like 3 2 1 it's ok but maybe when it
hits 4 to 1 it goes to like 20 to 1 then

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490
hits 4 to 1 it goes to like 20 to 1 then
 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.910
hits 4 to 1 it goes to like 20 to 1 then
you said exactly so you so then you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
you said exactly so you so then you
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.830
you said exactly so you so then you
start getting hostile climate so I wrote

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
start getting hostile climate so I wrote
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.260
start getting hostile climate so I wrote
a review paper on this with with Joe

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270
a review paper on this with with Joe
 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.810
a review paper on this with with Joe
Duarte and Phil tetlock and Lee Justin

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820
Duarte and Phil tetlock and Lee Justin
 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.320
Duarte and Phil tetlock and Lee Justin
Jared Crawford and and we so we reviewed

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330
Jared Crawford and and we so we reviewed
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.490
Jared Crawford and and we so we reviewed
everything that we could find and we

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
everything that we could find and we
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.010
everything that we could find and we
concluded that most of what's going on

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020
concluded that most of what's going on
 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.500
concluded that most of what's going on
is self selection that is people on the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
is self selection that is people on the
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.730
is self selection that is people on the
left and we're open to experience oh

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740
left and we're open to experience oh
 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.610
left and we're open to experience oh
it's banana selection but then there's

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
it's banana selection but then there's
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.590
it's banana selection but then there's
really good evidence that there's also

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600
really good evidence that there's also
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.970
really good evidence that there's also
hostile climate I mean it's it's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980
hostile climate I mean it's it's
 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.370
hostile climate I mean it's it's
undeniable now that if you are not on

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
undeniable now that if you are not on
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.530
undeniable now that if you are not on
the left in a grad program there's just

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
the left in a grad program there's just
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.660
the left in a grad program there's just
constant little subtle or not so subtle

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
constant little subtle or not so subtle
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.970
constant little subtle or not so subtle
reminders that you don't belong and look

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
reminders that you don't belong and look
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.860
reminders that you don't belong and look
in the Academy we're all about saying

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
in the Academy we're all about saying
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470
in the Academy we're all about saying
hey if there are subtle hints here and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480
hey if there are subtle hints here and
 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.240
hey if there are subtle hints here and
there you can't succeed right I mean

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
there you can't succeed right I mean

rigid because the idea was that you can

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740
rigid because the idea was that you can
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.650
rigid because the idea was that you can
make a valid case for the utility of

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660
make a valid case for the utility of
 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.590

flow of people that would go along with
 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.590
flow of people that would go along with
that and you can make a good case for

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600
that and you can make a good case for
 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.200
that and you can make a good case for
the danger of that and so the idea might

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210
the danger of that and so the idea might
 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.150
the danger of that and so the idea might
be that if you're only making a case for

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160
be that if you're only making a case for
 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.100
be that if you're only making a case for
the danger of that then you're tilted

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110
the danger of that then you're tilted
 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.570
the danger of that then you're tilted
too far to the right and if you're only

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580
too far to the right and if you're only
 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.550

making a case for the utility of that
 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.840
making a case for the utility of that
then you're tilted too far to the left

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850
then you're tilted too far to the left
 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.210
then you're tilted too far to the left
exactly that's right and so we can look

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220
exactly that's right and so we can look
 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.920
exactly that's right and so we can look
at immigration as a nice example there

us in the last few years especially is a
 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.730
us in the last few years especially is a
flooding in of religious thinking and so

let's get a bunch of social scientists
to talk about immigration what are they

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980
to talk about immigration what are they
 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.190
to talk about immigration what are they
going to do look at the data way up the

going to do look at the data way up the
pluses and minuses no they're going to

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950
pluses and minuses no they're going to
 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.650
pluses and minuses no they're going to
many of them feel they're on a team and

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660
many of them feel they're on a team and
 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.720
many of them feel they're on a team and
that team is fighting the right the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730
that team is fighting the right the
 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.190
that team is fighting the right the
right is anti-immigrant it includes

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200
right is anti-immigrant it includes
 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.430

so someone applies to a geology program

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:02.640
so someone applies to a geology program
 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.670
