00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:10.666
&gt;&gt;We have a lot of visitors coming
down, from both in the school

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.426
and outside the school, and
they're going to really want

00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:13.176
to hear what you have to say.

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:16.406
You're going to bring your
Social Studies notebook,

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:17.426
and articles down there.

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:20.186
If you don't have your
notebook handy, just be prepared

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.566
to show them all the articles
on the laptop, and also,

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.506
you're going to want to
show them your Google Maps

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:26.556
on the public art sites, okay?

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:31.656
And all of those things, you have
to be prepared to talk about.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.506
Also, we don't want you to forget
those two guiding questions,

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:37.776
how does art reflect the community?

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:39.896
And the other one is,
how does science,

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:41.476
math and engineering connect to art?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.206
&gt;&gt;Susan: It's called Expeditionary
learning for a reason, you know,

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:49.046
the classic expedition, you're
out with a group of people,

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:51.056
trying to climb a mountain,
and the goal,

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.756
and all of the consequences
along the way, are real.

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:55.166
It starts to rain.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.446
You know, that happens.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.786
Your computer dies.

00:00:57.786 --> 00:00:59.026
That happens.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.226
You know, these things go
on, but you're committed

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:02.656
to this end objective together.

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:04.796
So the relationships
become important,

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:06.796
and the connections become important,

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:11.366
and when you offer someone
the opportunity to engage

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.896
in something real, there is
nothing more exhilarating.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:18.836
&gt;&gt;Scott: At the beginning of
every expedition, we usually look

00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:21.096
at a district calendar to see,
you know, what we're going

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:21.986
to be doing for the fall.

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:28.666
&gt;&gt;David: We're talking about a
schedule here at King Middle School

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.886
where a team of five or six experts
in learning, your teachers, can say,

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:36.506
in order to pull off this particular
project at this particular stage,

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:38.636
we need to design a whole
new schedule this week.

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The first
one sounded fine.

00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:42.206
&gt;&gt; David: If we're working in
the world, and we're in any kind

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:44.886
of engineering or design
process, or editing movies,

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:47.206
nobody stops after 40
minutes, puts everything down

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.406
and goes on to do something else.

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:52.616
&gt;&gt;Scott: This is where
we start as a staff,

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:55.956
is creating the model before we ask
the kids to do it, so, essentially,

00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:58.346
we kind of figure out what,
exactly, we're going to build.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:01:59.766
So here's a good example.

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.916
There's, like, a science
piece around metabolism,

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:03.756
and that's a science content piece.

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:07.046
Here's a math piece around
size of their bacteria.

00:02:07.436 --> 00:02:11.356
This is a multimedia piece, where
the kids have drawn their work.

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:14.636
&gt;&gt;Ruth: The scientists were
all, like, oh sure, we'll come.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:16.776
So they're all very
excited to do this.

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:19.806
&gt;&gt;In expeditionary learning, we
love to develop relationships

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:23.806
between the students and community
members, because the excitement

00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:27.176
that it generates in the
students, deepens their learning,

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:29.506
and lengthens their retention.

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:31.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have to help
me with the pronunciation.

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:34.386
&gt;&gt;Student: All right,
pseudomonas aurantiaca.

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:36.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Aurantiaca.

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:40.516
&gt;&gt;Paul: This is going to take us
to where the maps are in Google,

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:43.036
and then we go to My Maps.

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.146
Students are working
with Google Maps,

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:48.246
and they are identifying all
the public art pieces that exist

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:49.116
in the City of Portland,

00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:51.676
so that these different
public art sites are going

00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:53.026
to be connected as a walking tour.

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:54.306
&gt;&gt;Kate: Hi, I'm Kate.

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:54.806
&gt;&gt;Sarah: I'm Sarah.

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:56.676
&gt;&gt;Student: And this
is Kinetic Conundrums.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.496
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Today, we're
out here taking photos

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:02.826
of already existing public art, that
we're studying in social studies.

00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:06.726
And so that we can make art
proposals in language arts,

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:11.866
and then create our own mini
model of public art and click it.

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:15.506
&gt;&gt;Gus: We don't learn
about things, we do things.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:19.226
It's a lot different than saying,
yeah, I can do that, I understand how

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:20.996
that works, but when they
actually have to do it,

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.256
there's a huge learning process,

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.336
there's a light bulb,
or an a-ha moment.

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:26.826
&gt;&gt;Drill that hole out
right in the middle.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.576
&gt;&gt;Student: This class is, like,
fun, because they teach us how

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.886
to be creative and to make
our own designs so, like,

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:35.016
we will have that experience
as we go along.

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:38.646
&gt;&gt;Gus: It's an incredible
value that I think is lacking,

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:42.466
where they don't have a class like
this, or like an art class, or music,

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:44.506
or something where the kids
actually have to do something,

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:46.526
get their hands dirty and make stuff.

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:48.846
&gt;&gt;David: We get visitors
from lots of schools.

00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:51.356
We get the people here from
expeditionary learning schools,

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.296
and they'll come in and they'll
look at what we're doing here

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:54.346
at King Middle School,
and they'll say,

00:03:54.346 --> 00:03:55.726
"If only we had one-on-one computing,

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:57.476
and they we could do
what you guys are doing."

00:03:57.476 --> 00:03:59.856
And then, when the
schools that are interested

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.966
in going one-to-one come here,
thinking it was going to be all

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.766
about giving kids computers, but
they discover it's really all

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:06.496
about project based learning.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.756
And they say, "If only we
had project based learning,

00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:10.216
we could do that, too, but we don't."

00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:11.206
&gt;&gt;Let's hear it.

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:12.716
&gt;&gt;David: I say the same
thing to both groups.

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:13.646
You should have both.

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:16.196
There's no excuse for
not having both anymore.

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:20.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Last night when I put
all the sculptures, so there's like,

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:24.606
80 sculptures in the front of my
room, and it was really amazing,

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:27.156
thinking of where we started
and where we ended up.

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:30.906
Just the variety of ideas,
and the ingenuity you had.

00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:32.026
You should be really proud.

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:34.496
It's just so cool to look
at them all together,

00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:38.596
because it's really very cool.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.426
&gt;&gt;David: What do you mean, you did
the math to figure out the balance?

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:45.066
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, this one, which
is two inches, by two inches.

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:47.916
So I did half of that.

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:50.556
&gt;&gt;David: It's pretty exciting to
see the kids get engaged in the work

00:04:50.616 --> 00:04:53.106
that they're doing, to take ownership
of the work that they're doing,

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:56.016
feel responsible for it,
and then be able to talk

00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:57.106
about the things that
they're learning.

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.246
&gt;&gt;So that you have this
side balancing this side.

00:04:59.246 --> 00:04:59.596
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:03.896
&gt;&gt;David: Sometimes I think we get
too concerned about the standards,

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:06.016
and there's an assumption
behind a lot of that,

00:05:06.016 --> 00:05:08.476
that we actually know what our kids
are going to face in the future.

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.736
And I'm not very convinced of that.

00:05:11.116 --> 00:05:16.256
And so the pieces about creativity,
cooperation, problem solving,

00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:17.226
those are going to be there,

00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:19.896
and so the kids getting those
here, is crucial and key.

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:23.246
&gt;&gt;Student: It's a weeping willow,
and it's called, Miss Lincoln Tree,

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:27.276
and the name was named after Lincoln
Park, where I want to put this.

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:28.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And these
will blow in the wind?

00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:28.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:31.936
It has a little bit of
esthetics, and history based.

00:05:32.236 --> 00:05:34.236
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It has a lot of esthetics.

00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:34.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:36.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Well I think
you just got my first vote.

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:37.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, thank you.

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:43.876
