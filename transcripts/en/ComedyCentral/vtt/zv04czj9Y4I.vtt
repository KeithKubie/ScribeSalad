00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:04.037
- SO LAST NIGHT
WHEN MY GIRL SAID

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:05.873
SHE WANTED TO SLIP INTO
SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE,

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.841
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE MEANT A COMA.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.010
[laughing]

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.979
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THAT'S FUNNY.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.947
I MEAN, IT'S SAD, TOO,
'CAUSE SHE DIED.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.049
- I'M SICK
OF BEING CALLED UGLY, DENZEL.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.218
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
A GIRL CAN TAKE.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.754
ONE DAY I'M GONNA SNAP,
AND WHEN I DO...

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.090
- CALM DOWN.
AT LEAST I APPRECIATE YOU.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.591
- REALLY?
- SURE.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.827
UGLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU EXIST
TO MAKE PEOPLE APPRECIATE

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.529
HANDSOME PEOPLE LIKE ME.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.498
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS!

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:32.766
both: AAH!

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.470
AAH!

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.871
[water splashes]

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.473
- [inhales deeply]
HAHH.

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.875
- AAH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.510
- I WAS SAVING YOUR LIFE.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.979
- NEXT TIME LET ME DIE!
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.282
- LOOKS LIKE
A DESERTED ISLAND.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.883
- DAMN,
IT'S JUST LIKE MY DREAM,

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.486
ONLY YOU AIN'T CLORIS LEACHMAN
WITH A HOT WING FOR A CLITORIS.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.720
- I'M SCARED, DENZEL.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.422
WHAT IF NO ONE
EVER FINDS US HERE?

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.525
I'LL DIE A VIRGIN!
UNLESS...

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.928
- YEAH, I'M GONNA BE REAL SAD
AT YOUR VIRGIN FUNERAL.

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:04.932
[engine revving]
