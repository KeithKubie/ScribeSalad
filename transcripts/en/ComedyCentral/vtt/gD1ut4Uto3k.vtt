00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.401
IT'S TIME FOR OUR NEXT GAME

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.302
WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE ONE

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.504
OF OUR NEW BIGGEST GAMES ON THE

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:04.538
SHOW.

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:05.806
"RYAN GOSLING OR RYAN SEACREST

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:07.307
FAN FICTION."

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.977
(cheers and applause)

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.111
I'M GOING TO READ YOU EXCERPTS

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.379
FROM FAN FICTION THAT I FOUND ON

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.747
THE INTERNET AND FOR 250 POINTS

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:14.748
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHICH OF

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.749
THE RYANS IT IS.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.717
SO YOU'LL ANSWER GOSLING OR

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:17.584
SEACREST.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.552
HERE WE GO, HERE'S THE FIRST

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:19.520
ONE.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.421
RYAN SAID, STILL CRYING, "YEAH,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.422
I KNOW THAT NOW.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.924
WE SHOULD OF...

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.526
(laughter)

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.761
BUT I'M SORRY, TOO.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.196
I FEEL SO BAD HOW THE WAY I

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.564
TREATED HIM.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:32.032
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN TREAT AN

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.734
ANIMAL HOW I TREATED HIM."

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.002
YES, JULIE KLAUSNER.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.470
&gt;&gt; SEACREST.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.437
&gt;&gt; Chris: LET'S FIND OUT.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.739
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS SEACREST,

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.875
RYAN SEACREST.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.111
&gt;&gt; WAS THIS THE CHAPTER ABOUT

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.646
WILLIAM HUNG?

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:46.813
(laughter)

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.884
&gt;&gt; Chris: IT SHOULD "OF" BEEN.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.286
HERE'S THE NEXT ONE.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:53.453
"SO I WAS JUST A ONE

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.322
NIGHTSTAND FOR YOU?"

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.690
YES, PAUL F. TOMPKINS.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.825
&gt;&gt; A ONE NIGHTSTAND.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:00:59.693
&gt;&gt; Chris: I WAS JUST A

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:00.694
NIGHTSTAND.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.396
NEXT TO YOUR BED.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.932
&gt;&gt; JUST ONE NIGHTSTAND.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:05.832
&gt;&gt; Chris: I'M JUST ONE, THERE'S

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:06.934
ONLY ONE OF ME.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.368
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS GOT TO BE A GOSLING.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.070
&gt;&gt; THIS IS IN FACT A GOSLING,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.605
YES, POINTS, POINTS.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:14.241
(cheers and applause)

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.375
&gt;&gt; SO I WASN'T JUST A ONE

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.844
NIGHTSTAND FOR YOU.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:17.811
&gt;&gt; Chris: SURE CAN'T WAIT TO GET

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.414
HOME TO MY LIVING NIGHTSTAND.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.816
ALL RIGHT, NEXT ONE, NEXT ONE.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.784
"THEY LEFT A FOUR-YEAR-OLD

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.552
CHILD WITH YOU, RYAN.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.088
SARAH STATED ALOUD."

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.156
WHICH IS HOW YOU STATE THINGS.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.657
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S HELPFUL.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.458
&gt;&gt; Chris: "WHAT?

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.826
RYAN BURST OUT.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.994
IT STATES HERE IN THE WILL THEY

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:35.596
LEFT THIS CHILD TO YOU.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:36.763
SARAH STATED.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.966
OH...MY...GOD."

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.300
PAUL F. TOMPKINS.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.003
&gt;&gt; IT ENRAGES ME TO SAY THAT I

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.705
THINK THAT IS RYAN SEACREST.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.240
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A SEACREST.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.875
THAT IS A SEACREST.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:50.711
HE GOTS THE DOLLARS.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.745
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SO MUCH MORE ABOUT

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.413
THEIR FANS THAN IT IS ABOUT

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.281
THEM.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.782
&gt;&gt; Chris: HERE'S THE NEXT ONE.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.584
"GREAT, SHE SMILED AND TURNED

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.453
BACK FOR THE RESTROOMS."

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.154
THAT'S WHO THE (BLEEP) KNOWS.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.222
YEAH, PAUL.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.658
&gt;&gt; I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT I

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:05.792
THINK THAT THAT IS RYAN GOSLING

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.894
FAN FICTION.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:07.828
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A GOSLING!

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:08.962
THAT IS A GOSLING!

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:09.930
(cheers and applause)

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.899
THERE HE IS WATCHING HER WALK TO

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.066
THE RESTROOM OFF IN THE

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.101
DISTANCE.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.336
&gt;&gt; IN HIS PAJAMAS OUTSIDE?

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.237
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE GOT OUT OF BED TO

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.238
MAKE SURE SHE GOT TO THE

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.640
BATHROOM SAFELY.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.707
NEXT ONE.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.608
"YOU'RE SHAUNI RIGHT?

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:22.743
THE ONE WHO I ONCE SENT A REPLY

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:24.378
TO ON MYSPACE?"

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.413
VERY TIMELY, VERY TIMELY.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.616
"THE MAJORLY DEVOTED FAN"?

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.118
JULIE.

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:32.419
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RYAN SEACREST.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.620
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.688
RYAN...

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:35.956
GOSLING.

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:37.090
NO, THAT'S RYAN GOSLING.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.091
&gt;&gt; NO!

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:38.959
&gt;&gt; GOSLING IS STILL A MYSPACE

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.794
GUY, I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:41.995
HE'S RIGHT THERE, HE'S THINKING

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.463
ABOUT MYSPACE, WHAT WENT WRONG.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.364
WHO'S IN MY TOP EIGHT?

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.399
LIKE YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WHEELS

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.366
TURNING.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.301
&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY THE BEST AUTHOR OF

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:48.569
ALL-TIME SHAUNI IS IN HIS TOP

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.237
EIGHT.

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:51.371
&gt;&gt; Chris: BARON, DO YOU HAVE A

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:52.406
THOUGHT ON THIS?

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.407
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:54.842
(laughter)

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.310
(cheers and applause)

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.277
&gt;&gt; Chris: NICE!

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:57.644
POINTS!
