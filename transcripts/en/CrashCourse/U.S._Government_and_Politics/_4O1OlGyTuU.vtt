Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today, we're gonna continue

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.990
our discussion of the Bill of Rights, and
talk about something that may actually be

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.529
useful to you. We're gonna talk about when
the police are allowed to search your house,

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:19.650
your car, and even you. But not me. I have
immunity. I'm on YouTube. Right, is that how

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.950
it works, Stan? It's not how it works? I'm
in trouble.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.030
You might think that this only matters if
you are, you know, a criminal, and if you

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.130
are, then you should be paying close attention,
but even if you haven't committed any crimes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.340
and you are unlucky enough to be stopped by
the police, these protections apply.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.320
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.720
The question of when and where and how the
police can conduct a search falls under the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.790
general topic of Criminal Procedure. In this
case, the second word is important. The courts

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.969
usually look at how the police are acting,
and the protections courts have supported

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.920
are primarily procedural. What this means
is that there is no unlimited, sometimes called

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.950
substantive, right to have the police not
search you or your home. The criminal procedure

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.390
civil liberties are found in the Fourth, Fifth,
and Sixth amendments, but today we're only

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.460
gonna look at the Fourth amendment, which
reads, "The right of the people to be secure

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.220
in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.380
shall not be violated, and no warrants shall
issue but upon probable cause, supported by

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.280
oath or affirmation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched and the persons or

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.860
things to be seized." You can see right away
that this is not an absolute right. The framers

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.330
made sure that we are only protected from
unreasonable searches and seizures, and they

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.130
added that the police are supposed to get
a warrant before they search you.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.920
Let's start with the warrant requirement,
because it's kinda confusing. A search warrant

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.240
is a piece of paper issued by a judge, authorizing
law enforcement officers to search something,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.810
usually your house, but possibly your car
or your person or your desk eagle. I'm not

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.130
hiding anything in there. What? According
to the Fourth Amendment, for the police to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.329
get a judge to issue a warrant, they must
have probable cause, which is more than just

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.189
a suspicion or an anonymous tip, although
sometimes judges will issue warrants on pretty

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.090
flimsy probably cause. When they are issued,
warrants are supposed to be specific, laying

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.240
out what the police are searching for and
where they expect to find it. This means that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.549
if the warrant says the police can search
your garage for a stolen car, they can't look

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.570
in your kitchen drawers and cupboards, because
A, the warrant says they can search your garage

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.379
and B, they're looking for a car, and you
can't hide a car in your kitchen drawers,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.629
unless it's a very small car. I drive a Prius,
which is pretty small, but it doesn't fit

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.469
in my kitchen drawers. I've tried. Even when
I take the whisk out.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.409
You'll notice that I qualified my statement
about warrants. You do this a lot when you're

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.439
talking about criminal procedure. I said,
"When they are issued," despite the fact that

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.849
the Fourth Amendment seems to say that the
police always need a warrant, the courts have

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.299
ruled that it is not always required for the
police to engage in a reasonable search. What

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.859
this means is that if the police have probable
cause to search you, say, they catch you pocketing

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.299
powdered donuts in the grocery store, they
don't always need to go to the judge to search you.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.079
What makes a reasonable search is a question
that the courts have wrestled with. Sometimes,

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.169
like with a stolen car in the kitchen cabinet,
it's pretty obvious. But many times it isn't.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.870
For example, if the warrant allows the police
to search your kitchen for illegal hand grenades

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.699
and they look in your freezer and find illegal
drugs instead, that's probably reasonable,

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.199
because freezers are where most people store
their illegal hand grenades, and also their

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.859
drugs, and if the police stop you for speeding,
which is a violation of traffic laws, also

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.719
known as a crime, and then search your car
and find a dead body in the trunk, the courts

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.689
have ruled that this is reasonable, too. It's
important to realize that the warrant and

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.859
reasonableness requirements are not meant
to prevent the police from stopping criminals

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.349
caught in the act. If the police, after chasing
a masked man carrying a bag with a dollar

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.540
sign on it running away from a bank that has
just been reported robbed by a man with a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.559
gun and mask manage to catch him, they don't
need an arrest warrant to take him into custody,

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.379
and because the running away and the bag of
money are pretty suggestive, the police will

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.819
have probable cause to search the guy, who
in my mind, looks like the Hamburglar for

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.499
the gun. And the question is, can they use
the gun as evidence?

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.279
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. One of the
most important Supreme Court cases dealing

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.919
with searches and seizures is Mapp v. Ohio,
decided in 1961. The facts of the case are

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.479
pretty wild. The police went to the home of
Dollree Mapp to search for explosives and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.639
gambling equipment. They didn't have a warrant,
so she didn't let them in. They came back

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.889
a bit later with a fake warrant and searched
the house. They didn't find explosives or

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.329
gambling equipment, but they did find a trunk
full of pornography, which was illegal at

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.040
the time, so they arrested her. The main evidence
against her, naturally, was the pornography,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.650
but the cops' probable cause was to search
for explosives. The Court ruled that the evidence

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.869
had been seized through an illegal search.
There was no warrant, and even if there had

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.269
been one, it probably wouldn't have included
the trunk in which they found the porn. More

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.900
important, they ruled that this evidence and
any evidence seized pursuant to an illegal

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.949
search cannot be used against a defendant
in a trial. This is called an exclusionary

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.589
rule, unlawfully obtained evidence is excluded
from the trial, and it's sometimes called

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.799
the "Fruit of the Poisoned Tree," possibly
because lawyers are better at naming things

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.889
than historians are. This is incredibly important,
especially for cop shows on TV, but also for

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.960
you if you happen to have your home searched
illegally and the police find evidence of

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.740
criminal activity. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.550
So it seems like there are some pretty strong
protections against the police searching your

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.670
home because of Mapp, but there are also plenty of
exceptions, and no, we're not talking about the Mongols.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.850
[Mongoltage]

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.340
Many of these exceptions involve your car.
In general, the courts have been very lenient

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.650
when police search your car, probably because
very often, when they pull you over, it's

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.729
because of some kind of moving violation,
like speeding, which can be probable cause,

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.789
especially if they think you might be speeding
away from a crime. The court decisions on

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.090
this issue are really, really complicated,
but the general rule of thumb is that the

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.080
police can usually search your car and you
if they pull you over, despite what Jay-Z

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.210
may think. Another question that comes up
is random traffic stops to check for drunk

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.580
driving. A breathalyzer is a type of search,
so it would seem that the police should have

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.789
probable cause to stop you and check to see
if you're drunk.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.729
But the Courts have ruled that drunk driving
checkpoints are okay, assuming they don't

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.280
disproportionately target people of a specific
race, but that's for another episode. While

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.479
we're talking about cars and specific groups
of people, I should probably add that there's

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.879
one group of people who don't have the same
protections against searches: students.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.420
Students often think that it's not okay for school
officials to search their lockers or their

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.639
bookbags, but those students are wrong. Most
students go to public schools, where the officials

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.889
are mostly government workers, and are subject
to the Bill of Rights. The Courts have ruled

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.090
that students don't have the same protections
as other citizens, and that the interests

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.710
of the state in keeping a safe, drug and weapon-free
educational environment trumps their privacy

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.909
interest. Although there are limits to how
intrusive these searches can be. Drug tests

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.599
for student athletes? Fine. Strip searches?
Not okay.

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.349
And bee tee dubs, in the same way that a breathalyzer
test is a search, so is a drug test, or as

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.770
they say in England, a drugs test, which is
probably a more accurate way to say it, because

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.419
they usually test more than one drug. These
can seem pretty intrusive, but the Courts

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.229
usually rule that they are okay, especially
where public safety is concerned. The state

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.509
interest in drug-free schools is a pretty
strong one, but the cases on student drug

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.759
tests are really interesting, especially when
they get into the issue of whether schools

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.919
can test all students without probable cause,
or only specific groups, like athletes. If

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.689
you're really interested, you should look
these cases up, but why are you so interested?

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.449
Maybe you should take a drug test.
Or a drugs test.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.599
So I'm gonna stop here before I get too deep
in the weeds about search and seizures and

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.639
the Fourth Amendment. There are two important
things to remember. The first is that, like

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.669
all the Constitutional protections of civil
liberties, it only applies to government agents.

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.990
You have no Fourth Amendment protection against
your parents searching your room, unless your

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.979
parents are police officers and they're on
duty, and it's like, official police business.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.610
The second thing to remember is that the protections
in the Fourth Amendment are far from absolute.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.270
The Amendment itself includes a reasonableness
standard, and what is reasonable as well as

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.999
when warrants are necessary has been, and
continues to be, determined by the Courts.

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.759
In this case, as with most civil liberties
cases, the Court's attempt to balance an individual's

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.599
interest in maintaining her privacy against
the state's interest in preventing crime and

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.860
keeping citizens safe. It's not an easy balance,
but that's what makes the issue complex and

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.140
interesting, at least to us here at Crash
Course, because we're complex and interesting.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.840
