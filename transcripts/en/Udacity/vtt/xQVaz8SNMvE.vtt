00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.470
Once you selected a topic to read,
you'll see the original post at the top.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.660
If the topic is a question,
you'll see a student answer and

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.520
an instructor answer here.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.590
If the student answer has been
endorsed by an instructor,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.940
that will also be flagged here.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.000
Below the answers, there may be
some follow up discussions as well.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.340
One the most useful features of piazza,
is this top nav bar.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.950
When you open a topic
that has some updates,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.680
this nav bar will highlight the updates,
since you last visited in pink.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.630
You can then scroll this bar back and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.660
forth, to see a chronological history
of what's been posted in what order.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.630
This also helps you focus on new
content since your last visit.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.780
&gt;&gt; There's one other really
useful feature on this page,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.490
but it's kind of hidden.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.420
If you click this star up here,
it will add a topic to your favorites.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.710
Favorites are listed at the top of your
topic list just under your pinned posts.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.210
This is a great way to keep track of
topics you know you're going to come

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.040
back to, or

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.150
to follow updates to topics without
subscribing to email notifications.
