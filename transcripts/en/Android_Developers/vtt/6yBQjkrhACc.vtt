ANTHONY DOUGLAS: I'm
Anthony Douglas, founder

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.940
and CEO of Hole19.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.850
Hole19 is building the
largest and most engaged

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.182
network of golfers.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.640
We're connecting
the world of golf.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.431
We want to be part of
the golfer's journey,

00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:24.850
before, during, and
after the round of golf.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.570
Golf has always been
a passion of mine.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.620
The idea came about
in 2007 when I

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.030
was working with a golf coach.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.320
So it was a platform
to track my stats

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.040
and connect with a golf
coach to help me improve.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.930
Starting a company in
that space is a great way

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.936
to blend my passion
with business.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.670
We built the
product in Portugal.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.620
We were in Lisbon.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.970
We found a design team that
could help us build it.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.386
Four and a half,
five years later,

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:51.680
we're close to a million users.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.810
The moment we found
out about Android Wear,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.160
it was clear to us that we
had to be there from day one.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.940
In the golf industry already,
technology-- actually pulling

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.825
out your phone-- is
often frowned upon.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:03.530
And we just felt that a
smart watch on your wrist

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.720
just made sense.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.580
Combining hardware
and software, we

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.842
felt that Android Wear was
the perfect solution for us.

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:11.550
FABIO CARBALLO: Since
the launch of Wear,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.380
we have seen a lot of positive
feedback from the users.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.980
And we have grown our
user base more than double

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.620
on the last six months.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.310
We've seen that our
Android Wear users have

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.665
a 40% monthly active usage.

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:27.930
Android Wear brings a much more
engaged community to our app.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.180
In fact, some of our users
are only using Hole19

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.209
on the Android Wear.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.500
And we think that it is a
consequence of the big effort

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.680
that we put into developing it.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.090
Moving to Android
Wear as a developer

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.470
was relatively easy,
given the quality

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.720
of the wearable libraries.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800
One of the most important things
on the on-course experience

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.210
was checking the
distances to the green.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.710
That was a core feature that
we had to move from the phone

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.060
to the watch.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.840
One thing that you
have to take into

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.290
account when developing
apps for Wear,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.700
is that the phone and the
app communicate at all times.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.530
For this, we have used
the data layer API that

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.100
makes our life really easy.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.990
Because it is just a matter
of exchanging the right

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.510
small portions of data.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.210
With the new launch
of Android Wear 2.0,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.000
we have access to
a whole new set

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.510
of features that can
improve the user experience.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.220
We are already using
the Complications API,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.430
because we want the user to
feel connected with online team.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.730
We want him to look
to the watch face

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.020
and have quick
access to information

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.480
like his handicap,
his average score,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.490
how many days has passed
from the last time he

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.350
had played golf.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.120
ANTHONY DOUGLAS:
It's been amazing

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.200
looking back when this
company was started,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.590
when I was in my basement
mapping golf courses

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.540
for six hours.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.570
Little did I know that
a few years later we'd

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.030
have 1 million users.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.420
I didn't really expect
it to be this powerful.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.500
I also didn't expect to bring
30 people into this company.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.640
It's been really rewarding.
