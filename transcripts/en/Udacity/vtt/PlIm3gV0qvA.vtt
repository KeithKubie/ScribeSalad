00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.918
At the end of the previous video,

00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:06.235
we refined our initial question, how popular were the different brands of

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:10.555
candy to a precisely formulated statistical inference problem in which we

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:15.000
want to create a regression estimator for interselection time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.480
Now before we can do that,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.050
we must identify what features we'd like to use in our model.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.130
As you know, if our goal is prediction, we must choose features which have

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.550
some kind of influential force over our response variable.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.600
Which in this case is interselection time.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.690
Our goal now is to identify what those features might be.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.320
What features would you use for the model?

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.990
The types of brands?

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.623
The number of each type of candy in the bowl?

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.860
The time of day?

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.740
Or the type of candy?
