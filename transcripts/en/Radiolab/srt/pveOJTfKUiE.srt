1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,190
You are listening to radio lab radio from

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,560
W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. So the,
I guess my first question is like what?

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,830
What conceivable set of circumstances
led to you doing what you did?

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,390
I just thought it would be a weird
thing to do. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's like,

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,660
well that would be weird. We don't
know if it's funny, but we try it out.

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,690
So yeah. Is it going to be
weird? We'll do it. Yeah.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,620
Is it going to alienate
half the audience? Yeah.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,593
No.

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,470
Okay. Wait, just to set
things up, you'd better.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,710
Those two people that you just heard
her wrist and show and Kurt Brown? No.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,410
Hello?

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,330
They are comedians. That's it.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,630
And we first heard about the bit you're
about to hear from Jesse Thorn. Yes.

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,260
The host of the sound of young
America. Yes. Great. Yeah.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,270
Are you rolling over there, Jessie?
No, let me record you. Okay.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,220
From my phone. Okay. Yeah, I'm rolling.

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,150
So you said that when Kurt and Kristen
walk on stage, what happened? Well,

18
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:13,960
there's a cuddle of jokes up top.
You know, they joke about this,

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,050
this TV show that they hosted in the
70s uncle Ben's farmyard courthouse.

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,830
I explained the American judicial system
using a court house made completely of

21
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,960
animals. Yeah, it was
canceled immediately. Yeah.

22
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,150
And so the audience is kind of laughing
at the jokes, thinking like, oh,

23
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:35,820
this is going to be a regular comedy
sketch sketch from it tonight. All right.

24
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,270
Hey Harrigan. I got ready.
I'm ready. Okay. Okay.

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,860
And then they go into this song.

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,170
Oh, okay. Tom.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,920
Oh good. Tom Is

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,440
does this maniacal singing, clapping.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,660
Christine is doing this horsey day.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,920
It's like, Oh wow,

31
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,893
wow,

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,333
wow.

33
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,170
Can you do this viewer in like why

34
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,050
Titian Jad like when we do it, we like
at the, after the third [inaudible]

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,250
my last name. They get it like, oh, they
could just going to do over and over

36
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,040
and then somewhere around like
four AV around the fourth time.

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,840
Then it's not really enough.
Money I use is quiet.

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,660
They're like, I'm done with this, I'm
done. I don't want to watch this anymore.

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,860
Why are they still doing it? And then,

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,470
and then that changes the
actual hatred and they're like,

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,550
you stupid people, you to stupid people,

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,780
but somewhere between like nine and 11

43
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,030
and they then they're like, oh,

44
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,430
I like this. You could be like

45
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,840
[inaudible] you get this next level,

46
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,870
which is they can't continue doing this
and then they do continue doing it.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,393
Okay.

48
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,250
But again, they really, their eyes
are starting to cross by that point.

49
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:06,540
I'm dripping sweat. Kristen's
angry that I've gone that long.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,020
It's like look good.

51
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,970
I mean you can hear a Kurt in that thing
like losing track of the song because

52
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,950
he's going into some kind of fuse.

53
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,443
Wow.

54
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,790
Have had her on stage whisper, stop it.

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,690
I love here I walk in my house

56
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,843
[inaudible]

57
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,430
this is maybe my favorite thing
in the history of the world.

58
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,210
What I love about it is that your brain
is trying to make it into what you want

59
00:04:56,601 --> 00:05:00,080
it to be, which is a joke, but
there is no joke happening.

60
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
And so what these two people are doing
is creating the expectation that the

61
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:07,310
expectation is going to be broken,

62
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,240
but then breaking that expectation that
the expectation is going to be broken by

63
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:14,330
just delivering the thing that they've
been delivering over and over for the

64
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:16,010
past 10 minutes. What's the longest

65
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,730
10 minutes in Australia?
Cause you were drunk? Yeah,

66
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,890
it seemed like it seemed like 10 minutes.
We can't be sure if it was 10 minutes.

67
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,190
It seems like there's no way
it's 10 minutes. You what?

68
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,310
It was 10 minutes and
the audience went crazy.

69
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,270
No, but you really do

70
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,010
Kristen Schaal as a whole.
Justin Scholl is a home.

71
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,100
The good or okay to go
look good or dance like, Oh

72
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,350
hey, I'm Chad at boom. Ron's in
Charlotte. I'm Robert Krulwich dance.

73
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,830
This is Radiolab and today,
oh today it's all about loops.

74
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,250
Things

75
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,020
that happen over and over and over and
over and over and over and over and over.

76
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,310
Coming up. Lipstick hurt you stream
loops that heal you. Dangerous sleeps,

77
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,240
that scare you.

78
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,860
Loops and loops and loops
that incomplete you at what?

79
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,550
Kristen's

80
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,500
a [inaudible].

81
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,760
So where, where are you guys?
What? We were in San Francisco.

82
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,810
You're in San Francisco,
you're not in Texas? No,

83
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,430
just sounds like we're in
Texas. Yes. She's from Texas.

84
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,400
So like can you guys actually
just a, if you don't mind,

85
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,610
introduce yourself so we know we
have your name and all that. Sure.

86
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,310
I'm Mary Sue Campbell. I live in Novato,

87
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:42,900
California and my daughter
Christine is 30 years old.

88
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,880
I live in San Francisco. Um,

89
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,070
and I was raised in Nevato in the
house that said this didn't happen.

90
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,660
That shall we begin. Okay.

91
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,080
Tell me the beginning w how this
story starts from the beginning.

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,110
I thought it was odd.

93
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:02,730
Christine actually called
me Tuesday morning about 10
o'clock and just said, oh,

94
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:04,710
what are you doing mom? And I said, Oh,

95
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:08,160
I'm just going to go out in the yard and
do some yard work and run some errands.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,551
And she said,

97
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:11,520
we ought to do the yard work early
because it's going to be hot today.

98
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,670
So we're in, we're in the summertime.
It's summertime. Yeah, it was August,

99
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,900
August 24th and apparently
what, 10 minutes later,

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,070
half an hour later,
she said, I called her,

101
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,150
she had left me a voicemail, something
like, Hey Christine, it's mom.

102
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,150
Something's, something's not
right. Something's wrong.

103
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,780
I need you to call me back.
So I gave her a call back and,

104
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,760
and she said something thing
about the house isn't right.

105
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:42,410
There's things look weird in here.
What's weird? What are you talking about?

106
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,420
And then she said, well, I'm looking
at the calendar and it says August,

107
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,860
2010 and I'm like, uh Huh. No. She's like,

108
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,590
well that's not right. And I said, well,

109
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,440
yes it is August 24th,

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,770
2010 and as soon as I said that
out loud, I grabbed my purse

111
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,440
to leave. Oh my God, she's
had a stroke. That was my, my,

112
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,090
my first reaction. And um, oh,
that makes me feel emotional.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,860
And so Christine says she walked
out of her house to the car,

114
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,810
keeping your mom on the
phone. What else do you see?

115
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm just trying to keep her
talking to me. All the while.

116
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,240
Her mom's telling her one thing after
another just doesn't look right.

117
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,940
She says there's a strange
black truck on the driveway,

118
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,510
which is the truck that belongs to her
boyfriend that has been parked there for

119
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:32,680
10 years. So I'm of course,
increasingly, I mean,

120
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm just freaking out at this point.

121
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,570
So she hangs up with her
mom and then calls the the

122
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,040
paramedics and a half hour later,
Christine arrived at the hospital.

123
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,210
By the time I walked in,

124
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:46,080
she had been there for five
or 10 minutes at the most,

125
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,000
and as soon as I walked in, the doctor
greeted me and said, I said, uh, yeah,

126
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:55,050
this is her doctor, Jonathan bellows.
Christine. It's immediately evident.

127
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,000
It's not a stroke, not an infection.
That's, that's a huge relief. But I said,

128
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,290
your mother has, has transient,
Global Amnesia, fancy and global.

129
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,700
Transient. Global. How did those words
hit you? I'll be honest with you.

130
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,810
I had no idea what that meant. I think
the word I heard the most was amnesia.

131
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,980
Oh, your mother has lost her
ability to form new memories.

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,180
She can't remember, but said it's
not going to last forever. Um,

133
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,600
it usually lasts between one and 24
hours and we're not sure what causes it.

134
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,140
And it's at this point where the story
goes from something kind of frightening

135
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,300
to something a little more surreal.
Yes. So when I came in, um,

136
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,590
her mother is sitting up in bed,

137
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,660
she's a smiler and she immediately
started asking, yes. Okay,

138
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:44,320
so what's the date? I said, well,
it's Tuesday, August 24th. Yes.

139
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,190
And of course we have a video on youtube
of this. My birthday's any pants. Yep.

140
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,610
Do you remember how I remember that?
I'm trying to remember the last date.

141
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,730
I remember. I don't
remember if never. Yeah,

142
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,551
we hung out.

143
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,580
You came over to my house and we watched
a video that I made for you when I was

144
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:07,960
in Texas and all of your sisters
and some of your brothers said,

145
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:11,050
happy birthday to you on the video.
Yeah. But we still have the videos.

146
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,861
You can watch it again,

147
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,340
but you're going to remember eventually
they say it's just temporary.

148
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,170
Where it was, it was at
home. You're at home yet.

149
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,660
You're at home doing some gardening
and you called me and you're feeling

150
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:25,960
confused. So I called the paramedics
had been come and get you.

151
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,310
And then we came here. You defend your
tests on you. Okay, so what's the date?

152
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,590
August 24th it's Tuesday.

153
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,140
I'm trying to remember the
last day I remember. Yeah,

154
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,980
I don't remember my birthday. Do you
remember your birthday? Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,740
That must've just been recently.
Yeah, a couple weeks ago.

156
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,950
Now you might've missed
it, but this conversation,

157
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:52,951
they're having just started over August
because every 90 seconds Mary Sue's

158
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,920
memory resets. August 24th
what's strange is the repetition,

159
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:59,530
like we started that last clip.
You heard with her saying this,

160
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,020
trying to remember the last day. Damn,

161
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:05,770
remember 90 seconds later after
her memory resets, she says,

162
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,340
try to remember the bias. A date.
I remember 90 seconds later,

163
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,100
I'm trying to remember the
last day. Damn remember.

164
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,000
And as you watched this
video for a few minutes,

165
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:20,140
you realize what's happening here.
Is that Mary Sue Dan Week? It is, no,

166
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,020
it's in a loop and it goes
like this. First, the date.

167
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,403
What's the date?

168
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,080
August 24th she then responds in
almost the same way every time.

169
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,920
Birthdays. Yes. She's missed her
birthday. All right. Yep, Yep.

170
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,900
And every time she says that, darn in
exactly the same way. If you fast forward,

171
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,310
it's already past my
birthday though. Yeah.

172
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,300
She must enjoy your birthday quite a
bit. Eventually. Then she laughs, Hey,

173
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,130
what happened? Then they recapped.

174
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,770
You're working in the garden
and you gave me a call.

175
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,310
Christine explains the whole thing.

176
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,330
It's usually when she says
the word paramedic called
the paramedics right there

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,830
and have them come and pick you up.

178
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,250
The Mary Sue's eyes get really wide in
this look of sheer and utter disbelief.

179
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,460
Yes. Yeah. Isn't that creepy? I
mean, every single, and you say that.

180
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,480
Isn't that creepy? Creepy.

181
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,760
90 seconds later is some
creepy 90 seconds later

182
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,800
and it's often at this
point right after creepy

183
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,770
that you was sets. Okay,
so I don't know. Tuesday,

184
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,700
like somebody put it on rewind
over and over and over again.

185
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,533
Yes.

186
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,420
Add repeated the birthday summit that
the nurse apparently was behind me

187
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,870
mouthing the words. Yeah.
Oh, that's my birthday. Yeah.

188
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,370
Girls like groundhog day
in here, groundhog's Day,

189
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,320
every two minutes we're doing a
list. The same thing. Yes we do that.

190
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:53,810
We have had the same
conversation over and over again.

191
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,790
Every two minutes for the last two and
a half hours. Two and a half hours. No,

192
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,040
they, we can't seem to
talk about anything else.

193
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,070
That is what we're talking about today.

194
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,330
What Day of the week is
it? Tuesday, August 24th

195
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,040
you didn't miss it. You were
there. Yeah, I'm watching it.

196
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,550
I wanted to slap me and you know I wanted
to reach out and slap me and say damn

197
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,640
it. I just told you that for the record
I would never slept. My mom would not.

198
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,360
No she would not. And here is a clear,
this is a person who's lost her memory.

199
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:33,810
Yeah.

200
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,810
But why would her behavior from one
cycle to the next be so precisely and

201
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:43,620
consistently the same? I mean
sometimes exactly the same. Yeah. Why?

202
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,300
I think what it is is one of the things
the nurses said is that when you have

203
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:51,900
something like this,
your true self comes out.

204
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,190
Your true. The word true
is interesting. So yeah.

205
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,150
Is that what we're saying on the
video? Is that your true person,

206
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,580
your true self? Oh yeah. I mean that's
my mom through and through right there.

207
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:05,250
I mean, she's, what Christine
means is not the repetition,

208
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,830
but that her mom keeps asking so
many questions. She's inquisitive.

209
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,670
She just wants to know what's going
on with, with all sorts, you know,

210
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,630
across the board. I love
problems. I love puzzles.

211
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,940
Are you like a Sudoku fiend? You know,
I am. I am. I hate to admit this,

212
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:25,560
God, I play Escape Room Games
on the Internet escape room.

213
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:26,370
What are those?

214
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,630
They're stupid little games where they
have little hidden pixels that you find

215
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,360
you're, you're stuck in a
room and you have to get out.

216
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,620
You've got to find the key to the door
and there's all these little hidden

217
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:41,460
places. Oh, this is the perfect,
perfect metaphor then. Oh yeah.

218
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,880
I was my own escape room. I'd
be like, Hey, didn't get it

219
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,460
Tuesday. There's a different way
of seeing this. First of all,

220
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:55,070
Jonathan blow that er doctor who's seen
a bunch of these cases, he said, well,

221
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,620
that puzzler instinct,
that's not just Mary sue.

222
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,680
What everybody does is struggle over and
over again with where am I and when am

223
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:08,660
I? It's just the brain in survival mode.
And another thing that everybody does,

224
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,780
and he's seen him about six of these
patients so far, is it everybody,

225
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,920
not just Mary sue,

226
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:17,260
but everybody becomes a broken
record right down to the,

227
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:21,220
the phrasing of the sentences,
which keeps them out a little bit.

228
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,590
It makes, you know,

229
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:27,510
it makes the brain seem a little
bit more like a machine. You know,

230
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:31,530
you give the machine the exact same
set of inputs every 90 seconds,

231
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,050
give it the same doctor,
the same hospital room,

232
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,830
same beeping machines and see
if the output ever varies.

233
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,530
And it doesn't, it almost
seems like the patient, uh,

234
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,030
has no free well.

235
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,030
And so sometimes in the back
of his head he thinks, God,

236
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:54,020
if I had that condition and someone
videotaped me, I would love to see,

237
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,680
see my own tape. Why,
you know, I think, uh,

238
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,080
I want to see, could I somehow
escape the loop? Huh? Or,

239
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,650
or would I, would I had depth
and depth with the rest of us?

240
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,890
Now, thankfully, according to Jonathan,

241
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,830
what normally happens in this
condition is that as time goes on,

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,890
that 92nd loop starts to slowly expand.

243
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,050
So it's actually more like
two minutes or three minutes.

244
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Eventually four minutes. Now it's
five minutes. And for Mary Sue,

245
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,290
after a few hours as her
loop got longer and longer,

246
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,890
her old memories started to
creep back in. By that evening,

247
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,930
she was remembering up until um,
like that Sunday, few hours later,

248
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,810
her memory began to extend
into Monday morning.

249
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:40,640
By the time we left the hospital, she
remembered Monday night. And then finally,

250
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,320
shall we begin? Okay.

251
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,620
Tell me the beginning how this
story starts beginning. Uh,

252
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,770
I, it was odd.

253
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:53,390
Christine actually called
me Tuesday morning about 10
o'clock and just said, oh,

254
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:57,740
what are you doing mom? And
apparently 10 minutes later,

255
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,953
hour later,

256
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,150
hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Jad
Abumrad man, we'll be right back.
