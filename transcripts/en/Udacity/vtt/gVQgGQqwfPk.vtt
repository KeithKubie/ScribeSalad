00:00:00.053 --> 00:00:04.687
That's right, we can increase the number of bytes delivered per transaction or

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:07.810
we can decrease the latency, the time between transactions.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.449
To increase the number of bytes delivered, the Starbucks analogy might be

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.689
to have many servers simultaneously serving up multiple cups of coffee.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.013
Whereas, decreasing the latency means having your servers work faster,

00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:28.589
taking less time to take an order, create a coffee, and deliver it back.
