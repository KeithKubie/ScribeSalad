Hey, ocean, what’s with all the salt?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.120
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews at YouTube
Space LA.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.100
Recently we got a question from NENE71984
asking why the oceans were salty, and everyone

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.360
in the office kind of looked at each other
and went, “Yeah, why?”

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.300
I’m going to assume she’s not asking why
the ocean is all sassy and bitter, but instead

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.600
is asking why there’s salt in the oceans
but not in our lakes and streams.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.070
Except some lakes like the Great Salt Lake,
I know, people in Utah and internet trolls.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.140
Jeez, I always have to be technically correct
with you guys, the best kind of correct.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.820
First off the salt in the oceans is 90% the
same chemical makeup as your table salt, good

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.210
old NaCl.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.790
Sodium Chloride isn’t the only kind of salt
there is, there are many varieties because

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.700
a salt is just a compound held together by
an ionic bond.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.890
What happens is an atom steals an electron
from another and becomes negatively charged

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.890
or an anion.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.780
Then it’s attracted to the positive cation
and the two atoms bond.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.860
So a lot of different chemicals can come together
and make salts, and because of this the ocean

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.049
salt is also made of a little magnesium, calcium,
potassium, and a polyatomic anion made of

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.119
sulfur and 4 oxygens called sulfate.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.139
But how does the salt get there?

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:12.179
From the rocks on land, actually.

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.700
According to the US Geological Survey, dissolved
CO2 in rainwater makes it slightly acidic,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.049
eroding rocks when it falls.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.460
That’s not the only trick water has up its
sleeve.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.270
And H2O molecule is polar, the oxygen atom
hogs the electrons so it’s more negatively

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.249
charged on one side and more positively charged
by the hydrogen atoms.

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.259
When salts are in water, they break apart
because the only thing holding them in their

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.469
crystalline shape was that ionic attraction.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.619
Once the rain lands, it flows downhill, carrying
the dissolved minerals and ions to streams

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.389
and lakes and rivers and eventually the oceans.

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.049
The USGS also points out salt comes from inside
the ocean too.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.829
Volcanoes and hydrothermal vents heat water
so it can dissolve some of the basalt on the

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.259
ocean floor, adding salt to the mix.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.060
But why does the ocean stay salty?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.920
Because salt has been accumulating there faster
than it leaves.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.499
Some organisms use the salt or the basalt
on the ocean floor takes some back, but the

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:00.669
exchange rate isn’t even.

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:02.409
There’s also the factor of evaporation.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.429
When water evaporates, the molecules spread
farther apart and the magnetic pull from the

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.750
vapor isn’t enough to bring the ions with
them.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.959
As a result, the salt stays behind and it
rains fresh water.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.630
So long as the water doesn’t get stuck inland
a la the Great Salt lake, salinity levels

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:47.230
will stay below .05%, compared to the 3.5%
average salinity of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.950
the oceans.
