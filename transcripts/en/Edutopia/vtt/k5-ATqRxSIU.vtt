00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:09.746
&gt;&gt;Eddy: Hi, my name is Eddy Kim.

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:12.306
I'm the site planner, and thank you
for letting us propose the plan,

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:13.846
on behalf of the city council--

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The city of
Yorktown is considering proposals

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.476
from several real estate
developers for plans

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:21.966
to revitalize the blighted
neighborhood of Elmwood.

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:25.776
&gt;&gt;Eddy: We plan on putting a
lake or big kind of like pond

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:27.516
in the middle as our focal point.

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:30.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Elmwood is a fictional
place, but many communities

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.176
across the country
face similar problems.

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:34.386
&gt;&gt;Student: Actually,
the number's going to be

00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:35.756
about one point five million.

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:38.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These students
from Alameda High School

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:41.736
in northern California are presenting
solutions at the culmination

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:46.896
of a three week project based
learning exercise called Urban Plan.

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:51.196
&gt;&gt;Paula: Urban Plan was designed
to take required economics

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:55.856
and required government classes out
of their silos and put them together

00:00:56.196 --> 00:01:01.236
in a way that students of a
sudden had that, "Oh, I get it.

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.176
So I aced my standardized tests.

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:06.626
I know how to write an answer
about supply and demand.

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:10.776
But when I do Urban Plan, now I
understand why I can't afford to live

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:11.796
in the town I grew up in."

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:14.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And so I just want to
reiterate that there isn't like,

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:18.076
"Oh yeah, you have to put in
tons of parks, or you have to put

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:19.876
in skyscrapers to generate
all this money."

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.696
There are many possible answers.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:23.376
That's the point of reality.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Developed at UC Berkeley,
the Urban Land Project is available

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:30.166
to schools in many cities
through the Urban Land Institute's

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.226
district councils.

00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:33.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And then you've
got neighborhood letters,

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.466
which are the interest groups that
have so far stepped forward and said,

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.526
"Hey, this is what we want here."

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:40.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It is a rigorous
project that addresses most

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:42.566
of the state economics
curriculum standards,

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:46.866
like marginal cost benefit,
allocation of goods and services,

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.826
and the role of incentives.

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The dry goods
building, it's a historic building,

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:53.056
and you can read a little
bit about it and what kind

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:54.606
of uses you can do with it.

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:56.666
There are limits on this
building, you have to do this.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.126
This building, you can
do whatever you want.

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To make
it easy on teachers,

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:04.186
the Land Institute provides
everything they need for the project,

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:08.476
from outside expert
volunteers to laptops and Legos.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.886
&gt;&gt;Paula: All the materials
are paid for, the Lego kits,

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:16.106
the teacher's guide and lesson
plans, the curriculum handbooks,

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:18.936
the site plans, everything,
delivered to the teacher.

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:22.006
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The idea that you
can't really be entirely creative,

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:24.346
and there are these rigid
requirements on building heights,

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.656
appearances, locations, is realistic.

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:31.286
So you're thinking creatively, and
you've just got to think differently.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students use
the Legos to create a model

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:35.526
of their new neighborhood.

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:39.196
The computers are loaded with the
sophisticated software they need

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:41.176
to solve complex dilemmas.

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:41.546
&gt;&gt;It's too high.

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:42.976
&gt;&gt;Yeah, it's way too high.

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:46.576
&gt;&gt;Student: How do we kill our percent
but still make the city go up?

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They are
broken into teams of five

00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:53.086
and teach student serves in a
specific role, like site planner,

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.836
director of marketing,
or neighborhood liaison.

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:59.216
&gt;&gt;Student: My role as the
financial advisor was basically just

00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:02.946
to make profit for both the
investors and the city, so that's--

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:05.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They must become
experts in their individual roles

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.586
and share their ideas with the group.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.986
&gt;&gt;Rob: This project has
things that are going to stick

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:12.776
with the students more in their
life, working with different people

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.306
that they didn't like,
speaking in front of strangers,

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.626
thinking about something from
a different point of view.

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:21.306
You know, thinking about
design, appreciating the world

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:23.236
that they live in,
politically, aesthetically,

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:24.796
working on a spreadsheet.

00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:26.996
&gt;&gt;Student: It's a neighborhood
retail, for example,

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.466
the absorption rate is two point
eight six, which is pretty close

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:34.496
to our upper limit, 'cause the
optimum absorption rate is three,

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:37.606
and midrise office building,
we actually went over that,

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.506
so it's a problem we need to solve.

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students must deal
with all kinds of problems,

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.026
like balancing parking
lots with open space.

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:46.656
&gt;&gt;Student: I think we could
make this park smaller,

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:48.176
this park is really big.

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Generating
sufficient returns.

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:52.476
&gt;&gt;Student: We're making ten million,
six hundred and fifty-six thousand

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:53.556
and losing three million--

00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:56.476
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And addressing
the conflicting priorities

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:58.166
of neighborhood interest groups.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:03:59.726
&gt;&gt;Student: I don't know, if
we put in a homeless shelter,

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:02.826
and the neighborhood alliance
gets mad, then they're just going

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.316
to be bothering city
council to death, you know.

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:06.626
They're just going to
be knocking on the door,

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:07.886
"What are all these
homeless people doing here?"

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:10.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the second week,
real estate professionals who serve

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:14.886
as facilitators come to class
to discuss the initial designs,

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:17.586
sometimes providing a
harsh reality check.

00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:18.626
&gt;&gt;Student: Affordable housing,

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.906
right now it's fifty-fifty
for one building.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.646
&gt;&gt;Marisita: Fifty-fifty, okay.

00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:24.786
&gt;&gt;I don't like to tell
them what to do ever.

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:28.046
I really would like
to ask hard questions.

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.016
If they have the homeless
shelter, I immediately say,

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:34.706
"What difficulties
would that pose to you?"

00:04:34.706 --> 00:04:38.766
&gt;&gt;If they don't have it, I
ask them immediately, "Oh,

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:40.296
so you moved the homeless shelter.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:42.426
Where are the homeless going to be?"

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:45.436
&gt;&gt;And you can deal with
the issues both ways,

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:49.966
but the important things here is to
deal with the issue, confront it.

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:52.336
&gt;&gt;Student: We're supposed to
follow like the primary goals,

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:57.416
and one of them is to remove the
blighting influences, and we thought

00:04:57.506 --> 00:05:00.016
that the homeless shelter
just brought everything down.

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:02.906
&gt;&gt;Jacqueline: Going into the project,
we think, "Oh that's easy, you know.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.526
I can just put some Legos here.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:07.266
That represents a building
and it's all good."

00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:10.166
But then you really have
to think about the effects

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.566
of what it's going to do.

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's going
to be in these stores?

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:14.426
Have you thought about any of that?

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.686
What's going to pull
people down here?

00:05:16.686 --> 00:05:17.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Restaurants, Boutiques.

00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:18.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Coffee shops.

00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:21.306
&gt;&gt;Jacqueline: Also we had the
experts come in and question us.

00:05:21.306 --> 00:05:22.596
Some of them were harsh.

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:25.676
Some of them were a lot nicer about
it, but either way, we learned a lot

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:26.766
from all of them, I'd say.

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:27.566
&gt;&gt;They got-- see, this way--

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:28.246
&gt;&gt;Seventy-five percent.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:29.076
&gt;&gt;We have less opposites--

00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:29.506
&gt;&gt;Now it's eighty--

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.666
&gt;&gt;-- is a lot smaller.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:33.416
&gt;&gt;We also have a midrise, okay?

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh yeah,
we had the midrise.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:34.856
Is it a midrise?

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.546
&gt;&gt;Dong-Jin: The project as a whole,
it gets you ready for the real world.

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:39.606
Just looking at the book,
it gets very tedious,

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:40.646
like you're just looking in a book.

00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:42.056
You're memorizing facts and stuff.

00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:45.396
But once you learn how to
actually use those facts,

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:48.916
you get a deeper understanding and
you can better interpret questions,

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:51.326
and so you build up
really useful skills.

00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:54.176
&gt;&gt;Student: Our group is called
Mindsweepers Corporations,

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:57.236
and our vision is to
have a very diverse city

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:59.326
that have a more suburban feel.

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:04.716
In our first block, we have retail
such as Macy's and Barnes &amp; Noble's

00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:05.696
for the college students.

00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:09.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Presentation time is
limited to ten to twelve minutes,

00:06:09.426 --> 00:06:13.186
with each student speaking from the
perspective of their individual role.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:16.016
&gt;&gt;Student: All right, I'm
the financial analyst.

00:06:16.016 --> 00:06:16.676
My name's Daniel--

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A question and answer
period follows each proposal.

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:23.056
&gt;&gt;Paula: Is it going to be an
animal shelter or an office?

00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:25.656
&gt;&gt;Student: It's divided
into two, and--

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:27.226
&gt;&gt;Paula: It's true that
there's no right answer,

00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:30.206
so we may challenge
or question a lot.

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:33.516
&gt;&gt;So a nonprofit office that
acts as an animal shelter?

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:35.786
&gt;&gt;Student: The way that you say it,
it makes it sound like there's going

00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.316
to be dogs jumping
on the office tables.

00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:37.466
&gt;&gt;Paula: Yup.

00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:39.566
&gt;&gt;Student: We have nonprofit--

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:40.726
&gt;&gt;Paula: That's how council sees it.

00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:42.886
&gt;&gt;Student: The nonprofit
in one section and office

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:44.076
in one section, so like--

00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:46.876
&gt;&gt;Paula: Let me just stop you
about the logistics of it.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:50.036
What I'm interested in is,
so you're putting in an SPCA,

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:53.626
which I don't see either the city
or the neighborhood requested,

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:57.546
and you're not putting in a
daycare center, a police substation,

00:06:57.546 --> 00:07:00.556
any of the things that
we offered to subsidize

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:01.856
or that the neighborhood requested.

00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:02.366
Is that correct?

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:03.146
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:04.626
&gt;&gt;Yeah, that would be correct.

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:06.056
&gt;&gt;Paula: That's correct, thank you.

00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:10.776
&gt;&gt;Daniel: My group decided
that it would be more important

00:07:10.776 --> 00:07:13.136
to include other things
that weren't in the RFP.

00:07:13.136 --> 00:07:17.136
I was just sitting at the computer,
typing in what they wanted.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.886
My job was to make sure
that we made money.

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:21.606
&gt;&gt;The city liaison's job was to say,

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:23.586
"You're not meeting all
of the RFP requirements.

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:25.426
That was a big problem with our plan.

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.786
&gt;&gt;Student: The retail,
we think is a good mix,

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:31.606
because we will have coffee shops and
Laundromats and small businesses--

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:33.886
&gt;&gt;Paula: Because the students
are assigned a specific role,

00:07:34.146 --> 00:07:39.326
the teacher can evaluate how well a
student understands and has worked

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:42.186
on this role by the input
they're bringing into the class

00:07:42.446 --> 00:07:44.146
and the presentation they make.

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:47.046
&gt;&gt;So a good student on a
weak team can still get an A.

00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:49.336
&gt;&gt;Student: Victoria Row is
forty percent nonprofit.

00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:51.696
Ten percent of that is
going towards artists,

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:54.086
which is one of the
demands of the community.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While students
gain an appreciation

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.516
for the challenges
involved in development,

00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:02.046
teacher Rob Sultanan thinks
the project offers even more

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:03.146
valuable lessons.

00:08:03.146 --> 00:08:06.366
&gt;&gt;Rob: From this project, there
are all these non objective,

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:09.466
nontraditional measure
things that are curiosity,

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.636
creativity, teamwork, passion.

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:15.896
So I do it for those reasons, not
because of the economics curriculum.

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.136
&gt;&gt;Student: We have
a police substation,

00:08:17.546 --> 00:08:18.816
which will watch over the park.

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:23.306
&gt;&gt;Rob: I believe that to be educated
is to be thoughtful, to be wise,

00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:26.686
to have perspective, to
step out of your world view,

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.946
and that the Urban Plan
accomplishes all those things.

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:31.396
&gt;&gt;Student: We wanted to give
people a sense of place,

00:08:31.916 --> 00:08:35.526
so we put the businesses near the
businesses, as you can see here.

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:39.066
