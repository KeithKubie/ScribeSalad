00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.169
- What do we have here?

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.922
I have "The Delphian Course,"
10 volume set, first edition,

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.425
which was printed in 1901.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:09.759
RICK: This is really cool.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.261
Where did you guys get these?

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.762
We got them at a swap meet.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.389
So obviously you guys
shop at the same store.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.559
[laughing]

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.018
ERIC: We came to
the pawn shop today

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.438
to sell our "Delphian Course."

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.440
This particular set
was a liberal arts

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.649
education for women.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.067
DEREK: It's
definitely a cool set.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.485
ERIC: It looked great on
my bookshelf for years.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.903
[laughing]

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.655
We tend to move a lot
more than we used to,

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:33.658
and to lug around from place to
place is just too much to bear.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.118
[chuckle]

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.830
RICK: Back late
1800s, early 1900s,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.207
publishers were making
lots of sets of books

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.501
like this, because
it was a way people

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.712
could get educated without
going to college, you know?

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.046
Basically they were
like book clubs--

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.256
Oh.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.049
RICK: --and Delphian
was for women.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.718
Say you live in a small town.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.344
You know, your husband worked,
you took care of the kids,

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.054
but you're going to
read a book at night.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.973
And one day a week,
your club met.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.892
They had intellectual
discussions

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.727
and they talked about what
they read about that week.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.898
It was a social thing, and
you get to learn something.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.399
These cover just
about everything.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.318
It was a really
liberal arts thing.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:12.489
Medieval stories, history
of music, conduct of life.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:15.283
This set of books, you know,
would last you for years.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.827
By the time you were done,
you had a much broader

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.162
understanding of the world.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.288
It was a great
thing for the time.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.498
[music playing]

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.208
So what do you want
to do with them?

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.250
I want to sell them.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.376
I'm tired of moving them around.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.045
[laughing]

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.713
- Books can get heavy, yes.
- Yes.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:29.756
[laughing]

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:30.715
How much do you want for them?

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:31.633
$250.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.384
[pained sigh]

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:35.428
I know the second
edition sold for $150.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.222
[exhale]

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:38.306
That person was really lucky.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.891
[laughing]

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.476
Just because something
is a first edition

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.145
doesn't mean it's worth
a lot of money, OK?

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:47.732
When you talk about volumes like
encyclopedia sets and volumes

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:51.194
like this, they just
don't sell well.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.320
I would give you
50 bucks for it.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.241
Hm.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.742
Could you go $100?
RICK: No.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.452
Ah.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.120
They're nice books
and everything,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.081
but they're just not that
collectible, plain and simple.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.749
Would you do $60, because
that's easier to split?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.672
Were you guys bad
in math, or something?

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.340
Yes.
[laughing]

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.967
I'll give you 50 bucks.
That's it.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.348
OK, deal.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.266
All right.
RICK: Cool, man.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.433
Thanks.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:23.226
RICK: All right,
let's go up here.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:23.768
I'll write you up.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:24.727
Thanks.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.020
ERIC: Made 50 bucks today.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.772
We're going to go
have a nice dinner.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.400
DEREK: I saw a really nice print
I want to buy that's $60, so--

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.235
and you can't split
that, can you?

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.319
No.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.405
You'll probably win.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.406
As always.
