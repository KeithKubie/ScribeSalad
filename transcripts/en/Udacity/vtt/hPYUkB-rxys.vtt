00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
All options except for giving up immediately are viable options

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
depending on the situation.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000
So it's always a good idea to do research on the problem that you're working on

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because many problems that occur in practice have occurred elsewhere before.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So it's likely that there will be some research

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
on this problem, and that can help you a lot potentially.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Of course, you can also try to show NP-completeness for your problem

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because if you manage to show this, then you know your problem is going to be hard.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is not an excuse to give up right away,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but you basically just know what you're dealing with.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's always a good idea to discuss the problem

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you're working on with friends and experts, of course,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because they might have a new insight that helps you.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
And finally, settling for a suboptimal algorithm--and we're going to talk more

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
about this in later units--can sometimes also be a good option if the stakes aren't high.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500
So, for example, Alice working on vertex cover--if her company is happy

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
with installing a few more monitoring devices than the absolute minimum,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
then she can possibly find another algorithm

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or just maybe even solve it by hand if she wants to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In this unit, we're going to focus on this aspect here--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
showing you how you can prove NP-completeness for a problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We have already done this a couple of times,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but it's worth to practice this technique.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And then how you can do some research on your problem.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I'll give you some example problems that often occur in practice

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so that you know the names; and when you come across them,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
then you'll have an easier time to find out more

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
about the problem that you're trying to solve.
