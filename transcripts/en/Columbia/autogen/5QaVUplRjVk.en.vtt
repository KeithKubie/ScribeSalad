00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
and hadn't seen in the literature and
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.670
and hadn't seen in the literature and
then I wondered what it was like to grow

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680
then I wondered what it was like to grow
 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.230

up in a family there where that was a

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240
up in a family there where that was a
 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.170
up in a family there where that was a
family tradition and so I began looking

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180
family tradition and so I began looking
 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.840
family tradition and so I began looking
for the three generations and that was

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850
for the three generations and that was
 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.100
for the three generations and that was
one of the things that took the longest

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110
one of the things that took the longest
 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.860
one of the things that took the longest

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.390
it was very tough to either find
families in which there were three

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400
families in which there were three
 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.390
families in which there were three
living generations of mothers who had

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400
living generations of mothers who had
 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.810
living generations of mothers who had
worked or if I found three generations

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820
worked or if I found three generations
 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.510
worked or if I found three generations
it was hard having all three generations

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520
it was hard having all three generations
 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.270
it was hard having all three generations
wanting to speak so I had found one

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
wanting to speak so I had found one
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.140

family I spent a lot of time with them

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150

the grandmother had needed to go to work
 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.490
the grandmother had needed to go to work
because her husband was an alcoholic and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500
because her husband was an alcoholic and
 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.080

ultimately though her daughter was eager

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090

years earlier and I think the husband

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320
years earlier and I think the husband
 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.540
years earlier and I think the husband
was no longer living

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550
was no longer living
 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.750

things like that because we tend to

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:06.810

conversation that that doesn't involve
the people it should involve and I think

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:24.569
the people it should involve and I think
 

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:27.139
the people it should involve and I think
that's that's something to consider too

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:27.149
that's that's something to consider too
 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.900
that's that's something to consider too

carry that that burden right right in
the jet and the general societal

00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:45.019
the jet and the general societal
 

00:12:45.019 --> 00:13:08.740
the jet and the general societal
discussion makes it worse

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:08.750
 

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:24.930
we'll talk yeah

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:24.940
 

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:42.550
mmm

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560
 

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.590
in the third generation or in the middle

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600
in the third generation or in the middle
 

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:56.059
in the third generation or in the middle
generation you're either one can you

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:56.069
generation you're either one can you
 

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.699
generation you're either one can you
hear me now no were you finding that

00:13:58.699 --> 00:13:58.709
hear me now no were you finding that
 

00:13:58.709 --> 00:14:01.819
hear me now no were you finding that
that the daughters of working mothers

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:01.829
that the daughters of working mothers
 

00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:04.100
that the daughters of working mothers
were deciding that they didn't want to

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:04.110
were deciding that they didn't want to
 

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.299
were deciding that they didn't want to
work because they didn't want to put

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:05.309
work because they didn't want to put
 

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:07.160
work because they didn't want to put
their children through what they had

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.170
their children through what they had
 

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.170
their children through what they had
been through did that come up in your

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180
been through did that come up in your
 

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.949
been through did that come up in your
research among the women I filmed or

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959
research among the women I filmed or
 

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:14.900
research among the women I filmed or
among the women who didn't want to be

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:14.910
among the women who didn't want to be
 

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.269
among the women who didn't want to be
filmed among the women who you were like

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279
filmed among the women who you were like
 

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.699
filmed among the women who you were like
when you're trying to cast for them for

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:19.709
when you're trying to cast for them for
 

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:23.269
when you're trying to cast for them for
the film that that didn't end up being

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279
the film that that didn't end up being
 

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:29.509
the film that that didn't end up being
an issue so much no because if they were

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519
an issue so much no because if they were
 

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:32.269
an issue so much no because if they were
women who didn't want to work then they

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279
women who didn't want to work then they
 

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:34.189
women who didn't want to work then they
didn't fit the profile I was looking for

00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199
didn't fit the profile I was looking for
 

00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:43.610
didn't fit the profile I was looking for
yeah so this seems like it's ripe for an

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620
yeah so this seems like it's ripe for an
 

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.679
yeah so this seems like it's ripe for an
update have you considered going back

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:45.689
update have you considered going back
 

00:14:45.689 --> 00:14:47.179
update have you considered going back
for the next generation which would be

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:47.189
for the next generation which would be
 

00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:50.809
for the next generation which would be
the fourth generation and if so their

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:50.819
the fourth generation and if so their
 

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:54.740
the fourth generation and if so their
filmmakers yes and if so do you and you

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:54.750
filmmakers yes and if so do you and you
 

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.939
filmmakers yes and if so do you and you
know what you were just saying right

00:14:55.939 --> 00:14:55.949
know what you were just saying right
 

00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:57.769
know what you were just saying right
after the film made me think that you

00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779
after the film made me think that you
 

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:59.749
after the film made me think that you
feel like not much has changed do you

00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759
feel like not much has changed do you
 

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.670
feel like not much has changed do you
really think that that would be the case

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680
really think that that would be the case
 

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.679
really think that that would be the case
that this would not the fourth

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:03.689
that this would not the fourth
 

00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:05.509
that this would not the fourth
generation wouldn't really add much

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519
generation wouldn't really add much
 

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:07.249
generation wouldn't really add much
that's different than what you've

00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:07.259
that's different than what you've
 

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:10.309
that's different than what you've
already gotten this film well I hadn't I

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:10.319
already gotten this film well I hadn't I
 

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:11.629
already gotten this film well I hadn't I
hadn't thought of that

00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639
hadn't thought of that
 

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:20.030
hadn't thought of that
so it's a good idea my guess my guess is

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040
so it's a good idea my guess my guess is
 

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.490
so it's a good idea my guess my guess is
that those fourth generation young women

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500
that those fourth generation young women
 

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.449
that those fourth generation young women
are working that would be my guess and

00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:25.459
are working that would be my guess and
 

00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:29.030
are working that would be my guess and
perhaps working without the kind of

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040
perhaps working without the kind of
 

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.710
perhaps working without the kind of
ambivalence that troubled their mothers

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720
ambivalence that troubled their mothers
 

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.210
ambivalence that troubled their mothers
or at least trouble some of their

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220
or at least trouble some of their
 

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.119
or at least trouble some of their
mothers but I don't know I haven't I

00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:38.129
mothers but I don't know I haven't I
 

00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:44.020
mothers but I don't know I haven't I
haven't gone back to see and

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.030
 

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.360
I know I haven't been in Boston for ten

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.370
I know I haven't been in Boston for ten
 

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.460
I know I haven't been in Boston for ten
years so I haven't I haven't been in

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:48.470
years so I haven't I haven't been in
 

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.320
years so I haven't I haven't been in
touch with him but I probably wouldn't

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:50.330
touch with him but I probably wouldn't
 

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.210
touch with him but I probably wouldn't
through the miracle of Google it would

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:52.220
through the miracle of Google it would
 

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.120
through the miracle of Google it would
probably not be so hard to to find them

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.130
probably not be so hard to to find them
 

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.240
probably not be so hard to to find them
I don't know but you know judging from

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.250
I don't know but you know judging from
 

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.270
I don't know but you know judging from
what I read in in the popular press it

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:01.280
what I read in in the popular press it
 

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.780
what I read in in the popular press it
seems like it is still at least we're

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:04.790
seems like it is still at least we're

economics of it and what struck me is

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880
economics of it and what struck me is
 

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.750
economics of it and what struck me is
that the grandmother generation all

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760
that the grandmother generation all
 

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.789
that the grandmother generation all
started out in what would today be

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799
started out in what would today be
 

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:08.049
started out in what would today be
considered poverty and yet it appears as

00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:08.059

if each of these families made it into

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.250
if each of these families made it into
 

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.000
if each of these families made it into
at least some level of the middle class

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.010
at least some level of the middle class
 

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.529
at least some level of the middle class
and I wondered if you did take it into a

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:14.539
and I wondered if you did take it into a
 

00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:16.779
and I wondered if you did take it into a
fourth-generation where people are now

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:16.789
fourth-generation where people are now
 

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:19.149
fourth-generation where people are now
falling out of the middle class yeah and

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159
falling out of the middle class yeah and
 

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.789
falling out of the middle class yeah and
you know if that would even be possible

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799
you know if that would even be possible
 

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:24.519
you know if that would even be possible
anymore right right I think that I think

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:24.529
anymore right right I think that I think
 

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:26.700
anymore right right I think that I think
that's a really good question yeah

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:26.710
that's a really good question yeah
 

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.019
that's a really good question yeah
that's also I think you know another

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:29.029
that's also I think you know another
 

00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:30.610
that's also I think you know another
thing and you referred to it I think in

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:30.620
thing and you referred to it I think in
 

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.139
thing and you referred to it I think in
the you know the introductory part of

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:32.149
the you know the introductory part of
 

00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:36.399
the you know the introductory part of
the film where you know back in you know

00:19:36.399 --> 00:19:36.409
the film where you know back in you know
 

00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:39.340
the film where you know back in you know
into the 50s at least it was possible

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:39.350
into the 50s at least it was possible
 

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.279
into the 50s at least it was possible
for one breadwinner to support a large

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:42.289
for one breadwinner to support a large
 

00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:46.930
for one breadwinner to support a large
family and so at a certain point you

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:46.940
family and so at a certain point you
 

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.279
family and so at a certain point you
know in the feminist movement I think

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:48.289
know in the feminist movement I think
 

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:51.279
know in the feminist movement I think
there was that decision to work because

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:51.289
there was that decision to work because
 

00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:54.279
there was that decision to work because
we want to work yeah but now I think

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:54.289
we want to work yeah but now I think
 

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:55.480
we want to work yeah but now I think

people have been forced back into
 

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.529
people have been forced back into
working because they have to work it's

00:19:59.529 --> 00:19:59.539
working because they have to work it's
 

00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:01.659
working because they have to work it's
you need at least two incomes for a

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:01.669
you need at least two incomes for a
 

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:05.529
you need at least two incomes for a
family if not yeah that's right yeah I

00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:05.539
family if not yeah that's right yeah I
 

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:07.810
family if not yeah that's right yeah I
don't know I mean it's as I as I watch

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:07.820
don't know I mean it's as I as I watch
 

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.180
don't know I mean it's as I as I watch
there's so many American things that run

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:10.190
there's so many American things that run
 

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.260
there's so many American things that run
through this to it so

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:11.270
through this to it so
 

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.350
through this to it so
I missed about America to own one's own

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360
I missed about America to own one's own
 

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.500
I missed about America to own one's own
