00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.526
&gt;&gt;I have a very deep belief now that-

00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:13.106
that students do not do well
academically unless they feel cared

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:15.896
about, unless they feel that
they're included, unless they feel

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:19.686
that there's a climate around
them where they can take risks,

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:25.736
where they can share their learning,
share their, sometimes misconceptions

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:29.396
or wrong answers even and
test those out in the world

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:34.856
and not feel embarrassed
or put down by it.

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:37.406
So when you create that
kind of safe place,

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.126
students are better able to learn.

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.416
They're better able
to work with peers.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.656
They're- they're more
comfortable in the classroom.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:51.226
And- and there is a process that
we can consciously create both

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.516
through curriculum and-- set
curriculum and through our--

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:59.136
the way we structure our
classrooms that enables students

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:01.906
to feel that sense of community.

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:08.066
Over a period of the- the first
year, we developed the Care

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:12.576
for Kids Program and then had
schools apply for that program.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:17.706
As I said, out of 90 schools,
28-- there are more that applied.

00:01:17.706 --> 00:01:20.526
We accepted 28 schools
who appeared to be ready

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.686
to launch the program
the following year.

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:25.876
And then we provided extensive
professional development

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.266
for them during the summer and
embedded professional development

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.396
for them as they implemented
the program during the year.

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.746
And it made- it's made
a major difference.

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.796
Everywhere I go, when I talk
to elementary faculties,

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.706
it's made a major difference.

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:45.776
But those early initiators
in this case,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.936
have provoked interest
among all the other schools.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:55.756
As I said, this is an initiative
that people are eager for.

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:59.866
You know, one of the things-- and
it's very clear, is that teachers are

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.536
in teaching, particularly elementary
teachers, because they love kids.

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:06.776
And they love to create an
environment where kids can thrive.

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:10.376
And this is so natural.

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:14.466
They understand it at
a very basic level,

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:17.646
that if they create a positive
environment in their classroom,

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.026
their classroom is going to be
fun to be in both for themselves

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:22.546
and for them- for their students.

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:25.606
And the students are
gonna learn more.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:29.246
And so it doesn't take
a lot of convincing.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:35.796
It- it-- what it takes is the
demonstration that it can be done.

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:39.856
And when teaches see that it can be
done and that it can be successful,

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:43.456
then they're really willing to devote
the energy and time to make it work.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:49.996
I believe that actually what
we're doing is going very deeply

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:54.066
and it's not about charismatic
principals or charismatic teachers.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:03:01.816
It's about engaging all teachers and
all the principals in the strategies

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:05.936
that Care For Kids is engaged in.

00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:09.656
And it shouldn't matter
who the principal is.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.266
It's nice that the
principal is an advocate

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:13.576
and the principal believes
it and has to understand it.

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:16.286
We have to have principal
leadership but we don't have

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:18.316
to have charismatic
principal leadership.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.356
We have to have principal leadership
that's committed to this kind

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:22.786
of vision and this direction.

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:26.016
And we have to have teachers who
are committed to this kind of vision

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:27.046
and this kind of direction.

00:03:27.096 --> 00:03:32.356
And that's what we're pursuing in
our hiring and in our appointments.

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.216
We have a- a district
philosophy and that-

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:39.626
that district philosophy is
part of our interview process.

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:41.106
It's part of our selection process.

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:47.996
And hopefully, it won't be
dependent on one individual.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:54.606
It will be dependent on a lot
of us being deeply committed

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:59.416
to the same kind of values and
norms and wanting to build a vision

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:02.266
of the district where-
where this is the norm.

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.416
Once you've done it,
you realize that--

00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:09.166
or once you've been involved
in social emotional learning,

00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:10.406
it changes the way you teach.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.256
It changes the way you
are in a classroom.

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:16.166
It changes the interaction you
have with students so that you-

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:17.646
you don't have the kinds

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:19.456
of discipline problems
you've had before.

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:25.436
You don't have the kinds
of- of organizational issues

00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:27.896
in the classroom that
you my have had before.

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:33.756
And what- what's so interesting is,
in giving up some of your authority

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:37.576
to students, which is sometimes
very difficult for teachers,

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:39.516
you realize that you
actually have more authority.

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:43.776
And it's one of those
paradoxes in life,

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:48.716
that when you literally involve
students in class meetings,

00:04:48.716 --> 00:04:51.796
when you involve them in these
morning meetings and discussions

00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:57.396
and sharing, that actually,
you giving up control,

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:03.816
allows you to have even more control
and more direction of the classroom,

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:07.066
because it's more of
a collective focus.

00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:10.296
And students buy-in.

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:14.706
And once they buy-in, they're
a part of the classroom

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.736
and they're committed
to what you're doing.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.716
Why doesn't everybody do it?

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:22.306
Well first of all, there are
probably two major reasons,

00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:29.746
one is that we're very tied up in
the struggle to reach proficiency.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:34.856
With No Child Left Behind, with
the targets that have been set,

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:41.316
I think most educators are in a
panic to attempt to do all they can

00:05:41.316 --> 00:05:45.886
to prepare students academically
for the test and test results.

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:50.986
I happen to believe that this is
the best preparation for test-

00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:52.646
for positive test results.

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:58.206
I think once you teach students
those kinds of social skills,

00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:02.806
once they build a sense of community,
you can move much faster academically

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:04.766
than you would otherwise.

00:06:05.376 --> 00:06:08.856
You have far fewer behavior
problems, far fewer disruptions,

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:11.846
far more collaboration on learning

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:14.536
so that students support each
other learn-- each others learning.

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.846
But it takes investment
of time on the front end.

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:22.886
And sometimes we're not willing
to devote that- that time.

00:06:22.886 --> 00:06:27.046
The other is, it takes skill
to lead a class meeting.

00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:32.736
An effective class meeting takes the
ability to not intervene too soon,

00:06:33.446 --> 00:06:40.096
to not impose one's own values and
one's own thoughts on the situation

00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:47.116
and let students engage and discuss
and struggle for a while and think

00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:51.326
about a situation carefully and think
about what might be right or wrong

00:06:51.326 --> 00:06:54.506
in a situation and what are different
possibilities and different options.

00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:57.746
As teachers we tend
to want to jump in

00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:59.646
and solve problems for our students.

00:07:00.156 --> 00:07:04.836
And it means holding back and
letting the students emerge

00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:08.336
with what are the best solutions
and facilitating that dialog.

00:07:08.396 --> 00:07:11.146
And that's often much more
challenging for us to do.

00:07:12.446 --> 00:07:13.686
It isn't touchy-feely stuff.

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:23.646
It's core social skills that
give students the- the experience

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:29.496
and the knowledge and talent to
work effectively with others.

00:07:29.786 --> 00:07:34.166
This isn't about, you know, being
nice and treating each other nicely.

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.056
This is about, this is serious work.

00:07:36.696 --> 00:07:38.876
It's serious work to
create a sense of community.

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.726
It's serious work to
resolve conflicts.

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:45.596
It's serious work to create an
environment that's a positive

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:47.146
environment in a classroom.

00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:50.826
And it's serious work
on the students' part,

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:54.796
to be able to manage themselves
in a way that is constructive.

00:07:55.516 --> 00:08:01.036
And that's the most important
contribution that they learned.

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:08.586
I would say that it's essential for
higher quality results, academically.

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:12.666
And it's not that you don't
have to do the academic work.

00:08:13.616 --> 00:08:15.266
You have to do the academic work.

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:19.876
But frankly, the academic work
is made easier once you do this

00:08:20.186 --> 00:08:23.126
