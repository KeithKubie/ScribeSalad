00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:03.184
- There has been a revival of activism

00:00:03.184 --> 00:00:05.436
among our young people,

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.281
and that's the most
encouraging thing to me.

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:10.951
Black Lives Matter means that there are

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:14.777
wider systemic issues that have produced

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:17.537
a culture of violence
within our community.

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:19.326
But it's all connected.

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:22.627
When you look at decades
of failed housing policies,

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:26.096
poor educational institutions,
chronic under-employment,

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:29.014
and unemployment, and poor health care,

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:31.905
and then you throw in drugs,
and then you throw in guns,

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.586
little wonder, you'll see this
culture of violence emerge.

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:39.532
And so, you have this
issue of the lack of trust

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:41.468
that the community has with the police,

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:43.291
and it's all connected with one another.

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.428
And so, what Black Lives
Matter means to me, is that

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:49.323
if we're going to have safer communities,

00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:52.941
more peaceful communities,
and more vibrant communities,

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:55.028
we're gonna have to address
some of these larger

00:00:55.028 --> 00:00:55.918
systemic issues.
