00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.660
We’ve already determined that the Justice
League could probably take on the Avengers

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.110
in the first of our Marvel versus DC series,
but how do their villains match up?

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.730
Like the heroes, most villains have a near
equivalent in each the Marvel and DC Universes.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.980
So which is the more dangerous universe to
live in?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.090
To determine this we thought we’d see how
some of the films’ most famous villains

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.360
would fare mono e mono.&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.180
Green Goblin v Joker
The Joker and the Green Goblin can often be

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.480
seen sporting the same maniacal grin on their
faces.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.120
Both insane in their own right, the Joker
definitely takes the crazy cake, but the Green

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.510
Goblin’s super powers and deadly gadgets
give him the edge here.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.749
Let’s face it, the only reason the super
powerless Joker is still alive is because

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.909
Batman refuses to kill him, and you can be
sure the Green Goblin wouldn’t extend him

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.420
the same courtesy.&nbsp;

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.999
Loki v Zod
It would be a battle of Gods and Aliens if

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.250
General Zod were to take on the Norse God
of Mischief himself.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.850
As a Kryptonian, Zod has most of the same
powers Superman man has: super strength, speed,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.810
x-ray vision, and whole bunch of other badass
abilities.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.100
As a God and member of the Frost Giants race,
Loki has many of the same powers as his adopted

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.100
brother Thor.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.590
Whereas Zod is more military minded, Loki’s
mastering of magic and other trickery would

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.929
likely outsmart Zod’s maneuvers, making
this the another win for Marvel’s miscreants.&nbsp;

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.189
Magneto v Lex Luthor
On paper, there’s not much similar about

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.289
Lex Luthor and Magneto.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.310
One was born with a silver spoon in his mouth
and the other was a holocaust survivor, yet

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.340
they’ve both risen as two of the most formidable
villains in their respective universes.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.200
While Magneto could easily remove that silver
spoon from Lex’s mouth and turn any armour

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.039
Lex uses to protect his very human body into
a liability, the smartest man in the world

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.619
could surely find a way around Magneto’s
single power of controlling metal.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.550
As an evil genius, Lex doesn’t need guns
or traditional man-made weapons that would

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.250
never work on Magneto, but could probably
think of a dozen other ways to take down the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.890
X-Men’s fiercest foe, giving DC their first
win.&nbsp;

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.540
Apocalypse v Doomsday
Here’s a truly epic match up that would

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.870
make Batman v Superman look like a schoolyard
shoving match.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.420
If Doomsday ever got on Apocalypse’s bad
side, it could literally mean the end of days

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.620
for everyone.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.310
Both of these villains are able to adapt to
whatever you throw at them, making them practically

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.319
invincible and in Apocalypse’s case, immortal.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.099
Doomsday does get bragging rights for killing
Superman, but we’re going to err on the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.689
side of caution here and just call this one
a draw.&nbsp;

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.069
Whiplash v Bane&nbsp;
Neither Bane nor Whiplash possess any supernatural

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.890
abilities, but both have the brains and brawn
usually limited to body builders and scientists.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.450
Both are pretty logical, so perhaps they’d
try to talk things out first, but with Bane’s

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.110
mask and Whiplash’s broken English this
probably wouldn’t get them very far.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.209
Even with Whiplash’s mastering of Tony Stark’s
Iron Man tech, he was still unable to get

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.730
very close to taking down the hero, yet Bane
literally broke Batman, so we’re going to

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.019
have to give this one to Bane.&nbsp;

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.519
Mystique v Harley Quinn&nbsp;
With the count tied at two each and one draw,

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.099
we’re bringing out the villainous ladies
for the tie breaker.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.110
Don’t be fooled by their looks, Mystique
and Harley Quinn are both as ruthless as any

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.530
evildoer in either universe and do not hesitate
to kill anyone in their path.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.629
Quinn does have one major achilles heal which
is her dedication to the Joker, and with Mystique's

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.580
shapeshifting abilities, it wouldn’t be
hard for her to pose as the Joker to get close

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.580
to Quinn.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.590
Once again, super powers trumps no powers,
and we’ll have to give this one to Marvel’s

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.590
Mystique.&nbsp;

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.010
So while DC is considered the darker universe,
it would seem that Marvel actually has deadlier

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.010
villains.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.300
We’re basing this mostly on the movies,
so perhaps Suicide Squad will tilt things

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.720
in DC’s favor, but for now, it would seem
Gotham and Metropolis are safer places to

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.930
live than anywhere in the MCU.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.170
Perhaps the Justice League isn’t stronger
than the Avengers after all, they just have

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.610
an easier job.
