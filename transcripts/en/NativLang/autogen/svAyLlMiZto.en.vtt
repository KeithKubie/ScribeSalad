my previous lessons looked at arguments

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
my previous lessons looked at arguments
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750
my previous lessons looked at arguments
and truth in logic and they introduced

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
and truth in logic and they introduced
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.980
and truth in logic and they introduced
the difference between truth and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
the difference between truth and
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.620
the difference between truth and
validity in evaluating an argument as

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
validity in evaluating an argument as
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900

you may have noticed neither the
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.580
you may have noticed neither the
language of logic nor the ways of

language of logic nor the ways of
forming and analyzing an argument

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
forming and analyzing an argument
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.810

guarantee the truth of the statements

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
guarantee the truth of the statements

argument the toolkit of logic doesn't
generate truth instead it allows

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
generate truth instead it allows
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459
generate truth instead it allows
statements to remain true throughout the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
statements to remain true throughout the
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.950
statements to remain true throughout the
process of developing an argument we

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
process of developing an argument we
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260
process of developing an argument we
might call it truth preserving rather

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
might call it truth preserving rather
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.740
might call it truth preserving rather
than truth producing we can analyze the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
than truth producing we can analyze the
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660
than truth producing we can analyze the
function of every one of the operators

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
function of every one of the operators
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910
function of every one of the operators
you learned in the logic as a language

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
you learned in the logic as a language
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.970
you learned in the logic as a language
series within that context of truth

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
series within that context of truth
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819
series within that context of truth
preservation this is normally done using

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
preservation this is normally done using
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.360
preservation this is normally done using
something called a truth table so far

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
something called a truth table so far
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850
something called a truth table so far
speaking generally I've been careful to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
speaking generally I've been careful to
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.300
speaking generally I've been careful to
separate content from form now let's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
separate content from form now let's
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130
separate content from form now let's
move towards integrating these two

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
move towards integrating these two
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.950
move towards integrating these two
aspects of statements by considering

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
aspects of statements by considering
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.370
aspects of statements by considering
truth values I'll be using just two

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
truth values I'll be using just two
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.140
truth values I'll be using just two
basic values true and false to start

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
basic values true and false to start
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690
basic values true and false to start
with a simple analogy this is like a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
with a simple analogy this is like a
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.070
with a simple analogy this is like a
light switch with the value on or off

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080
light switch with the value on or off
 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.020
light switch with the value on or off
the switch sends a signal to a light

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
the switch sends a signal to a light
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.660
the switch sends a signal to a light
which may also be on or off

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
which may also be on or off
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.179
which may also be on or off
the switch is a variable in a statement

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
the switch is a variable in a statement
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.539
the switch is a variable in a statement
like a proposition P the light is the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
like a proposition P the light is the
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.960
like a proposition P the light is the
value of the entire statement if I give

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
value of the entire statement if I give
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.469
value of the entire statement if I give
you two statements P and Q can you tell

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
you two statements P and Q can you tell
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.410
you two statements P and Q can you tell
me what they mean no because they're

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
me what they mean no because they're
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.569
me what they mean no because they're
just variables and you don't know what

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
just variables and you don't know what
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.569
just variables and you don't know what
they represent so then can you say

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
they represent so then can you say
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.539
they represent so then can you say
nothing about their content think for a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
nothing about their content think for a
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.359
nothing about their content think for a
moment in the lesson on arguments we

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
moment in the lesson on arguments we
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.730
moment in the lesson on arguments we
looked at an argument with the form P

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
looked at an argument with the form P
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.419
looked at an argument with the form P
implies Q P therefore Q it's well-formed

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
implies Q P therefore Q it's well-formed
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.760
implies Q P therefore Q it's well-formed
meaning if we fill it with true

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
meaning if we fill it with true
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.320
meaning if we fill it with true
statements the conclusion will be in

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
statements the conclusion will be in
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.380
statements the conclusion will be in
it is possible to say something about P

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
it is possible to say something about P
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.290
it is possible to say something about P
then it can be true or it can be false

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300
then it can be true or it can be false
 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.100
then it can be true or it can be false
and the same goes for Q by looking at

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
and the same goes for Q by looking at
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.810
and the same goes for Q by looking at
the operators in the form of the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820
the operators in the form of the
 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.450
the operators in the form of the
argument we can pass that truth down to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460
argument we can pass that truth down to
 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.670
argument we can pass that truth down to
the conclusion well we don't know the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
the conclusion well we don't know the
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.270
the conclusion well we don't know the
specific value of P or Q we can say

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
specific value of P or Q we can say
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.310
specific value of P or Q we can say
things that hold for every possible

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320
things that hold for every possible
 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.250
things that hold for every possible
truth-value in combination and declare

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
truth-value in combination and declare
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.720
truth-value in combination and declare
the resulting truth value of the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730
the resulting truth value of the
 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.380
the resulting truth value of the
statement as a whole if P is true then

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390
statement as a whole if P is true then
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.310
statement as a whole if P is true then
the statement P is true if P is true and

the statement P is true if P is true and
 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.550
the statement P is true if P is true and
Q is true then the statement P and Q is

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
Q is true then the statement P and Q is
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.710
Q is true then the statement P and Q is
true if P is false and Q is false P and

true if P is false and Q is false P and
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.550
true if P is false and Q is false P and
Q is false C you can say something about

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
Q is false C you can say something about
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.520
Q is false C you can say something about
the truth of these statements we're

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
the truth of these statements we're
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.370
the truth of these statements we're
going to dive into specifics but first

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
going to dive into specifics but first
 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.410
going to dive into specifics but first
let's test to see if you get the gist of

let's test to see if you get the gist of
 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.650
let's test to see if you get the gist of
logical values assume P and Q stand for

and vice versa if we add another not the
 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.580
and vice versa if we add another not the
negation is negated so not not P is true

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100
when you ask do you want to leave today
 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.340
when you ask do you want to leave today
or tomorrow where you exclude the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.880
or tomorrow where you exclude the
possibility of today and tomorrow the

light turns on when either one of the

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
light turns on when either one of the
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.589
light turns on when either one of the
switches is flipped

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599
 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.169
the logical implication is frequently

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:40.179
the logical implication is frequently
 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:42.659
the logical implication is frequently
used and for some learners it's a bit

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669
used and for some learners it's a bit
 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.499
used and for some learners it's a bit
tricky if P is true then Q is true

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509
tricky if P is true then Q is true
 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.299
tricky if P is true then Q is true
meaning P implies Q holds if P and Q are

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:51.309
meaning P implies Q holds if P and Q are
 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:56.279
meaning P implies Q holds if P and Q are
both true P implies Q is false if P is

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289
both true P implies Q is false if P is
 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.389
both true P implies Q is false if P is
true and Q is false in that case P

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:00.399
true and Q is false in that case P
 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:04.589
true and Q is false in that case P
wouldn't imply Q it would imply not Q if

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599
wouldn't imply Q it would imply not Q if
 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.699
wouldn't imply Q it would imply not Q if
P is false and Q is false then P could

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:08.709
P is false and Q is false then P could
 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:11.279
P is false and Q is false then P could
still very well imply Q so the

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289
still very well imply Q so the
 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.339
still very well imply Q so the
implication holds true the last case

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349
implication holds true the last case
 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.629
implication holds true the last case
where P is false and Q is true is an

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639
where P is false and Q is true is an
 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.869
where P is false and Q is true is an
interesting one something besides P

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879
interesting one something besides P
 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.409
interesting one something besides P
might imply Q so the implication still

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419
might imply Q so the implication still
 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:31.139
might imply Q so the implication still
holds P implies Q holds true unless P is

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:31.149
holds P implies Q holds true unless P is
 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:35.369
holds P implies Q holds true unless P is
true and Q is false this is like a light

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:35.379
true and Q is false this is like a light
 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.850
true and Q is false this is like a light
that goes on when switch P is on if the

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860
that goes on when switch P is on if the
 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.249
that goes on when switch P is on if the
switch is on then we expect the light to

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259
switch is on then we expect the light to
 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.980
switch is on then we expect the light to
be on but the light might also turn on

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990
be on but the light might also turn on
 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.129
be on but the light might also turn on
from some other switch so the switch P

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139
from some other switch so the switch P
 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.709
from some other switch so the switch P
being off doesn't make the statement if

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719
being off doesn't make the statement if
 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.499
being off doesn't make the statement if
P's flipped on then the light is on

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509
P's flipped on then the light is on
 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.439
P's flipped on then the light is on
untrue only one thing can make that

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449
untrue only one thing can make that
 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.019
untrue only one thing can make that
statement if P is on the light is on

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029
statement if P is on the light is on
 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.049
statement if P is on the light is on
false turning P on and finding the light

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:01.059
false turning P on and finding the light
 

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:04.819
false turning P on and finding the light
off

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:08.159
finally the by conditional means that

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169
finally the by conditional means that
 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.100
finally the by conditional means that
the two propositions P and Q have the

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110
the two propositions P and Q have the
 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.540
the two propositions P and Q have the
same value the statement P if and only

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550
same value the statement P if and only
 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.949
same value the statement P if and only
if Q is true when both P and Q are true

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:19.959
if Q is true when both P and Q are true
 

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:23.670
if Q is true when both P and Q are true
or both P and Q are false in any other

or both P and Q are false in any other
 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.600
or both P and Q are false in any other
case the by conditional is false this

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610
case the by conditional is false this
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.879
case the by conditional is false this
makes the two propositions logically

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:29.889
makes the two propositions logically
 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.279
makes the two propositions logically
equivalent so they must return the same

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:32.289
equivalent so they must return the same
 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.940
equivalent so they must return the same
value

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:34.950
 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.310
I encourage you to go back through these

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320
I encourage you to go back through these
 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.550
I encourage you to go back through these
operators filling in P and Q with

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560
operators filling in P and Q with
 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.560
operators filling in P and Q with
propositions you take to be true or

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.570
propositions you take to be true or
 

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.620
propositions you take to be true or
false and spend some time reflecting on

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:48.630
false and spend some time reflecting on
 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.240
false and spend some time reflecting on
the logical truth values of the

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.250
the logical truth values of the
 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.970
the logical truth values of the
resulting statements this will be a good

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:52.980
resulting statements this will be a good
 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.130
resulting statements this will be a good
exercise it'll help you familiarize

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:55.140
exercise it'll help you familiarize
 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.890
exercise it'll help you familiarize
yourself with truth tables and clear up

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900
yourself with truth tables and clear up
 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.310
yourself with truth tables and clear up
some ambiguities in your logic please
