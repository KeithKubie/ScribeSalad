00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's say you don't like
company ABCD very much

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.790
and you're convinced that the
stock is going to go down.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.590
So in that situation, you
can actually short the stock,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.370
which in a very
high level is a bet

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.020
that the stock is
going to go down.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.480
And the way that you
do that mechanically

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.460
is that you borrow the stock
from someone else who owns it,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.530
and then you immediately
sell that stock

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.610
that you don't even own.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.790
You sell the stock that you
borrowed from someone else,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.590
and you'll sell it
at the current price.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.120
So, for example,
in this situation,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.570
you would sell it at the
current trading price of $50.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.259
You would then hope that
the stock price goes down.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.800
Let's think about
the situation where

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.240
the stock price goes down.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.910
So if you shorted it right over
here, you borrowed the stock

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.350
and you sold it for $50.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.761
And then if the stock were
to actually go down-- let's

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.260
say it goes all the
way down to $20,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.830
and you think that's about
how far it's going to go down,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:11.450
then you can buy back the stock
for $20 in this situation.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.470
And then give it
back to the owner.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.920
You had borrowed the stock.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.950
Now you can hand back
the stock to the owner.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.742
So you could give it back and
you've essentially unwound it.

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:22.200
And what it allowed
you to do is it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.770
allowed you to do the buying
and selling in reverse order.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.220
Normally before
you sell something

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.660
you have to buy something.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.760
But here you were able to
sell it and buy it later

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.390
for a lower price.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.080
So the situation
where the end price

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.560
is $20 you had sold it for $50.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960
So you got $50.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.920
And then you had to use
$20 of it to buy it back.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.690
So in that situation,
shorting the stock,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.580
you would have made $30.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.150
Let me write this column here.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.340
This is the short option.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.830
You sold at $50.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.780
You borrowed and sold at $50.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.000
Then when it went down to $20
you bought it back for $20.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.010
So you had $50 of proceeds.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.300
You had to use $20
of it to buy it back.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.160
So you had a $30 profit.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.850
But that's only in
the good scenario.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.410
What happens if
your bet is wrong?

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.860
What happens if the stock
price goes up to $80?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.330
And over here you get so scared.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.487
You're like, oh my god, I have
to buy the stock back by $80.

00:02:19.487 --> 00:02:20.570
What if it keeps going up?

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.319
I could lose an unlimited
amount of money.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.110
So over here you get scared
and you unwind your situation.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.310
You say, OK, I'll go and
buy the stock for $80,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.620
so I can give it back.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.050
So in this situation
where the stock goes up

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.990
you actually could
lose a lot of money.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.810
You had sold it for $50.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.970
So you only have $50 that you
have from the transaction.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.750
But now you have to
buy the stock for $80.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.580
So if you sold for $50
and you buy for $80

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.600
you've now lost $30.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.640
You're $30 in the hole.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.970
So now you are at negative $30.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.790
And really shorting is the
riskiest of all of the things

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.940
you can do, because a stock
price and go unbelievably high.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.870
What happens if the stock price
goes to $800 or goes to $8,000?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.527
All of a sudden, you've
sold something for $50

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:10.860
and you have the obligation
at some point in the future,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.820
because you have to
give the stock back,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.290
of paying $500, or
$800, or $8,000.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.590
You don't know how much
you'll have to lose.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.630
So it's really the
riskiest thing you can do.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.680
But it is one way to bet that
a stock price will go down,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.130
or profit from a stock
price going down.
