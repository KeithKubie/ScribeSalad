&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.460
I hope you all had a good lunch.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.150
Doing great.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.720
So welcome to the Library of
Congress National Book Festival.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.990
My name is Sasha Dowdy,
I work at the Library

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.870
of Congress Young
Readers' Center,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.550
which is a really special place
in the Library of Congress

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.480
for kids, teens,
and their families.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.670
For everybody who's
under 16 years old.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.860
And you can come take a
look into the millions

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.690
of collections at the library.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.400
The Library of Congress National
Book Festival recognizes

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.540
and celebrates the importance of
reading and authors and books.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.860
The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.960
but the truth is the library
festival is a huge undertaking.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.490
It's a huge financial
undertaking and it is free

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.740
for everyone because
of the generous support

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.860
from our sponsors
and supporters.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.120
Spread the joy of reading
with your gift online

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.240
on LOC.gov/donate,
from the Festival app,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.090
or when you purchase
books today.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.360
And now onto the main event.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.510
We have here author
Russell Ginns!

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.050
[ Applause ]

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.360
When I was reading a
little bit about him,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.400
I realized that he is a very
unique author whose books

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.880
and works can be found
everywhere in the library.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.760
So he's a game designer.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.230
So they can be found in the
movie and game division.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.980
And he's also a composer,
so you can find music

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.540
in our performing arts library.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.910
And he is a puzzle maker.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.040
And those things you
can find anywhere

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.410
within our 167 million
item collection.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.850
And I challenge you
guys to come find them.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.820
And of course, Russell
writes books.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.280
He's written over 100 books.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
They are fun, they're smart,
and they're full of adventure.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.350
So buckle in, and you're
going to find out more about

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.780
"Samantha Spinner and
the Super Secret Plans."

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.420
It's a spectacular journey
through Seattle, Washington,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.510
Paris, and other countries and
cities that I won't tell you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.830
about because they're
super secret.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.510
So, welcome Russell
Ginns, everybody!

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.060
[ Applause ]

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.840
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: Testing, okay!

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.170
Well, thank you guys.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.890
It is a huge thrill to
be at the book festival.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.370
So I want to start
by saying thank you.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.290
I'm probably going to say
thank you a couple times.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.410
And I am here to talk to
you about my new book series

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.050
"Samantha Spinner and
the Super Secret Plans."

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.420
Where Samantha's
uncle disappeared.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.090
But before he took
off, he taught Samantha

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.090
and her brother how to
say please, thank you,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.440
and "where's the
tallest building?"

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.200
in 11 different languages.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.350
And they set off to find
them and they discover

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.950
that no place is in
the middle of nowhere.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.910
&gt;&gt; [Singing] Samantha Spinner!

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.280
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.580
Samantha Spinner!

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.300
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.930
Going to Egypt, going to
France, looking for the man

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.670
in the green plaid pants!

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.230
Sam Spinner!

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.510
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:55.510
[ Music ]

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.430
[Singing] Going to Egypt, going
to France, looking for the man

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.570
in the green plaid pants!

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.720
Sam Spinner!

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.510
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.090
[ Applause ]

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.220
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: When
I was about your age,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.370
my parents took me to see a
play in a big fancy theatre

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.900
and I got a little bit bored.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.820
And I started looking around
at the space in the theatre,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.470
the walls, and I started
thinking all those shapes,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.950
do any of them do anything?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.270
And I started thinking wow,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.950
what if one of them
was a secret panel?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.950
And you could open a
rectangle and go up a ladder

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.250
that nobody else knew about?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.900
And you went up a
secret staircase

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.200
and there was a room at the top?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.430
And I took that idea
and I thought

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.350
about that all over the place.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.220
So I would see this lion
sculpture in front of a laborer

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.490
and I would think wow, what
if you could pull its tail

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.440
and it opened up
a panel that went

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.070
to a secret underground subway.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.440
And there are these buttons
on the sides of buildings

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.780
and I thought wow, what if some

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.720
of them are underground
monorail controls?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.130
And then I saw this bank in
New York and it had shields

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.550
around the top of the building.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.910
And I thought wow, what
if you could pry them open

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.030
and they were the entrance to a
crazy straw that zipped you off

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.980
to Germany or zipped
you off to France?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.370
And then there's this
diamond in the Smithsonian.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.860
Have you ever heard
of the Hope diamond?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.120
So well, what if that
in there is a fake?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.550
It's a piece of glass?

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.040
And the real Hope diamond
is out there somewhere,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.050
maybe it's around a dog collar.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.800
And the owners don't
know it yet.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.480
And so I took all of those ideas
and I put it into my book series

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.630
"Samantha Spinner and
the Super Secret Plans."

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.180
And I started the
story in Seattle,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.230
Washington because that's
where I was living at the time.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.660
And I'll talk a little bit about
that later, but it's always good

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.040
to write about what you know.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.320
And in my story,
Samantha has an Uncle Paul

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.260
who only wore green plaid
pajamas all day everyday

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.890
and bright orange flip flops.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.810
But then he disappeared,
and he left behind presents

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.430
for his nieces and nephews.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.700
And Samantha's older sister gets
a check for 2.4 billion dollars.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.610
And a note that says
"Have fun shopping!"

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.510
And her brother gets the
deed to Yankee stadium

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.250
and all the players' contracts.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.710
So he's the new owner
of the New York Yankees.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.130
And he has a note that
comes with it that says

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.800
"Don't miss opening day!"

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.900
And Samantha, she gets
an old rusty umbrella

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.200
with a hole in it.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.370
And a note that says
"Watch out for the rain."

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.910
So if you read my book,
and I hope you do,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.190
the title of chapter
2 is "It Wasn't Fair."

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.520
And it really didn't seem fair
at all but one thing leads

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.540
to another and they look at
the inside of the umbrella

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.460
with a magnifying
glass and they discover

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.500
that it's actually got secret
drawings and maps and plans

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.250
to all kinds of secret
passageways

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.520
that take you all
over the world.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.820
And so starting in book
one and then onward,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.130
they go to countries,
some you've heard of,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.700
some you haven't heard
of, all around the world.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.650
But you'll remember
that note that said

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.720
"Watch out for the rain"?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.440
Well, of course, that
stands for the Royal Academy

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.400
of International Ninjas.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.640
And they used to have
the super secret plans,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.090
and used it to cause
crimes and break

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.660
into banks and art museums.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.230
And they still do all that.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.420
But now they have
to use the sewers.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.170
So they become stink bandits.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.680
And they smell terrible.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.260
And they're really mad about it.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.170
And they want the umbrella back.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.680
And that is the start
of my book series,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.430
and it takes you all
around the world.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.120
And there's a question
people ask me all the time.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.210
They say "Have you
ever been to Italy?

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.920
Have you ever been to Mali?"

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.480
And I say not yet.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.020
They say "Have you
ever been to St Louis?"

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.440
Well, not yet.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.130
And so how do you think I
write about all these things?

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.470
So, I don't know if other
authors are doing this

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.800
or did I invent this
or discover this?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.220
But I've been using
Google Earth.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.150
Do you guys all know
about Google Earth?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.970
Yeah, so what I do is in
the section of the chapter

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.410
of my book, when I want
them to go some place,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.340
I find it on Google
Earth, and then I zoom in

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.510
and I take it down
to street view.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.540
And then I can see the scene
exactly the way my characters

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.080
Samantha and her
brother see the scene.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.100
And so I'm going to read you
a little chapter of my book

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.140
where they're on the
streets of Florida,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.070
I'm sorry, Florence, Italy.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.760
And they have to go find
a statue because they know

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.140
if they find a statue of horses,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.290
there's a secret
button inside one

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.460
of the nostrils of
one of the horses.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.830
Samantha took a closer
look at the horses

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.130
from the edge of the pool.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.810
They seemed to be
splashing and straining

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.920
as they hauled Neptune
through the water.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.830
Their mouths were open
as if gasping for air.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.110
She looked even closer
at the marble faces

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.190
and noticed a blue dot
in one horse's nostril.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.750
"There's something up with that
horse," she told her brother.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.050
"Follow me."

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.390
Water bubbled gently
around them as they splashed

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.340
through the water towards
the center of the pool.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.300
They came face-to-face
with four,

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.580
bright white marble stallions.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.230
Nipper squinted at the
horse for a moment,

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.710
then he stood up straight.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.010
"Step aside!"

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.070
he said loudly, pushing
his sister out of the way.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.390
He raised a hand in the air
and he wiggled an index finger.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.220
"This is a nose-worthy
situation,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:45.070
and I have been called upon
to use my special talent."

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.050
Samantha groaned.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.360
"You are exceptionally gross."

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.430
Nipper plunged his finger deep
inside the horse's dark nostril

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.730
and pressed.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.450
Something gave a little,
and there was a click,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.960
followed by four,
loud creaking noises.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.300
Somewhere below the street,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.150
it sounded like four
giant toilets flushing.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.670
She started to lose her footing.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.660
The fountain had
become an angry storm.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.960
"Wait!" she shouted.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.190
"I just remembered there's
something that we-- ."

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.510
The current yanked
Samantha under the surface,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.110
ending her sentence in
a gurgling "Wheeee!"

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.890
She was being sucked
towards a shape

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.320
in the front of the horses.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.770
She flailed her arms, slapping
at the water helplessly,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.510
and slid into the darkness.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.260
[ Applause ]

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.390
So, I'm having a ton of
fun writing adventures

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.040
with Samantha and her brother.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.110
Learning and exploring
places all around the world.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.450
But I have also filled my book

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.050
with secret hidden
codes and puzzles.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.320
Have ever of you guys
heard of an escape room?

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.760
You guys know about
escape rooms?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.580
Well I went to one a while ago

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.000
and I thought wouldn't
it be cool

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.450
if you could turn a book series
into a secret escape room?

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.950
So there's word searches.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.320
If you take the titles
of certain chapters

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.010
and you put them together,
they form a word search.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.550
There's one character,
there's numbers at the bottom

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.140
of the page and they tell
you which words to read

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.420
and they'll direct you
to a secret website.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.160
And if you go there,
it says "Stop!

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.550
Don't read Samantha Spinner,
it's a terrible book!

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.950
No one should read that!"

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.600
And there's all sorts
of puzzles and clues.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.940
So just to give you an idea
of what I'm talking about

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.650
and how I do it, I put
a couple puzzles here.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:28.840
Now, don't shout it out.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.400
Samantha's umbrella hid
a lying, smelly ninja.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.860
Take a closer look,
there's the name

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.160
of a country hidden in there...

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.010
Ah-ha! Okay, we'll do another.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.260
I brought my lunch
in a paper bag today.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.250
Take a closer look,
there's the name

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.910
of a country hidden
there somewhere!

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.210
Raise your hand if you
think you've got it.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.980
China! Okay, we'll do one more.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.550
Dennis, that's their dog,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.620
saw a man in a cape
running in the street.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.040
Don't shout it out.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.640
There's a country
hidden there somewhere.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.940
One, two, three.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:26.940
I'll do another so you
can see another way

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.900
that I hide messages
in the book.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:36.490
Iceland, Norway,
Denmark, Italy, Albania.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.280
There's five countries,
now take a closer look.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.180
The name of a secret
sixth country is hidden

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.480
there somewhere.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.530
How'd you get it?

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.830
She said India.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.510
How'd you get it?

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:59.190
Exactly. So that's one of
the things I've been doing.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.980
The message behind my whole
book is that no place is

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.500
in the middle of nowhere.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.550
That just because places seem
far away, it may seem strange

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.860
to you, they don't seem that way
to the people that live there.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.670
My characters are fearless,

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.470
and they're exploring not just
famous places that you've heard

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.750
about some friend who
went to on vacation,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.780
but countries all
over the world.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.080
And let's see.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.040
Okay, Peru.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:50.180
Who can tell me which of these
animals you'd find in Peru?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.340
The llama, yes.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.220
That's a llama you'd find
in the Andes mountains.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.490
That to the right is a
Komodo dragon, not in Peru.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.820
Those only live in
islands off Indonesia.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.630
And I thought it was really
funny when I started reading,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.930
well not funny,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.410
but an interesting thing
that could be funny.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.150
In chapter two, my
second book in the series,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.330
Samantha's brother
goes to Indonesia

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.910
and he sees a Komodo dragon.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.590
And he sneaks it home
because he thinks he's found a

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.130
baby dinosaur.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.520
And that part of the story
doesn't end very well.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.000
But okay, we'll do another.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.590
Oops. Let's try that again.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.340
One more time.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:07.100
Okay, who can tell me which of
these you'd find in the USA?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:14.390
Yes? That's the leaning tower
of Pisa, that's in Italy.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.670
Egypt? No, the pyramids?

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.110
Oh, the elephant.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.670
Of course, that is
Lucy the Elephant,

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.190
found in Margate
City, New Jersey.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.610
And the elephant shaped hotel.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.180
And when I found out about
the elephant shaped hotel,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.620
I got really excited.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.370
And I decided I would make
the third book in my series,

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.440
which I'm just writing now,
all about important things

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.960
or amazing places you'd find
around the United States.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.910
And so they go to the, the story
starts at the elephant hotel.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.550
Then they go to Carhenge,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.900
a monument that's
made out of old cars.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.070
And they go to the corn palace
in Mitchell, South Dakota,

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.280
a building that's
covered with corn.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.150
And then the rest of my series,
then they go back to Italy,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.690
they go to around
countries in Africa.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:03.990
They go to Russia.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.290
They go to China.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.260
And they, as I said
before, along the way,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:15.720
they learn to say merci, xiexie,
grazie, dhanyavad, terima kasih,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.430
[inaudible], choukrane, gracias,
domo arigato, [Russian],

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.330
and that all means....

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.920
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: And I'd
like to say thank you guys.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.630
This is an amazing thrill,
to be able to come and talk

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.940
about my book with readers.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.570
So I really appreciate it.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.630
And the one thing I want
to do before we have time

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.430
for a question or two, I've
been collecting these things.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.920
At the count of three,
will you guys all go

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.930
"Watch out for the rain!"

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.450
One, two, three.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.510
&gt;&gt; Watch out for the rain!

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.810
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns:
No, that's not it.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.650
This is really important.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.220
This is a matter
of life and death!

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.420
One, two, three!

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.150
&gt;&gt; Watch out for the rain!

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.450
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: Thank you.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:09.750
&gt;&gt; [Singing] Samantha Spinner!

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.840
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.140
Samantha Spinner!

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.230
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:23.220
Going to Egypt, going to
France, looking for the man

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:29.580
in the green plaid pants!

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.160
Sam Spinner!

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.510
And the Super Secret Plans!

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.930
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: Thank you.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:42.420
So time for one or two
questions before time's up?

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.340
Got two questions.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.640
Over there.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:51.150
&gt;&gt; How did you get the
idea for your books?

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.450
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: Well I got
the idea because I really

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.810
like the idea of seeing real
places and things all over,

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.580
and wow, what if there was
a secret passageway there?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.120
And I had kids at the time who
were around your age and one

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.690
of them was reading the
Magic Treehouse and one

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.930
of them was reading
Captain Underpants.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.000
And I thought wow, what if you
put the Magic Treehouse together

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.560
with Captain Underpants and
you'd have amazing adventures

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.500
that taught you about
real things in the world.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.450
And that's where
I got that idea.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.750
Next.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.410
&gt;&gt; So what inspired you to read?

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.720
I mean to write books?

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.570
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: Well
I've always liked books

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.690
and storytelling
and song-writing.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.790
And there's something
really special

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.490
about writing a whole
novel with characters

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.950
that you get attached to.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.850
And so that's what I got
really excited about.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.210
Wow, you could really
learn more about the world

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.780
and about real people in
the world through the eyes

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.010
of characters your age.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.810
And that's what inspired me.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.550
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you have
a particular person or kind

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.160
of person in mind who
you're writing to.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.550
Like do you picture your
reader as you write?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.850
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns:
I absolutely do.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.770
I picture readers like you.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.940
I even found a program on
an app called Voice Stream,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.620
which reads your voice back.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.910
Or your writing back in the
voice of a 10-year-old kid.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.210
And I do that.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.830
So whenever I write,
I write a chapter,

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.600
and then I have it
read back to me.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.850
But I'm always thinking about
a 4th-grade boy or girl.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.560
And especially one that has
a really annoying brother

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.170
or a really annoying sister.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.030
Because you probably
can relate to that.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.420
&gt;&gt; Where did you find
the book about Samantha.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.670
Did you just make it up?

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.460
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: The name?

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.960
I'm sorry.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.260
&gt;&gt; No, the book.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.560
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: The book?

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.510
I'm sorry, I just
couldn't hear the question.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.140
&gt;&gt; The name of the book.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.920
&gt;&gt; The book about Samantha.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.220
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns:
Oh, why did I come

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.520
up "The Super Secret Plans?"

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.820
The title?

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.120
Because I love alliteration.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.420
Do you know what
alliteration is?

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.870
Where you put sounds together?

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.160
And I don't even know where I
came up with the name Samantha.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.010
But I knew that there
were secret plans.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.820
And I thought well, they
could be super secret plans.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.350
And then there could be
a girl named Samantha.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.810
And then I just kept adding.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.320
So it's Samantha Spinner
and the Super Secret Plans.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.940
And then book two in my series,
which is just coming out.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.140
It's called Samantha Spinner
and the Spectacular Specs.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.870
Because I just want to keep
that going because it's fun.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.390
Thanks. Do we have time for...

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.690
One more question!

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.190
Last question over here!

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.670
&gt;&gt; When did you start writing?

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.970
&gt;&gt; Russell Ginns: This book?

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.960
Well I've been writing
for a long time.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.830
I started in magazines.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.880
And then I'm going to
tell you something scary.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.580
This is a scary story now,
this might even be horrifying.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.550
I wrote this book, I started
writing this book almost ten

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.230
years ago!

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.980
And did any of you guys ever say
like "I'm going to do something"

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.010
and then you never finish it?

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.350
Yeah. That happened to me.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:58.340
So I would always,
always be-- how you doing?

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.260
Good. Be careful, I don't want
you to fall off the stage.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.170
So make sure you use the steps.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:10.920
Alrighty. So-- I started
writing my story, no.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.230
I think-- I started writing
my story about ten years ago.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.700
And then I looked at a penny.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.540
And I noticed somebody
changed the back of the penny.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.520
And I thought whoa, I've got
to finish writing this book

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.290
or it's not going
to mean anything.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.590
Okay, come on.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.890
We gotta' go down.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.740
Can somebody give me a hand?

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.640
Thank you.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.830
I looked at the back of a
penny and they changed it.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.090
And so I thought, well I've got
to finish this book really soon.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.850
And then I got really serious.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.810
And I wrote it in
about three months.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.640
But that is just to
do a rough draft.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.790
I don't know if other writers
or your teacher tell you

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.570
about writing is
about re-writing.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.080
So I spent the next nine
months working with editors,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.430
my mom looked at it, my
friends looked at it.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.580
And it took about a
year to get the book

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.360
from when it was a rough
draft to what you see now.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.260
So you've got to start writing

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.560
and you've got to
start re-writing.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.250
But I think I'll stop here.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.040
Because they're rushing
the stage.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.580
Anyways, thank you very much.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.040
This is just a huge thrill.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.340
Thank you.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.800
And-- . Okay.
