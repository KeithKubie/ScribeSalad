the least entertaining one and on
 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.479
the least entertaining one and on
because it's like well they've seen the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489
because it's like well they've seen the

one was just kind of like it's kind of
 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.080
one was just kind of like it's kind of
boring and kind of basic like it follows

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090
boring and kind of basic like it follows
 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.949

not as bizarre and random as every other

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910
not as bizarre and random as every other
 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.580
not as bizarre and random as every other
episode pretty much in this season yeah

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.690
of like this when the other ones would
get so random they would be so

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700
