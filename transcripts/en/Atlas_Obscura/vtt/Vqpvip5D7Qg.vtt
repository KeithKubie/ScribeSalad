00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.709
Roopkund Lake in India

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.291
is sixteen thousand feet above sea level

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:10.375
a glacial lake, and it is overflowing with skeletal remains

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:13.250
but the real amazing thing about skeleton lake

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.333
is what killed the people that are there

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.500
So in 1942 this Indian forest ranger

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.208
stumbles across Roopkund Lake

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:33.875
and sees that it is full of skeletons, it is full of the remains of hundreds of people...

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:37.458
looking back up through the frozen ice in this lake

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:41.792
it would have been an absolutely terrifying sight!

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:46.917
So this forest ranger became concerned that these might be Japanese soldiers

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:48.709
as part of some kind of WWII maneuver

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:51.333
and reported it to the British

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.166
But on a follow up study in the 1950s

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.083
they found that these skeletons were in fact much older than that

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.875
but even after this forest ranger discovered them

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:04.125
they don’t know how they got there, and they don’t know what killed these hundreds of people

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:05.709
dozens of theories were put out

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:06.792
ancient soldiers

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:08.250
a caravan of merchants

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.291
a royal wedding party

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.875
maybe they died of disease

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:13.500
maybe they all froze to death

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.166
this mystery goes unsolved for decades

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.125
there were some songs and stories that were told

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:28.792
that lent some possible explanation to how these people came to be there and what killed them

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.834
In 2005 as part of a National Geographic expedition

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.834
they begin examining the skeletons

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.667
and they find some interesting things

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:39.667
one: it’s a mixed group. There are women, there are children there are older people

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.750
they think they may have been other way to a festival

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.166
celebrating Nanda Devi

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.792
all of these skeletons suffer from similar wounds

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:51.375
blows to the heads and shoulders with a blunt object

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:55.667
this area of India, because its in the mountains, in the Himalayas

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:59.417
16,000 feet above sea level, over a glacial pass

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:03.083
the weather is out of control there

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:07.333
the area is also known for extreme hailstorms...

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.792
and that is what killed all of these people

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:15.083
the songs and folklore

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:19.375
were about the Goddess Nanda Devi becoming angry at a traveling party

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:23.750
in an act of rage she cast down stones as hard as iron

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.500
striking all of these people dead

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.417
and all of the scientific evidence, all of the forensic evidence

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:30.667
backs this up

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:35.709
they were killed when a freak hailstorm started dropping

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.166
hailstones that were as big as nine inches in diameter

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.542
that is what killed the people at skeleton lake

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:44.792
a friggin hailstorm!

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.583
so while it may have taken until 2005

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:50.083
to definitely prove with science

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:55.792
that the hundreds of people at Roopkund were killed in a freak hailstorm

00:02:55.792 --> 00:03:04.166
the stories, the song of the area, have been telling this tale for over 1100 years

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:09.125

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.083
people steal the skeletons, they are slowly being taken

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:20.667
the region is trying to get the area earmarked, designated as a protected region

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:24.583
leave them at the lake, it’s skeleton lake, its what it’s named after them

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.001
leave them there
