00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.509
It's twitches too spelled with two O's because

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.090
Clever? If you saw my review of the first film you know that I thought it was actually kind of well done

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.720
Ehh, for what it is

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.689
It was a good family fantasy that has some good laughs, some legitimately good drama, and some magical elements. The sequel is pretty much the same.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.429
And not in the bad way like everything is on repeat. They do throw in a lot of new stuff. Heck,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.490
They actually take out a lot of the annoying things from the first one like they very rarely say "Go Twitches!" or do any catchphrases

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.029
In fact, I can only think of two at the end where they do that stupid little dance

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.000
And then they both go "loser". Oh, that's painful

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.999
The rest of the film is once again kind of cheesy

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.659
But kind of interesting too. Our Twitches, played again by the Mowry

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.099
Sisters, find that being friends is one thing, but being sisters living together is something different

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.319
They're snipping at each other more, having disagreements, and not always getting along. But at the end of the day,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.220
They're still sisters and they still connect

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.000
But that comes to a bit of a head when their mother (the real mother)

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.560
Reveals that another evil force is slowly slipping into their Kingdom

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.599
And they need their magic to stop it particularly during an eclipse

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.729
It seems that someone or something in the shadow world is trying to infiltrate their real world

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.710
Their magic can get rid of it for good

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.069
But there's one problem

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.979
While most of the people think it's Thanos, the villain from the first film, one of the sisters thinks it's her father

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.538
And because we don't see things from the point of view of the shadowy monster it very well could be

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.318
This creates a rift between the sisters as well as the rest of the family

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.688
Including their bickering protectors, who have now decided to get married. All throughout the film magical clues,

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.159
Backstories, shadow sneaking around... all indicate that something is up

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.880
But we don't quite know what.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.149
Is it the villain? Is it the father? Even if it is the father look at this portrait of him. Maybe he's a bad guy

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.538
too. After all, they were related. The pacing and atmosphere in this movie is still reasonably well done. So many times

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.600
You'll just see a shadow

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.309
Sneaking in the background you have no idea, is this for good or for evil? And this creates a nice family dynamic among our heroes

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.580
In fact, there's even more than that. They find out that not everybody can use magic. In fact, it's practically outlawed

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.518
While the mother sees this as a necessity one of the sisters doesn't. And both sides have very legitimate points

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.249
It's not something like Little Mermaid 3 where All music is outlawed, and that's obviously bad. Here,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.190
it actually kind of makes sense the choices that people make and the arguments they have for their side. Again,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.959
I feel like that strangely the strength of these movies is that there actually is kind of a family connection

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.690
Disagreements don't always mean one is obviously right and one is obviously wrong. But on top of that,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.239
There's a ton of other things that Disney Channel viewers would like. You get to see 'em go on dates, you find out one might

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.289
Be a prince, but that turns out he's just wearing a butler's outfit because he works in the kitchen

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.339
There's a boyfriend who used to date one of the sisters and now he's dating the other one

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.049
But this shadow suddenly possesses him, maybe it seems to be following him

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.789
There's all sorts of nice little touches going on. The effects are still pretty bad

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.959
But they're at least a little better than the last one. They at least try to go more

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.860
cinematic with them. Sometimes, they work, other times they're pretty awkward

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.979
but thankfully a lot of it is shot more cinematically, so you're more looking at the nice sets and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.470
Cinematography than you are how bad the effects are. Yeah, for the most part. Again, they can be really awkward

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.199
It's funny because I just had to watch Return to Halloweentown where a lot of it obviously steals from Harry Potter

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.899
Here, this one steals from Harry Potter, too

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.840
But it also kind of steals from Lord of the Rings with shadowy

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.249
figures and even a ring and a dark presence trying to take human form

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.609
And...yeah on the one hand I could shout "Rip off!"

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.759
It does seem to come back to its own thing just enough. And the elements it does borrow from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.800
seem to be good elements that they're borrowing from

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.740
Like there's a backstory about how the mother and father met. The father wanted to get the mother a gift

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:03.620
And so she asked for a star. And that's exactly what he got her; a star that can fit in her pocket.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.920
That seems Harry Potter-esque

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.719
But it's just different enough to let it pass. That dark presence

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.450
you always feel watching you and always seems to be around very much feels like Sauron from Lord of the Rings. But again,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.439
They add that you don't know if it's evil and you don't know what it can do

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.410
It's almost like it's similar ideas, but the changes

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.089
They make are just enough to make it so it's not really distracting and you're still invested in the story

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.209
Add some good one-liners and even some good dramatic moments

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.320
and yeah, you get a sequel, about as good as the first one. It still has hammered-in moments and schmaltzy moments, but again

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.660
I think that's kind of expected for a Disney Channel movie. When it wants to get a small laugh out of you, it works and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.619
When it wants to get a little emotion out of you it works, then too - I'm actually kinda surprised

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.679
I like these movies as much as I did. I doubt I'll play it again

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.479
but was glad I sat down and watched them once. It felt like there was a lot more to it than just

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.039
Sister Sister if they were witches. It has its own universe it has its own identity

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.890
And it has more than enough to keep kids entertained. I know it's weird, but as these Disney Channel movies

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.710
Go, these films are surprisingly pretty decent
