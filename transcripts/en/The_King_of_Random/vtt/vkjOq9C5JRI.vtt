They say a rose is a symbol of true love.
And here's a cheesy little trick that might

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.590
help you find it.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.100
For this project, all you're gonna need
is a single serviette. Open it flat on a table,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.320
then fold one of the edges back about an inch
and a half from the top. Now simply flip it

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.440
over, and place one of your thumbs on the
corner behind the strip. We're gonna roll

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.400
the whole thing, around the outside of our
thumb, until it forms a tube. And when it

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.409
looks like this, try pinching it off just
below the flap, and gently twist, until it

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.940
starts tightening up. This is gonna be
the flower's head. Let's keep twisting it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.960
down another inch or two to form a stem, then
take one of the corners at the bottom, and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.370
fold it up along the side. You should be able
to see how this corner, is forming a little

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.569
leaf. As we continue twisting the stem down
the rest of the way, it should be starting

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:56.319
to resemble a real flower. But the flower
head doesn't look very convincing yet. To

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.409
fix that, let's reach inside and twist the
inner folds around, and now it looks incredible.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.510
The flap on the outside can be gently pulled
up around the rose head to make a little decorative

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.440
hood, and it's done. You've just made an instant
white rose, to impress somebody special. Now

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.640
check this out. If you try spraying a little
perfume or cologne on the flower head, it

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.860
will smell good too. I gave one of these to
the girl of my dreams 7 years ago, and now

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.700
we're married, and have 3 kids. If you don't
have a special someone, try using it as a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.420
fancy way to tip that cute server that just
brought you your food.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.050
Well now you can turn a humble eating accessory,
into a clever expression, of your affection.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.320
By the way, you don't even have to have a
napkin. I just made this one with a hamburger

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.780
wrapper. How awesome is that? Well that's
it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.450
