00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.511
So here's the worst case. We have a green triangle clipped by a blue rectangle.

00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:08.179
How many sides is the resulting polygon?

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:20.276
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:23.234
And so how many triangles will this result in?

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:38.041
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So our answer here is 5.
