00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:03.495
(very quiet music)

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:05.243
Ann Temkin: I'm standing
in front of a platform

00:00:05.243 --> 00:00:07.536
full of sculptures by Constantin Brancusi,

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:11.656
a Romanian-born artist who walked from

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:14.152
Romania to Paris when
he was a young artist.

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:18.232
He made sculptures that explored
the idea of abstraction.

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.828
In the center is Mademoiselle Pogany.

00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:24.115
The bronze is dated 1913 and it's based

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:27.397
on a marble and made
from a plaster from 1912.

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:30.492
It was actually a portrait
of a friend of his,

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:33.578
Margit Pogany, a young Hungarian woman.

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:37.448
When the plaster was on
view in 1913 in New York,

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:42.368
it became one of the star
pieces of the Armory Show,

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:45.524
not in the sense of being most beloved,

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:49.740
but being most ridiculed by
the press and by the visitors.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.979
Together with Marcel Duchamp's

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.364
Nude Descending a Staircase,

00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:57.035
Mademoiselle Pogany was lampooned

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.608
probably more than any other object there.

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:00.650
What was the problem?

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.285
It had a name.

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:04.366
Brancusi was clearly telling the visitors

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.815
that this was a portrait.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.994
This was not a head, it was
an egg, is what they said.

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:12.897
Brancusi delineated the hair

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:15.732
not by any sculpted forms of curls.

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:17.909
She was considered bald.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.866
The facial features by the slightest

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:24.031
of descriptive lines or incisions

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.482
were seen as nonsensical.

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:28.742
We're at a point in history where

00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:32.284
Brancusi is beginning to abstract from

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:36.357
a fairly naturalistic image into forms

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:39.325
that were much more pure and simplified

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:41.073
down to their really essential features.

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:43.316
This was something that today, I think,

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:46.035
100 years later, we all look at and know

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:47.733
that we're looking at a woman.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:51.398
At that time, it was almost
incomprehensible that

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:53.818
that would be how you could
represent somebody's face.

00:01:53.818 --> 00:01:57.818
(very quiet music)
