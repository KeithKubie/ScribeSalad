and as a result I find myself believing
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.070
and as a result I find myself believing
in some scientific theories that when I

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
in some scientific theories that when I
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.230
in some scientific theories that when I
say them out loud kind of make me sound

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
say them out loud kind of make me sound
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.079

the clothes however if we were to
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849
the clothes however if we were to
imagine that example man were immortal

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
imagine that example man were immortal
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460
imagine that example man were immortal
and that he never bought any other

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
and that he never bought any other
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590

think that eventually he would have to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
think that eventually he would have to
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070
think that eventually he would have to
start repeating his outfit combinations

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
start repeating his outfit combinations
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.350
start repeating his outfit combinations
airing that example in mind here is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
airing that example in mind here is
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.490

as individuals that is what science
tells us that sheer number of possible

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
tells us that sheer number of possible
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600
tells us that sheer number of possible

combinations that these particles can
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550

make is so big that I am NOT going to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
make is so big that I am NOT going to
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.630
make is so big that I am NOT going to
bother trying to figure out what that

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
bother trying to figure out what that
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.030
bother trying to figure out what that
number is however because there are only

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
number is however because there are only
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160
number is however because there are only
a certain number of different types of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
a certain number of different types of
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289
a certain number of different types of
particles that means that the number of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
particles that means that the number of
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.120
particles that means that the number of
different combinations those particles

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
different combinations those particles
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.859
different combinations those particles
can make is finite

meaning the just like example man if you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
meaning the just like example man if you
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.429
meaning the just like example man if you
give the universe enough space it will

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
give the universe enough space it will
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410
give the universe enough space it will
have to start repeating itself and it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
have to start repeating itself and it
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510
have to start repeating itself and it
just so happens that the prevailing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
just so happens that the prevailing
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920
just so happens that the prevailing
scientific theory at the moment is that

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
scientific theory at the moment is that
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.490
scientific theory at the moment is that
the universe is infinitely big so if

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
the universe is infinitely big so if
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710
the universe is infinitely big so if
that's true then that means that the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
that's true then that means that the
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.300
that's true then that means that the
universe

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310
universe
 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.970
universe
has to have repeated itself which means

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980
has to have repeated itself which means
 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.540
has to have repeated itself which means
that there has to be an infinite number

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
that there has to be an infinite number
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.839
that there has to be an infinite number
of different copies of me and of you and

cosmos please believe me when I say that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
cosmos please believe me when I say that
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.100
cosmos please believe me when I say that
I know how absurd this idea sounds but I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110
I know how absurd this idea sounds but I
 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.370
I know how absurd this idea sounds but I
also know that it comes from a place of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380
also know that it comes from a place of
 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.350
also know that it comes from a place of
observing our universe and making a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360
observing our universe and making a
 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.180
observing our universe and making a
logical conclusion about it it is not

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
logical conclusion about it it is not
 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.820
logical conclusion about it it is not
fanciful thinking it is rational

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830
fanciful thinking it is rational
 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.550
fanciful thinking it is rational
thinking it just it just doesn't feel

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
thinking it just it just doesn't feel
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.110
thinking it just it just doesn't feel
like it should be true now obviously

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
like it should be true now obviously
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.940
like it should be true now obviously
when it comes to science how we feel

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
when it comes to science how we feel
 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.580
when it comes to science how we feel
about an idea has absolutely zero impact

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590
about an idea has absolutely zero impact
 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.370
about an idea has absolutely zero impact
on how true it is or isn't but for me

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
on how true it is or isn't but for me
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.350
on how true it is or isn't but for me
personally I kind of like the idea of

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360
personally I kind of like the idea of
 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.449
personally I kind of like the idea of
infinite Charlie's and I will explain

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459
infinite Charlie's and I will explain
 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.490
infinite Charlie's and I will explain
why what the theory dictates is that not

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
why what the theory dictates is that not
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.320
why what the theory dictates is that not
only are there an infinite number of

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330
only are there an infinite number of
 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.789
only are there an infinite number of
identical versions of us scattered

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799
identical versions of us scattered
 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.979
identical versions of us scattered
around the universe but also that there

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989
around the universe but also that there
 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.960
around the universe but also that there
are an infinite number of ever so

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970
are an infinite number of ever so
 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.280
are an infinite number of ever so
slightly different versions of us

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
slightly different versions of us
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.780
slightly different versions of us
scattered throughout the universe and so

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
scattered throughout the universe and so
 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.430
scattered throughout the universe and so
for me personally when I'm going about

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440
for me personally when I'm going about
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.770
for me personally when I'm going about
my day to day life and I make a decision

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780
my day to day life and I make a decision
 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.960
my day to day life and I make a decision
that I regret or I find myself missing

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970
that I regret or I find myself missing
 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.759
that I regret or I find myself missing
an opportunity I fail to tell a girl

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769
an opportunity I fail to tell a girl
 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.620
an opportunity I fail to tell a girl
that I like her or something then what I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630
that I like her or something then what I
 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.479
that I like her or something then what I
like to think about is that somewhere

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489
like to think about is that somewhere
 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.009
like to think about is that somewhere
out there in the universe there is a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019
out there in the universe there is a
 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.650
out there in the universe there is a
