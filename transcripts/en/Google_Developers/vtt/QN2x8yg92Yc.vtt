JESSICA DENE EARLEY-CHA:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.960
My name is Jessica
Dene Earley-Cha,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.532
and I'm a Developer Advocate
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:11.490
Today, I'm going to walk
you through the latest

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.550
version of the actions on Google
Console, which makes developing

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.650
faster and easier than ever.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.150
When you create
actions, you can now

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.810
choose from several categories.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.480
Depending on the
action type you select,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.550
your workflow will change.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.620
For each category, you'll
get specific guidance

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.230
across stages of
development-- setup,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.420
build, test,
deploy, and measure.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.420
One of the first things
you want to do for setup

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.010
is to give your actions
an invocation name.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.040
Choose a simple but unique name.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.710
You want users to easily
invoke your actions.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.751
Now, you can go ahead
and build your action.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.250
Start by defining
the intents you'll

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.080
want your user to be able to do.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.750
You'll also need to
find fulfillments--

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.550
how your action responds
to your users' requests.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.920
One of our fulfillment
types is conversation.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.860
That could be created with
Dialogflow Dialogflow is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.990
a tool that uses AI
and natural language

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.810
processing to understand
the user, which

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.400
then triggers your action.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.980
The console pulls from
the Dialogflow project,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.926
so you could see
what you have set up.

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:09.300
As you're inputting all of
your intents and fulfillments,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.710
you can test your
actions in the simulator.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.710
Make sure to test it on
different service types,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.590
like audio only speakers and
mobile devices, which have

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.150
audio and visual capabilities.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.450
You'll be able to see the
JSON requests and responses

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.270
from actions on Google
to your action, as well

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.110
as logs and errors.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.440
You can even test your action
on your personal devices

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.200
that are linked to your
same Google account.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.700
Now that you've
tested your action

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.620
and have all the
functionality you want,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.720
you can start the
deployment process.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.170
All you need to do is add
metadata to your action.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.880
Once that's done,
submit your action

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.820
in for the review process.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.010
After your pass' review,
it's available to all users,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.170
or you could use our
alpha and beta releases

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.180
to try out your actions
with a smaller group.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.880
Once the actions are live,
it's time to measure.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.920
You can do this with
our analytics tool.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.500
There, you can see usage,
errors, and discovery data.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.142
So that was a quick demo of
the actions on Google Console.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:03.600
You can find out
more about Actions

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.580
on Google by checking
out the docs in the link

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.090
in the description below.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.657
We also have a Google
Plus community,

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:10.740
so you can ask your questions
and share your ideas

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.940
with everyone.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.320
I'm Jessica Dene Earley-Cha.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.260
Thanks for watching.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.640
And I look forward to
seeing what you build.
