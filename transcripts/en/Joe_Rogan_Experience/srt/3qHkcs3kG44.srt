1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,720
Two one. Boom. All right. We're live.
Thank you very much for doing this, man.

2
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:05,441
I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,970
I've been absorbing your information and
listening to you talk for quite a while

4
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:13,900
now. So it's a, it's great
to actually meet you. Thanks
for having me. My pleasure.

5
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,580
My pleasure.
You are one of the rare guys that is a,

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,090
you're a big investor. You are, um,

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,920
you're deep in the tech world,

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,450
but yet you seem to have a very balanced
perspective in terms of how to live

9
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:33,451
life as opposed to not just be entirely
focused on success and financial success

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,100
and tech investing,

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,990
but rather how to live your life in
a happy way. That's, uh, it's, uh,

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,310
that's not balance.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,870
Yeah. You know, I think the
reason why people like, uh,
hearing me is because like,

14
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:54,050
if it's like if you go to a
circus and you see a bear, right?

15
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,110
That's kind of interesting, but not
that much. If you see a Unicycle,

16
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:00,170
that's interesting, but you see a bear
on a Unicycle, that's really interesting.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,730
So when you combine things, you're not
supposed to combine. I get interested.

18
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,660
It's like Bruce Lee, right? And striking
thoughts, philosophy plus martial arts.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,460
And I think it's because at some level,
all humans are broad.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,570
We're all multivariate.

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,430
But we get summarized in pithy ways
in our lives and at some deep level,

22
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:20,840
we know that's not true,
right?

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,060
Every human basically is capable of
every experience and every thought, uh,

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,520
you know, your UFC, comedian,
commentator, podcasts here,

25
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:33,440
but you're also more than that. You're
also father a lover, you know, a thinker,

26
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:38,150
et cetera. So I like the model
of life that the ancients had,

27
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:42,560
the Greeks, the Romans, right, where you
would start out and when you're young,

28
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,410
you're just like going to school,
then you're going to war,

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,970
then you're running a business,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,610
then you're supposed to serve
in the Senate or the government,

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,290
then you become a philosopher.
This sort of,

32
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:55,130
this arc to life where you
try your hand at everything.

33
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,980
And uh, as one of my friends is a
specialization is for insects, right?

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,720
So everyone should just
be able to do everything.

35
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:07,100
And so I don't believe in this model
anymore of trying to focus your life down

36
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,070
on one thing. You've got one life,
just do everything you're going to do.

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah,
I couldn't agree more.

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,210
And I think that sometimes people find
certain success in whatever the endeavor

39
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,210
is and then they think that that is their
niche and they stick with it and they

40
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,850
never change.
And they almost out of fear.

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,920
Well it's, it's hard
because there's a, you know,

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,890
there's analogy around mountain climbing.

43
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,700
Like if you find a mountain and you start
climbing and you spend your whole life

44
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:36,480
climbing it and you get say two thirds
of the way and then you see the peak is

45
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,470
like way up there, but you're
two thirds of the way. Yeah.

46
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:41,130
But is still really high up.
But not to go the rest of the way.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,070
You're going to have to go back down to
the bottom and look for another path.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,830
Nobody wants to do that.
People don't want to start over.

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,220
And it's the nature of later in life
that you just don't have the time.

50
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,760
So it's very painful to go back
down and look for a new path.

51
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,470
But that may be the best thing to do.

52
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,470
And that's why when you look at
the greatest artists and creators,

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,120
they have this ability to start over
that nobody else does. Like Elon will,

54
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,750
you know,

55
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,800
be called an idiot and start over doing
something brand new that he supposedly

56
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:12,820
is not qualified for or when Madonna or
Paul Simon are you to come out with a

57
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,654
new album.

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,350
Their existing fans usually hate it
because they've adopted a completely new

59
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,620
style that they've learned somewhere
else and a lot of times they'll just miss

60
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:21,454
completely.

61
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,020
So you have to be willing to be a fool
and kind of have that beginner's mind and

62
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,150
go back to the beginning to start over.
If you're not doing that,

63
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,990
you're just getting older.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,250
Yeah, I mean I don't even know
if it's willing to be a fool.

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,150
It's just to me that the most exciting
thing is to try and get better at

66
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,400
something and to learn things.
I mean it's,

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,420
it's really exciting when you just have
incremental progress in something that

68
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,410
you're completely new to.

69
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,030
Yeah.
I live for the Aha moment,

70
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,690
that moment when you connect two things
together that you hadn't connected

71
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:53,800
together before and it fits nicely in
solidly and it kind of helps form a steel

72
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:57,760
framework of understanding in your mind
that you can then hang other ideas off

73
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,110
of.
That's what I live for.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,690
That curiosity fulfilled and it's what
little children do to, you know, my,

75
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,000
my little son is always asking
why, why, why, why, why,

76
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,880
and I always try and answer him
and half the Times I realized,

77
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:13,750
actually I don't really understand why.
I just have a memorized answer for you,

78
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,280
but that's not really understanding.

79
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,750
Yeah. Those are weird
conversations, right? When you're,

80
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,280
you're talking to your
kids and you say, look, uh,

81
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,170
the reality is I don't know a lot of
things. Yes. I've just memorize a lot of,

82
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,630
yeah. And there's certain things
that you just can't know. Yeah.

83
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,530
You realized that you know,
you have,

84
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,740
you have answers for a few things
that you've thought through.

85
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,670
Then you sort of have coverups like,
like trap doors. Like don't go here.

86
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:38,630
This is just a cover up.

87
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:42,080
I don't really know the answer to what
the meaning of life is or how we got here.

88
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,240
And then you've got a whole bunch of
memorize stuff because a lot of your, uh,

89
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,960
a lot of intelligence these days, just
the external brain pack of civilization.

90
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,050
I know it's out there and are,

91
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,530
the answers are out there and I'll have
to look them up and I've memorized some

92
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,990
of them and I kind of understand how
money works in the Federal Reserve prints

93
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,410
it and what this government thing is,
but not really.

94
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,500
Right. Um, so not good enough to
teach it in university. Yeah. Uh,

95
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,900
I think people do that with almost
everything in life these days.

96
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:12,470
In terms of like have a, like
a, a one page of one sheet,

97
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:17,471
like a brief summary of what
the explanation for what
this very complex subject

98
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:22,160
might be. Tldr, right? Yes.
Give me the don't give you
the lecture. Gave me the book.

99
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't give me the book. Give me the blog
posts. Don't give me the blog posts.

100
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:27,950
Give me the tweet. Don't give me the
tweet. I just, I already know. Yeah.

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,400
I got really fascinated by the way
you read because I thought there was

102
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,190
something wrong with me by doing that.
But you,

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,370
you don't really just
read a book to completion.

104
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,290
You read and then you pick something
else up and you just kind of go based on

105
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,030
your whims,
whatever you're interested in.

106
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,580
Raised by my mom,

107
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,960
I was raised by a single mom in New
York and she used the local library as a

108
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,480
daycare center because it was
a very tough neighborhood.

109
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,210
And so she would basically say,
when you get back from school,

110
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:58,700
go straight to the library and don't come
out until I pick you up late at night.

111
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,550
So I used to basically live in
the library and I read everything.

112
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:05,990
I read every magazine I read
every pictograph or what
every book or every map.

113
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,880
I just ran out of stuff to read.
I just read everything.

114
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:12,650
So I got over this idea of that reading
a large number of books or reading a

115
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,500
book to completion as a vanity
metric because it really,

116
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,720
when people are putting
a photos on Twitter,

117
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,590
Instagram of looking at my pile of books
that I'm reading, it's a show off thing.

118
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,700
It's a signaling thing.
Yeah sure.

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,350
And the reality is I would rather read
the best hundred books over and over

120
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:31,990
again until I absorbed them rather than
read all the books. Yeah. Cause your,

121
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,800
your brain has find that information,
uh, and find its space. Uh,

122
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,810
you get enough advice. It
all cancels to zero. Um,

123
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,940
there's a lot of nonsense
and books out there too.

124
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,540
So I don't read any
more to complete books.

125
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,430
I read to satisfy my genuine intellectual
curiosity. And it can be anything.

126
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:51,980
It could be nonsense. It could
be history, it could be fiction,

127
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:56,090
it could be science, it could be Psi Phi
these days. It's mostly Scifi philosophy,

128
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:57,800
science cause that's just
what I'm interested in.

129
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,350
But I will read for understanding.

130
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,200
So a really good book I will flip through.

131
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,560
I won't actually read it consecutive in
order and I won't even just even finish

132
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,330
it.
I'm looking for ideas,

133
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,690
things that I don't understand and when
I find something really interesting,

134
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,540
I'll reflect on it, I'll research it. Uh,

135
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,540
and then when I'm bored of it I'll
drop it or I'll flip to another book.

136
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,030
Thanks to electronic books.
I've got 50,

137
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:24,800
70 books open at any time and my kindle
or I books and I'm just bouncing around

138
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,270
between them.
Uh,

139
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:31,271
it's also a little bit of a defense
mechanism to how in modern society we get

140
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,790
too much information too quickly and
sort attention spans are very low.

141
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,390
So you get Twitter, you get
Instagram, you get Facebook,

142
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,391
you just used to being bombarded with
information so you can take that to you.

143
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,550
You can view that as a negative and
be like, I have no attention span.

144
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,080
Or You could view that as a positive.

145
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:51,080
I multitask really well and
I can dig really fast. I can,

146
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,000
if I find a thread that's interesting,

147
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,270
I can follow through five social networks
through the web, through the libraries,

148
00:07:56,271 --> 00:08:00,230
through the books, and I can really get
to the bottom of this thing very quickly.

149
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,740
It's like the library of Alexandria
that I can research at my disposal.

150
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,750
So I no longer track books, read
or even care about books. Read.

151
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,350
It's about understanding concepts.

152
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,400
Yeah. You brought up two awesome points.
First of all, the social media aspect of,

153
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:16,460
of books and basically anything,
it's like,

154
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,830
it's such a weird way to display
your life cause it's, you know,

155
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:25,831
you're displaying the best aspects of
your life and some sort of a glass case,

156
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,620
you know,
just,

157
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:32,420
it's an unrealistic version of your
life that you cultivate and you curate

158
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,590
and I'm, I'm as guilty of that as
anybody. Everybody's guilty of it.

159
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm guilty of it too.

160
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,140
Yeah. You know what I mean? I
pose with my dog every time I run.

161
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,530
Yeah.

162
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,030
We're always signally rather
than really looking at yourself,

163
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:48,850
you're looking at how other
people look at you like this one,

164
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:50,020
remove mental image,

165
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,950
and it's kind of a disease because social
media is making celebrities of all of

166
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,330
us and celebrities and the most
miserable people in the world, right?

167
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,120
Because they're this strong
self image that gets built up.

168
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,420
It gets built up by compliments.
Every time somebody pays you or me,

169
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,850
a compliment and we're like,
oh, well thank you. Right?

170
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,840
Then that builds up an image of who
we are and then one idiot comes along,

171
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,460
one out of 10,
one out of a hundred,

172
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:15,390
and they can easily tear it down because
it doesn't take many insults to cancel

173
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,380
out a lot of compliments.

174
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,590
And now you're carrying around this big
weighty self image and it's just very

175
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,520
easy to be attacked and because you're,
you're famous or you're well known,

176
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,000
people want to attack you. So,
uh, being a celebrity is no good.

177
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,780
It's actually a problem.
Like one of my tweets is,

178
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,140
and these are all reminders to myself,
is you want to be rich and anonymous,

179
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:38,580
not poor and famous, right? There's
benefits to it of course, of course.

180
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,000
But we wouldn't do it.

181
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Unusual problems that you don't get
trained for and you really will not

182
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,960
understand unless you experience it.
You know,

183
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,870
it goes having this conversation with
my wife, we were talking about um,

184
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,950
people that just come up to you and
they don't care what you're doing.

185
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,100
They don't care if I'm with my daughter,
if I'm holding her,

186
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:03,000
if I'm feeding her for, you know, we're
in the middle of an intense conversation,

187
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:06,180
she's crying,
she could be crying and some bro,

188
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,300
we'll come over and just
immediately have to take a picture,

189
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,360
doesn't care his needs,
supersede the daughter.

190
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,380
And my wife was saying
that before she knew me,

191
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:20,760
she used to think that that's just
part of the price of being famous.

192
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,830
That people, people like you, that's
just part of the price, be famous.

193
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,330
And now when it interrupts
her life and you know,

194
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,040
interrupts the children and interrupts
friends and you know, she now she's like,

195
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,100
this is annoying. Like this
is not, this is not healthy.

196
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,510
This is not a smart way to,

197
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,490
to interact with people and that
people have this weird challenged,

198
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,960
this weird thing that if you're,
if he become famous,

199
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,720
there's this weird challenge where
people just want to come to you,

200
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,270
especially today,
because if they can get a photo of you,

201
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,750
then that boost their social
media profile. Like, Hey,

202
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,070
I'm sitting here with evolve.
Look at this.

203
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,470
Anonymity is a privilege. Uh, on the
other hand is self inflicted. I mean,

204
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:01,740
we brought it on ourselves. We don't
think we knew what it was though we did,

205
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,000
but we carry on. So it tells us we
are getting something out of it.

206
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,870
So there are times when some of the
approached me in public and I'm a little

207
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,300
resentful and then other times
they're just like, actually,

208
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,500
I'm really grateful that you know,
I've worked for this, I got this right.

209
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,360
This is the payoff. Just embrace
it. Smile, Grin and bear.

210
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,650
It meets someone of a different,
yeah,

211
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,620
sort of celebrity too, right?
You're a, you're a hero
amongst investors and amongst

212
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,940
tomorrow among young male Geeks,

213
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,960
which is just some of my favorite people.
Right.

214
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:34,840
But that's not the kind of celebrity
I think most people set out to get,

215
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,450
especially the most guys. Right, right,
right. You want the cute females? Yeah.

216
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,540
I look at my brief little youtube clips.

217
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:47,440
I'd have a tiny little podcasts
going now and it's like 95% male. Oh,

218
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm sure. Yeah. This

219
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,810
is very highly 18 to 35, right? Yeah. We,
what are we, what is the numbers and said,

220
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,100
yeah, it's in the nineties.
Yeah. Um, you, you did that one.

221
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,850
You do that one very small
podcasts where you just have small,

222
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,650
like three or four minute clip.

223
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,730
Yeah. So what it was, I
did a tweet storm, uh,

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,160
called how to get rich without getting
lucky and it got pretty popular in

225
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,310
Twitter. Uh, and uh, it's
really about wealth creation.

226
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:16,330
I just used the click baity title and
it's trying to basically lay out timeless

227
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,820
principles of wealth creation
that if you absorb them,

228
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,330
you become the kind of
person who can create wealth,
create business, make money.

229
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,910
Uh, and my theory behind that is like,
there are three things everybody wants.

230
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,160
There's actually more than three. But
let's see, let's just start with three.

231
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,130
The three basics.
Everybody wants to be wealthy,

232
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,250
everybody wants to be happy
and everybody wants to be fit.

233
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,980
And I know there's a lot of which
she was signaling that goes on,

234
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,870
like we don't want to money.
And you know,

235
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,990
I don't care about being happy and
happiness is for stupid people,

236
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,840
but let's face it, like you want
to be rich and happy and healthy.

237
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,100
That's the TRIFECTA.

238
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,920
Now of course you also want to
internally calm state of mind.

239
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:53,500
You want a loving household. So there
are other things that come into it,

240
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:57,940
but those three I think they can
actually be taught right? And a fitness.

241
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm not going to teach. There are a
lot of people who you've had on here,

242
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,151
including yourself,

243
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:04,660
who know a heck of a lot more about
fitness and health than I do. Um,

244
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,550
but I was born poor and miserable and uh,
I'm now pretty well,

245
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,000
often very happy. Uh, and I
don't, and I worked at those.

246
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,550
And so I've learned a few things.
There's some principles.

247
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,500
And so I try to lay them out,

248
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:21,100
but in a timeless manner where you
can kind of figure it out yourself.

249
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,050
Because at the end of the day,
I can't really teach anything.

250
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:26,470
I can only inspire you and maybe give you
a few hooks so you can remember things

251
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,930
when they happen or put it,
put a name to them.

252
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,980
So this podcast actually ended
up explaining this tweet storm.

253
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,700
So there's a tweet storm was like
36, 38 tweets, got very famous,

254
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:39,640
got translated dozens of languages.
Um,

255
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,140
and these were principles that I came up
with for myself when I was really young,

256
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,330
around 13, 14. Uh,

257
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:50,980
and I've been carrying them in my head
for 30 years and I'd been sort of living

258
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:55,510
them. And over time I just
realized like sadly or fortunately,

259
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,320
the thing that I got really good at was
looking at businesses and figuring out

260
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:03,010
the point of maximum leverage to actually
create wealth and capture some of that

261
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,140
and do it in a very longterm kind of way.
Not, not the, you know, banker crashed,

262
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,170
the economy get bailed out kind of way.
But you know,

263
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:14,770
build businesses and help people
and provide value kind of way,

264
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,790
especially when applied to modern
technology and leverage in this age of

265
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,130
infinite leverage that we live in a,

266
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:24,850
so the podcast is just explaining each
tweet. So these are little three, four,

267
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:28,810
five minutes snippets. I don't like
to say the same thing twice. Uh,

268
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,110
I don't like to explain
in detail. Uh, I just,

269
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,920
I feel like if you have something original
and interesting to say should say it,

270
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,780
otherwise it's probably been said better.

271
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,730
So that podcast tries to be information
dense. It tries to be very concise,

272
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,970
it tries to be high impact
and tries to be timeless. Uh,

273
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,560
and it has all the information.

274
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,100
I think you need the principles that if
you absorb these and you work hard over

275
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,820
10 years, you get what you want. Um,
so I've got the one on wealth creation.

276
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,560
I'm going to attempt to do one on
happiness is a big word, but you know,

277
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,290
happiness and inner peace
and calm and all that.

278
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,880
Because what you want is you don't want
to be the guy who succeeds in life while

279
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,900
being high strung,

280
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,170
high stress and unhappy and leaving
a trail of emotional wreckage,

281
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,250
whether you and your loved ones,

282
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,790
which is more common than not.

283
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,490
Yeah. Because you got to focus and it's
very hard to be great at everything.

284
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,190
You want to be the guy or the Gal
who gets there calmly, you know,

285
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,820
quietly without struggle.
Uh,

286
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,340
you want to be the person who the
e when there's a crisis going on,

287
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,390
you want to be the calmest,

288
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,320
coolest cucumber in the room who still
also figures out the correct answer.

289
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,950
Hmm. If you can be, you were in,

290
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,390
one of the things that you were saying
is that you feel like happiness is

291
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:43,930
something that you can learn and then
you can teach yourself to be happy,

292
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:48,931
even just by adopting the mindset that
you are happy person and proclaiming that

293
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,500
to your friends. And so you've sort
of developed a social contract.

294
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,560
I'm a happy person and the law,
I have to live up to that.

295
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,680
Yeah. I've got hundreds of
techniques, but develop that one. Oh,

296
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,810
well, there's this, uh, there's
social consistency, right?

297
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,010
Humans have a need to be highly
consistent with their past pronouncements.

298
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,100
So the way I started my first
tech company was I was in a,

299
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:16,600
in working inside of a larger organization
and I told everybody that I was going

300
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,270
to go start a company. I was like, I hate
this place. I'm going to do my own thing.

301
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm going to be a successful entrepreneur.
Six months past, nine months pass.

302
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,000
Then people start saying,
you're still here.

303
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,440
I thought you were going to go start
a company or when you're lying, right?

304
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:33,290
That was the implication. So
we kind of know this, right?

305
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:37,220
Social contracts are very powerful. Like
if you want to give up drinking, right?

306
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,770
And you're not serious about it,
you'll say, I'm going to cut back.

307
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,370
I'm going to have only one drink a night.
I'm going to only drink on weekends.

308
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:47,300
You tell yourself, but if you're
serious, you'll announce it on Facebook.

309
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,480
You'll tell all your friends, you'll tell
your wife, you'll say, I'm done drinking.

310
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm throwing everything out of the house.
You'll never see me drinking again.

311
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,070
When you say that you know you're serious.

312
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,750
So I think a lot of these are choices
that we make and happiness is just one of

313
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,270
those choices. Uh, and
this is unpopular to say,

314
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,350
cause there are people who are
actually depressed, you know,

315
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,450
chemically or what have you.

316
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:09,290
And there are people who don't believe
that it's possible because then it

317
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,050
creates a responsibility on
them. It says, oh, now if I'm,

318
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,320
you're saying if I'm not happy,
that's my fault. Not saying that,

319
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:19,740
but I'm saying that just like fitness
can be a choice. Health can be a choice.

320
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,720
And nutrition can be a choice. Working
hard and making money can be a choice.

321
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,640
Happiness is also a choice. If you're
so smart, how come you aren't happy?

322
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,260
How come you haven't figured that out?

323
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,100
That's my challenge to all the people who
think they're so smart and so capable.

324
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,400
If you're so smart and capable,
why can't you change this?

325
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,320
Hmm. There are a bunch of people though
that actually take pleasure in being

326
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,670
miserable there.

327
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:47,671
There's something about the pursuit
of excellence and have success that

328
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,340
supersedes

329
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,570
all other pursuits that in in their eyes,
it is.

330
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,980
It is that the peak, the pinnacle,
the most important thing.

331
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,690
It's not a trade off.
I would argue that now when I say happy,

332
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,520
happy is one of those words that means
of zillion different things, right?

333
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,430
It's like love, right? What
does that mean? Right? I love
cheese. Yeah. Before that,

334
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,540
a little bit more tightly, right? So

335
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,270
let's go back to desire, right?
This is old, old Buddhist wisdom.

336
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,590
I'm not saying anything original,

337
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,680
but desire to me as a contract that you
make with yourself to be unhappy until

338
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:28,530
you get what you want. Okay? And
I keep that in front of mine.

339
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:30,360
So when I'm unhappy about something,

340
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,020
I look for what is the underlying desire
that I have that's not being fulfilled.

341
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,990
It's okay to have desires.
You're a biological creature.

342
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,440
Can you put on this earth? You have to
do something. You have to have desires.

343
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:44,190
You have a mission, but don't have too
many. Don't pick them up unconsciously.

344
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,680
Don't pick them up randomly. Don't have
thousands of them. My coffee's too cold.

345
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:51,140
It doesn't taste quite right.
I'm not sitting perfectly,
oh, I wish it would warm.

346
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,560
Or uh, you know, oh my dog pooped in the
lawn. I didn't like that. Whatever it is,

347
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,180
pick your one overwhelming desire.
It's okay to suffer over that one,

348
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,350
but on all the others,

349
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,040
you want to let them go so you can be
calm and peaceful and relaxed and then

350
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,800
you'll perform a better job.
Most people,

351
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,780
when you're unhappy
like a depressed person,

352
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,220
it's not that they have very clear calm
mind. They're too busy in their mind.

353
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,190
The sense of self is too strong.
They're sitting indoors all the time,

354
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:20,460
their minds working, working, working.
They're thinking too much. Well,

355
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,470
if you want to be a high
performance athlete,

356
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,620
how good of an athlete are you going
to be if you're always having epileptic

357
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,400
seizures?

358
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,430
If you're always like twitching and
running around and like jumping in your,

359
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:32,670
your, your limbs are flailing
out of control the same way.

360
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,360
If you want to be effective in
business, you need a clear, calm, cool,

361
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,260
collected mind.

362
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,910
Warren Buffet Plays Bridge all day
long and goes for walks on the side.

363
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,150
He doesn't sit around like constantly
loading his brain with nonstop information

364
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,090
and, and, and getting worked
up about every little thing.

365
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,570
We live in an age of infinite leverage.

366
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,140
What I mean by that is that your actions
can be multiplied a thousand fold

367
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,130
either at broadcasting,

368
00:19:56,131 --> 00:20:00,150
at a podcast or by investing capital
or by having people work for you or by

369
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,220
writing code.
So because of that,

370
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,110
the impacts of good decision making are
much higher than they used to be because

371
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:10,680
now you can influence
thousands or millions of people
through your decisions or

372
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:11,514
your code.

373
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,700
So a clear mind leads to better
judgment leads to better outcome.

374
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,020
So a happy,
calm,

375
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,340
peaceful person will make better
decisions and have better outcomes.

376
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,710
So if you want to operate
at peak performance,

377
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,780
you have to learn how to tame your mind,

378
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,800
just like you have to learn how to attain
your body. I love what you're saying.

379
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,710
Um, Warren Buffet might not be the
best example because he drinks like,

380
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:39,090
I think six coca is a day and eats
mostly Mcdonald's and he's still alive

381
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:43,110
somehow. So that shows you
that low stress is more shit.

382
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,430
Like how old is he? I mean, he's a fairly
old man, Charlie, I think in his nineties.

383
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,120
Right? Yeah. It's made it really far.
I wonder what Warren's doing, you know,

384
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,170
I mean just he's got it. No,
that's bad for him, but if
it's terrible, doesn't care.

385
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,340
He doesn't care. I think he's just a
little stress. Stress is a big key. Right.

386
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,560
So he's just enjoys that Coca
Cola and that's probably,

387
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,270
maybe there is a trade off,
right?

388
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:08,020
Like maybe him and join that
junk food and that coke just ah,

389
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,320
that the pleasing of the mind is maybe
better than him just eating wheat grass

390
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:17,410
shots and, and be pillar
salads and just being, yeah,

391
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,750
just super worked up about everything.

392
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,750
It's like if you need your glass of
red wine and de stress and calm down,

393
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,460
that's probably better than you
flying off the rails. Right, right.

394
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,680
And I think that that's applicable not
just in business but in probably any

395
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:30,250
pursuit.

396
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,250
And I like what you're saying about allow
that one thing to be your obsession,

397
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,640
but everything else, you know, learn
how to learn, how to let things go.

398
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:40,480
Pick your battles.

399
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,860
And we'd like to think that we'd
like to view the world as linear,

400
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,200
which is I'm going to put
an eight hours of work,

401
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,920
I'm going to get back eight hours of
output, right? Doesn't work that way.

402
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,160
The guy running the corner grocery store
is working just as hard or harder than

403
00:21:56,161 --> 00:22:00,570
you and me. How much output is he
getting? What you do, who you do it with,

404
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,660
how you do it. Way more important
than how hard you work. Right?

405
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,490
Outputs are non linear based on the
quality of the work that you've put in the

406
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:10,680
right way. That work is
like a lion. You don't,

407
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,710
you and I are not like cows were
not meant to graze all day. Right?

408
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,580
We're meant to hunt like lions were
closer to carnivores in are omnivorous

409
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:21,780
development than we are to herbivores.
Um, we don't tell vegans. Yeah, sorry.

410
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,410
Look, I wish all that stuff
worked. I don't want to eat meat.

411
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,550
This future generations will look back
at us as worse than slavers. You know,

412
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,380
because the Holocaust,
we're committing with the animals,

413
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:35,100
but they'll have artificial meets that
taste in or healthier is better than the

414
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:39,150
real thing. So allegedly,
allegedly, but so as a,

415
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,800
as a modern knowledge worker athlete,
as an intellectual athlete,

416
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,460
you want to function like an athlete,
which means you train hard,

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,600
then you sprint, then you
rest, then you reassessed,

418
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,070
you get your feedback loop, then you
train some more than you sprint again,

419
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,940
then you rest.

420
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,450
Then you reassess this idea that you're
going to have linear output just by

421
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:04,890
cranking everyday at the same amount
of time saying that's that's machines.

422
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,280
You know machines should be working
nine to five humans are not meant work.

423
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,910
Nine o'clock are not meant to work nine
to five. No, I agree whole heartedly.

424
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:16,170
But that's for people that
are working for someone,

425
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,490
there's not really that option. So
that's unfortunately the, the rub, right?

426
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:23,220
That that's kind of where
my tweet storm starts,

427
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:26,340
which is first of all the first thing.

428
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:29,040
If you're going to make money is that
you're not going to get rich renting at

429
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:33,180
your time. Even lawyers and doctors who
are charging three, four, $500 an hour,

430
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:36,180
they're not getting rich because their
lifestyle is slowly ramping up along with

431
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,180
their income and they're
not saving enough. Uh,

432
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,430
they just don't have
that ability to retire.

433
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,060
So the first thing you have to do is
you have to own a piece of a business.

434
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,260
You need to have equity either
as an owner and an investor,

435
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,430
shareholder or a brand that you're
building that accrues to you to gain your

436
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,440
financial freedom.
Yeah,

437
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:59,120
and I was really fascinated by another
thing that you were bringing up about

438
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,510
working for yourself that
you feel in the future,

439
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,010
whether it's 50 or 100 years from now,

440
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,650
virtually everyone is going
to be working for themselves.

441
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,650
And I believe the way you put it is that
the information age is going to reverse

442
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,370
the industrial age.
Yeah.

443
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,370
If you go back to a hunter
gatherer times how we evolved,

444
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,330
we basically work for
ourselves. We communicated and
cooperative within tribes,

445
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,470
but each hunter,

446
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,920
each category stood on their own and then
combine their resources for the family

447
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,560
unit. But there was no
boss hierarchy, hierarchy,

448
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:31,940
hierarchy where you're like the third
middle manager down in the farming age.

449
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,990
We became a little bit more
hierarchical as we had to run farms,

450
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,330
but even those were still
mostly family farms.

451
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,460
It's industrial work with factories that
sort of created this model of thousands

452
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:47,720
of people working together on one thing
and having bosses and schedules and

453
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:52,250
times to show up. The reality is if you
have to go, I don't care how rich you are,

454
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,820
I don't care whether you're like a top
Wall Street banker, if you have to go,

455
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,020
if somebody has to tell you,

456
00:24:57,021 --> 00:25:01,970
if somebody can tell you when to be at
work and what to wear and how to behave,

457
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,010
you're not a free person.
You're not actually rich.

458
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,690
So we're in this model now where we think
it's all about employment and jobs and

459
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,930
intrinsic in that is that I
have to work for somebody else,

460
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,450
but the information age
is breaking that down.

461
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,500
So Ronald Coase is an economist
who has this coast theater.

462
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,550
I'm very famous Theorem,

463
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,690
but it basically just talks about
why is a company the size that it is.

464
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,170
Why is the company one person instead of
10 people instead of a hundred instead

465
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:28,004
of a thousand?

466
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,390
And it has to do with the internal
transaction costs versus the external

467
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,470
transaction costs. Let's say
I want to do something, uh,

468
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,050
let's say I'm building a house and I
need someone to come in and provide the

469
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:40,580
lumber. I'm a developer, right?

470
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,390
Do I want that to be part of my company
or do I want that to be an external

471
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:45,200
provider?

472
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,740
A lot of it just depends on how hard it
is to do that transaction with someone

473
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,180
externally versus internally.

474
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,120
If it's too hard to keep doing the
contract every time externally,

475
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,230
I'll bring that in house.

476
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,560
If it's easy to do externally
and it's a one off kind of thing,

477
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:59,690
I'd rather keep it out of the house.
Well,

478
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,580
information is making it easier and easier
to do these transactions externally.

479
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,910
It's becoming much easier to
communicate with people. GIG economy.

480
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:10,760
I can send you small amounts of money.
I can hire you through an APP,

481
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,320
I can rate you afterwards,

482
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,030
so we're seeing an atomization of the
firm we're seeing the optimal size of the

483
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:20,510
firm is shrinking.
It's most obvious in silicon valley.

484
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,830
Tons and tons of startups constantly
coming up and shaving off little pieces of

485
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:27,770
businesses from large companies
and turning them into huge markets.

486
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,870
So what looked like the
small little vacation rental
market on craigslist is now

487
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:37,380
suddenly blown up into airbnb.
One example, that's one example,

488
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,580
but what I think we're going to see is
whether it's 10 2050 a hundred years from

489
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,480
now,
high quality work will be available.

490
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,920
We're not talking when
I'm driving an Uber,

491
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,250
we talking about super high quality
work will be available in a gig fashion

492
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,990
where you'll wake up in the morning,

493
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,500
your phone will buzz and you'll have
five different jobs from people who have

494
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,300
worked with in the past or
had been referred to you.

495
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,760
It's kind of like how Hollywood already
works a little bit with how they're

496
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:03,090
organized for a project. You decide
where to take the project or not,

497
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,040
the contract is right there in the spot.

498
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,820
You get paid a certain amount and you
get rated every day or every week you get

499
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:10,620
the my delivered and then
when you're done working,

500
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:13,290
you turn it off and you go to Tahiti
or wherever you want to spend the next

501
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,124
three months.

502
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,790
And I think the smart people have already
started figuring out that the Internet

503
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,540
enables this and they're starting to
work more and more remotely on their own

504
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,171
schedule,

505
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:25,650
on their own time and their own place
with their own friends in their own way.

506
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,230
And that's actually how we
are the most productive.

507
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,460
So the information revolution by
making easier to communicate, connect,

508
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:36,570
and cooperate is allowing us to
go back to working for ourselves.

509
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,920
And that is my ultimate dream. Even when
I run a company and I have employees,

510
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,780
I always tell those people,
hey,

511
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:44,940
I'm going to help you start
your company when you're ready.

512
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,540
Because I think that's the
highest calling. Maybe not
everybody will get there,

513
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,190
but it would be fine if
we were even working at 10
person company or a 20 person

514
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,520
company is way better than working
in a thousand person company,

515
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:57,900
a 10,000 person company.

516
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,430
So this idea that we're all factory like
cogs in a machine who are specialized

517
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,790
in have to do things by rote memorization
or instruction is going to go away.

518
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:10,230
And we're going to go back to being
small groups of creative bands of

519
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,650
individuals setting out to do missions.
And when those missions are done,

520
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,270
we collect our money,
we get rated,

521
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,320
and then we arrest and reassess
until we ready for the next sprint.

522
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,050
Has there ever been a study done on
happiness as it regards to the size of

523
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:28,010
companies? Not that I'm aware of,
but to me it's obvious. It's just

524
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,290
yes, the smaller the company,
the happier you're going to be.

525
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,380
The more human year relations are,
the less you have rules to operate under,

526
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:37,220
the more flexible, the more creative,
the more you'll be treated like a human.

527
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:38,960
Just because you were able
to do multiple things.

528
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,800
Yeah. Um, this brings me to what is a,

529
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:48,801
a subject that keeps getting brought up
nowadays is universal basic income with

530
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:54,061
the oncoming apocalypse of automation
is this is how it's being portrayed by

531
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:55,930
Andrew Yang,
who's running for president.

532
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:59,560
I sat down and talked to them about it's
very compelling and he's a very smart

533
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,300
guy and he's an entrepreneur himself.

534
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:05,050
And when he starts talking
about automation and how
it's going to just eliminate

535
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,070
massive amounts of jobs and leave
people stranded, what do you,

536
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,570
when I know you're a guy that thinks about
the future and I'm going to take this

537
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,840
unpopular point of view on this, I think
it's a non solution to a non problem.

538
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,460
Mm.
Ooh.

539
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,460
And I mean that in the sense
that automation has been
happening since the dawn

540
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:25,060
of time. Mainly electricity came along
that put a lot of people out of work,

541
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,420
did it right. A lot of people carrying
buckets of water and you know,

542
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,460
lighting lamps and all
those kinds of things.

543
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,220
And this was the concern with
factories as well, or apps, everything.

544
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,820
Literally every single thing that comes
in the printing press. Absolutely.

545
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,080
And what it does is it frees

546
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,540
people up for new creative work.

547
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,670
So the question is not is
going to eliminate jobs.

548
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,830
There is no finite number of jobs.

549
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,130
We're not like sitting around dividing
up the same jobs that were around since

550
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:48,964
the stone age.

551
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,510
So obviously in new jobs are being
created and they're usually better jobs,

552
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,550
more creative jobs.
So the question is,

553
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,930
how quickly is this transition going to
happen and what kinds of jobs will be

554
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,290
eliminated and what kinds of jobs
will be created. It's impossible.

555
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:05,110
Looking forward to predict what
kinds of jobs will be created.

556
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,000
If I told you 10 years ago that podcast
it was going to be a job or that, uh,

557
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:10,241
you know,

558
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,150
playing video games is going to be a
job or commentating and video games,

559
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:15,610
it's going to be a job you would
have laughed me out of the room.

560
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,070
Those are nonsense jobs.
But yet here we are.

561
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,060
So society will always create new jobs.
Civilization creates new jobs,

562
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:25,330
but it's impossible to predict what
those jobs are. So the question is,

563
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:29,380
how quickly is that transition happening?
All the reality is,

564
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:32,950
even though everybody keeps talking
about this automation apocalypse,

565
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,130
where did record low unemployment?
Explain that.

566
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,470
Where does the transition Donald Trump,
that's how it, all I'm saying is it's,

567
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:44,110
it's, it's, I don't see it in the numbers.
I don't see it actually happening.

568
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,670
The question is how quickly
can you retrain people? So
it's an education problem.

569
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,430
The problem with the UBI,
there's a couple of problems that ubi.

570
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,070
One is you're creating a straight,

571
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,900
you creating a slippery slide
transfer straight into socialism,

572
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,410
right?

573
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,040
The moment people can start
voting themselves money
combined with a democracy,

574
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,010
it's just a matter of time before
the bottom 51 votes themselves.

575
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:09,390
Everything in the top 49 and it just,
it,

576
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,670
and by the slippery slope
fallacy is not a philosophy.

577
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,830
And I know people like saying that, but
they haven't thought it through. Um,

578
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,790
but the moment you start having a
direct transfer mechanism like that in a

579
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,310
democracy,
you're basically doing it with capitalism,

580
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:22,840
which is the engine of economic growth.

581
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,920
You're also forcing the entrepreneurs
out or telling them not to come here. Uh,

582
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,260
the estimate I saw for 15 k a year,

583
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,710
a basic income for everybody will
be three quarters of current GDP.

584
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,100
And of course GDP was shrinking responses.
All the entrepreneurs fled.

585
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,750
So you would essentially
bankrupt the country. Uh,

586
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,300
another issue with Uva is that
people who are down on their luck,

587
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,410
they're not looking for handouts.
It's not just about money,

588
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,600
it's also about status.
It's about meaning.

589
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,720
And the moment I started giving
money to you and put you on the Dole,

590
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,720
I have lowered your status.
I've made you a second class citizen.

591
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,680
So I have to give you meaning and meaning
comes through education and capability

592
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,510
I have.
You have to teach a man to fish,

593
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,990
not to basically throw your writing
leftover carcasses that haven't say here,

594
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:09,450
eat the scraps. So it doesn't
solve the meaning problem.
And lastly, it's nonsense.

595
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:12,850
The hand 15 k out to everybody
you want to means test people.

596
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,620
There's no reason to
give it to you and me.

597
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,550
So you end up back towards the welfare
system where you do have to figure out

598
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:19,840
who needs it and who doesn't.

599
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,310
So I think the better route is that
we actually establish a set of basic

600
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:29,200
substance services that you have to have
and we provide those in abundance to

601
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,950
technology based automation. So
get basic housing, get basic food,

602
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,160
get basic transportation, get
high, high speed Internet access,

603
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:37,150
get a phone in your pocket.

604
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,760
Those are the kinds of things
you want to give people. Um,

605
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,820
and finally,
in terms of the rate of automation,

606
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,130
I think we can educate
people very quickly.

607
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,660
One of the myths that we have today
is that adults can't be reeducated.

608
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,360
We view education as this
thing where you go to school,

609
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,330
you come out when you're out of college
and you're done. No more education.

610
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,470
Well that's wrong.

611
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,430
You have all these great online boot
camps and coding schools coming up.

612
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:04,110
They're ones that are even
pay you to go there. Now. Um,

613
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,430
you can educate people and mass and
you can educate them into creative

614
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:11,480
professions. People who are talking
about Ai, automating programming.

615
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,340
I've never really written serious code.

616
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,960
Coding is thinking it's
automated structure.

617
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,970
Thinking an AI that can program as well
or better than humans is an AI that just

618
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:26,480
took over the world. That's end game.
That's the end of the human species. Uh,

619
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:29,700
and I can give you arguments why I
don't think that's coming either. Um,

620
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,430
people who are thinking,

621
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,000
and I know I take the opposite side from
some very famous people in this debate,

622
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,690
but we're nowhere near close to
General Ai, not in our lifetimes.

623
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:42,950
You don't have to worry about it. Even in
our lifetimes really. It's so overblown.

624
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,780
Uh, it's a, it's another,
it's a combination of
Cassandra complex. You know,

625
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:52,250
it's fun to talk about the end of the
world. Um, combined with a god complex,

626
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,810
like people who have lost religion.

627
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:56,930
So they were looking for meaning
and some kind of end of history. Um,

628
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,610
the reason why I don't think AI is coming
anytime soon is because a lot of the

629
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:05,270
advances and so so-called AI
today or what we call narrow AI,

630
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,750
they really pattern recognition,
machine learning to figure out like,

631
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:12,710
what is that object on the screen or
how do you find the signal and all that

632
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:16,820
noise. There's nothing approaching
what we call creative thinking, uh,

633
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,230
to actually model general intelligence.
You run into all kinds of problems. First.

634
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,960
We don't know how the brain works at all.
Number two,

635
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,410
we've never even modeled a paramecium
or an Amoeba, let alone the human brain.

636
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,461
Number three,

637
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:32,660
there's this assumption that all of the
computation is going at the cellular

638
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:36,380
level, at the neuron level, whereas
nature is very parsimonious.

639
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,270
It uses everything at his disposal.

640
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,380
There's a lot of machinery inside the
cell that is doing calculations that is

641
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,480
intelligent, that isn't accounted
for. And the best estimates,

642
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,530
I would take 50 years of Moore's law
before we can simulate what's going on

643
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,310
inside a cell near perfectly and probably
a hundred years before we can build a

644
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:56,000
brain that can simulate inside the cells.
So putting it at saying that,

645
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:59,540
I'm just going to model neuron is on or
off and then use that to build the human

646
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:02,600
brain is overly simplistic.
Furthermore, I would pause it.

647
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,460
There's no such thing
as general intelligence.

648
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,070
Every intelligence is contextual within
the context of the environment that it's

649
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,070
in. So you have devolved
an environment around it.

650
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,710
So I think a lot of people
who are peddling general AI,

651
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,060
the burden of proof is on them.

652
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,120
I haven't seen anything that would lead
me to indicate we're approaching general

653
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,670
AI.
Instead we're solving deterministic,

654
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,060
closed set finite problems
using large amounts of data,

655
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,680
but it's not sexy to talk about it.

656
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:25,851
If you,

657
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:30,851
you're talking about mirroring the actual
abilities of cells or are you talking

658
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:36,120
about recreating the actual mechanism?
Like what?

659
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,130
What is going on inside

660
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,050
cells and biological organisms that we
just don't know how intelligence works.

661
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,130
We don't know.
No idea.

662
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:50,210
So most of the AI approaches basically
say we're going to try and model how the

663
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,190
brain works,
but then model at the neuron level,

664
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,670
which is saying this neurons
on that neurons off, they're
combining their signal,

665
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,990
but I'm saying in the neuron is a
cell inside the cell there's all this

666
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:04,680
machinery going on that's operating
the neuron that is also part of the

667
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:08,100
intelligence apparatus. You can't just
ignore that and abstract that out.

668
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,370
You have to model it down to
the inside the cell level.

669
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,980
It's also a part of the
biological organism itself.

670
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,460
Exactly and it has all
these needs that you know,

671
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:21,330
the biological organism has to have
food and rest and it's actually,

672
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,700
it's a balance going on.
But when you eliminate all that,

673
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,900
when there is none of that,

674
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:29,940
and it's just calculations and we get to
a point where it's just this thing that

675
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:31,560
we've created,

676
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,370
whether you call it a computer where it
doesn't have to be a moving thing even,

677
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,680
but a thing that you've
created that stores virtually
all the information that's

678
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,510
available in the world,
star stores,

679
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:47,280
all of the patterns of all the thinking
of all the great people that have ever

680
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:49,110
lived,
all the writers,

681
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,780
all the people that have ever published
anything on the people that have ever

682
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:55,920
spoken, any words, stores,
all of their points,

683
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,500
all of their counterpoints,
other contradictions,

684
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,160
applies logic and reason and some
sort of sense of the future and starts

685
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:13,011
improving upon these patterns and then
starts acting on its own based on the

686
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,870
information that's been provided with,

687
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,790
well first you would have to actually
simulate a structure of the human brain

688
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,440
that can hold all that information.

689
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,020
You're basically talking about tens of
thousands of brains worth of information,

690
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,560
right? We can't even build one brain
the next decade or two or three. Well,

691
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,350
in terms of an actual physical brain,
yes,

692
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,460
but what about something that recreates
the abilities of a brain then?

693
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,410
Like I said,
nature is parsimonious.

694
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,580
So we've got this three pound wetware
objects that can hold all this data.

695
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,420
Nature has been very efficient in
evolving kind of how we get there.

696
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,590
I just don't think computers are
anywhere close to that. Like that.

697
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:53,460
It can hold that amount of data with
that complexity with like the holographic

698
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:57,070
structure of the brain working recall
in many, many different ways. Uh,

699
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,360
and then I don't think you can evolve
a creature to be intelligent outside of

700
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:05,880
the boundaries of feedback in a
real medium. Like if you evolve,

701
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,140
if you raised the human being a concrete
cell with no input from the outside,

702
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,720
they wouldn't have any
feedback from the real world.

703
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,370
They wouldn't evolve properly.
So I think just dumping information into,

704
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,900
into a thing isn't enough.

705
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,050
It has to have an environment to
operate and to get feedback from.

706
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,800
It needs to have context, but isn't
that biological? I mean, what if you,

707
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,000
if you have just the,

708
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,020
all the information that people have
accumulated and the lessons that people

709
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:34,170
have learned and you programmed
that into the computer. Like if,

710
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,460
if we can take a computer that
can beat someone at chess, the,

711
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:38,510
the real question was,
well,

712
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:41,920
can we make some sort of an artificial
intelligence that could beat someone a go,

713
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,160
which is far more complex than chess.
They figured out how to do that too,

714
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,990
and that was a giant shock,
right? These are still manmade,

715
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,890
very closed bounded games.
They're, they're not,

716
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,070
they're not on the road to
the unbounded game of life.

717
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,600
They are completely artificial.
But this didn't go well.

718
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,270
Didn't that give you like
a little bit of a pause?

719
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,600
A little bit go is not go or
league of legends or Fort Night.

720
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,250
They're not completely deterministic,

721
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,360
but they're still very artificial
and very bounded games.

722
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,690
Being good at go doesn't mean that you
can then suddenly figure out how to write

723
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:20,460
great poetry, right? The creativity
for sure is something that's,

724
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,210
creativity is the last frontier.

725
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:25,950
So I do believe that automation over a
long enough period of time or replace

726
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,440
every non creative job or every,
not creative work,

727
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,180
but that's great news. That means that
all of our basic needs are taken care of.

728
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,460
And what remains for us is to be creative,

729
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,480
which is really what every human wants.
Yeah. When, what are you doing right now?

730
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,590
This is the creative job. Sure. Um, that,

731
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:47,750
that brings us back to the idea of
meaning and universal basic income. Uh,

732
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,220
I think the idea of giving someone
$15,000 a year doesn't necessarily cause

733
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,550
whatever, whatever one would worry
about is people being on the Dole.

734
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,940
You would have a bunch of listless
people out there with no meaning in life.

735
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,460
But the idea is that $15,000 a year,

736
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,430
and I'm not necessarily sure
I agree with this, I'm not,

737
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,930
I'm not even endorsing this,
but that $15,000 a year,

738
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:13,630
we just provide you with the
necessities to get by in life.

739
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,420
It would give you food. They
would give you shelter. Well,

740
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:19,240
that's not gonna stop at 15
because the moment people are like,

741
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,074
I'm getting 15 or like,

742
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,850
then people will demand more Bernie
Sanders and beyond the, I'm 16, 17, 18,

743
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,500
19 these companies are too big. Yeah.
That could, it doesn't, it doesn't stop.

744
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,420
It just,
it just goes all the way to bankruptcy.

745
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:36,130
And the concern is a slide to
socialism. It's obvious. I mean, heck,

746
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:39,670
if I was on, if I was not working
and I was getting my 15 year,

747
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,190
I would happily voted for the
guy who would give me 20 or 25.

748
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,240
It's just common sense.

749
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,600
What do you say to the people that don't
believe that there is such a thing of

750
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:49,690
ethical as ethical or
compassionate capitalism?

751
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:53,260
And then there's many people today
that are espousing Marxism and they're

752
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:58,261
espousing some sort of a socialist society
where they believed that capitalism

753
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:00,780
is screwed people over and,
uh,

754
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:05,320
eliminated the middle class and they're
absolutely problems with capitalism.

755
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,260
I think monopolies are a
problem. I think that, uh,

756
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,720
crony capitalism is a problem
with the government, you know,

757
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,870
kind of gets in bed with them
and sort of forces things. Uh,

758
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,670
I think the bankers have really,
you know,

759
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,060
rape society and the rest of us
are suffering literally. Yeah.

760
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,680
They have essentially taken huge risks
where they prioritize the gains and the

761
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,930
socialize the losses.
So when it fails,

762
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:29,420
they basically get bailed out
and bankrupt everybody else. Uh,

763
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,380
so the capitalism has
gotten a really bad name.

764
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,070
Let's talk about as free exchange.
Free

765
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,903
markets,

766
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,390
free markets and free exchange are
intrinsic to humans from when the first

767
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:41,660
person started a fire and somebody
came along with a deer and said, hey,

768
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,660
if I cooked my dear in your fire,
I'll share some of it with you. Right?

769
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:48,770
So specialization of labor, we trade
that's built into the human species.

770
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:53,060
Basic math comes from accounting, keeping
track of debts and credits and so on.

771
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,370
We need to be able to
engage in free trade.

772
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,140
The correct criticism of capitalism
is when it does not provide equal

773
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:03,530
opportunity. And so we should always
strive to provide equal opportunity.

774
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,380
But people confuse that
with equal outcome.

775
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,790
When you have equal outcome that can
only be enforced through violence because

776
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,421
different people,

777
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,750
free people make different choices
and when they make different choices,

778
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:15,860
they have different outcomes.

779
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,270
If you don't let them suffer
the consequences of bad
choices or reap the rewards

780
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,710
from good choices, then you are forcibly
redistributing through violence.

781
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,170
It's interesting that there isn't.

782
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,220
There are no socialist working socialist
examples that exist without violence.

783
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,470
You basically need someone to
show up with a gun and say, okay,

784
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,260
you're not allowed to do that.
You hand this over to that person.

785
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,520
So one of the reasons why this podcast
is because I believe everybody can be

786
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:44,270
wealthy. Everybody. It's not a zero
sum game. It is a positive sum game.

787
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,070
You create something brand new,

788
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,380
you exchange with me for
something brand new I've created,

789
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:52,700
there's higher utility for both of us.
The some of the value created is positive.

790
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,640
It's not like status where
it's like you're higher up.

791
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,220
I'm lower down your presidents.
I must be vice president.

792
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,220
You're a plus one I'm a minus one.
It has to cancel the zero.

793
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,140
We should all be all for playing positive,
some ethical games.

794
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,160
The problem is because of these looters
who have ruined capitalism's name,

795
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,670
that then you get socialists coming in
and saying, burn the whole system down.

796
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,530
You burn the whole system down.

797
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:18,710
We end up like Venezuela or the
former Soviet Union, you know,

798
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,340
you don't want to be a fail socialist
states with Mac to teens hunting cats on

799
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:26,000
the streets to eat. Right.
That's literally what happens
in some of these places.

800
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,680
Uh, so I think it's very important not
to destroy the engine of progress that

801
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:34,340
brought us here. Yeah. The idea that
socialism just hasn't worked yet,

802
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,540
that it needs to the, we just need to
do it right. If we do it right, we can.

803
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,760
If you ever hundred a hundred
million dead and yeah.

804
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,820
Well let's keep trying all over the world.
Yeah.

805
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,690
And every single time it's implemented.
Yeah.

806
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,240
Have you ever had a conversation with
someone who's a socialist? Were we,

807
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,780
many times some of my better
friends are socialists. Really?

808
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,830
We really get into
that. Yeah. What is the,

809
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:58,160
I mean there's anyone have a
compelling perspective at all.

810
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,950
I think really socialism comes
from the heart, right? Y'All.

811
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,510
We all want to be socialist.

812
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,190
Capitalism comes from the head because
they're always cheaters in any system.

813
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,690
And there's incentives in any system.
So when you're young, if you're,

814
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:17,120
if you're not a socialist, you
have no heart. When you're older,

815
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,040
if you're not a capitalist,
you have no head, right?

816
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,950
You haven't thought it through.
So I understand where it comes from.

817
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,210
I always like Nassim Taleb framing on
this where he said, with my family,

818
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,620
I'm a communist with my close friends,
I'm a socialist. Uh, you know,

819
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:34,800
at my state level politics, I'm a Democrat
at, you know, higher levels. I'm a,

820
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,130
I'm a Republican. And that the federal
level and the Libertarian, right?

821
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,350
So basically the larger
the group of people,

822
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:44,430
you have mass together who have different
interests, the less trust there is,

823
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,490
the more cheating there is, the better
the incentives have to be aligned,

824
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:50,910
the better the system has to work.
The more you are towards capitalism,

825
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,960
the smaller the group you're in,
you're in a Kibitz you and you're a,

826
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,580
and you're in your house, you
in your tribe. By all means,

827
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:59,250
be a socialist with my aunts,
with my brother,

828
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:03,210
with my cousins and my uncles and
my mom. But family, I'm a socialist.

829
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,500
That's the right way to live. A
loving, happy, integrated life.

830
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,070
But when you're dealing with strangers,
I mean you want to be a real socialist.

831
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,380
Great. Open all your doors
and windows tomorrow please.

832
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,600
Everybody come take what you want.
See how that works out.

833
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,390
Yeah. Um, this idea of income inequality,

834
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,010
that always strikes me as a very,
it's a deceptive term.

835
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,600
Income inequality.

836
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,560
Well, let's flip it around. It
comes from outcome inequality. Yeah.

837
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,910
And the outcome inequalities there because
you made different choices. Now again,

838
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:36,610
going back, if it was because he
didn't have the same opportunities,

839
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:37,444
that's a problem.

840
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,610
So society should always
try to give people equal
opportunities. So for example,

841
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:43,870
instead of basic income,

842
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,200
what if we had a retraining program
built into our basic social fabric,

843
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:53,350
which said that every four years or
every six years or whatever it is,

844
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,250
maybe it's every 10.

845
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,290
You can take one year out and we'll
pay for you to go retrain completely.

846
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,130
And you can go into any profession you
like that has some earning power and

847
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,090
output,
uh,

848
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,320
hopefully a creative longterm profession
and you can reeducate yourself.

849
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,130
That would be much better for society on
all levels. Then basically just saying,

850
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,720
now you're going to be the
Dole for the rest of your life.

851
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,370
MMM.
Yeah.

852
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,310
Just you'd have to lead that horse
to water and then make them drink.

853
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,820
It requires people to put in some
effort. Yes. We can all just sit around.

854
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,540
It's just not well, that's my
perspective on income inequality.

855
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:30,290
There's always effort, inequality,
and thought inequality.

856
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,820
There's just certain
people that are obsessed.

857
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:35,030
And if those people become successful,
it doesn't mean they stole from you.

858
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,990
It just means that they put in the amount
of energy and effort that is required

859
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:40,040
to reach where they're at.

860
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,740
And there's a lot of Richard's signaling
that goes on now where people say, well,

861
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:46,580
it's cause you're privileged. You know
what the greatest privileges you're alive,

862
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,300
85% of humanities dead.
So how privileged are you then?

863
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:52,850
You're living in the first world. Then
you're, you know, you have four limbs,

864
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,800
et cetera.
So you can take that argument all the way.

865
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,180
It's kind of a nonsense discussion.

866
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:56,321
Well,

867
00:46:56,321 --> 00:47:00,660
it's a very weird progressive argument
and it as it pertains to a race is always

868
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:03,480
a weird one, right? Because
white privilege to me is,

869
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,220
although you could look at what
they're saying on paper, like yes,

870
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,840
yeah, I'm sure there's more black
people that are harassed by the police.

871
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:17,841
I'm sure there was more black people who
are treated suspiciously by shop owners

872
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,650
in the light. But the problem isn't
the people who aren't treated poorly.

873
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,220
The problem is the people
who treat the people poorly.

874
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,530
The problem is racism.

875
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:33,590
The problem is not people that didn't ask
to be born white or whatever they are,

876
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:35,740
and they don't get harassed that,

877
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:40,660
so this idea of white privilege or
male privilege or whatever it is,

878
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,570
that's not the problem.
You're,

879
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,380
you're just looking at someone who's
not a victim of this particular problem

880
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,520
that you're highlighting,

881
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,370
but you're not looking at the
perpetrators of the problem.

882
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,550
You're making people perpetrators by
simply existing and having less melanin in

883
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:58,420
their skin or having their answer

884
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,500
assessors come from that's
just racism by another.

885
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,820
It's another sneaky way being racist
and then they say you can't be racist.

886
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,780
It's not racist because you're white.
That's right. That is this hilarious.

887
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:10,610
If you can't be racist
against white people,

888
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,070
that one as a variation of the whole
still while I hit you argument, you know,

889
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,720
stop struggling while I'm hitting you,
but it's just so silly.

890
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:19,910
You've just completely
change what racism means.

891
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,120
What's hilarious is it mostly the people
who are yelling racist and not the

892
00:48:23,121 --> 00:48:27,170
minorities? What I look on my Twitter
or my social media or on my news,

893
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,330
it's white on white violence,
virtue signal.

894
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:34,130
It's white on white violence was
mostly going on is it's elitist whites,

895
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,700
blue state whites, college educated
whites beating up on high school,

896
00:48:37,701 --> 00:48:38,960
educated whites,
blue collar.

897
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:42,290
It's a white collar versus blue collar
war that's going on and the rest of us

898
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:44,180
are just kind of watching like,
oh, that's kind of interesting.

899
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,700
Well it's also a side effect of
the ability to broadcast, right?

900
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:51,880
Like everyone with a Twitter handle
has the ability to broadcast.

901
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:55,960
Everyone with a Facebook page has the
ability to pontificate and have these long

902
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:56,794
rambling,

903
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,100
these huge statements that people put
out when you read them. It's like,

904
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:06,200
how much time did you put in this and
what the fuck do you put that much time of

905
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:10,750
your kids or your job or your job or your
life or your future planning for your,

906
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,890
you know, how much do you work out
a day? I mean you just, these some,

907
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,080
I've read some people's Facebook posts.
I'm like,

908
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:20,890
this is a preposterous amount of effort
that you put in the saying virtually

909
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:21,610
nothing.

910
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,420
Let's see. Humans are being creative.
It's the Ai do that. Well that's true.

911
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,090
It is create. It's, it's okay.

912
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,740
Creative in a very odd way,
right?

913
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:33,890
Cause it's creative and that they're
trying to elicit a response from people in

914
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:38,450
there trying to raise their, their
social value or raise their position,

915
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:38,870
the social

916
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:39,590
totem pole.

917
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,200
It's signaling and it's easy signaling
because of the kind of thing that

918
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:44,870
everybody has to agree with you on it
because nobody wants to be seen as a

919
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:45,704
horrible person.

920
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,090
And it's a very hard to make the nuanced
arguments against than it is to just

921
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:50,924
kind of go along.

922
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:55,980
Right. Well it's also, it's, some of
it is so cliche that it seems like,

923
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,960
I know one guy who poses
as a woman on on Twitter,

924
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:05,070
but he does it just obviously,
what is the name?

925
00:50:05,071 --> 00:50:06,760
Tatiana Mcgrath

926
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,710
graph? Yes. Yeah. Used to
be Godfrey Elwick. Yes. Oh,
is that the same guy thing?

927
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,940
So yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah, I
did not. They killed his account.

928
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,960
They can't get the same one for that
hundred percent sure for pretending to be

929
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:21,880
trans racial. That's
right. They didn't leave.

930
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,930
He basically says all the crazy
stuff that people on the left say,

931
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:30,130
but he says the craziest yes. And kind
of just shows how it's okay to say it.

932
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:33,800
Like I think I saw a tweet from recently
just said or her that it's not okay to

933
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:38,340
be white. Yes. And then some people agree,

934
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,290
but it's,
it's so close to what they say.

935
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:47,530
It's so close that it's like the most
artful form of subtle parody because if

936
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,200
you replace in half of these things that
you replaced the word white with black

937
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:55,190
or Asian, what's the Lynch mob
descended on you? Yeah. It's,

938
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,330
it's a strange time in that respect
that there's a famous old saying,

939
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,160
if you want to see who rules over you
see who you are not allowed to criticize.

940
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,840
Mm, excellent. Yeah, that
is a, that's so true, right?

941
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,670
Yeah. That's so true. I wonder where
this is going. I really do. I'm,

942
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,320
I wonder because this is,

943
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:19,340
it seems like this new found ability
to broadcast that we have with,

944
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,280
whether you have a youtube page or
whether you have a Twitter or whatever,

945
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:23,030
you're doing,

946
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:28,030
this new found ability to spread whatever
you're trying to say to so many people

947
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:32,420
with very little understanding
on the most part,

948
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:36,010
from what it's actually a
great thing overall. Yeah.

949
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:40,080
It means that any human can broadcast
to any other human on the planet at any

950
00:51:40,081 --> 00:51:41,840
time. So, for example,

951
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:45,410
if you know a totalitarian dictator
where to come to power and someone was

952
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:46,120
beating up,
you know,

953
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,970
had fascist beating up an old women like
that would get broadcast out instantly

954
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,240
there would be an instant outrage, hue
and cry rallying. So in that sense,

955
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:56,540
it helps bring attention
to the plight of anybody.

956
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,890
But right now we're going through the
phase where we have this new found power

957
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:04,940
to assemble mops and people
don't know how to deal with that.

958
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:09,530
So it becomes very easy to set up
a mob and have it attack somebody.

959
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:12,260
Take all the context out.
Like even this conversation,

960
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:15,230
I'm sure people will take out snippets
to put him on social media and try and

961
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,680
get somebody's outraged. Of course.
Uh, and so you have to learn how it,

962
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,100
first of all, society just has to get
over to this idea of outrage. Like to me,

963
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:26,060
like outreach people are the people
who get easily outrage of the stupidest

964
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:29,310
people on social media. Those are
the people I block instantly. Uh,

965
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,440
it's just kind of very low level thinking,
right? These are the foot's off the,

966
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:33,980
these are the foot soldiers in the mob.

967
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,590
Eventually society just
has to get over it.

968
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,070
They have to understand that these are
all snippets being taken out of context.

969
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:41,510
These are doctored video clips.

970
00:52:41,511 --> 00:52:46,190
These are just someone who's trying to
get outraged over something. Eventually,

971
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:49,850
there'll also be anti mob
tactics. Like for example, if,

972
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,230
if I go to someone's Twitter feed and
all it is, it's full of political,

973
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,590
political, ranting, raving
conspiracy theories.

974
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,800
Do I want to work with this person
doing associate with this person?

975
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:04,460
Do want to be friends with this person?
Their mind is just cluttered with junk.

976
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,320
I don't necessarily blame them.

977
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:11,300
I think that the human brain is not
designed to absorb all of the world's

978
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:12,081
breaking news.

979
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:16,130
24 seven emergencies injected straight
into your skull with clickbait headline

980
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:20,360
news. If you pay attention to that
stuff, even if you're well meaning,

981
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,080
even if your sound of mind and body,
it will eventually drive you insane.

982
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,760
This is goes to clockwork
orange where he's, you know,

983
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,160
has his eyes opened up this
forced to watch the news.

984
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,000
But I think that's what's happening right
now because these are addictive, right?

985
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,750
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
these are weaponized.

986
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:40,920
You have social statisticians
and scientists and
researchers and people in lab

987
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:41,250
coats.

988
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,270
Literally best minds of our generation
and figuring out how to addict you to the

989
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:48,480
news and if you fall for it,
if you get addicted,

990
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,560
you're brain will get destroyed.
And I think this is the modern struggle,

991
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,790
like the modern struggle. So the ancient
struggle used to be the tribal struggle.

992
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,670
You had your tribe of friends and family,
you had your religion,

993
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,370
you had your country, you had
your loyalty, their nationality,

994
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,110
at least you had meaning and support.

995
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:08,040
But now you would struggle against other
tribes. Modern life, we're so free.

996
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,640
Everything's become atomized. We stand
alone. You live in your apartment alone,

997
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:14,000
you live in your house alone and
your parents don't live nearby.

998
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,490
Your friends don't live nearby.
You don't have any tribal meaning.

999
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:20,220
You don't believe in religion anymore.
You don't believe in country anymore.

1000
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,530
It's fine. You've got a
lot of freedoms, fantastic.

1001
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,280
But now when they come to attack you,

1002
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,670
you're alone and you can't resist.
So how do they attack you?

1003
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:32,460
It's all well meaning I don't fault
capitalism, I love capitalism.

1004
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,890
But look at how it happens.
Social Media,

1005
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,210
they've massaged all the
mechanisms to addict you,

1006
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:43,440
like a Skinner pigeon or a rat who's
just going to click, click, click, click,

1007
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:44,790
click camp,
put the phone down,

1008
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,940
the food they've taken
sugar and the weaponized it,

1009
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,270
they've put it into all these different
forms and varieties that you can't

1010
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:53,400
resist eating drugs,
right?

1011
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,930
They've taken pharmaceuticals and
plants and they've synthesize them.

1012
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,450
They've grown them in such a way
that you can't, you get addicted,

1013
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:03,480
you can't put them down point,
right? If you're a young male,

1014
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,530
you want to around the internet,

1015
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:08,550
it'll like SAP away your libido and
you're not going out in real life society

1016
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:08,821
anymore.

1017
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:12,690
Cause you've got this
incredibly stimulating stuff
coming at you video games,

1018
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:15,240
another way to Dick People.
So you have this,

1019
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,390
you have entire large factories of
people that are working to addict you to

1020
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:22,920
these things and you stand alone.

1021
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,640
So the modern struggle as an individual
is learning how to resist these things

1022
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:27,450
in the first place.

1023
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,640
Drawing your own boundaries and
there's no one there to help you.

1024
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,030
Oof. That's terrifying. I mean, it is,

1025
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,380
if we do road that needs to be
navigated by young people that are,

1026
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:42,640
there's no map, there's no
guidebook on how to handle this.

1027
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,330
Our generation is the
transition generation.

1028
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,270
I think our kids will know how to handle
it better cause they'll grow up with,

1029
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,123
I hope,
I hope.

1030
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,210
I hope too,

1031
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,410
because you're seeing some ridiculous
behavior from people today that's so

1032
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:57,990
common. I mean, I don't know if
you've been paying attention to this,

1033
00:55:57,991 --> 00:56:02,490
but there was a guy who,
he made a, uh, a video of,

1034
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:04,440
it turns out it wasn't even
him that made the video.

1035
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:05,460
At least that's not what he said.

1036
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:09,690
But it was a video where he sort
of doctored Nancy Polosi talking.

1037
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,250
It made it look like she was drunk.

1038
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,720
And then a bunch of people
retweeted it and like, oh my
God, look, she's drunk. And,

1039
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,940
and so one of the online
publications, uh, uh,

1040
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,320
some website tracked him down

1041
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
and doxed him and turned out he's just
a day labor who is an African American

1042
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:33,490
Trump fan.
And thought it would be funny to do that.

1043
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:36,460
And it turns out that he didn't even,
at least according to him,

1044
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,680
he actually just put it
up on his Facebook page.

1045
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,040
What's even more disturbing is Facebook
gave up his information to this website.

1046
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,910
Right. For what? Cause he made something
funny that made people seem drunk.

1047
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,100
There's a million of those about me.
I mean,

1048
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:56,101
you could find them mean I think Facebook
and Twitter and a bunch of these other

1049
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:59,860
social media platforms are committing
slow motion suicide through these kinds of

1050
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,290
activities.
That was a stunning one though,

1051
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:06,220
that they would give up this guy who's a
labor because he made a parody video or

1052
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:08,770
he made someone look foolish with editing.
Well,

1053
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:12,670
you now have basically the media views
it as their job to go after individuals

1054
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:15,850
they don't like. Yeah. I used media
with air quotes in that regard. Yes.

1055
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,210
I don't think this is something that
the New York Times would have done us

1056
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:21,400
anything responsible, but the media is
getting more and more desperate, right?

1057
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:23,500
Because what happened
was before the Internet,

1058
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,400
you could have two local newspapers in
every town and you could have two local

1059
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:30,460
news stations,
TV stations in every town.

1060
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,350
And then CNN came along and
started commoditizing the
news 24, seven broadcast,

1061
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,810
and then the internet came along.
And that was the final nail in the coffin.

1062
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,360
Because what the Internet did was it said,
actually,

1063
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:43,930
if there's a fact that's news,
you can distribute that immediately.

1064
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,850
It can go on Twitter,
it can go on Facebook.

1065
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:48,400
It gets reprinted and Google
news a thousand times, you know,

1066
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:51,640
you go on Google News, you're like, okay,
what's the piece of news? Which source?

1067
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:54,280
And 3000 other articles. Too many, right?

1068
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,710
So news has become commoditized.

1069
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,450
So the entire news media has shifted
into peddling opinions and entertainment.

1070
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:06,730
And so now they've become a variation
between like cheerleaders, shock troops,

1071
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:11,200
enforcers, uh, you know, talking
heads. So these are now tribal,

1072
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,950
these are not propaganda
machines signaling for their
tribes. It's a right wing.

1073
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:17,830
One is left wing one, right? There's
the alt right, there's a control left.

1074
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,980
And the two of them were just fighting
it out using their various media organs

1075
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:25,830
in memes. So basically when you see one
of these news organizations, doxing,

1076
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:30,280
an individual that's like a tank running
over a soldier, that's what's going on.

1077
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,260
It's just a war. And so there's
no, there's no such thing anymore.

1078
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,940
Less than neutral media commentator.
The,

1079
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,690
the illusion of objectivity
that journalism had is lost.

1080
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,190
There is no longer one guy,

1081
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:44,410
like a Walter Cronkite that
everyone's going to listen to.

1082
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,760
It's now the shock troops fighting wars
with each other. How does this play out?

1083
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:53,770
Have you thought about it? Yeah, a little
bit. Uh, so what the Internet does,

1084
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,210
a lot of this is internet driven.

1085
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:00,450
What the internet does is the Internet
creates one giant aggregator or two for

1086
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:05,980
everything. One taxi dispatcher, one
ecommerce store, one search engine,

1087
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:10,960
one uh, you know, one social
media site for friends and family,

1088
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:12,190
one for business,
et cetera.

1089
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,840
So the Internet is this giant aggregator
where it creates one big hedge Amman

1090
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,913
for everything.

1091
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:23,490
And it creates an atomized long tail of
millions and millions of individuals.

1092
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,580
What it gets rid of is the medium, medium
size ones in the middle. So for example,

1093
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:33,410
you might've had like seven
Hollywood studios. What's
Origami? Netflix. You had a,

1094
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:34,410
you know, like, uh,

1095
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,700
10 large ecommerce players had commerce
players from Walmart to Costco to,

1096
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:42,040
you know, Kmart and whatever. Nope,

1097
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,590
not just going to be Amazon and
a ton of small individual brands.

1098
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,810
So that's the world that
we're headed towards.

1099
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:50,330
One Hedge Amman and
millions of individuals.

1100
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:55,630
So we're ends up longterm is media
will be a few gigantic outlets.

1101
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,210
You know, it could be the New York Times,
it could be Facebook, a few like that.

1102
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,600
And there's going to be just a really
long tail of millions of independent

1103
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:05,910
people. So this idea of who is a
journalist and who's not, you know,

1104
01:00:05,911 --> 01:00:08,600
is a Sandra journalists are
not everyone's a journalist.

1105
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:13,070
That's the world that we're headed
towards. I do think that extreme power,

1106
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:17,540
the most powerful people in the world
today, and this is not well known,

1107
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,810
but the most powerful people in the world
today are the people who are writing

1108
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:24,390
the algorithms for Twitter and
Facebook and Instagram because they're

1109
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,940
controlling the spread of information.

1110
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,810
They're literally rewriting people's
brains. They're programming the culture,

1111
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:33,420
and they're doing it very subtly like
Google. I believe that, you know,

1112
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,820
one of their execs got up
in front of Congress and the
Congressmen asked him, uh,

1113
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,730
you know, do you manipulate
search results? And he said, no,

1114
01:00:40,731 --> 01:00:44,360
we do not manipulate search
results. Really, that's your job.

1115
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,630
That is literally all Google does.
Google has one job,

1116
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:50,970
which is to manipulate search results
to pull them out of the noise and rank

1117
01:00:50,971 --> 01:00:55,940
them properly. And the, the
precise algorithms of how
they do that is very hidden,

1118
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:59,510
very complex, but influences the
hearts and minds of everybody,

1119
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,930
including all the voters. Now, if Google,

1120
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:06,740
Facebook and Twitter had been smart about
this, they would not have picked sides.

1121
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,960
They would have said,
we're publishers,

1122
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,080
whatever it goes through our pipes goes
through our pipes. If it's illegal,

1123
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:15,080
we'll take it down, give us a court
order. Otherwise we don't touch it.

1124
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,190
It's like the phone company.

1125
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:19,520
If I call you up and I say something
horrible to you on the phone,

1126
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:20,810
the phone company doesn't get in trouble.

1127
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,660
But the moment they
started taking stuff down,

1128
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,030
that wasn't illegal
because somebody screen,

1129
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,010
they basically lost the right to be viewed
as a carrier and now all of a sudden

1130
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:34,790
they've taken on liability. So they're
sliding down the slippery slope into ruin,

1131
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,150
sloping to ruin where the left wants him
to take down the right, the right ones.

1132
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:41,870
And I take down the left and now they
have no more friends. They have no allies.

1133
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:45,290
Traditionally the libertarian leaning
Republicans and Democrats would have stood

1134
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:47,540
up in principle for the common carriers,
but now they won't.

1135
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,890
So my guess is as soon as Congress,
and this is, this day is coming,

1136
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:52,940
if not already here,

1137
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:57,080
it might even been here today actually
because you saw something related in the

1138
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,880
news.
The day is coming.

1139
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:04,180
When the politicians realize that these
social media platforms are picking the

1140
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:06,980
next president,
the next congressman,

1141
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,740
they are literally picking and
they have the power to pick.

1142
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,790
So they will be controlled by
the government. In what way?

1143
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,260
How do you think they're
going to be controlled?

1144
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,500
We think they're going to have to adhere
to strict principles of freedom of

1145
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,334
speech. Now, no,

1146
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,210
unfortunately is headed the
opposite direction, right? Yeah.

1147
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,090
I wish it was freedom of speech.
Uh,

1148
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,630
much more likely they're going to
be in the short to medium term.

1149
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:30,690
They're going to be hauled
in for hearings. Uh, they're
going to be pressured,

1150
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:32,280
massively do this,
don't do that.

1151
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,880
My concern about that is the
hearings that I saw with Zuckerberg,

1152
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,750
those people were completely incompetent.
They are and seem to understand them.

1153
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,430
They don't, but they're just applying
pressure. They just trying to scare him.

1154
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:44,310
So he'll do what they want.
And what do they want them to do?

1155
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,050
They want them to basically suppress
the other side. So if you're right wing,

1156
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:50,760
you want to suppress the
left wing for left doing.

1157
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:51,840
You want to suppress the right wing.

1158
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,560
And if you just see where these companies
are headquartered in Silicon Valley,

1159
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,170
um, all the sensors, and
that's really what they are.

1160
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,140
There are sensors working inside
these companies that are just called,

1161
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,200
they're called by different
names obviously, right?

1162
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,270
Doublespeak you call it the department
defense wants the Department of war.

1163
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,700
So in this case,
the Department of safety and trust,

1164
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,170
when really it's the
department of censorship,

1165
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,090
the sensors are inside Silicon Valley.

1166
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:14,190
So it's going to reflect
Silicon Valley's politics,

1167
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,540
which is extremely progressive.
Left ring. And if you're not that,

1168
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,700
you really have no place.
There's, that's right.

1169
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,020
Try being a conservative and open
conservative at Google. Good Lord.

1170
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:28,470
Now you get lynched. Yeah,
that's crazy. I mean,

1171
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,500
I don't think that there was ever a thing
like that that was so influential and

1172
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:40,020
so politically, ideologically
one sided. Yeah. There's a,

1173
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:42,570
there's a little saying on the Internet
thing. It's called conquest law,

1174
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:46,460
that any organization that's
not explicitly left right
wing eventually becomes

1175
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,890
left wing.
And I don't know why that's true,

1176
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,170
but it does seem to me to be true.
What's a,

1177
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:55,200
it's a fascinating battle that's going
on right now. I mean, it really is.

1178
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:56,550
And conservatives in,

1179
01:03:56,551 --> 01:04:01,110
in as far as social media is concerned
that they're just getting chopped off at

1180
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:05,050
the Hams left and right. Yeah. What
will eventually happen is that, uh,

1181
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,440
whenever you suppress speech,
the organism metastasizes,

1182
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,840
then it has to start
turning towards other means.

1183
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,690
If you're unlucky goes towards violence,
uh,

1184
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,790
if you're lucky they find other outlets.
Uh,

1185
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,480
I think what will happen is we will
start creating decentralized media that's

1186
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:24,680
not owned by any single entity that
can't be suppressed or shutdown.

1187
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,260
That will then start spreading
these various things and
that will take the place

1188
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:31,740
of Twitter or Facebook or whatever, but
it's going to take 10 years, 20 years.

1189
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:33,450
It's not overnight. Well, uh, you know,

1190
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,450
Twitter took 10 years to get to the
point where it's at this mess right now.

1191
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:41,540
But it was so interesting too to have
Jack Dorsey in to talk to him about where

1192
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:44,640
it's going, where you thinks is
going on in his own principles,

1193
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:48,540
which he believes that it's a fundamental
right and he believes that freedom of

1194
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:53,541
speech is something that we all should
have and that these platforms should

1195
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:58,140
essentially be like,
like utilities,

1196
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,350
like the electric company I think is
correct and he has the right vision.

1197
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,320
It's just he's in an organization
where the other individuals in the

1198
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,720
organization feel differently,
very differently.

1199
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,820
So the organization itself
can get hijacked and his
timeline for changing things,

1200
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:16,130
it's like it's decades. I mean, I don't,

1201
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,070
I shouldn't say decades.
I mean I was like,

1202
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,960
when do you think that something where
there was a park that was one idea of

1203
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,220
having an uncensored Twitter, like
one Twitter, that's the wild west.

1204
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:30,760
Like you can have regular Twitter or
you could try wild west Twitter like,

1205
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,450
well that that already existed
and that were called Gab. Yeah.

1206
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,840
Such as APP isn't even wild west Twitter
they did when when people, docs people,

1207
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,450
they remove things like
that. Yeah. I mean,

1208
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:45,070
I think there's certainly lines around
violence and reality that you don't want

1209
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:48,550
to cross. But yes, gab is closer
to free speech platform. Uh,

1210
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,950
but it's still not decentralized.
It can still get shut down.

1211
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,900
I can still get taken out. It's also
suppressed heavily. Yes. So there,

1212
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:57,840
and the people on there right
now are extremely right wing,

1213
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:59,980
so it's not a pleasant place
for someone like me to hang out.

1214
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,890
So that people that have been kicked off
of something. That's right. That's right.

1215
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,200
Try going over there and being moderate.

1216
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:08,260
Try going over there and there's no
room for you. Yeah, unfortunately,

1217
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:11,460
because I don't identify as any
party here, any creed, you know,

1218
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,490
it doesn't work for me.

1219
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:17,160
Does that a problem in silicon valley
when you don't identify as anything? Do,

1220
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:20,760
do you get pressure? It totally. It
used to be okay. It's not okay anymore.

1221
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,160
When was it? Okay. 10 years
ago I would say it was okay.

1222
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:27,250
And then you start seeing a shift.
Yeah. And now you have to pick sides,

1223
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:29,520
otherwise you'll automatically
the enemy real. Yeah.

1224
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:33,130
Struggle sessions and all that.
Okay. God struggle sessions.

1225
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:37,450
I'm exaggerating for effect,
but it definitely has that
oppressive feeling to it.

1226
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,650
Right. And you also have to be
politically outspoken. It can't,

1227
01:06:40,651 --> 01:06:43,300
it can't be something that you
just stay neutral about. Right.

1228
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:44,710
It's like when a Tim Ferriss,

1229
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:47,740
I think at some point put out a tweet
about how you can't just say anything

1230
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:48,580
anymore and you know,

1231
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:51,910
people are being suppressed and a whole
bunch of people who allowed them from

1232
01:06:51,911 --> 01:06:54,280
Silicon Valley pilot and said,
what is it that you can't say?

1233
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:56,500
What are you afraid to say? You can
say whatever you want him. Go ahead.

1234
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:01,540
What are you afraid of? Like baiting.
Yeah. Yeah. What was he trying to say?

1235
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,040
Wow.
We have to put them in that box.

1236
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,890
One is someone who was thinking
about saying something he
shouldn't have said it.

1237
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:09,400
Exactly. Now we know one great tweet
us was, you know, the left one,

1238
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:13,360
the culture wars and other just driving
around shooting the survivors. Wow.

1239
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,010
That's hilarious. Yeah. I wonder,
uh, I wonder who as has one,

1240
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:18,611
the cultural war,

1241
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:22,210
the certainly a battle that's
been one in terms of like control,

1242
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:25,390
social media control,
social media is absolutely laughable,

1243
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:28,780
but this is unfortunate for conservatives,

1244
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:31,660
but technology is a force
that also pushes left.

1245
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,850
So if you look all
throughout human history,

1246
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,480
like the left essentially grows and
grows and grows, right? Why is that?

1247
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:40,930
Why is it an extra believe that
as some commentators have said,

1248
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,020
Leviathan slouches left, right? For
the Leviathan is the government,

1249
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:45,340
why does it smell?
She left?

1250
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:48,220
And I think a lot of that has
been because of technology.

1251
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,480
Technology has made it so that it
makes more like industrial revolution

1252
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,660
technology. We all band together,
awards awarded the state, right?

1253
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:59,230
Contraception is a technology
that kind of helps lean leftward.

1254
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,830
It takes away from the family unit.
Abortion is a technology, right?

1255
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:05,470
It wasn't possible thousands of years ago.
Um,

1256
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:08,440
so technology actually
empowers the individual.

1257
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:11,890
The individual means that you have
the breakdown of family structure and

1258
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:14,110
religion and all that.
And I'm not necessarily opposed to that,

1259
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,980
but it does mean that there's

1260
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,180
a leftward shift to it.

1261
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,200
Now we're getting a small
set of technologies that
actually can take you more,

1262
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:22,160
right word,
uh,

1263
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:25,970
encryption as an example
because the encryption makes
it easier to have privacy.

1264
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:30,440
It makes it easier to have money that
is outside of the state. Um, guns,

1265
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:34,310
three d printing of guns and example of
a technology that is more of a rightward

1266
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:38,240
shift. Um, but generally
technology leads the world left.

1267
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,491
Yeah.

1268
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:44,491
It's also usually highly educated people
that are involved in technology in the

1269
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:49,750
first place. And I think when you
look at universities in particular,

1270
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:52,570
they tend to lean left
in this country as well.

1271
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:57,580
Well, universities, uh, what happened
with the university is very interesting.

1272
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,370
Universities first one, you know,
became the arbitrators of, uh,

1273
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:05,170
data, intellectual ism, and
know what's right and wrong.

1274
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,410
So that the time period when it was like,
should we be doing that or not? Well,

1275
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:10,420
let's look at the university.
What do they have to say?

1276
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:13,900
What are the smartest people, the
professors that think tanks have to say?

1277
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,980
And the universities got this,
this credibility from the hard sciences.

1278
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,680
So they got this from a,
you know,

1279
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:25,300
physics and math and computer science
and chemistry because these deliver real

1280
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:30,190
things. The Manhattan project,
the microprocessor, the
space vehicles and so on,

1281
01:09:30,191 --> 01:09:31,120
the electric car.

1282
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:36,190
So they gained this mantle of authority
and legitimacy from the hard sciences.

1283
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,960
So then come the social
sciences kind of sneaking.

1284
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:42,940
Then you get economy economics and
microeconomics is a real discipline,

1285
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:47,560
real science, real math behind it, logic
reason. And then you get macro economics,

1286
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:49,570
which can be politicized
a little bit more voodoo.

1287
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:52,810
And then you get social studies and then
you get gender studies and then you get

1288
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,370
blah blah blah blah blah,
blah, blah, blah blah.

1289
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:59,800
And so what happened is that because we
took scientists to be the high priests

1290
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:05,050
of our new world, science itself has
gotten corrupted and the social sciences,

1291
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:06,620
and you can tell they're
fake scientist because they,

1292
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:10,780
the word science tacked on at the end
have come in and hijack the universities

1293
01:10:10,781 --> 01:10:12,190
and become the new think tanks.

1294
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:17,850
And so essentially what you see going
on today in the universities is a war

1295
01:10:17,891 --> 01:10:20,200
between the social sciences
in the physical sciences.

1296
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,080
And the crossover point is biology,
right?

1297
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:26,380
Where you can see like the whole gender
is a social construct movement is

1298
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:30,640
attacking biology and
evolutionary biology. Um, just
like in the social sphere,

1299
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:32,140
they're coming after the comedians.
Right.

1300
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:35,440
But you can see the struggle going on
in the universities and I would say the

1301
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:38,140
physical sciences are
essentially losing that war.

1302
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:42,790
What can be done? Or is it just
something that has to play out? Is it,

1303
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,320
do we have to realize the consequences
of the foolishness and the good news of

1304
01:10:46,321 --> 01:10:50,360
the physical sciences have a
reality on their side? Yeah.

1305
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:54,560
But it's not even, I mean, in
many ways it's not respected.

1306
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,520
Yeah. But at the end of the day, you're,
your aircraft still has to fly. Uh,

1307
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,500
you know, you're a microprocessor
still has to compute.

1308
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,480
So there's only so far they can, they can
take it. Uh, but I do see, for example,

1309
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:07,231
in biology,

1310
01:11:07,231 --> 01:11:10,380
a lot of biologists are facing this
difficult thing where they have to say

1311
01:11:10,381 --> 01:11:13,500
things that they know are not
true to keep their job. Like, Oh,

1312
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:17,800
you had Bret Weinstein on here. Right. So
that's a, that's a clear example. So it,

1313
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,870
there's just the crossover line of what
is acceptable and what's not is entering

1314
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:25,550
into biology and biology will
probably suffer the most. Um,

1315
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,770
synthetic biology for
example. Uh, will, you know,

1316
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:32,070
a lot of this will end up in
China, um, because it won't be,

1317
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,110
you won't be able to map facts
and reality and actions together.

1318
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,250
You won't be able to get grants.

1319
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,910
He won't be able to get the
adulation of your peers. Um, I don't,

1320
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:44,010
I don't know enough here's
the nom and shaky territory,

1321
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:47,610
but it's just my sense that that
crossover battleground right now as an

1322
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:51,060
evolutionary biology economics lost.
Well,

1323
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:55,110
it certainly in terms of gender
in the, that, that sort of,

1324
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,020
that seems to be one of the
major battlegrounds. Yeah.

1325
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,800
I mean, it's also going to happen if
we have a blank slate theory, you know,

1326
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,300
are we nature or are we an immature?
Um,

1327
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:07,570
it's kind of a socially
unacceptable to say that, you know,

1328
01:12:07,571 --> 01:12:10,240
a lot of it is in nature and
not nurture or vice versa.

1329
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:14,290
Depending on which side you're on.
Those kinds of discussions get corrupted.

1330
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,300
They do get corrupted.
Yeah.

1331
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,590
It's really unfortunate because that's
an unbelievably important thing to

1332
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:22,680
understand.
Like what makes a person a sociopath?

1333
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:27,170
What makes a person a super
successful person, a winner. Right?

1334
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:30,930
But what makes a person a drug addict?
What, what are, what are these factors?

1335
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:35,160
You can't have a reasonable conversation
about climate science anymore. Right?

1336
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,720
It's not a science, it's all
politicized. You can't even bring it up.

1337
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,370
Everyone's got their
minds made up already.

1338
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,221
Well,
it's,

1339
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:43,820
what's uncomfortable to me is people
have their minds made up and they don't

1340
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:44,470
even have it.

1341
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:46,680
Yeah. Well, on most of these topics,

1342
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:49,770
people are talking past each other anyway
and talking about different things.

1343
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:54,390
Like when you get into, uh, you know,
when you, when you get into gun control,

1344
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:55,590
for example,
right?

1345
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,130
One side is talking about the right to
bear arms in case I to radical ruler king

1346
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,130
tried to take over the
country the other time.

1347
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,560
The other side is talking about
school shootings and you know,

1348
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:07,050
protecting people in their homes,
right from crime.

1349
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,120
So they're just talking about
two different things, right? Uh,

1350
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,800
and it's just not politically acceptable
to even talk about the same thing.

1351
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:18,210
Or when you get to immigration, the
Wright is talking about, uh, you know,

1352
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,280
uh, the, the,

1353
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,860
the left is like bundling together
illegal immigration and legal immigration

1354
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,740
into one thing, right?
Whereas in the, on the right,

1355
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,010
sometimes you got racist siting in there
so it doesn't help their cause. Right?

1356
01:13:29,011 --> 01:13:30,330
They're talking about
two different things.

1357
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,010
If they were talking about the same thing,

1358
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:35,520
which is how many immigrants should
we let into the country and you know,

1359
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:37,080
what are the criteria for that?

1360
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,200
That would be a very different
conversation than no immigrants are.

1361
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:42,960
Everybody comes in. And then
also on the left, you know,

1362
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:46,670
you had this benefit that everybody who's
currently coming in illegally is going

1363
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:48,780
to vote for the left because of
where they're coming from and their

1364
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:51,220
socioeconomic circumstances.
Um,

1365
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,360
to me the test of any good system is
you build a system handed over to your

1366
01:13:56,461 --> 01:13:59,190
enemies to run for the next decade.
So for example,

1367
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,680
if you want a censorship
on Twitter or Facebook,

1368
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,980
you should build that system and then
hand it over to the other side to run.

1369
01:14:04,981 --> 01:14:07,980
So if you're a left winger
who is promoting a censorship,

1370
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:12,100
let somebody else running. Same with
immigration. If you immigration system,

1371
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:15,880
build the system then handed over to the
other side to run in there. So, you know,

1372
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:16,714
it's a good system.

1373
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,830
There's no room for nuance when you're
dealing with these political battle

1374
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,530
grounds, when, when you're
dealing with right versus left.

1375
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:28,531
And one side has a clearly established
stance that you're supposed to take.

1376
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,820
Like gun control is a great example
of that, right? There's no room for,

1377
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,740
what about mental health?

1378
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:40,180
What about the fact that so many of these
people are on psych medication, right?

1379
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:43,960
What, why is that not being discussed?
You're running one of the greatest, uh,

1380
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:48,810
mental health experiments in history when
we're building great buddy up in Sris

1381
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,360
and maybe you get 30 million people
Sris maybe like 29.9 million are a lot

1382
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:58,990
happier and then you have a fraction
that commit suicide or detonate. Yeah.

1383
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:03,550
You're basically trading the mean for the
variants. You have blow up risk. Yeah.

1384
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:07,060
There's no room for nuance, which is
why I stay out of politics. Largely.

1385
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,210
Do they drag you in though?
Sometimes. I always try.

1386
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:12,100
I mean even conversations conversation
you get to get dragged in,

1387
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,750
but I'm sure there's
going to be some people.

1388
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:18,400
Here's the thing about politics because
there we have a first past the post

1389
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:22,020
system. What that means is that whoever
wins 51% of the vote in this country,

1390
01:15:22,021 --> 01:15:23,800
he gets a lot of the power,
right?

1391
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,790
It's not like proportional representation
where the Greens have 10% and you know

1392
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,350
libertarians of 3% or whatever.

1393
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:31,900
It's just like you're all Democrat
in power now are all Republican.

1394
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:37,150
Because of that, to win, you have to pick
one of these two sides, right? You have,

1395
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:41,080
you have to choose. You can't just, you
can't just, you can't just basically say,

1396
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:44,260
I'm going to be, uh, you
know, nuanced about it.

1397
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,080
You can't vote for third party to
throwing away your vote, right?

1398
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,340
I have a friend who's tried to fix that.

1399
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:51,080
He started this thing called a good party
where like, you kickstart your vote.

1400
01:15:51,081 --> 01:15:53,560
So you combine all your votes,
you hold them in reserve,

1401
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,220
and then when you have enough to win,
then you vote that person in power, right?

1402
01:15:57,221 --> 01:16:00,130
You don't, you don't throw away your
boat. But outside of those hacks,

1403
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,950
we're never going to get a third
party get elected. So because of that,

1404
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:06,250
all of your beliefs have to neatly
fit into the Democrat bundle,

1405
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,140
other Republican bundle. And so
when you get into that tribe, uh,

1406
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,990
if you signal outside of that tree,
out of that bundle, you get attacked.

1407
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:18,310
So it's literally,
it's making you into an unclear thinker.

1408
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,990
It's making you into a muddle thinker.

1409
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,890
If all of your beliefs line
up into one political party,

1410
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,150
you're not a clear thinker.

1411
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:28,180
If all your beliefs are the same
as your neighbors and your friends,

1412
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:30,680
you're not a clear thinker.
You're literally just your beliefs.

1413
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:32,830
They're socialized,
they're taken from other people.

1414
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:36,730
So if you want to be a clear thinker,
you cannot pay attention to politics.

1415
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:38,410
It will destroy your ability to think.

1416
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,010
But what dread
most of modern life,

1417
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,120
all our diseases are
diseases of abundance, not
diseases of scarcity, right?

1418
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:53,170
All Times I may have starved. Uh, I'm,
you know, all times if I've got sugar,

1419
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:55,900
that was a wonderful thing. I should've
eaten all the sugar to get my hands on.

1420
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,200
If I got an a piece of news or gossip
that was interesting data that would have

1421
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:01,330
helped my life and move me forward.
Um,

1422
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:04,120
if I had gotten some brief
amount of entertainment,

1423
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:07,390
whether through video games or magazines
or whatever, that would have been good.

1424
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:11,690
Now it's all diseases, abundance.
We are overexposed to everything.

1425
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,470
So the way to survive in modern
society is to be an ascetic.

1426
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,220
It is to retreat from society. There's
too much society everywhere you go,

1427
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:22,130
society and your phone, society in
your pocket, society in your ears,

1428
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,190
you're being socialized right
now by listening to this podcast.

1429
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:27,470
We're socializing.
You were programming you.

1430
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:31,460
Everyone's trying to program everybody.
The only solution is to turn it off.

1431
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:35,150
The only solution is to turn it off
and concentrate on your breathing.

1432
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:40,850
Meditation. Yeah, I, yes, it works.
It's, it's been a lifesaver for me. Oh,

1433
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:44,060
I do it and I do it whenever
I get like spare time.

1434
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:46,430
I was at the doctor's
office this morning and uh,

1435
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:47,750
I knew it was going to be 20 minutes,

1436
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:51,560
so I just sat there with my eyes closed
for 20 minutes and I meditated. You know,

1437
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:55,250
when I was growing up, there was this
statement, I think it was pascal. He said,

1438
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,540
you know,

1439
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:59,510
all of man's problems arise because he
cannot sit by himself in a room for 30

1440
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:03,230
minutes alone. And it's very true.
I always needed to be stimulated.

1441
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:08,180
And when the iPhone came along, boredom
was dead. I would never be bored again.

1442
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:11,360
If I'm standing in line, I'm on my
iPhone and I thought it was great.

1443
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,420
And when I was a kid I used to try
and over clock my brain be like,

1444
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:16,820
how many thoughts can I think at once?
The answer is only one.

1445
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:19,010
But I would try to like think
multiple thoughts at once.

1446
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:22,130
And I was proud of that as proud
that my brain was always running.

1447
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:25,130
This engine was always
moving and it's a disease.

1448
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,670
It's actually the road to misery.
And now that I'm older,

1449
01:18:28,671 --> 01:18:32,720
I realize that you actually want to again,
rest your mind.

1450
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,580
You want to learn how to
settle into your mind.

1451
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:38,450
And now I look forward to solitary
confinement. You leave me alone for a day,

1452
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:40,350
it'll be like the happiest
day I've had in a while.

1453
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:44,330
And that is a super power that
I think everybody can attain.

1454
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,430
The superpower of learning to be
alone and enjoying it. Yeah. Yeah.

1455
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,220
Well I think it's critical and I,
and I do think that this, this,

1456
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,690
these times where you
just think about things,

1457
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:00,830
just be alone and think about
things are so rare these days.

1458
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:06,340
And I think during those rare times is
when you really get to understand what

1459
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:10,910
you actually believe or don't
believe. Yeah. It's, it's funny,

1460
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:14,330
when I first started meditating, it was
really hard, right? Cause everybody,

1461
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,060
I think a lot of people who are
listening to the broadcast ever heard of

1462
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:20,480
meditation that has a good reps.
Everybody tries it, they struggle,

1463
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:23,960
they kind of give it up. It's one of
those things that everybody says they do,

1464
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:27,410
but nobody actually does. Right.
It's like not eating sugar. Right.

1465
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,930
Everyone talks about how, yeah, I
don't need sugar with like, yeah,

1466
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:33,080
then then the dessert tray rolls around
and everyone's going for the cookies.

1467
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:36,500
Yup. Right? Yup. So it's become
one of those things and in fact,

1468
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:38,960
it's not even become a signaling
thing where it's like, oh,

1469
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:41,750
how much did you meditate? I
meditated this much. Right. You know,

1470
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:43,970
there are people now wearing
headbands saying with tweety,

1471
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:46,310
birds Chirp and then when they're
in deep meditation, I don't know,

1472
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,350
I don't know how they make it work,
but they'll be like,

1473
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:51,470
I got a lot of trips today. How many
trips did you get? Oh right. Oh,

1474
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:53,630
you're a meditation technique
is wrong when it's right,

1475
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:57,710
but really all it is is the
art of doing nothing. Okay.

1476
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:02,480
And it's important because I think
when we, when we grow up, right,

1477
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:06,410
it's all this stuff happening to you
in your life and some of it you're

1478
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:11,010
processing some of ear absorbing and
some of it you should probably think a

1479
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:13,740
little bit more about and work through,
but you don't, you don't have time.

1480
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:17,160
So it gets buried in you and it's all
of these preferences and judgments and

1481
01:20:17,161 --> 01:20:20,460
unresolved situations and issues
and it's like your email inbox,

1482
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:24,210
it's just piling up email after email
after email that's not answered going back

1483
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,870
10 2030 40 years.
And then when you sit down to meditate,

1484
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:30,300
those emails start coming back at
you. Hey, what about this issue?

1485
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:32,700
What about that issue? Have you
solved this? Did you think about that?

1486
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:36,420
Your regrets there,
you have issues there and that gets scary.

1487
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:39,720
People don't want to do that. Like it's
not working. I can't clear my mind.

1488
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:43,410
I better get up and not do this. But
really what's happening is it's, it's,

1489
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:44,640
it's self therapy.

1490
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:47,670
It's just that instead of paying a
therapist to sit there and listen to you,

1491
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:50,430
you're listening to yourself
and you just have to sit there.

1492
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,170
As those emails go through one by one,

1493
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:56,040
you work through each of them until you
get to the magical inbox zero and there

1494
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,900
comes a day when you sit down,

1495
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:00,450
you realize the only thing is you're
thinking about or things that happen

1496
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:02,790
yesterday because you've
processed everything else.

1497
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,050
Not necessarily when resolve that,

1498
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:08,190
but at least listen to yourself and
that's when meditation starts and I think

1499
01:21:08,191 --> 01:21:08,610
it's a,

1500
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,730
it's a very powerful thing that everybody
should experience and that's when you

1501
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:14,160
arrive upon the art of doing nothing.
Well,

1502
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,370
I think it's even a problem that most
people are getting their meditation from

1503
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:20,470
an APP. I will not use an APP. It's key.

1504
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,040
I mean Sam Harris was a very good
meditation. Now I should say that,

1505
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,850
but you should be able to
just do it and many people,

1506
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,430
it is literally the art of doing nothing.

1507
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:33,480
So all the initiative for meditation
is just sit down, close your eyes,

1508
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:36,360
comfortable position, whatever happens,
happens. If you think you think,

1509
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:38,490
if you don't think you don't think,
don't put effort into it,

1510
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:40,530
don't put effort against it all you need.

1511
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,410
Do you concentrate on your breath or do
you have a specific nothing, nothing.

1512
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:48,300
Now you just said, he just said, I
think about my breath. That's all I do.

1513
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:52,350
I just to try to only concentrate
on breathing. I used to do that,

1514
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:55,020
but at some level,
all the concentration,

1515
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,780
every meditation technique is
leading you to the same thing,

1516
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:02,730
which is just witnessing and concentration
is a technique to still your mind

1517
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:05,520
enough that you can then drop
the object of concentration.

1518
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:08,430
So you could also just try
going straight to the end game.

1519
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,940
The problem with what I'm talking about,
which is not focusing on your breath,

1520
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,870
is you will have to listen to your mind
for a long time. It's not going to work.

1521
01:22:15,871 --> 01:22:19,770
Let's do at least an hour a
day and preferably at least
60 days before you kind

1522
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:22,530
of worked through a lot of issues,
so it will be held for awhile,

1523
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,270
but when you come out the other side,
it's great.

1524
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,280
You get rid of the chatter or when the
chatter comes, it's in the background,

1525
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:33,520
it's dimmer, it's smaller. You've heard
it before. You see the patterns. Uh,

1526
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,240
it's more recent. It's something
you need to resolve any way.

1527
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:40,980
And you will get moments of
actual silence. What is your,

1528
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,280
what's your ultimate
state when you meditate?

1529
01:22:44,281 --> 01:22:48,630
Like is there a state where
you've achieved rarely if ever,

1530
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,330
where you just, you, you are,

1531
01:22:51,331 --> 01:22:55,230
you're in bliss or you're in
harmony or urine enlightenment.

1532
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:59,000
Like whether it's kind of,
it's kind of indescribable, uh,

1533
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,310
because when you're really
meditating, you're not there.
When there's no thoughts,

1534
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:06,850
there's no experience, there's nothing,
there's just nothing. Uh, so it's,

1535
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,640
it's hard to describe, but
I would say that, uh, it's
like, uh, you can definitely,

1536
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:16,480
every psychedelic state that
people encounter in using
so called plant medicines

1537
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:19,060
can be arrived at just
through pure meditation.

1538
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,160
And I've definitely hit
some of those states.

1539
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:25,690
You've hit some transcendent psychedelic
states where you're anticipating the

1540
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:29,230
whole deal. Had trippy visuals. I've
had the kind of the lights and colors.

1541
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:32,530
I've had been the so called downloads.
I've had the realizations,

1542
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:37,180
I've had the bliss, I've had the light
of the colors, but not every time. No,

1543
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:39,670
it's really an in fact I would say that,
that that's uh,

1544
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,340
that's also like an experience
that you can start craving,

1545
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:46,770
which will then actually take you out
of meditation. Um, where you really, I,

1546
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:50,080
and I'm not enlightened or anything
close to it, so not even the Ballpark,

1547
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:54,700
but my own experience and this is just
personal experience is the place where I

1548
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:57,790
ended up the most. That is
really the one that I, I,

1549
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,650
I want to be at his peace.
Just peace. Peace, happy.

1550
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,840
Yeah. Peace. To me,

1551
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:08,650
peace is happiness at rest and
happiness is kind of piece in motion.

1552
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,410
You can convert peace to
happiness anytime you want,

1553
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,590
but pieces what you want most of the time.
That's interesting.

1554
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:18,790
You can convert peace to
happiness and time you want. Yeah.

1555
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,730
If you're a peaceful person,
anything you do will be happy activity.

1556
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,170
And by the way,
being on social media,

1557
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,570
engaging in politics will not bring you
peace. There's nothing less peaceful.

1558
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,520
Right.
And today's Day and age,

1559
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:34,540
the way we think you get peace is by
resolving all their external problems.

1560
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,610
But there's unlimited external problems.

1561
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:40,300
So the only way to actually get pieces
on the inside by giving up this idea of

1562
01:24:40,301 --> 01:24:44,380
problems, who thinks you can get piece
by resolving external problems other than

1563
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:47,710
politicians, everybody. That's what
everybody is struggling to do. Right?

1564
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:51,280
Why are you trying to make money to solve
all your money problems while you're

1565
01:24:51,281 --> 01:24:52,300
trying to win it politics?

1566
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:54,750
Cause then you'll be at peace
because your people will have one.

1567
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,700
It's a daunting task to
get your shit together.

1568
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:04,780
It's easier to change yourself and
to change the world. That's true.

1569
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:08,430
And the best way to change the world is
to change yourself. Exactly. It's all,

1570
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:12,130
yeah, it's all these people who
are shouting on social media.

1571
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,850
The best way is just to actually live
the life that you want other people to

1572
01:25:15,851 --> 01:25:16,800
live.
Uh,

1573
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:21,000
like I went down to New Zealand and
there's this guy that I met with and uh,

1574
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:21,250
you know,

1575
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,280
everyone's on social media shouting
about environmentalism and conserve and

1576
01:25:24,281 --> 01:25:28,570
sustain. And I go to this guy's house
and he was doing a very quietly,

1577
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,670
very gently,
he was doing a two week long,

1578
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,510
a zero waste experiment where
he was throwing out nothing.

1579
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:39,280
So every package that he opened he would
keep and he would like clean it up so

1580
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:42,040
he could keep his Amazon boxes. You'd
keep the look and handed him a tea bag.

1581
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:45,740
If he opened a tea bag he has to figure
out how to compost the tea inside,

1582
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,440
how to make the tea itself useful,

1583
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:50,740
how to make the tea bag like a little
storage item so there was no trash.

1584
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:55,450
He was literally living with zero trash
waste and he was doing it and it was

1585
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:56,620
really inspirational.

1586
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,820
Meeting people like him made me far more
environmentally conscious than you know

1587
01:26:00,821 --> 01:26:03,350
any amount of people yelling at
me on social media ever will.

1588
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,380
How long did he do that for? I
think it was two weeks. It was hard.

1589
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:09,110
What the fuck are you
going to do with tea bags?

1590
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,390
He had quite the collection was
filling them with little things. Yeah.

1591
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:15,290
Sounds like you're crazy hoarder,

1592
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,980
like a hoarder person stacks a tea bags
in his house for a pretty impressive guy.

1593
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:23,030
Yeah, that's a strange way to go
about things. I, I appreciated that.

1594
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:24,050
I mean look,

1595
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:28,100
it is entirely possible to
somehow or another engineer,

1596
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:32,270
all of our cups and all of our things
and all are about to be biodegradable.

1597
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:37,830
If you know the struggle with the modern
environmental movement is that they

1598
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,460
identify the correct problem,
which is finite earth
spaceship. This is all we got.

1599
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:47,720
Don't ruin it. But they don't have the
solution. So what they say is no growth,

1600
01:26:47,721 --> 01:26:48,970
no growth,
no growth on.

1601
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:52,340
The problem is you got 3 billion Indian
and Chinese who aren't going to stay in

1602
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:54,680
poverty. They're going to grow
whether you like it or not.

1603
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:57,020
So you can yell at them,
you can scream at them,

1604
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:59,420
you can yell at us and scream at us.
But that's not going to happen.

1605
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:03,650
So the only way out unfortunately
is again, through technology,

1606
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,750
which is you have to
build green technology.

1607
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:09,440
And I give Musk a lot of credit for being
one of the few people who's out there

1608
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:10,274
trying to do that.

1609
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:14,330
So you build things that are biodegradable
and good for you and healthier and

1610
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:17,390
everybody wants to be healthier
in Chinese, want to be healthier.

1611
01:27:17,391 --> 01:27:20,120
India's want to be healthier, they
want to be cleaner. If you say,

1612
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,150
I can clean up your rivers,
I can clean up your forests,

1613
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:28,010
I can have your children not get sick
with cholera and diphtheria, typhoid,

1614
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,520
I can cure your diseases. That can
help make your immune system stronger.

1615
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,170
I can give you clean drinking water.

1616
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:36,200
Like that is what causes people
to become environmentalists,

1617
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,470
not shouting and screaming at them that
they shouldn't grow and they should stop

1618
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:42,950
pumping things into the sky. And you
know, they have no concept of that.

1619
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,270
They're just trying to get out of poverty.

1620
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:49,520
So I think the modern environmental
movement identifies the correct problem,

1621
01:27:49,521 --> 01:27:52,730
but then doesn't come up with the right
set of solutions that are appealing to

1622
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:55,490
people. People are not going
to give up economic growth.

1623
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:59,280
They're going to have to get
rich first. That's, yeah,

1624
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:03,710
that's a very good point. But how do
you do, how do, how do you do both?

1625
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,970
You lower the price of cre,
clean technologies massively.

1626
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,970
So you basically make clean technologies
cost competitive through subsidy

1627
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:14,420
technologies.
Innovation.

1628
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,200
Ideally you can subsidize in the short
to medium term until the innovation curve

1629
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:21,370
is crossed. I mean, like Tesla doesn't
have any patents, right? Right.

1630
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:25,160
Or they freely give away their patents.
That's an example of how you can do it.

1631
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:30,080
Um, so you know, someone, if you want
to get rid of plastic straws, yeah,

1632
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:32,990
you can do it here and there. You can
get San Francisco to ban plastic straws,

1633
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:35,150
but China's not going to
blend banned plastic straws.

1634
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:40,220
Not until you build a paper Straw that
is, you know, same cost, good durability,

1635
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:44,900
and then you in, and then you educate and
Chinese like, Hey, this is petroleum. Uh,

1636
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,420
you know, this plastic that you're doing
this patrolling. This is bad for you.

1637
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,920
Here's the chemical composition.

1638
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:51,740
Here's the things that are going in
your bloodstream. And they want healthy,

1639
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:55,310
happy kids also. So they going to
have their kids use paper straws.

1640
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,710
Maybe straws aren't the best
example, but you can, you know,

1641
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,500
this is true with fossil fuels, for
example, that's probably the best one.

1642
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:05,250
Or replacing a lot of plastics
with glass and paper and so on.

1643
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:09,860
Yeah, there's a new technology that was
just Rhonda Patrick cut in on her Twitter

1644
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:11,580
today about they're,

1645
01:29:11,581 --> 01:29:16,581
they're able to convert plastic waste
into fuel and that there's companies that

1646
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:21,680
are actively trying to do that now.
So then in that way,

1647
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:23,890
plastic waste will become valuable,
right?

1648
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:26,540
And then it'll become a commodity and
it becomes something that people are

1649
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:27,890
resource.
Now there's certain problem

1650
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:31,950
this doesn't solve, this doesn't solve
carbon, this doesn't solve deforestation,

1651
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:35,760
you know, so there you kind of have to
step in with other means. So for example,

1652
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:36,870
you look at the Amazon,
right?

1653
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,290
Everyone's complaining about the
Amazon being deforested. Well,

1654
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,140
you're not the poor Brazilian
farmer, right? Right. So you're,

1655
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:46,350
you're sitting here in your
comfortable chair, like social media,

1656
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:49,860
hammering away at, you know, the evil
Brazilians for deforesting, the Amazon.

1657
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:53,700
But the Amazon has incredible resources.
If we really care about it,

1658
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,710
we should turn it into an
incredible tourist park.

1659
01:29:55,711 --> 01:29:57,000
And put your money where your mouth is,

1660
01:29:57,001 --> 01:30:00,960
start doing ecotourism and the Amazon
started paying for it and then maybe take

1661
01:30:00,961 --> 01:30:03,930
the future rights for all
the pharmaceuticals that
are going to come out of all

1662
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:07,380
the incredible plants there and start
selling those off so that people,

1663
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,040
so that maybe give the pharmaceutical
companies and incentive to preserve the

1664
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:14,790
biodiversity in the Amazon. Say, Hey,
if you buy this patch of the Amazon,

1665
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:18,420
you consider that and you can serve it
whatever plant medicines that come out of

1666
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:19,590
there that you can then license,

1667
01:30:19,591 --> 01:30:21,870
you get the patent for 20
years or 30 years or whatever.

1668
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:26,610
So I think there are solutions where we
as the first world who have money can

1669
01:30:26,611 --> 01:30:31,611
put our money where our mouth is and go
and rescue these kinds of properties.

1670
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:33,510
That's a very interesting solution.

1671
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:36,270
But I could see immediate pushback
from people that don't think the

1672
01:30:36,271 --> 01:30:40,340
pharmaceutical companies should have
the rights to this natural plant or the,

1673
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:43,590
or the government does it and then the
government gets the patents and the

1674
01:30:43,591 --> 01:30:43,951
government,

1675
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:47,820
we'll auction off the patents later or
they'll worse or the license them or

1676
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:51,150
whatever it is. Right.
The often like just this,

1677
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,350
the often the problem is there
is no really good solution.

1678
01:30:55,590 --> 01:31:00,330
There's a bunch of solutions that
also have drawbacks. That's life.

1679
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:04,590
Yes. That's the trade offs
as being humans. Very messy.

1680
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,450
Yeah.
It's a constraint environment.

1681
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:10,600
Obviously I skew more towards a private
property capitalist type solutions

1682
01:31:10,601 --> 01:31:14,140
because even though they're not perfect,
they had been proven to actually work.

1683
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,890
Right. When something is your
property, you take care of it, right.

1684
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:19,930
You're not gonna, you're not going
to crap all over your own house. Um,

1685
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:23,200
but it should probably be temporary
property, not permanent property.

1686
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:25,570
You see a lot of countries in
the world and not doing this,

1687
01:31:25,571 --> 01:31:28,060
no foreign ownership of land thing,
for example.

1688
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:31,860
Or Mexico has no private
ownership of beaches. Right.

1689
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:33,640
So you can draw the
line at certain points.

1690
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,190
[inaudible] yeah.

1691
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,520
Do you enjoy doing this kind of thing
where you break things down and give your

1692
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:45,570
perspective on things and try to
illuminate certain complex objects?

1693
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,770
I'm not,
I'm not trying to eliminate so much as

1694
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:53,290
you know, talking to you.
I learn as much as I say,

1695
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:56,080
and I learned it from myself because
I'm being forced to articulate it.

1696
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:00,250
I can sit around and think my
thoughts all day, but it's a lot of,

1697
01:32:00,251 --> 01:32:02,200
it's going to be nonsense.
It's not, I'm going to,

1698
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:06,310
cause there are gaps in thinking where
you make leaps because you're kind to

1699
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:08,440
yourself that you don't
realize you're making.

1700
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,270
But when you're forced to write it down,

1701
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,630
and this is why I tweet or when
you have to talk to somebody,

1702
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,690
you have to complete those gaps
and make it a proper logical chain.

1703
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:20,380
And the mistake that I made
when I was young was, you know,

1704
01:32:20,381 --> 01:32:23,650
I always want to seem like the smartest
kid in the room. Uh, you know, like,

1705
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:26,200
just like you probably want to seem like
the funniest kid in the room where the

1706
01:32:26,201 --> 01:32:28,750
toughest kid in the room, right?
We're all losers starting out.

1707
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:29,620
We want to be winners.

1708
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:32,470
So we picked the thing we're good
at and we doubled down on it.

1709
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:35,290
So I always want to be the smartest
kid in the room. So what did I do?

1710
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,460
I read a lot of books,

1711
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,790
I memorize a lot of things and then
whatever I hadn't memorized as pre

1712
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:41,750
pre-google I made it up.
So that sounded good.

1713
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:46,570
Pre-Google after Google fact checking
started and I had to get better, right?

1714
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,680
So Google improve me that
way. A lot of people. Exactly.

1715
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:54,310
So now what I realize is that the
biggest mistake was memorization,

1716
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,940
right?

1717
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:58,870
Because when you're actually trying to
live your life in Congress with reality,

1718
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:03,700
you, you want to have a deep understanding
of what you do and why you do it.

1719
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:07,420
And so it's much more important to know
the basics really well there is to know

1720
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:09,820
the advanced.
Knowing Calculus wouldn't help you today.

1721
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:11,860
It doesn't help you in business,
doesn't help you in most things.

1722
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:14,290
But knowing arithmetic,
really what will help you really,

1723
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:17,920
whether it's at the corner grocery store
counting change to figuring out the

1724
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:19,540
value of your podcast business,

1725
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:22,300
to figuring out how to do the
probability math on you know,

1726
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:23,710
some action that you want to take.

1727
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:29,020
So understanding basic mathematics cold
is way more important than memorizing

1728
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:33,460
calculus concepts. And the problem is, and
this is true of, I think all reasoning,

1729
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:36,280
it's much better to know the
basics from the ground up.

1730
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:38,830
Solid Foundation of
understanding of steel frame,

1731
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:41,530
of understanding that it is
to just have a scaffolding.

1732
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:43,270
We just memorizing advanced concepts.

1733
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,450
This is why there are a lot of people I'm
sure that you listen to who are really

1734
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:50,560
smart. They use a lot of jargon and
you can't quite follow their reasoning.

1735
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,110
You don't know how they're putting
things together and you're this deep down

1736
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:57,330
suspicion. They don't even really
understand, right? So if you look at the,

1737
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,870
the the most powerful thinkers,

1738
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:01,630
especially the ones where
money or life is on the line,

1739
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:06,460
they have to understand the basics
really, really well. Richard Fineman,

1740
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:08,260
the famous physicist,
was able to,

1741
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:11,980
he had this piece in one of his lectures
where he takes you from counting

1742
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:16,900
numbers on your hand all
the way to calculus in four
pages of texts that orally

1743
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:20,620
but written down it's four pages of text
and it's a complete unbroken logical

1744
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:23,860
chain that takes you through
geometry, trigonometry, precalculus,

1745
01:34:23,861 --> 01:34:27,460
analytic geometry, graphs,
everything, all the way to calculus.

1746
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:31,990
He understood numbers at a core level.
He didn't have to memorize anything.

1747
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:35,590
When you're memorizing, it's an
indication that you don't understand.

1748
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:40,450
You should be able to read, derive
anything on the spot. And if you can't,

1749
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,313
you don't know it.

1750
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:46,210
So do you apply that to things other than
mathematics and everything? Everything.

1751
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:48,760
Everything. You don't even make
attempt to memorize things.

1752
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,300
Just make an attempt to understand them.
You can't help but memorize things.

1753
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:53,410
But if you can't,

1754
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:56,950
and this is where Twitter is great
for me as I try to understand,

1755
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,950
and then I tried to write it down in
such a way that I could remember it.

1756
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,700
Just the basic hook that'll point
towards the deeper understanding.

1757
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:08,000
And I'm forced to explain it to people
and that's how I know I understand

1758
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:09,710
something.
So this is what I meant originally.

1759
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:11,780
We talked about reading a good book.

1760
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:14,660
I'll read one page in the night and
then I'd spend the rest of the night

1761
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:15,494
thinking about it.

1762
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:20,000
Or I'm chasing down references and
Wikipedia or weird blog posts trying to

1763
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:23,330
understand it. Um, you
know, so for example,

1764
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:27,560
there was a, I was dealing
with, this is a few months back,

1765
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:31,520
I was dealing with a question of
stupid topic, but the meaning of life,

1766
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:36,290
right? Let's see. How could that be stupid
though? Well, it's trite, it's trite.

1767
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,460
You're not supposed to think about it.

1768
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:39,260
It's something you ask your
parents when you're young,

1769
01:35:39,261 --> 01:35:42,620
they tell you don't worry about it. Are
they still get the job? Exactly. Good job.

1770
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:45,200
You fricking hippie. Or here's God. God
is the meaning of life, right? Yeah.

1771
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,780
And so I was just trying
to resolve for myself.

1772
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:51,290
Like what could the answer be right?
Not what is the answer,

1773
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:54,380
but what could the answer be?
And so at a core level,

1774
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:57,890
I was forced to kind of hunting down
all these weird little things and really

1775
01:35:57,891 --> 01:36:01,070
understand for myself, and
it's gotta be personal, right?

1776
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:04,100
But as they established for myself
what it could and could not be,

1777
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,350
and that gave me some level of peace.

1778
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:09,590
So now I don't have to keep asking that
question of what is the meaning of why,

1779
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:14,250
uh,
I mean you,

1780
01:36:14,251 --> 01:36:16,610
you sh I think the question is
more interesting than the answer.

1781
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,170
Everyone should explore this on their own,

1782
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,020
but let me just explore a few
parts with you, right? Okay.

1783
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:23,780
So first is if I gave you an answer,

1784
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:27,290
if I said the meaning of life is to
please God. Well, which God, okay.

1785
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:30,290
Judeo Christian God. Well, okay,
why that one? Why this thing?

1786
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,970
The problem is it's a why question.
You can keep asking why forever, right?

1787
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,410
Any answer I give you, you'll just ask
why again? Why again, again, that's right.

1788
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:43,280
And you end up in a place
called a grip as trilemma. Okay.

1789
01:36:43,281 --> 01:36:46,970
This is a philosophical exercise,
but I kind of thought it through.

1790
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:50,900
Then Google around and there's a thing
called a grip as trilemma and a grip was

1791
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:54,050
trauma says that any
questioning like this,

1792
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,740
why will always end in
one of three places. Okay?

1793
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:01,400
First is infinite regress,
right? Why? Because of this,

1794
01:37:01,401 --> 01:37:05,630
why that and just keep going forever.
The second is circular reasoning. Well,

1795
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:09,860
a why a cause? It'd be, well, why beat
because of a fight to get trapped in that.

1796
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:13,700
Or the third is an axiom and
the most popular axiom is God,

1797
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,970
but it could be anything cause of math
because the science, because the big bang,

1798
01:37:16,971 --> 01:37:19,130
because the simulation,
right? These are all axioms.

1799
01:37:19,131 --> 01:37:20,720
These are all just stopping points.

1800
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:24,740
Saying simulation we're in a simulation
or saying is the big bang is just

1801
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:27,350
another way of saying God.
It's just God's a dirty word.

1802
01:37:27,351 --> 01:37:29,690
So we don't use it as much anymore.
But same thing.

1803
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:33,380
So you end up in one of these
three dead ends essentially. Right?

1804
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,980
So there is no answer. Uh,
the real answer is because

1805
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,640
what is the meaning of life? Yeah. You get
to make up your own answers. The beauty.

1806
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,180
If there was a single answer,
we would not be free.

1807
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:50,930
We will be trapped because then we
would all have to live to that answer.

1808
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:52,460
Then we'd be bored like robots,

1809
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:56,190
each one competing with each other to
fulfill that single more than the others.

1810
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:59,010
Back to signaling like I'm
better at it than you are.

1811
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,700
But luckily there is no answer.
So you just do whatever you want.

1812
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,310
The meaning of life.

1813
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:10,790
It's funny that that w w that's the
basis of all existential angst that you

1814
01:38:12,031 --> 01:38:16,740
don't, you don't know why you're here and
you have this feeling that it could be

1815
01:38:16,741 --> 01:38:20,040
meaning less. It is. I mean if you,

1816
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,840
when you start pondering the,
the multiverse, the universe,

1817
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:29,130
the galaxies, solar system,
the planet, the organism,

1818
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:33,690
the cells inside the organism,
the bacteria, the parasites,

1819
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:38,280
the symbiotic relationship we have to
our environment. And you start going,

1820
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:41,820
Jesus Christ, what am I? Just a little
piece of this thing? It's like, well,

1821
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:45,810
the answers to all the great questions
are paradoxes. Yeah. So for example,

1822
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:49,470
you're asking like, do I matter? That's
like really the question you asked, right?

1823
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:52,650
Well, how do I matter in this
infinite universe? Well, you know,

1824
01:38:52,651 --> 01:38:56,250
on the one hand you're separate.
No two points are the same.

1825
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:59,040
Every point is every two points
are infinitely different.

1826
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:02,280
You're completely separated. No one
will have your thoughts, your emotions,

1827
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:04,800
your feelings, your experience. So
your life as a single player game.

1828
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:07,500
You're trapped inside your head and you're
just aware of a bunch of things going

1829
01:39:07,501 --> 01:39:10,230
on. And that's it. On the other hand,

1830
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:15,030
I cannot say the word Joe Rogan
without invoking the entire universe.

1831
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:18,030
Joe Rogue alien comes along,
says, what's that Joe Rogan?

1832
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:20,640
What's Joe Rogan Rogan's a human.
What's a human bipedal ape?

1833
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,070
What's an ape on the earth?
What's the Earth Planet?

1834
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:26,580
What's a planet solar system where
it was the carbon made inside starts,

1835
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:27,414
right and says,

1836
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:31,740
I have to create the entire universe
to just say the words Joe Rogan.

1837
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,680
So in that sense, you're connected
to everything. It's inseparable.

1838
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:40,010
So the answer to that question of
do I matter is I am nothing and I am

1839
01:39:40,111 --> 01:39:42,780
everything. And you'll find this
with all the great questions.

1840
01:39:42,781 --> 01:39:44,040
The answers are all paradoxes,

1841
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:48,750
which is why at some level it's sort of
pointless to pursue them to find a trite

1842
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:49,920
answer like I'm giving,

1843
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:54,950
but the act of pursuing them is actually
really useful because then it gives you

1844
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:59,220
certain intrinsic understanding in
your life that brings a level of peace.

1845
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,950
I feel like there's with many people,

1846
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:06,951
this stress of this question is
also accentuated by unhappy lives.

1847
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:11,700
It's unsexy accentuated by
unhappy choices, by being trapped.

1848
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:16,560
There's a big difference
between not knowing what the
meaning of life is and God,

1849
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:20,400
I gotta get the fuck out of this job. I
have to, I can't live my life this way.

1850
01:40:20,401 --> 01:40:22,740
What's the meaning of life?
If this is my life,

1851
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,830
which is why I always start
with let's get you rich first.

1852
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:31,020
That's why very practical
about it, because look, you
know, Buddha was a prince,

1853
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,620
okay? He started out really rich and
then he got to go off in the woods.

1854
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:38,940
In the old days, what happened was
if you want it to be peaceful inside,

1855
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:42,570
you would become a monk. You
would renounce everything.
You'd become an aesthetic.

1856
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:46,710
You would give everything up. You renounce
women, men, you'd renounce children,

1857
01:40:46,711 --> 01:40:50,250
you do announce money, you renounce
politics, science, technology, everything.

1858
01:40:50,251 --> 01:40:51,600
And you would go out in
the woods by yourself,

1859
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:53,860
you to give everything
up to be free inside.

1860
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:57,880
Well today we have this
wonderful invention called
money or you can just store

1861
01:40:57,881 --> 01:41:02,650
stuff up in her bank account. Okay?
And you can basically save, you can,

1862
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:03,880
you can work really hard,

1863
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:07,780
you can do great things for society and
society will give you money for giving

1864
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:09,640
it things that it wants and
it doesn't know how to get.

1865
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:13,990
And then you can save that up and you can
live well below your means and you can

1866
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:17,110
find a certain freedom in that and that
will give you the time and the energy to

1867
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:19,630
pursue your own internal
peace and happiness.

1868
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,470
So I believe the solution to making
everybody happy is to give them what they

1869
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:25,360
want.
Let's get them all rich,

1870
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:30,690
let's get them all fit and healthy and
then let's get them all happy is are

1871
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:34,110
those things even possible? Can
absolutely. Everyone can be written,

1872
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,760
everyone can be recovery.
Here's my thought exercise for now.

1873
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:38,230
It seems like we're in an infomercial.

1874
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:42,880
Everyone can be really not selling any my
home, this is my Rolls Royce. Yeah, so,

1875
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:44,020
so that's a good point.

1876
01:41:44,021 --> 01:41:47,350
So everything that I've ever created
on this topic of how to make money,

1877
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,740
I will never charge a dollar
for because that would ruin it.

1878
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,680
That would show that I'm just another
huckster who's trying to get rich off of

1879
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:55,690
you.
There are no get rich quick schemes.

1880
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:59,170
That's just somebody else trying to
get rich off of you. Right. So it's,

1881
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:04,590
so to me it's more of a philosophical
contribution where for it to have meeting

1882
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:08,170
and to be legit, I can't charge
you anything for it. But yes,

1883
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:11,260
everybody can be rich. And let me
give you a thought exercise. Okay.

1884
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:16,800
Imagine if tomorrow we could wave a
wand and everybody was trained as a

1885
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:21,880
scientist or an engineer. Everybody,
even if you weren't very good,

1886
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:23,850
you had enough understanding of computer.

1887
01:42:23,851 --> 01:42:27,040
Did you write some code and you can build
some hardware and don't tell me people

1888
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:30,520
can't do it because they can. That's
just the attorney of soft expectations.

1889
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,310
That's just you looking down on
somebody else, they can do it.

1890
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:36,670
They just have to be educated. Now,
if they're educated all as hardware,

1891
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:40,090
software engineers, scientists,
biologists, technicians, hard sciences,

1892
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:43,900
not the social sciences.
We would all be done within five years.

1893
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:47,410
Robots would be doing everything from
cleaning toilets to cooking food to flying

1894
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,020
airplanes and driving Uber's
and what would we be doing?

1895
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:53,090
We would be doing all creative jobs to
entertain each other and researching

1896
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,810
science and technology.
We will have wonderful lives.

1897
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:59,200
So it is really just a question
of education. Nothing else.

1898
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:01,150
Is this a scale issue though?

1899
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:06,040
I mean you're talking about it as if
this would work with 300 million people,

1900
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:08,020
it will work with 10 billion people.
It will work.

1901
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:12,400
This space fairing race with 100 trillion
people. Just we have the resources,

1902
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:16,840
we have the ability. The
Universe is infinite resources.
You build it, you know,

1903
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,750
have you heard of a Dyson sphere?
You know,

1904
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:22,000
you pull the Dyson sphere on a star and
you gather all its energy like that.

1905
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:23,470
There's so much energy out there.

1906
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:26,770
One asteroids got all the
minerals that we need. One son,

1907
01:43:26,771 --> 01:43:31,660
one solar system has got all the power
we will need for a long, long time. Uh,

1908
01:43:31,690 --> 01:43:34,360
you know, we can extract it of
nuclear fusion. You know, we're,

1909
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:38,020
we're not that far from those
kinds of technologies working. Uh,

1910
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:40,690
it's just a question of
gut and, uh, you know,

1911
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:44,860
an interest like we should be building
nuclear fusion test plants on the moon.

1912
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:48,880
The moon should be littered with
F. It's no downside, right? Yeah.

1913
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:51,830
If you could,
how would that work?

1914
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:55,670
Is send a bunch of people up there
to work on. The problem with robots,

1915
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:58,580
the problem with fishing nuclear
fission is that, you know,

1916
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:02,810
nature creates energy through
nuclear energy, right?

1917
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,800
Like the sun creates energy,
nuclear energy. Now for
transmission reviews, photons,

1918
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:08,240
because photons don't interact.

1919
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:10,820
And so photons are great for
information transmission,

1920
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:14,390
but they're actually not great for
energy transmission for energy creation.

1921
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:19,520
You want nuclear to work. And the problem
is because nuclear energy, you know,

1922
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:22,040
we built it with a bomb.
We have dirty nukes,

1923
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:25,070
all those kinds of problems with
Fukushima, three mile island, Chernobyl,

1924
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:29,330
we don't innovate anymore. Nukes. Imagine
if when the first steam engine blew up,

1925
01:44:29,331 --> 01:44:31,970
we said,
oh no more steam engines for awhile,

1926
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,790
or very carefully regulated
billion dollars a regulation.

1927
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:38,390
You can't innovate that way.
When the first airplane crashed,

1928
01:44:38,391 --> 01:44:41,060
we said no more innovation in airplanes.
Right?

1929
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:46,190
So we need a way to iterate on nuclear
efficient and eventually fusion and get

1930
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:49,640
them working safely, cleanly,
passive, say failure,

1931
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:53,180
etc. If we're going to find our way out
of the energy trap and the best place to

1932
01:44:53,181 --> 01:44:55,310
do that is someplace
like on the moon or Mars,

1933
01:44:56,030 --> 01:45:01,030
do you think that it's
actually a possibility that
they could get nuclear power

1934
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:03,080
to the point where it's not a detriment?

1935
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:06,080
Because when everyone's worried
about is a meltdown, right? Yeah.

1936
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:10,760
And we do have these old plants that
are running, that are running on this.

1937
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:13,840
This is 50 year old technology.
It's crazy cause they,

1938
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:16,820
there's no ability to shut them
off, right? Very old technology.

1939
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:20,210
They do now have gen four nuclear
reactors that are passive, fail safe.

1940
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:24,260
So in other words, when they fail, they
fail until you pull the plug on them.

1941
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:26,990
They fell into a state where there's
no leakage, there's no problem.

1942
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,820
There are default is a positive
outcome as opposed to the current ones,

1943
01:45:31,821 --> 01:45:34,340
the old ones where if you
unplug them like, and these,

1944
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:38,540
even these gen four or just gen
four, they're not gen five, gen 80,

1945
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,820
gen hundred where we are microprocessors.
Right?

1946
01:45:40,821 --> 01:45:44,900
And that should be something that people
are working towards. I hope so. I mean,

1947
01:45:44,901 --> 01:45:46,580
in an ideal world we would do that.

1948
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,310
The problem is if you have nuclear energy
on the moon, how do you get at home?

1949
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:49,860
Right?

1950
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:53,780
So what you actually got to do is you've
got to read it on the moon and you're

1951
01:45:53,781 --> 01:45:56,000
using it there maybe to
launch more satellites,

1952
01:45:56,001 --> 01:45:59,810
more rockets further out into the solar
system. And that's the initial use case.

1953
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,560
Um, but then eventually the technology
gets so good you can bring it home.

1954
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:08,510
Now I want to go back to this idea of
getting people rich that somehow or

1955
01:46:08,511 --> 01:46:11,380
another that's going to make people
happy. How do you stop that? The,

1956
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:16,580
the natural progression that people
have of, you know, Oh, you know,

1957
01:46:16,581 --> 01:46:20,360
I have got a nice Chevrolet.
Yeah, but I really want to BMW.

1958
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:24,250
I've got a nice BMW, but now I want a
Mercedes. I have mercy. I want to for Ron.

1959
01:46:24,251 --> 01:46:25,084
Yeah.

1960
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:30,290
How do you stop that
material possession trap?

1961
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,240
Because you can't at some level.

1962
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:35,870
But I think most smart people over time
realize that possessions don't make them

1963
01:46:35,871 --> 01:46:36,704
happy.

1964
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:40,310
It's just you have to go through that
and you have to buy your stupid car to

1965
01:46:40,311 --> 01:46:42,950
realize that it doesn't attract attractive
girls that actually just attracts

1966
01:46:42,951 --> 01:46:47,720
other dudes who are like, Hey, I
like that car, man. Right? Like,

1967
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:50,790
like you have some expensive out there,
some fancy cards.

1968
01:46:50,791 --> 01:46:54,770
Tell me how you know how much
that attracts women versus
men. Well, I'm married.

1969
01:46:54,771 --> 01:46:58,710
Those are for me. I just
enjoy machines. Yeah.

1970
01:46:58,711 --> 01:47:01,890
So let me their toys. That's a particular
thing where you enjoy machines.

1971
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:03,660
But I think as you get older,

1972
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,160
you just realize that there's no
happiness in material possessions. Now,

1973
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,350
lack of material possessions
can make you very unhappy.

1974
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:13,980
So being poor can make you unhappy. But
being rich is not gonna make you happy.

1975
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:15,680
And what happens.
Unfortunately,

1976
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:19,110
a lot of people struggle through their
whole lives to make money. They make some,

1977
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:22,470
they were exhausted and then they're like,
well now why am I not happy?

1978
01:47:22,471 --> 01:47:25,290
I guess I'm just not a happy person
and smart people aren't happy.

1979
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:29,280
That's like a great little way to, people
feel better about it. They say, well,

1980
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:32,790
if you're smart, you're not happy.
Right? Whereas I positively, other way,

1981
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:35,790
if you're smart, you should be
able to figure out how to be happy.

1982
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:37,560
Otherwise you're not that smart.
Yeah.

1983
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:41,310
That is an offensive statement that
if you're smart, you're not happy.

1984
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:44,970
I've heard that before and I just do not
understand the logic of that other than

1985
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:49,260
self justifying. I understand where it
comes from. It comes from if you're smart,

1986
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:52,950
it's usually cause you thought things
through and you are very busy mind and so

1987
01:47:52,951 --> 01:47:57,420
busy mind can often rob you have peace
of mind because when the piece that we

1988
01:47:57,421 --> 01:48:00,840
seek is not peace of mind,
it's piece from mind. Right?

1989
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:04,260
So if you look at all the crazy
activities you do to be happy, right?

1990
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:09,290
Whether it's like trying to get laid
and have an orgasm or extreme sports or

1991
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:12,120
looking at something beautiful
or taking a psychedelic.

1992
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:13,440
You're trying to get out of your own mind.

1993
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:17,520
You're trying to get your monkey mind
to stop chattering at you for a moment.

1994
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:22,830
You're trying to get peace from the mind
and there are other better ways to do

1995
01:48:22,831 --> 01:48:27,420
that. Most of the ways we try to get
peace from mind, our indirect, um,

1996
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:31,440
whereas if you understand things,
if you see things properly,

1997
01:48:31,441 --> 01:48:34,230
you will naturally slowly
develop piece from mind.

1998
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:38,970
Sorry if I went on a tangent
there. No, it's a good tangent.

1999
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:44,150
It's a good tangent because I think
oftentimes the pursuit is what's thrilling

2000
01:48:45,421 --> 01:48:49,350
to people and the possibility that one
day they'll be able to rest and that

2001
01:48:49,351 --> 01:48:50,640
they'll reach this goal.

2002
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:54,570
That's the fundamental delusion that there
is something out there that will make

2003
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:59,210
me happy and fulfilled forever.
Yeah. Golden years there
is, it's called death. Oh,

2004
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:03,420
I'll take care of everything. That's the
great leveler. But when people look at,

2005
01:49:03,421 --> 01:49:06,780
particularly social media was bring it
back to that. When you see someone who,

2006
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:10,520
you know, you see them posed in
front of their mansion there,

2007
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,700
beautiful car and they're leaning against
it with their designer clothes on,

2008
01:49:14,701 --> 01:49:18,540
they're expensive. Watch
you. Ah, I want that.

2009
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,960
That's what I want.
What you really want is freedom.

2010
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:26,280
You want freedom from your money problems.
And I think that's okay. So people,

2011
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:31,020
once someone can solve their
money problems either by
lowering their lifestyle

2012
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,460
or by making enough
money, uh, and you know,

2013
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:38,440
essentially what you want to get everybody
to the retirement but not retirement

2014
01:49:38,441 --> 01:49:38,790
and the,

2015
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:43,020
I'm 65 years old sitting in a nursing
home collecting a check retirement,

2016
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,440
different definition.

2017
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:49,490
Retirement is when you stop sacrificing
today for some imaginary tomorrow.

2018
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:51,360
Mm.
Okay.

2019
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,890
Today is complete in an of itself.

2020
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:57,560
You're retired and so how
do you get there? Well,

2021
01:49:57,561 --> 01:50:01,670
one is you can have so much money saved
up that just your passive income off of

2022
01:50:01,671 --> 01:50:04,040
that without your having to lift
a finger coverage, your burn rate,

2023
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,840
keep your burn rate low,
right?

2024
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:10,040
A second is you just drive your burn
rate down to zero. You become a monk.

2025
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:14,300
A third is you're doing something
you love, you enjoy it so much.

2026
01:50:14,301 --> 01:50:17,480
It's not about the money.
So there are multiple ways to that path.

2027
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,030
But the most common is people just say,
I need to make more money.

2028
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:24,230
And the kind of wealth creation that I
talk about is about creating timeless

2029
01:50:24,231 --> 01:50:28,310
principles and adapting yourselves that
making money won't be an issue and you

2030
01:50:28,311 --> 01:50:30,680
can do it by doing what you love,
right?

2031
01:50:30,681 --> 01:50:33,860
Like we get into this model of
I must work for other people,

2032
01:50:33,861 --> 01:50:35,630
work my way up the ladder.
Uh,

2033
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,690
I must like do what that
person is doing to make money.

2034
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,380
But really today in society,
you get rewarded for creative work,

2035
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:45,680
for creating something brand new that
society didn't even know yet that it

2036
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:48,080
wanted, that doesn't know how
to get other than through you.

2037
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:51,830
So the most powerful moneymakers
are actually individual brands.

2038
01:50:51,831 --> 01:50:56,480
People like yourself or elan or
Kanye or Oprah or Trump, right?

2039
01:50:56,481 --> 01:51:00,980
These are individual brands, eponymous
name brands who themselves are leveraged.

2040
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:03,200
Like you're leveraged.
You have podcasts,

2041
01:51:03,201 --> 01:51:06,320
media going out to everybody that's
leveraged the podcast work for you and you

2042
01:51:06,321 --> 01:51:08,900
sleep.
They have knowledge that nobody else has,

2043
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:11,600
which is your knowledge is the
knowledge of being Joe Rogan. I mean,

2044
01:51:11,601 --> 01:51:16,601
who else is a UFC fighter
and a commentator and a
podcaster and a comedian and

2045
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:17,330
you know,

2046
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:20,810
interested in all these things and knows
all these people can't replace you. Um,

2047
01:51:20,850 --> 01:51:24,260
so we have to pay you what you're worth.
And was I never fought in UFC though.

2048
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:29,000
Oh you did? Okay. Sorry. Um, or you
know, your, whatever you're, you're,

2049
01:51:29,001 --> 01:51:32,670
you're involved in that whole scene. You
just have a unique set of skill sets. Um,

2050
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:35,690
so because of this unique,
what I call a specific knowledge,

2051
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,940
because of the accountability
that you have with your name,

2052
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:41,690
because the leverage that you have through
your media, your money making machine,

2053
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:44,960
you're, I'm sure at this point I
could make you start over tomorrow,

2054
01:51:44,961 --> 01:51:47,150
wipe out your bank card.
You'd be rich again, no time.

2055
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:49,400
Because you have all the skillsets.

2056
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:52,370
So once people have those
skill sets and the beauty is,

2057
01:51:52,371 --> 01:51:55,250
the way you've done it is you
don't have any competition.

2058
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:58,730
There's no substitution. If Joe Rogan
were to disappear off the air tomorrow,

2059
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,660
it's not like random podcasts and number
12 with step in and fill that thing. No,

2060
01:52:02,661 --> 01:52:03,650
it's just gone.

2061
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:08,120
So the way to get out of that competition
trap is actually to be authentic.

2062
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:13,100
The way to retire is actually to find
the thing that you know how to do better

2063
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:15,860
than anybody. And you know how to do that
better name because you love to do it.

2064
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:18,290
No one can compete with
you if you love to do it.

2065
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:22,850
Be Authentic and then figure out how to
map that to what society actually wants.

2066
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,760
Apply some leverage,
put your name on it so you take the risks,

2067
01:52:25,761 --> 01:52:27,020
but you gain the rewards,

2068
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:29,840
have ownership and equity in what
you do and then just crank it out.

2069
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:35,000
I think people have to be very careful
to not get trapped along the way with

2070
01:52:35,450 --> 01:52:39,500
things that you can afford
with your current lifestyle,

2071
01:52:39,501 --> 01:52:41,690
like the way you're living
in the way you're earning,

2072
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:45,950
but they're also imprisoning you and the
fact that you are now to have to work

2073
01:52:45,951 --> 01:52:46,130
this

2074
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:50,150
40 hour week job in order to get
this thing that you can afford,

2075
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:55,130
but now you are saddled down to this job.
You've no, you're not saving, you're not,

2076
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,280
you're not putting things in a,

2077
01:52:56,281 --> 01:52:58,910
in a good place and you're
working for these things.

2078
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:04,210
Working for things as rewards is a real
trap that a lot of people fall into.

2079
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:07,400
It's the biggest one. Let's see,
until I've also says that, uh,

2080
01:53:07,630 --> 01:53:10,220
you're under two great addictions,
heroin in a monthly salary

2081
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:16,340
and that's why you can't get rich
renting out your time because you know,

2082
01:53:16,341 --> 01:53:18,110
when you start charging
more and more for your time,

2083
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:21,780
it's a slow upgrade loop and then you
upgrade your house at the same time you

2084
01:53:21,781 --> 01:53:24,140
have in your car at the same time
you move in the neighborhood.

2085
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:28,910
You really also have to get
used to ignoring your peers
or upgrading or changing

2086
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:30,640
the definition of your peers.
There are a lot of,

2087
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:32,690
a lot of people here who are poor here,

2088
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,360
but there'll be rich if they
were living in Thailand and Bali,

2089
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:37,700
and if they have the luxury
of a remotely doable job,

2090
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:40,640
they may want to be living
there and saving up money.

2091
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:44,390
But the ignoring the peers is an issue
because the keeping up with the Jones,

2092
01:53:44,391 --> 01:53:48,510
this is a real phenomenon. Yeah.
And makes the world go around. Yeah.

2093
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:52,310
And then there's this other
thing that people have to avoid,

2094
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:57,370
even allowing their mind to think when
they're hearing what you're saying and

2095
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:00,380
all this logical,
fantastic advice.

2096
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:05,920
There's these six dirty words
that's easy for you to say.

2097
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:09,570
Yeah. That is a terrible trap. And look,

2098
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:13,890
I grew up as a first generation
immigrant in Jamaica, Queens, uh,

2099
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:18,740
with zero money, single mom, two kids
working day and night, go to school.

2100
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:23,660
Uh, you know, I washed dishes. Uh,
I was [inaudible] catering jobs,

2101
01:54:23,661 --> 01:54:27,680
I was mowing lawns. I was working since
the age of 11 on and off here and there,

2102
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:32,310
um, didn't have 2 cents to
rub together, you know, uh,

2103
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:34,880
I had to borrow $400 to go to college,

2104
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:39,530
like literally a short $400 to 400.
I had to find $400. I didn't have it.

2105
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:44,210
Uh, you know, got rejected from a
job at Dunkin donuts. So like, okay.

2106
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:49,530
It's not to say that it's easy, it's not
easy. It's actually really fricking hard.

2107
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:53,750
It is the hardest thing you will do. But
it's also the rewarding thing. You know,

2108
01:54:53,751 --> 01:54:56,480
look at the kids who are born
rich, no meetings, their lives,

2109
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:59,300
you're terrible place. Yeah, you're real.

2110
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:02,360
You're real resume is just a
cataloging of all your suffering.

2111
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,620
If I were to ask you to describe
your real life to yourself,

2112
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:09,440
when you look back on your deathbed,
you're going to go back and say,

2113
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:11,030
what are the interesting things I've done?

2114
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:14,000
And it's all going to be around the
sacrifices that you've made in the hard

2115
01:55:14,001 --> 01:55:17,260
things that you did. Anything you were
given, doesn't matter. You know, you,

2116
01:55:17,261 --> 01:55:19,970
you have your four limbs, you have
your brain, you have your head,

2117
01:55:19,971 --> 01:55:21,890
you have your skin yet.
So that's all from granted.

2118
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:26,860
So you have to do hard things anyway
to create your own meaning in life. Um,

2119
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:31,460
making money as a fine one. Yes. Struggle.
It is hard. I'm not gonna say it's easy.

2120
01:55:31,461 --> 01:55:34,340
It's a really hard, but the tools
are all available. It's all there.

2121
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:35,330
There's also this,

2122
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:40,360
these traps that people sort of establish
in their own mind of giving themselves

2123
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:47,580
excuses or giving themselves
in unsurmountable obstacles,

2124
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:51,720
insurmountable d paths,
terrain mentality. Yeah.

2125
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:55,440
It's somebody else's fault. That's my skin
color's fault. It's the system's fault.

2126
01:55:55,441 --> 01:55:57,750
Yeah. Those people are
sinking. I feel bad for them.

2127
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:01,200
I want to shake them out of it and
say, actually, you can get out of it.

2128
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:04,700
You just have to stop thinking.
It's everybody else. I'll
do the perspective. Yeah.

2129
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:06,390
It's so difficult for people to do.

2130
01:56:06,391 --> 01:56:09,480
It's one of the most difficult things for
people to do is to change the way they

2131
01:56:09,481 --> 01:56:13,710
approach approach reality itself.
At the end of the day.

2132
01:56:13,711 --> 01:56:17,400
I do think even despite
what I said earlier, life is
really a single player game.

2133
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:19,500
It's all going on in your head.
You know,

2134
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:24,390
whatever you think you believe
will very much shape your reality,

2135
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:27,150
both from what risks you take
and what actions you perform,

2136
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:29,580
but also just everyday
experience of reality.

2137
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:33,030
If you're walking down the street and
you're judging everyone, you're like,

2138
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:36,090
I don't like that person because their
skin color. I don't like that. Oh, she's,

2139
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:39,570
she's not attractive. That guy's
fat. This person's a loser. Oh,

2140
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:43,230
who put this in my way? You
know, the more you judge,

2141
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:46,260
the more you're gonna separate yourself
and you'll feel good for an instant

2142
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:48,660
because you'll feel good about yourself.
I'm better than that,

2143
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:52,350
but then you're going to feel lonely
and then you just gonna see negativity

2144
01:56:52,351 --> 01:56:55,100
everywhere. The world just reflects
your own feelings back at you.

2145
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:59,160
Reality is neutral.
Reality has no judgements to a tree.

2146
01:56:59,161 --> 01:57:02,850
There's no concept of right or wrong
or good or bad, right? You're born,

2147
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:05,850
you have a whole set of
sensory experiences and
stimulations and lights and

2148
01:57:05,851 --> 01:57:07,170
colors and sounds.
And then you die.

2149
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:11,190
And how you choose to interpret that
is up to you. You do have that choice.

2150
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:13,680
So this is what I meant,
that happiness is a choice.

2151
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:17,040
If you believe it's the choice,
then you can start working on it.

2152
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:20,670
And I can't tell you how to find it
because it's their own conditionings that

2153
01:57:20,671 --> 01:57:23,220
are making you unhappy.
So you have to uncondition yourself.

2154
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:25,320
It's just like I can't fix
your eating habits for,

2155
01:57:25,321 --> 01:57:26,490
you can give some general guidelines,

2156
01:57:26,491 --> 01:57:29,340
but you got to go through the heart
habit forming of how to eat right.

2157
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:33,060
But you have to believe it's possible
and it is absolutely possible.

2158
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:34,320
I was miserable.

2159
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:37,590
I'm happy as a clam and it's not just
the money I got there before the money.

2160
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:39,910
You got happy before
the money? Mostly. Yeah.

2161
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,950
How did you get happy before the money?
I started getting older. You know,

2162
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:47,710
I just realized like life is
short. I'm going to die again.

2163
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:52,060
Try it. Right. Try It, try
anyways. Yeah. Well, Confucius
had a great saying that, uh,

2164
01:57:52,061 --> 01:57:52,290
you know,

2165
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:56,440
every man has two lives and the second
starts when he realizes he has just one.

2166
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,710
Ah,

2167
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:02,450
and I read that it was one of those
book dropping lines. You know,

2168
01:58:02,451 --> 01:58:05,000
it's like Mike drop.
Confucius had a lot of microbes.

2169
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:08,750
Confucius was a bad motherfucker. He was,
that's a crazy one. That was a great one.

2170
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:12,050
Um, or another one is next
time you get sick, you know,

2171
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:13,670
cause everybody gets
sick every now and then.

2172
01:58:13,671 --> 01:58:18,560
It's like a happy person
once 10,000 things, a sick
person just once. One thing,

2173
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:23,120
right? So it's your, it's your unlimited
desires that are clouding your piece,

2174
01:58:23,121 --> 01:58:25,460
your happiness have desires.

2175
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:30,020
You are biological creature that stands
up and says, I can do something. I move,

2176
01:58:30,021 --> 01:58:31,400
I resist,
I live.

2177
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,860
But just be very careful of your desires.
This is the oldest most trade wisdom.

2178
01:58:36,861 --> 01:58:38,960
Desire is suffering. That's
what it means, right?

2179
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:42,160
Every desire you have is an
access where you will suffer.

2180
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:45,430
So just don't focus on more
than one desire to time.

2181
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:49,240
The Universe is rigged in such a way
that if you just want one thing and you

2182
01:58:49,241 --> 01:58:52,450
focus on that, you'll get it. But
everything else you gotta let go.

2183
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:58,070
Did you make a gradual shift to
happiness or was it a radical change?

2184
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:00,620
It's ongoing. It's gradual. Everyday.

2185
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:04,550
You're happier today than you were
a month ago. Yeah. Allegedly. Yeah.

2186
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:08,660
Yeah.
I'm very happy these days deliriously,

2187
01:59:08,661 --> 01:59:11,820
so it's actually a hard for me to hang
out with normal people. Really. Yeah.

2188
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:12,771
So you,

2189
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:17,420
you've made a significant shift over
the period of like how many years?

2190
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:21,500
Eight years. Eight years, yeah. Wow.

2191
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:26,660
And is this something that you've pursued
through certain books or is it just

2192
01:59:26,661 --> 01:59:27,220
like you,

2193
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:31,490
you've made an understanding or gained
an understanding in your own mind and

2194
01:59:31,491 --> 01:59:33,530
then started pursuing it based on,
I don't understand that.

2195
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:36,590
Yeah, it's very, very
personal. Uh, it's basically,

2196
01:59:36,591 --> 01:59:40,400
you have to decide it's a priority. And
then I tried every hack I possibly could.

2197
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:45,080
I used to, you know, I tried all the,
I tried meditation, I tried witnessing,

2198
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:48,110
uh, you know, I even tried an Ssri
just to see what it would feel like.

2199
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:52,190
How did it feel? Uh, it was, it turned
me from a pessimist or an optimist,

2200
01:59:52,191 --> 01:59:54,050
but I didn't like the physical
side effects and all that.

2201
01:59:54,051 --> 01:59:55,730
I want to be in a drug
for sustained basis.

2202
01:59:56,210 --> 01:59:59,300
So I dropped it and I felt it
turn you into an optimist. Yes.

2203
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:02,150
At the time I used to be
a pessimist. Yeah. Um,

2204
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:05,090
I started doing things like I would
start looking at the, uh, you know,

2205
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:07,490
in every moment and
everything that happens,

2206
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,500
you can look on the bright
side of something. Right.

2207
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,190
And so I used to do that forcibly and
then I trained it until it became second

2208
02:00:13,191 --> 02:00:17,630
nature. So for example, like a
friend of my wife's was over and she,

2209
02:00:18,110 --> 02:00:20,270
when we were dating and
she took all these photos,

2210
02:00:20,271 --> 02:00:23,690
she took like hundreds of photos
and then she sends them all to us.

2211
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,650
And my immediate reaction was like,

2212
02:00:24,651 --> 02:00:26,870
why are you dumping hundreds
of photos on my phone?

2213
02:00:26,871 --> 02:00:28,880
I don't need a hundreds of photos,
have some judgment.

2214
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:33,440
That was my immediate reaction. And then
I could say actually how nice of her,

2215
02:00:33,441 --> 02:00:36,230
she sent me hundreds of photos I could
pick. The one that I like, right?

2216
02:00:36,231 --> 02:00:38,090
There are two ways of
seeing almost everything.

2217
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:40,160
There are a few things that
are like high suffering.

2218
02:00:40,161 --> 02:00:43,340
So you can't do that other than just
saying, well, this is a teacher, right?

2219
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:47,660
But I slowly worked through every negative
judgment that I had until I saw the

2220
02:00:47,661 --> 02:00:49,700
positive and not second nature to me.

2221
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:53,810
I also realized that like what you
want is you want to clear minds.

2222
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:56,960
You want to let go of thoughts,
happy thoughts disappeared.

2223
02:00:56,961 --> 02:01:00,170
I had automatically very easy to let
go of them. Negative thoughts linger.

2224
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:04,610
So we interpret the neck, the positive and
everything. Very quickly. You let it go,

2225
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,890
right? You let it go much faster. Um,
simple hacks. Get more sunlight, right?

2226
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:11,750
Learn to smile more,
learn to hug more.

2227
02:01:11,751 --> 02:01:13,880
These things actually released
serotonin and reverse.

2228
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:16,370
They aren't just outward
signals of being happy.

2229
02:01:16,371 --> 02:01:20,570
They're actually feedback loops to being
happy. Um, spend more time in nature.

2230
02:01:20,571 --> 02:01:24,770
You know, these are obvious. Watch your
mind. Watch your mind all day long.

2231
02:01:24,771 --> 02:01:27,830
Watch what it does, not judge it and not
try to control it. But you can meditate.

2232
02:01:27,831 --> 02:01:30,980
24 seven meditation is not
a sit down close your eyes,

2233
02:01:30,981 --> 02:01:35,060
activity meditation is just
basically watching your own thoughts.

2234
02:01:35,061 --> 02:01:37,880
Like you would watch anything
else in the outside world and say,

2235
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,640
why am I having that?
Does that serve me anymore?

2236
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:44,270
Is that conditioning from when I
was 10 years old? Like for example,

2237
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:49,820
getting ready for this podcast. You
got Ready? I didn't but good. I did,

2238
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:52,670
but I did. But I did.
But you couldn't help it.

2239
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,020
And what happened was the few days leading
up to this, my mind was just running.

2240
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:59,990
And normally my mind is pretty calm
and it was just running and running and

2241
02:01:59,991 --> 02:02:04,430
running. And every thought I would have,
I would imagine me saying it to you,

2242
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:09,460
my brain couldn't help but rehearse what
it's doing is just rehearsing all the

2243
02:02:09,621 --> 02:02:13,400
time to talk to you. And then I
was even rehearsing, rehearse,

2244
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:15,370
telling you about the rehearsal,
right?

2245
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:18,710
So it was all playing all these Meta games
and I was just like, shut up, stop it.

2246
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:22,070
What is going on? And it took me
a while to figure out, oh yeah,

2247
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:22,970
you know what it is.

2248
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:28,220
When I was a kid in queens and I had no
money and I had nothing and I need to

2249
02:02:28,221 --> 02:02:32,990
save myself. The way I got out was
by sounding smart, not being smart,

2250
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,140
sounding smart.
That was the skill I perfected.

2251
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,820
So I am hardwired to always rehearse
things so I will sound smart.

2252
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:44,810
It's a disease that keeps me from
being happy so but when you see that,

2253
02:02:44,811 --> 02:02:48,770
when you realize that when you understand
something then it naturally calms you

2254
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:53,450
down. So after that I stop rehearsing
as much, but it's still a train habit.

2255
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:55,140
That is

2256
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:00,140
really interesting point that you want
to sound smart that that many people do

2257
02:03:02,431 --> 02:03:04,570
that and especially young
people and it's you.

2258
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:08,520
You see someone who is smart or someone
who appears smart, they say smart things.

2259
02:03:08,521 --> 02:03:09,810
You kind of want to sound smart.

2260
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:13,220
I want people to think about me the
same way I think about that person,

2261
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:16,860
that that is my disease. That is my
feeling is what clutters my mind. I,

2262
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:21,460
the the thing I have to
ask myself now is if I can,

2263
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:24,520
would I still be interested in learning
this thing if I couldn't ever tell

2264
02:03:24,521 --> 02:03:27,850
anybody about it? Uh, that's
how I know it's a real,

2265
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:29,680
that's how I know it's something
I actually want to know.

2266
02:03:29,990 --> 02:03:33,230
Common thing though, I know I
suffered from that when I was young.

2267
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:34,790
The desire to sound smart,

2268
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:40,300
that's very, very common.
All of us start out.

2269
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:45,250
You know, every, everything.

2270
02:03:45,251 --> 02:03:49,360
You're the winner now in your life. You
were to you. It's because you are a loser.

2271
02:03:49,361 --> 02:03:52,990
At some point, if you had gotten all
the girls, if you had all the money,

2272
02:03:52,991 --> 02:03:54,940
if you had everything you want,
you're a good looking.

2273
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:57,790
And in junior high or high school,
uh,

2274
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:01,150
you wouldn't have done anything with your
life and you would have peaked early.

2275
02:04:01,151 --> 02:04:03,340
It's like the Bruce Springsteen
glory days song, right?

2276
02:04:03,341 --> 02:04:04,960
You would have married your
high school sweetheart.

2277
02:04:04,961 --> 02:04:06,910
You'd be living in your home town.
You know,

2278
02:04:06,911 --> 02:04:08,650
you'd be a manager at
the local Mcdonald's,

2279
02:04:08,651 --> 02:04:10,300
whatever that first dream job you had.

2280
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:13,900
Thank God we didn't all get what we
wanted when we were young. Right. Right.

2281
02:04:13,901 --> 02:04:15,310
Or we would be trapped in that.

2282
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:18,790
So you have to be able to break
out of where you came from.

2283
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:20,060
I don't know where I was going.

2284
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:23,030
That is interesting too about
people who peaked too early. Yeah.

2285
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:27,770
Or maybe those people that peak too
early can do the Ilan Mustang and just

2286
02:04:27,771 --> 02:04:30,480
abandon it and start something
new and then learn the,

2287
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:33,200
the joys of sucking at something.

2288
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:38,340
Yeah, and actually the, in
our professions, especially
when you're high visibility,

2289
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:41,490
the problem with Peking is
that you then get drowned in,

2290
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:45,450
in death of a thousand cuts. People
have expectations of you. Hey Joe,

2291
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:48,030
can you come to my event? Hey Joe,
can you look at my business plan?

2292
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:51,330
Hey Joe can give me advice on this.
Can you talk to my friend?

2293
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:52,350
Can you come in as podcast?

2294
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:55,800
You're just being assaulted all the
time with inbound opportunities.

2295
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,770
So you have no time to
start over with anything.

2296
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:02,520
So you have to ruthlessly
ruthlessly disappoint everybody.

2297
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,520
Eliminate and clear your schedule,
drop all the meetings,

2298
02:05:05,521 --> 02:05:07,170
not even respond to the emails.

2299
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:09,330
The only way you're gonna be
able to start over with anything.

2300
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:10,780
Yeah,
and I,

2301
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:14,530
we've talked about this and I'd love
your approach to meetings that if they're

2302
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:16,970
not life or death,
I'm the same way.

2303
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,550
I avoided a good one recently,

2304
02:05:19,551 --> 02:05:24,551
and this was someone that
was just tracking me down
as a high profile person in

2305
02:05:24,591 --> 02:05:27,560
a big organization. And I'm like,
can we just talk on the phone?

2306
02:05:27,890 --> 02:05:29,990
And then we talked on the phone list.
There was nothing to say.

2307
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:32,780
It was just they wanted to
get me in the office and

2308
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,820
yeah,
meeting hardly be phone calls.

2309
02:05:34,821 --> 02:05:39,000
Phone calls should be emails and
emails should just be texting. Right.

2310
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:43,010
Many of them, right. With meetings.
I mean, I, I despise meetings.

2311
02:05:43,011 --> 02:05:46,250
I used to own the domain. I don't do
coffee.com I eventually had to go,

2312
02:05:46,251 --> 02:05:49,280
but I used to respond from the violet.
I don't do coffee, you know? Oh,

2313
02:05:49,281 --> 02:05:52,550
that's hilarious. It was a little
bit of a jerk move, but it really,

2314
02:05:52,551 --> 02:05:54,220
what it comes from is when I was young,

2315
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:56,450
one of my principals was I
knew I had to make money.

2316
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,230
It was my overwhelming desire. And, uh,
one of the things I did was I said, okay,

2317
02:06:00,231 --> 02:06:03,740
I'm never going to be worth more
than what I think I'm worth. Okay.

2318
02:06:03,741 --> 02:06:06,650
No one's gonna pay me more than what
I think I'm worth. So what am I worth?

2319
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:11,180
So I picked an hourly rate for
myself that I was worth. And I said,

2320
02:06:11,181 --> 02:06:13,910
I'm never going to squander
my time for less than this.

2321
02:06:13,911 --> 02:06:18,110
So if originally is 500 bucks an hour,
then I upgrade the 5,000 bucks an hour.

2322
02:06:18,111 --> 02:06:22,430
And you know, it's ludicrous. But pick an
aspirational hourly rate, aspirational.

2323
02:06:22,431 --> 02:06:23,750
It has to be a little ludicrous.

2324
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:26,960
And then what I would do is
if I have to return something,

2325
02:06:26,961 --> 02:06:30,440
I'm standing in line to return
something and it's below my hourly rate,

2326
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:33,920
I'll throw it away if I have
to, if I, or give it away.

2327
02:06:33,950 --> 02:06:37,490
If I have to do some tasks and I can
hire somebody to do it for less than my

2328
02:06:37,491 --> 02:06:38,810
hourly rate,
I would hire them.

2329
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:42,680
And so I just became
extremely jealous of my time.

2330
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:45,650
Which doesn't mean you
can't have fun rest leisure,

2331
02:06:45,651 --> 02:06:48,710
spending time with your
friends and family. That's
all great. Don't count that.

2332
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:51,350
But if you're doing anything
you don't want to do,

2333
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,240
which is the definition of work,

2334
02:06:53,241 --> 02:06:56,330
it's a set of things that you have to
do that you don't want to do if you're

2335
02:06:56,331 --> 02:06:59,930
working it better be for your hourly
rate otherwise don't do the work.

2336
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:04,070
And so once it came out of that,
then I just realized the cost of meetings,

2337
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:05,900
a costume meetings is so high,

2338
02:07:05,901 --> 02:07:09,200
especially given all the people who are
in their right, one person's talking,

2339
02:07:09,201 --> 02:07:11,960
seven people listening, you're
literally just dying an hour at a time.

2340
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:17,150
So you have to just drop
nonurgent meetings or figure
how to be more efficient

2341
02:07:17,151 --> 02:07:18,380
with them if you're going
to do anything great.

2342
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,050
The extreme example is business travel.

2343
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,760
Getting on a plane to fly halfway
around the world for one meeting,

2344
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:27,320
which never amounts to anything.

2345
02:07:27,770 --> 02:07:30,800
And then like wasting your whole
little life there and then flying back.

2346
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:35,150
So about five years ago I resolved.
I am never going to travel for business.

2347
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:37,540
Wow.
And I haven't traveled for business since.

2348
02:07:37,541 --> 02:07:42,220
I only travel if the travel
experience will be so entertaining,

2349
02:07:42,221 --> 02:07:46,060
enjoy us because I have friends or it's
a place I want to see or whatever that

2350
02:07:46,061 --> 02:07:49,390
it will be complete in and of itself
because I know that whatever the business

2351
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:52,780
meeting it came from is,
is never worth it. Wow.

2352
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,470
And actually that principle
applies larger than just travel.

2353
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:59,380
It applies to life in general.
The this,

2354
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,660
one of the secrets to happiness is to
really embrace what you're doing in that

2355
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:07,930
moment. That's trite. But where that,
where that comes from is saying,

2356
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:12,220
I only want to do actions that are
complete in and of themselves. Right.

2357
02:08:12,221 --> 02:08:16,060
If I'm looking for some ulterior
motive down the line is not going to

2358
02:08:16,061 --> 02:08:19,930
materialize and, and if you think
it is, maybe even if it does,

2359
02:08:19,931 --> 02:08:22,750
it'll be very short lived.
Anything you want in your life,

2360
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:25,330
whether it was a car or whether
it was a girl over those money.

2361
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:28,570
When you got it a year later,
you're back to zero.

2362
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,720
Your brain had had dynamically adapted
to it and you're looking for the next

2363
02:08:31,721 --> 02:08:32,554
thing.

2364
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,140
That's a great statement.
Had dauntingly adapted.

2365
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:41,480
That's that is what happens to people
and you get accustomed to whatever it is.

2366
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:44,720
I realized that when I
first got a new apartment,

2367
02:08:44,721 --> 02:08:47,720
it was a nice apartment and after awhile
I got used to it. I was like, oh, okay.

2368
02:08:47,930 --> 02:08:51,440
Yeah, so just an apartment. It was just
where I live. I'm used to, it's nice,

2369
02:08:51,441 --> 02:08:52,274
but I'm used to it.

2370
02:08:52,490 --> 02:08:54,800
Yeah. We all go through this
learning. It's it's, you know,

2371
02:08:54,801 --> 02:08:58,040
it's riding the Ferris wheel of life.
It's like you get at the bottom,

2372
02:08:58,041 --> 02:09:00,680
you're like, oh, I want to get the top.
This is so exciting. You divide it up,

2373
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,620
you get a little dopamine rush
and get a little serotonin.

2374
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:07,020
Then you ride it back down is that
wears off. Then you need another high.

2375
02:09:07,021 --> 02:09:09,320
Then you write it back up and
you write it back down. In fact,

2376
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:13,220
the more high as you get, the harder it
gets to go around the wheel. More board.

2377
02:09:13,221 --> 02:09:14,900
You get it in,
the harder it goes to go back up.

2378
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:17,380
So what lights your fire in now?
Like what,

2379
02:09:17,381 --> 02:09:20,350
what gets you motivated
to do things and to act?

2380
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:25,700
Art. Art. This is art. Oh,
okay. Art Is this creativity.

2381
02:09:25,701 --> 02:09:27,980
It's just anything that's
done for its own sake.

2382
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:30,470
So what are the things that
are done for their own sake?

2383
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:34,730
There's nothing beyond uh, loving
somebody. Uh, creating something,

2384
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:38,540
playing art. To me,
creating businesses play.

2385
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:42,830
I create businesses early stage cause
it's fun cause I, I mean to the product,

2386
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:46,430
even when I invest, it's because I liked
the people. I like hanging out with them.

2387
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:49,580
I learned from them. And I think
the product is really cool. Um,

2388
02:09:49,581 --> 02:09:53,090
so these days I will pass on all kinds
of great investments because I'm like,

2389
02:09:53,091 --> 02:09:56,750
I just, the product's not interesting.
It's boring. I'm not gonna learn anything.

2390
02:09:56,930 --> 02:10:01,610
That's a beautiful luxury. It is a luxury
part and learning. Yeah, it is a luxury.

2391
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:06,140
These are not 100% or zero things,
right?

2392
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:10,940
You can in your life start moving more
and more towards that goal. It's a goal.

2393
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:12,110
When when I was younger,

2394
02:10:12,111 --> 02:10:15,440
I used to be so desperate to make money
that I would've done anything. Right.

2395
02:10:15,441 --> 02:10:16,550
If you'd shown up and said,
hey,

2396
02:10:16,551 --> 02:10:19,970
I got a sewage trucking business and
you're going to go into that. I was like,

2397
02:10:19,971 --> 02:10:21,230
great, let's do it. I'm
going to make money.

2398
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:24,260
Thank God no one gave me that opportunity.

2399
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:28,430
I'm glad that it went down the
road of technology and science,

2400
02:10:28,431 --> 02:10:32,960
which I genuinely enjoy. Uh, and
so I got to combine my vocation,

2401
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,160
my avocation.

2402
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,530
I mean, what are you doing?
You're playing, you're
having fun, you're doing art.

2403
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,420
You're not, you're not working. No.

2404
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:42,530
That's what I always say when people say
work hard. I'm like Sarda. No, not really.

2405
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,460
I'm always working,
but it looks like work to them,

2406
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:50,720
but it feels like play to me and that's
how I know no one can compete with me on

2407
02:10:50,721 --> 02:10:55,700
it because I'm just playing 16 hours a
day and if they want to compete with me

2408
02:10:55,701 --> 02:10:56,421
and they're going to work,

2409
02:10:56,421 --> 02:10:58,490
they're going to lose because they're
not going to do it 16 hours a day,

2410
02:10:58,491 --> 02:11:00,620
seven days a week. Well, listen, man,

2411
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:03,920
there are some gems of wisdom
in this conversation in the,

2412
02:11:03,921 --> 02:11:08,090
I hope people pull things out of this
and apply them to their own life,

2413
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:10,470
and I'm certainly going to
listen to you again and,

2414
02:11:10,471 --> 02:11:14,600
and try to apply some of this to my own
life stuff that I'm not already applying,

2415
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:17,480
but I really appreciate your time and
I really appreciate you coming in here.

2416
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,430
Thanks for having me.

2417
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:23,240

2418
