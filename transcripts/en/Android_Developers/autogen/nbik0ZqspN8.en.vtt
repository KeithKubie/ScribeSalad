00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
to understand if that made a difference
 

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
to understand if that made a difference
so<00:16:26.520><c> for</c><00:16:26.820><c> example</c><00:16:27.090><c> in</c><00:16:27.180><c> countries</c><00:16:27.540><c> like</c><00:16:27.600><c> Russia</c>

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
so for example in countries like Russia
 

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.370 align:start position:0%
so for example in countries like Russia
when<00:16:28.710><c> we</c><00:16:28.860><c> did</c><00:16:29.040><c> this</c><00:16:29.220><c> 30</c><00:16:29.730><c> percent</c><00:16:30.120><c> discount</c><00:16:30.380><c> we</c>

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
when we did this 30 percent discount we
 

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.730 align:start position:0%
when we did this 30 percent discount we

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
saw a 70% increase in sales and this
 

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.220 align:start position:0%
saw a 70% increase in sales and this
this<00:16:35.070><c> is</c><00:16:35.190><c> like</c><00:16:35.460><c> if</c><00:16:35.730><c> you</c><00:16:35.790><c> start</c><00:16:36.420><c> doing</c><00:16:36.720><c> this</c><00:16:36.990><c> on</c>

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.230 align:start position:0%
this is like if you start doing this on
 

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.070 align:start position:0%
this is like if you start doing this on
every<00:16:37.920><c> country</c><00:16:38.310><c> and</c><00:16:38.460><c> start</c><00:16:38.700><c> focusing</c><00:16:39.080><c> you</c>
