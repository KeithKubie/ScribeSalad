00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.430
SARAH PAN: I was part of the
PIIRS Global Seminarsprogram

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.700
and I visited France in
the French theater class.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.700
This photo is very
vibrant, and that's

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.460
how I would describe the
experience in France.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510
Every play that we went to
was a unique play in its own --

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.620
very colorful.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.170
You know, the sound, the
French language, the culture --

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.440
everything is encapsulated
in this one photo.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.540
Theater is something
that I didn't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.860
think I was comfortable with.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.410
It's all something
thatâ€™s very overwhelming.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.910
But I think being in
a different community

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420
and trying to explore something
new with other students that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.850
are also trying to
do the same thing --

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.110
it's really refreshing.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.990
And it gives you a foundation
to learn new things.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.420
And that's what I loved
about my experience

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.710
with the Global Seminar.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.319
ALEX FORD: Haiti has always
been near and dear to my heart.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.280
And so for my senior
thesis, I looked

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.990
at transnational
identities, which

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.480
span the borders between
Haiti and America.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.920
But also part of
my senior thesis

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.110
is a film based on
the story of when

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.630
I went to work in Haiti
after the earthquake

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.880
back in my early
years of high school.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.680
When I look at the photo,
I see some joy in it.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.965
You know, I see light.

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:26.340
You know, there
are clear waters.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.350
You see the shadow on
the floor of the ocean.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.080
And, to me, says
despite whatever

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.350
circumstances there are,
despite whatever hardships they

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.510
may face, there is still
a sense of happiness.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.010
There's still a
sense of resilience.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.320
There's still that
culture that bleeds

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.610
through them no matter what.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.490
The goal of my photo
in this is to change

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.660
the narrative of Haiti.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.114
You know, it's not what we see
generally or what we perceive.

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:49.900
I don't know.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.470
They're still smiling.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.610
And I think that's kind
of what's important.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.920
ANNA MARSH: Princeton has
a really incredible program

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.350
called the Bridge
Year Program that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.830
enables incoming
freshmen to spend

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.940
nine months in one of five
cities across the globe.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.310
I was really excited
about Salvador, Brazil,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.250
where I could work with an
urban gardening organization

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
and pursue a previously
established interest

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.960
in sustainable agriculture,
the environment, and also

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.060
community service.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.710
And I was able to
explore the city

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.196
and get to know other
aspects of life there.

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:26.820
A couple other
Princeton students and I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.390
got to know this
man, named Georgie,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.090
who was an instrument creator.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.310
Through this musical
and creative lens,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.957
he forgets about a
lot of other things

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.540
that are going on
in a way that can be

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.980
very positive and productive.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.780
But you're in the
presence of someone

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.810
who is so invested and
absorbed with their passion.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.450
In his kitchen setting,
he's almost forgotten to clean.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150
He's forgotten to cook.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.230
And it's as though
the only sustenance

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.830
is the beat of his drum,
the strum of his guitar.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.100
It's just him and the music,
which was a cool experience

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.607
to be there.

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:04.440
YASH HUILGOL: One of
the many considerations

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.530
I had when I got to Princeton
was my interest in doing

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.150
some sort of
international experience

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.670
and get a chance to
be exposed to a pretty

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.190
different academic
environment than Princeton.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.990
So what made this
photo, I think,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.240
particularly exciting
was it not only

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.730
had a very important
national element

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.060
to what it means to
be a British person.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.400
It also had a lot
of implications

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.590
of being a visitor in the U.K.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.960
Getting a chance to see
the British people just

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.040
get completely excited
about this giant bonfire,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.770
all these fireworks
for Guy Fawkes Day--

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.560
it's just such a
different experience.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.880
In the U.S., you
wouldn't necessarily

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.820
be celebrating an effigy
going up into flame

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.670
and having like a huge bonfire.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.790
So getting a chance to see that
just takes me back to not only

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.800
the different traditions
that go on abroad,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.400
but also the celebrations
that continue from basically

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.990
the 1700s to present.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.070
One thing about study abroad,
which is just phenomenal,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.540
is you get a chance to
see things for real.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.097
To be a part of this crazy
experience was something,

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:07.680
I think, that this
picture represents.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.030
