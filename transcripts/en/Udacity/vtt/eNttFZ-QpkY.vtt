00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.810
The answer is we want to make our discrening bear a subtype of the grizzly bear.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.470
This allows us to reuse the grizzly bear code for knocking down a tree and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.782
chasing a victim. The problem is inside chase when we eat the victim, we don't

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.850
want the bear eat behavior. We want the discerning bear to do something

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.870
different. So what this means is we need to define a new eat method inside

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.804
Discerning Bear, give it the behavior we want. So here's what the code for

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:26.754
discerning bear class looks like. The only method we need to define is eat,

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:30.914
everything else is inherited from Grizzly Bear or from Bear and what we do and

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:34.949
eat is check if the name if the victim is Dave. If it's not, we print something

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.973
and happy otherwise we eat the victim.
