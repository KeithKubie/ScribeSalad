00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:03.041
- Let the function f be defined by

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.302
f of x is equal to ax to the third plus b,

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:08.773
where a and b are constants.

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:11.638
If f of zero is equal to two,

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:13.372
and f of two is equal to three,

00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:14.704
which of the following must be true?

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:16.248
And it's a is greater than zero,

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:17.310
b is greater than zero,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.913
a is less than b, so let's
look at each of these

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:21.442
constraints right over here.

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:26.442
So, we have f of x is equal
to ax to the third plus b.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.447
And they say f of zero, so
what is f of zero going to be?

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.506
F of zero, well this
whole term is gonna be

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:35.709
a times zero to the third, so
that's just going to be zero.

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:38.312
So, f of zero's going to be equal to b,

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.577
which they tell us is equal to two,

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:43.645
so we know that b is equal to two.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:44.571
So, now we know that

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:49.571
f of x is equal to ax
to the third plus two.

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:52.701
Then they tell us f of two is three.

00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:53.776
Well, what is f of two?

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:55.912
And I'll just switch colors
somewhat arbitrarily.

00:00:55.912 --> 00:00:58.181
F of two, now, is going to be

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:02.833
a times two to the third power plus two.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.084
Well, this is going to be equal to

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:09.033
eight a plus two, and they tell us,

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:11.694
they tell us that that is equal to three.

00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:13.778
That is equal to three.

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:17.776
So, we have eight a plus
two is equal to three.

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.505
Now we can solve for a, actually,

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.443
so let's subtract two from both sides

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:24.714
and we get eight a is equal to,

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:26.370
eight a is equal to one,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.039
divide both sides by eight,

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.173
a is equal to one-eighth.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.767
So, which of these are true?

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:34.846
A is greater than zero, that's true.

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:39.366
B is greater than zero, that's true.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.969
A is less than b,
one-eighth is less than two,

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.747
that's true as well,
so all three are true.
