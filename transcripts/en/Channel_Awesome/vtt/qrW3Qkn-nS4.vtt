00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.940
Last time, in the good Star Trek movie...

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.120
A whale of a tale!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.400
It appears a probe is destroying the Earth in the hopes of finding the extinct humpback!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Desperate to hammer in an animal rights commentary,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.700
the Enterprise goes back in time to see if they can find some!

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.260
They're told time travel is dangerous,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.120
despite the fact that they've done it a billion times before

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.720
and will continue to do it a billion times after!

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.040
Yar she blows!

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.300
But this marine biologist will not hand them over so easily.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.460
She will later be banished to the same horrendous realm that Captain Decker was banished to.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.020
The whales are captured,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.660
the probe is pleased,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.500
and director Leonard Nimoy is happy this reaches an audience that lives outside their parents' basements.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.400
Will Shatner have the same luck as he takes over directing the next one?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.140
Well that depends.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.880
Do you like ladies over 50 years old doing a half-naked fan dance?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.800
Hopefully, you answered, "No!"

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:12.100
[Kirk screams "Khan!" over and over to the opening theme of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.200
And now we get one of the more famous stinkers of the Star Trek franchise,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.780
This movie has so much, and yet so little going on at the same time

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.740
that it can't help but result in an illogical mess.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.260
The harsh moments are funny,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.960
the funny moments are harsh,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.860
the characters seem like over-the-top cutouts of themselves...

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.500
it's just crazy.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.000
So let's see why this film boldly went where no film should've gone before.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.980
We open with a scavenger on Nimbus III, in the Neutral Zone,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.420
where he seems to think he can make more holes in the movie than the script can.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.800
[Drumbeat from scene in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" where Sir Launcelot charges Swamp Castle]

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.840
[Drumbeat]

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.660
[Drumbeat]

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.220
[Drumbeat]

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.420
LAUNCELOT: Ha ha!

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.540
GUARD: Hey...

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.060
SYBOK: Your pain runs deep. Share your pain with me.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.500
CRITIC: It turns out this rider is a Vulcan named Sybok,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.320
who has an incredible power to take people's pain away in a matter of seconds.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.780
Oh good, we'll need that after this movie.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.380
J'ONN: What is it you seek?

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.280
SYBOK: What all men have sought,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.380
since time began:

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.700
the ultimate knowledge.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.780
Well you're not gonna find it in the film Shatner directed.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.380
And, speaking of which, we see Shatner trying to climb his own ego,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.800
as it seems Kirk and the crew are on shore leave.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.420
McCoy watches from below, trying to see if he can have a heart attack on screen.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.500
MCCOY: God damned irresponsible...

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.360
SPOCK: Greetings, captain.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.120
(Kirk gasps)

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.860
I have been monitoring your progress.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.840
KIRK: I'm flattered.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.940
CRITIC: It's also nice to see that the innovative technology so often praised on Star Trek

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.760
has taken a backseat to Wile E. Coyote trademarks.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.000
KIRK: Why don't you go pester Dr. McCoy for a while?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.020
CRITIC: Back on Nimbus III, we see a scuzzy bar, where..

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.180
ah, gheesh.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.040
Did I mention that Shatner WROTE this, too?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.860
Mr. Shatner, I don't know why you wrote in a three-breasted cat lady in...

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.560
(as Shatner) Vanessa.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.060
Vanessa.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.120
But, she doesn't seem to be all that important...

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.740
(as Shatner) Oh, but she is. She shows 
what a run down place it is.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.580
Then she kills all the main characters except for you.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.260
(as Shatner)Yes! Everything in Star Trek has been building up to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.060
the sexual adventures of me and her three breasts.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.840
But that doesn't make sense!

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.940
Why would a cat lady...

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.500
(as Shatner) VANESSA.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.200
...Vanessa

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.040
be the big payoff in Star Trek?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.400
(as Shatner) Because it adds to the...

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.180
gravitas...

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.360
and, weight, of...

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.880
You just wanted to see this disgusting thing on screen, didn't you?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.900
(as Shatner) Just give me five scenes with her.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.620
-One.
-Four.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.480
-Two.
-Done.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.420
Ha ha ha. Shatner, ya still got it.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.980
CAITHLIN DAR: Gentlemen. I'm Caithlin Dar.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.020
CRITIC: So it turns out - oh God I can't believe I'm saying this -

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.000
a Romulan, a human, and a Klingon walk into a bar.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.460
Don't look at me, I'm sure it was written that way in the script.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.600
Erect penis hair here is a Romulan representative.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.860
In fact, they're all representatives of their governments.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.200
And they meet up in this shithole of a location -

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.620
kind of weird, they couldn't find another place to meet? -

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.120
to lay out exposition.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.920
CAITHLIN DAR: Twenty years ago, our three governments agreed to develop this planet together.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.700
ST. JOHN TALBOT: Our "new age" died a quick death.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.420
CRITIC: But their "sucks to be them" speech is interrupted by Sybok.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.020
CAITHLIN DAR: Our governments will stop at nothing to ensure our safety.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.960
SYBOK: That's exactly what I'm counting on.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.500
CRITIC: We then cut back to Camp Hammy,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.400
where Spock, Bones, and Kirk all sit around the fireplace eating beans.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.560
Uh, don't sit too close to Spock, there.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.760
MCCOY: These are from an old southern recipe handed down to me by my father.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.900
SPOCK: In that case, I have little choice but to sample your beans.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.660
GEORGE TAKEI: Ohhh myyy.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.080
KIRK: Bourbon and beans: an explosive combination.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.180
MCCOY: With that Vulcan metabolism, he could eat a bowl of termites and it wouldn't bother him.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.980
You know, you two could drive a man to drink.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.560
You really piss me off, Jim.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.780
CRITIC: Okay...take the whiskey away from him, he's clearly had his fill.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.720
MCCOY: Maybe it didn't cross that macho mind of yours that you should've been killed when you fell off that mountain.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.180
(as drunk McCoy) And another thing. What's up with the three-titted cat lady you had earlier?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.840
(as Kirk, voiceover) Vanessa.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.820
KIRK: I knew I wouldn't die, because the two of you were with me.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.360
SPOCK: I do not understand.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.800
I've always known...

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.080
I'll die alone.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.580
Or with a bald man, trapped under a bridge, gasping for air, but,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.920
I know it's one of those two.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.120
So, to be fair, that is a pretty deep scene to have in a Star Trek movie.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.460
What's it leading up to?

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.060
SPOCK: I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as, the sing-a-long.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.100
KIRK: I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we gonna sing?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.060
Wh- Bones- wh-what are we gonna sing?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.800
MCCOY: How 'bout "Camptown Races?"

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.960
"Pack Up Your Troubles."

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.660
"Moon over Rigel VII."

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.700
MCCOY: "Row, Row Your Boat."

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.060
"Row, Row, Row Your Boat!"

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.900
I love Row...d-do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.000
That song did not come up in my research, captain.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.520
The lyrics are...are very simple.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.280
It's uh...ah...

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.460
Row, row, row your boat...

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.000
Um...is this really worth playing over the hostage scene that we had going on earlier?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.360
I don't know if I see the necessity of this.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.700
KIRK: Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily/Life is but a dream/

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.900
Ah, the doctor and I will start it off,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.900
and then when we give you a signal, you jump in.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.600
Doctor, if you please.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.520
(Clears throat)

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.880
MCCOY: Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.900
They're really building up this musical interpretation, aren't they?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.400
MCCOY (singing):
Row, row, row your boat/Gently down the stream/

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.800
KIRK: Row, row, row your boat/Gently down the stream/
MCCOY: Merrily, merrilly, merrily, merrily/Life is but a dream/

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.660
EVERYBODY!

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.760
(with children singing)
Row, Row, Row your boat/Gently down the stream/

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.360
Merrily, merrily, merrily, mer...

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.420
(stops singing) What the hell are we doing?!

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.460
Are we really spending so much time on this?

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.240
Wasn't there some...government representatives that were threatened with death?

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.620
Why are we still here?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.760
KIRK AND MCCOY: Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.600
KIRK: Life...

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.960
Come on, Spock, why didn't you jump in?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.340
SPOCK: I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.740
I'm trying to comprehend the meaning of this SCENE.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.260
MCCOY: It's a song, you green-blooded...Vulcan.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.900
SPOCK: Life is not a dream.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.100
No! You're right! It's a series of questions leading up to inevitably asking,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.040
"What the hell am I doing sitting around a fireplace singing row your fucking boat?!"

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.900
KIRK: Good night, Bones.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.580
MCCOY: Good night, Jim.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.820
KIRK: Good night, Spock.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.540
SPOCK: Good night, doctor.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.900
MCCOY: Good night, Spock.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.260
SPOCK: Good night, Jim.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.400
JOHN WALTON: Good night, children.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.440
JOHN BOY: Good night, daddy.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.340
ELIZABETH: Good night, John Boy. Good night, Jim Bob.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.360
JIM BOB: Good night, Elizabeth.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.680
CRITIC: Meanwhile, we cut to a crazy Klingon who's just,

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.120
well, bored.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.020
So he looks for crazy shit to do.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.580
Riveting subplot, huh?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.300
(Speaking Klingon)

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.720
Wasn't that Nimoy's quote about the film?

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:23.960
(Speaking Klingon)

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.420
And he might get his wish.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.440
Shore leave, it appears, is cancelled due to the hostage situation,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.800
and the crew are flown back.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.900
KIRK: All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer her by.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.700
MCCOY: Melville.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.740
SPOCK: John Masefield.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.560
Are you sure about that?

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.520
I am well versed in the classics, doctor.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.500
Then how come you don't know
 "Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.260
Oh good! We get to sing it again!

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.400
Row, Row, Row your boat/Gently down the...
KIRK: I told you to

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.460
CRITIC: Aw.
KIRK: have this ship operational in two weeks,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.600
I gave you three, what happened?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.820
SCOTTY: I think you gave me too MUCH time, captain.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.100
Bridge.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.780
I hope...

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.680
I could use a shower.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.440
SPOCK: Yes.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.200
Well that wasn't nearly as important as the "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" scene,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.340
but, I still see the necessity of that line.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.360
It was to piss us off, right? 'Cause, you did a very good job.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.760
So the ship has all sorts of problems, and odds and sods that aren't fixed yet,

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.940
but that doesn't stop the Federation from sending what seems like the only captain they ever send for anything.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.520
BOB: Now I know, Enterprise is not exactly up to specs.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.480
KIRK: The Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.860
Other ships, yes,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.720
but no experienced commanders.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.300
Captain, I need Jim Kirk.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.160
Well why don't you take a ship that's not a disaster, and put Kirk on that?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.500
MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.000
KIRK: I miss my old chair.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.060
Ok, is the writing from Little Rascals? You need better jokes than these!

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.280
Actually, it DOES feel like The Little Rascals!

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.760
No, seriously. Spock's reaction is just like the dog, isn't it?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.240
KIRK: I miss my old chair.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.480
(Confused dog growl)

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.620
Stupid!

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.100
We then see the hostage footage that Sybok has sent out.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.640
CAITHLIN DAR: He requests that you send a Federation starship to parlay for our release at once.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.140
SYBOK: I deeply regret this desperate act, but these are desperate times.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.020
I have no desire to harm these innocents, but do not put me to the test,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.000
I implore you.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.840
JOKER: Oh, and, every day he doesn't, people will die.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.940
(Laughing)

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.060
CRITIC: Oh, and by the way, when did Voldemort get there?

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.880
Was the representative of Hogwarts on that planet, too?

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.080
VOLDEMORT: AVADA KEDAVRA!

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.860
SCOTTY: So, because the teleporter isn't working, they take a shuttle down to see if they can sneak in.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.200
A shuttle from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" apparently.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.780
But in order to sneak in, they need a distraction.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:05.940
(Uhura singing)

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.500
Oh God, no. No no no-no-no-no-no.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.240
Oh, Shatner, have you no shame?!

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.960
SHE COULD BE MY MOTHER!

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.780
Oh, pull the camera back. Go no closer, go no closer!

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.840
(Gagging)

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.480
(Vomits)

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.840
Oh, God, go no closer!

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.840
Oh God, I can see Uranus.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.060
Why would you do this, Shatner, WHY?!

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.480
(as aliens) Quick! Put some clothes on that woman!

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.800
Frank, gimme your robe!

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.360
-Then I'll be naked!
-Trust me, it'll be better.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.140
(normal voice) Oh God, there's gotta be something I can cut to while Calendar Girls is going on!

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.400
How long is this scene?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.700
[Ding!]
Perfect.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.660
Save me, corporate America!

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.740
...the hell kind of ad was that?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.260
Oh, anyway, is the dance over?

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.240
Oh, thank God!

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.860
UHURA: Hello, boys.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.260
I've always wanted to play to a captive audience.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.960
CRITIC (as alien): For the love of God, don't rape us.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.500
(normal voice) While that's going on, Chekov is distracting Sybok, pretending to be the captain of the ship,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.160
while Kirk and the others sneak in.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.120
J'ONN: Where are they going?

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.040
KIRK: Spock.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.680
SPOCK: Hold your horse, captain.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.680
No. He didn't say that. He didn't say...

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.020
I refuse to believe a line that stupid is in a Star Trek movie.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.840
SPOCK: Hold your horse, captain.
CRITIC: No, don't play it again, I've already repressed it.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.020
It's gone. You play that clip, all I'm gonna see is:

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.820
KIRK: Spock.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.740
(as Catherine Zeta-Jones) Do me.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.240
(normal voice) If only I could do that for the Uhura dance.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.660
(Uhura singing)

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.640
Oh, it still doesn't work!

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.580
CHEKOV: Even as we speak, a Klingon warship it on its way.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.680
We estimate arrival within the hour.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.920
SYBOK: I imagine the Klingons will be quite angry.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.900
CHEKOV: You are under attack by
 superior Federation forces.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.560
SYBOK: It wasn't bloodshed I wanted!

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.680
CHEKOV: Wait! Come back!

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.600
CRITIC (as Chekov): I'm not done meespronouncing theengs.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.620
Hand over all your wascally wabbits.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.920
(normal voice) And number five on Shatner's very bizarre bucket list finally gets fulfilled!

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.920
That's right, cats don't dance.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.380
No more pussyfooting around!

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.360
Forget it, Jake, it's Cheetara!

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.900
Oh, let's face it, it's better than:

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.040
SPOCK: Hold your horse, captain.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.000
I at least gave you the option of three to hate.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.940
But it turns out Sybok has used his power to brainwash the hostages,

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.120
and now they have Kirk captured as well.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.400
Sybok and Spock recognize each other as old friends from long ago, but Spock still refuses to join him.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.180
Thus, they're forced to fly Sybok back to their ship,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.880
all while the lead singer of Kiss closes in on them.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.400
KIRK: To get us inside, and, re-raise the shields will take...

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.280
SPOCK: Exactly 15.5 seconds.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.940
...an eternity, during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.160
KORRD: He speaks the truth.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.820
CRITIC: Wait a minute, don't they have a Klingon general there?

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.560
Why don't they just use him to tell the guy to stand down?

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.780
KIRK: Fly her in manually.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.300
CRITIC: Or, this works, too.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.960
CHEKOV: Warp speed, now.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.080
ROAD RUNNER: Meep meep!

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.460
CRITIC: So Kirk, Spock, and Bones are put in the ship's prison,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.920
while Sybok continues to brainwash the crew by taking away their pain.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.420
But we also find out some very interesting info:

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.240
KIRK: I ordered you to defend your ship!

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.120
SPOCK: You ordered me to kill my brother.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.560
KIRK: You mean he's your *brother* brother?

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.220
Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact you don't have a brother!

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.940
Technically, you are correct.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.700
There, you see?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.040
I have a half-brother.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.760
OBI-WAN GHOST: So what I told you is true...

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.600
from a certain point of view.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.460
CRITIC: Yeah, they pull the old "you never asked" trick, just so they can connect these two together.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.120
Honestly, the story would've worked just as well if they were close friends instead of brothers, but,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.640
screw it. Doesn't matter. What's Sybok's evil plan?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.460
SYBOK: My Vulcan ancestors were ruled by their emotions.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:01.020
They believed in a place in which these questions of existence would be answered.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.480
The greatest adventure of all time:

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.740
the discovery of Sha Ka Ree,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.120
at the center of the galaxy.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.940
CRITIC: So, and I swear I'm not kidding here,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.220
Sybok is literally looking for God.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.560
Oh, and I don't mean in a spiritual sense
 or look within yourself, no no!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.140
I mean physically locate him.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.580
Find out where he's been hiding.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.400
And he thinks that God's been covering up Heaven for all these years behind something called the Great Barrier.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.940
KIRK: No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier, no probe has ever returned...

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.800
CRITIC: Oh, and don't think I'm misinterpreting 
that this is God or Heaven,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.040
because he literally uses those terms later.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.940
SYBOK: The place from which creation sprang.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.820
Heaven, Eden, call it what you will.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.340
KIRK: God's a busy man.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.840
CRITIC: Yeah, kinda hard to believe they're really going here.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.120
I mean, it's pretty hard not to be let down when you're being promised GOD in your movie.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.940
That's kind of a lot of buildup!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.380
SCOTTY: What are you standin' around for? Do you not know a jailbreak when you see one?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.060
CRITIC: But Scotty breaks them out of their cell, and tells them where he thinks they can get a distress signal out.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.240
And, is it me, or is the placement of those pipes really kinda stupid?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.980
KIRK: Mr. Scott, you're amazing!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.780
SCOTTY: Well there's nothin' amazing about it, I know this ship like the back of my hand.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.680
(Bonk!)

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.840
[Three Stooges theme]

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.920
CRITIC: They start climbing to get to their location, but Spock believes he has found a faster way.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.800
SPOCK: I believe I have found a faster way.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.480
CRITIC: Oh, and never mind the obvious shadow of the lift holding him up.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.660
I'm sure it's just the shadow of his really fat wallet in his back pocket or something.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.500
SPOCK: It appears we're too heavy.
KIRK: Must be all those marshmallows.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.160
Fire the rockets!

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.620
CRITIC: Wait a minute. What was the order of the decks they passed?

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.620
Fifty-two...

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.740
sixty-four...

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.020
sixty-THREE...

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.260
fifty-two again...

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.300
seventy-seven...

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.120
seventy-eight...

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.320
seventy-eight again...

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.300
and then the ceiling.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.040
No, why did you stop? Apparently the layout of this ship is like a video game glitch!

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.360
Keep going higher and higher, and yet somehow you keep getting lower and lower.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.220
Go through the ceiling! I'm sure you'll end up at the floor again.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.380
But they're caught once again, and Sybok decides to have a little chat.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.060
SYBOK: I want your respect.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.860
Are you afraid to hear me out?

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.880
Wait outside.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.180
Ok. Beat him up.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.320
(Punching noises)

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.900
I mean, come on, guys! You outnumber him three to one!

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.820
He has no weapons! Just hold a knife up to his throat and say, "give me back the goddamned ship, you pointy-eared Sean Connery!"

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.500
SYBOK: Your pain is the deepest of all.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.760
I can feel it. Can't you?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.780
CRITIC: But, instead, we see Sybok try to take away the pain of Bones and Spock,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.680
in the hopes of winning them to his side.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.440
MCCOY: Father? Oh my God, don't do this to me.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.000
I'm here.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920
I'm with you, dad.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.080
CRITIC: Now, to be fair, this scene is very well done,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:07.220
as we see the pains our characters suffer, and even discover that, many times, our pain helps in forming who we are.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.580
KIRK: Dammit Bones, you're a doctor. You know that pain and guilt can't be taken away with a wave of a magic wand.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.520
They're the things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.420
I don't want my pain taken away! I need my pain!

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.820
CRITIC: Well fair enough statement, but, all I'm thinking is:

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.400
how the fuck is he making these images appear?

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.440
He never did in the opening, and you never see it with anyone else.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.560
And we're told it's not just inside their minds, as clearly all four of them can see the visuals.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.480
And on top of that, where DID this power come from, anyway?

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.060
It's not like psychiatry where he talks to 'em, he just sort of looks at them and the pain goes away.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.540
Where'd he learn to do it? How's it being accomplished?

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.860
N...ever addressed.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.400
We just assume that he's a Vulcan Jesus.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.960
A...Vesus.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.500
SPOCK: I have found myself, and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.180
CRITIC: Sybok's brainwashing doesn't 
seem to work on them, but,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.580
they decide to join him anyway, because they're as curious as he is.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.000
Um, you sure you didn't brainwash 'em?

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.500
SULU: They say, no ship can survive this.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.240
SYBOK: I say they're wrong. I say the danger is an illusion.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.340
CRITIC: Well, apparently it IS an illusion.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.400
Because, not only do they make it through with no problem whatsoever -

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.860
I mean, the ship doesn't even shake -

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.820
but they literally do it in the span of just a couple of seconds.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.060
How is this the great danger they were talking about?!

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.440
Were all the ships in the galaxy just like,

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.280
"Duhhh, looks dangerous!"

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.140
and never went in?

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.120
What kind of explorers are these?

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.420
To boldly go where no man has g...bullSHIT!

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.340
To cowardly run away from anything that looks different!

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.800
The Great Barrier's about as threatening as the Ring of Fire from Finding Nemo!

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.720
Terrifying!

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.280
So they take a shuttle down to planet...Heaven,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.980
and come across something big.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.380
(as Spock) It appears we're in the remains of a brontosaurus burger, captain.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.440
"GOD": Welcome.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.140
MCCOY: Is this the voice of...God?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.140
One voice. Many faces.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.520
Does this better suit your expectations?

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.640
The Cowardly Lion is God?

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.220
(as the Cowardly Lion) I'm the Messiah, 
I'm the Messiah, hallelujah!

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.400
"GOD": The journey you undertook to reach me 
could not have been an easy one.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.360
Actually, it was disgustingly easy.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.100
Kinda like stepping through a light fog.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.820
"GOD": And how did you breach the Barrier?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.000
SYBOK: With a starship.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.300
Could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.420
KIRK: Excuse me.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.980
Yes, Kirk, do you ingeniously want to point out the painfully obvious?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.260
KIRK: What does God need with a starship?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.160
"GOD": Bring the ship...

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.260
I said, what does God need with a starship?

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.740
CRITIC: I think the real question is, what does KIRK need with a WIRE strapped to his back?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.720
KIRK: Why is God angry?

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.780
SPOCK: You did not answer his question. What does God need with a starship?

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.100
CRITIC (as Spock): All right, I'm convinced. He's God.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.060
"GOD": The ship. I must have the ship!

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.540
Now, to be fair, according to most texts,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.000
God has asked for a lot of bizarre things:

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.040
"Jesus, die on the cross."
"What?"

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.820
"Abraham, kill your son."
"Huh?"

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.320
"Moses, wander through the desert for about 40 years."
"What the fu--?"

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.000
Asking for a starship almost sounds reasonable.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.380
"GOD": An eternity I've been imprisoned in this place...

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.920
CRITIC: But they are now convinced that this is not any god at all, so,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.540
what is he then?

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.600
SYBOK: Reveal yourself to me.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.160
(laughing)

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.880
"GOD" (as Sybok): What's wrong?
 Don't you like this face?

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.820
CRITIC: What a...twist?

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.880
I don't even get it. It's him but it's not him?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.400
They never really explain it.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.980
SYBOK: This is my doing. This is my arrogance...my vanity.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.760
CRITIC: I am you and you are me.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.700
HUGH SIMON: I am Hugh.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.260
JUDGE MAXWELL: You are me?

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.260
I am HUGH.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.380
CRITIC: So Sybok tries to fight off the...whatever,

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.820
as Kirk has his ship fire a torpedo at it.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.780
It kills Sybok, but doesn't seem to destroy the entity.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:49.540
But the teleporter starts working, but can only beam up two people, so Kirk says, beam up Spock and Bones.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.920
"GOD": Yooooouuuuuu...

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.900
("God" continues sceeaming)
SCOOBY DOO: Scooby dooby doo!

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.040
CRITIC: But the Klingon ship arrives -

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.920
funny, I guess that's TWO ships that made it through the HORRIFYING Great Barrier -

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.400
and destroys the beast with its laser gun.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:16.660
So a photon torpedo barely hurts it, but few shots from a tiny laser kills it off?

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.520
SPOCK: Logical.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:25.020
He's then beamed aboard the ship, where it turns out that Spock convinced the Klingon general to outrank the crazy guy chasing him.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.960
Just like they should've done BEFORE...oh God, who cares? The movie's almost over.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.120
Let's just hear our half-assed moral that even Veggie Tales could tell us.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.260
MCCOY: Is God really out there?

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.140
KIRK: Maybe He's not out there, Bones.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.540
Maybe He's right here...human heart.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.260
Well one place He definitely isn't is in this script.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.200
Why? Because no loving God would ever let us end on this scene:

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.900
[Spock playing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"]

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.860
(Screams) Are you fucking serious?!

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.400
You're really bringing it back to this scene?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.080
Like, this was the big favorite in all the movie?

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.560
You know what, when it's paced this way, it almost seems like nothing happened!

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.400
(as Kirk) Bones, did we do a weird thing where we searched for God and Spock lost his brother?

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.560
(as McCoy) It's not mentioned in the next Star Trek movie; I don't care.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.240
[Kirk, Spock, and McCoy sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" in rounds]

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.480
Roll, roll, the credits, quickly cross the screen...oh, thank you.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.100
Whew! That was Star Trek V,

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.200
and let me tell you, for a movie about finding God,

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.860
I really feel like nothing was accomplished.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.200
At times it can have some good moments,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.160
even some good character development, but,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.320
a lot of the scenes don't tie together, a lot of characters seem pointless,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.140
the comedy is really bad, and plus,

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.760
the story is just beyond ridiculous.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.940
I felt closer to finding God in "History of the World, Part I" than I do in this film!

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.780
And, granted, the next film IS a lot better,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.360
but we still have a whole 'nother generation of movies to fuck it up.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.180
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.960
[Star Trek II theme]

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.600
[Record scratches]

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.480
(Children singing)
Row, row, row your boat/Gently down the stream/

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.640
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily/Life is but a dream/

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:21.340
[Song continues]

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.440
[Song fades out]

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.440
SPOCK: I have little choice but to sample your beans.
