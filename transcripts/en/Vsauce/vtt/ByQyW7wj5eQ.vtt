Violin skulls and the most popular social
networks by country.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.560
It's episode 51 of IMG!

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.700
Our Sun is big, like really, really big.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.800
Take a look at this photo of the transit of Venus.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.240
Brady Haran pointed this out to me.
Venus is pretty big.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.600
Almost the size of Earth, but the Sun in this
photo is huge and to put it in perspective,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.840
in this photo the Sun is 67 million miles
further away from us.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.960
But more seriously, what colour is the Moon?
I mean, it's easy to think that the Moon is

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.969
just a bright, white silvery grey.
But a lot of that brightness is an illusion,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.479
caused by the fact that the Moon is brighter
than everything around it.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:01.259
In fact, the Moon only reflects 12% of the
light that hits it from the Sun, which means

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.120
the Moon is quite dim.
In fact, it's about the same colour as asphalt,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.850
which means that if you were to put the Moon
and Earth in equal illumination, the Moon

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.220
would look like this.
And if you follow @tweetsauce, last week you

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.940
would have seen how shallow the oceans are
compared to the radius of the Earth.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.960
If you were to take all the water on Earth
and collect it into a single ball, it would

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.380
only be this large.
Mountains and valleys on Earth's surface are

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.480
even more puny compared to its overall size.
If you were to take the Earth and shrink it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.790
down to the proportions of a pool ball, the
Earth would be smoother than an actual pool

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.160
ball.
But I guess what really matters is that you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.710
should be careful kissing these lips.
And in case of trouble, call on these superhero

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.890
lips to save the day.
Nicholas Night's "Social network" series makes

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.770
Facebook a bit more real.
This one is called "Joining a group."

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.760
"Reached a new high score in Mafia Wars."

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.900
"Only some friends see you."

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.380
And "Being a fan of."
Now, a few days ago on Reddit, this giant

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.060
collection of Facebook timeline covers showed up.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.799
You've got Tetris, fencing, funny walks,
states of matter and more.

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.339
Reddit also showed me that with the right
positions and camera angle, you can hide not

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.980
one, but two extra people.
Moving on.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.620
On a secluded Mexican island a local man
has been decorating trees with people.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.189
Baby people.
But in Morocco the trees are just full of

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.329
climbing goats.
Oh and these woods?

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.219
There's a hidden face.
See if you can find the face, but be careful.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.069
Post-It notes can be decoration,
like building-sized decorations.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.260
Or just hang yourself off a building by lying
on top of it and looking up at your reflection.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.660
Robert The carves old books into elaborate shapes.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.940
And this artist stacks and crams book pages,
magazines and newspapers into amazing designs,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.840
including people.
Here's a barn that's actually a converted

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.920
water tower.
And if you're afraid your beard might fall

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.060
off, you better grow a beard strap.
If you're wondering why all of these animals

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.489
are so satisfied, the answer is simple.
Animals are using  the Internet.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.720
Not a fan of animals?
Well, suit yourself.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.520
Expect along with the reflection that looks
like it says something else.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.140
And sculptures love escaping.
In Japan, KitKats are much more diverse.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.240
They've got flavours like pumpkin, potato,
sweet corn, even watermelon and salt.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.120
Mashable shared a diverse collection of geeky cufflinks.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.000
QR codes, typewriter keys, floppy disks and likes.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.010
Now for something less diverse, look at your zipper.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.700
Chances are it says "YKK."
90% of zippers in the world are made by the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.140
YKK group.
Keep being saucy.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.500
And as always,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.060
thanks for watching.
