00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.620
[Captioned by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Guys, today we are outside
in the great big wilderness

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.400
because we're going to be testing
out ten different life hacks

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.640
designed for camping.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.660
These are all things
that I've seen online

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.680
that seem like they could be really cool, and I want to put them to the test

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.800
to see how well they actually work.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.300
The first life hack were going to
be testing out is using plastic

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.540
drinking straws to make yourself
single-serve containers of spices.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.200
To start off, we'll take a pair of pliers
or a multi-tool, and pinch one end

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.520
of the straw really near the end.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.680
Using a lighter,
melt the end of the straw,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.980
and it should seal shut.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.540
Once you have one end
of the straw sealed,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.100
decide how much spice you want in it,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.440
and cut the straw there.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.060
Now, just take the straw
and kind of push it down into the spice,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.380
until it's as full as you want it to be.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200
Be sure to leave enough space at the top

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.500
that you're able to pinch
the top of the straw without it

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.080
binding into the spices.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.440
Now, just like when we started,
use your lighter to seal it off.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.500
At this point, we have
a waterproof container

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.700
that might even be airtight
full of the spices our choice.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.560
When we're ready to use it,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.500
we can just cut it open
and pour it over our food.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.000
I would say that this definitely
does work pretty well.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.340
I'm doing it while I'm already
out here in the wilderness,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.400
where as this is really something
you want to do at home

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.020
to prepare to go camping.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.960
If you're already out here,
and you have the spices,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.100
then of course, you don't need
to put them in smaller containers.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.300
They're already in--
You already got them.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.720
You don't need to bring them out with you.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.860
But this does definitely work.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.260
I'm going to be using this in the future.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700
Our next camping hack is supposed
to help you carry firewood

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.940
as you're walking around,
trying to gather it all up.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640
It involves taking two sticks,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.580
and tying two or three lengths
of paracord in between them,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.860
to then form a sort of carrier that
you can put the rest of the wood in.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.880
Now, I don't anticipate this
working any better or worse

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.800
because I have a neon rainbow piece
of paracord, but I guess it's possible.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.500
I'm good at knots.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.860
Got a bunch of pieces of firewood.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.680
I tried to make sure that
they're all long enough,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.580
that they span from
one string to the other.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.840
Let's give this thing a shot.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.700
That was pretty neat
and that's probably more

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.480
than I can easily gather up in my arms.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.600
So this is works pretty slick.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.720
Next up, we're going to test a hack
that lets you have a bar of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.400
soap near your washing station,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940
and fit it into the foot
on a pair of nylons

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.760
and you're then able to lather
up right through the material

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.160
without having to take the bar of soap,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.100
and then set it down on
something dirty or grungy.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.280
That's uh, that's stretchy.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.700
Now, we'll hang this from our table next

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.100
to a jug of water and we should be
able to use it to wash your hands.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.000
With soap and a nylon,
might look a little bit strange

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.580
but it works pretty well.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.740
I'm able to lather up my hands
right through the cloth,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.760
and then I don't have to set
the soap down on the ground

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.060
or anything covered in dirt.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.680
Our next camping hack teaches us
a way that we can dry off our shoes

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.280
if we've unfortunately stepped
in a stream or something like that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.580
by letting them sit overnight
with a t-shirt filling the shoe,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.100
and in theory, by morning,
it should be dry.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.900
So this one we're going to let go
overnight and see how it works.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.700
Of course if it gets completely dry,
it's going to depend on the temperature

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.920
and the humidity and everything
else going on around you, but

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.040
we should be able to see at least
if one is more dry than the other.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.100
The next test is for a camping hack
that's been floating around the internet

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.940
for about as long as I can remember.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.480
The idea is that you
can take a headlamp,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.260
strap it to the side of a jug of water,
and it will provide a lantern

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.440
that will just beautifully
light everything up .

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.600
We're going to try that out.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.700
So there's our headlamp
attached to the jug of water,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.300
and it's putting off light kind of all around,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.600
which is what we were hoping for.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.016
The question is whether
this is actually worth doing.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.520
Here's how much it's going right now.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.100
It does provide some light, maybe if
you were playing cards on this table,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.700
it would be enough to play by,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.160
But if we take the headlamp off,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.940
I would say we actually have quite a bit
more light just using the light bulb itself.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.100
So here's my thought.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.300
If you have a headlamp instead of taking
it off and strapping it on to the milk jug,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.180
just wear it on your head and you
can see everything you need to.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.800
I don't think this life hack is worth it.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300
Next up is had to take an aluminum can
a tea light to make a lantern

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.360
that's supposed to light up a large area.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.000
We'll start by cutting a slit

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.500
from near the bottom of the can
to near the top and then moving

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.300
sideways kind of cutting
a big letter "I" into our can.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.560
Well, then take the two sides, and fold
them open, and place the tea light inside.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.300
We can now see a side-by-side
comparison of a candle in our little can

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.500
and a candle that's
just sitting on the table.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.860
I'm not sure if there's a lot more light
coming out of the one on the can

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.660
but there are a couple
advantages I can see.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.889
The light is a little bit more directed
and if you're trying to do something specific

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.620
that might be really helpful,
but I would say the best use

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.600
is that this candle is flickering a lot

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.700
and when there's any gust of wind it
almost gets put out

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.500
and if there's any strong wind it
would go out, so the can really does

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.580
a good job of shielding the candle
from being blown out by a slight breeze.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.300
I don't think it's gonna make a huge
difference in terms of how much

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.600
brightness is getting put off,
but at least it protects it from the wind,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.920
and I'd say that's an
advantage worth knowing.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.580
Our next campaign hack is one
that intrigued me quite a bit.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.880
It involves using a hollowed-out
half of an orange and some vegetable oil

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.400
to make an oil lamp
candle kind of thing,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.380
and why you are camping and
have an orange and some oil

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.060
but not say a lantern or
just a normal candle,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.860
I'm not sure, but I still
really want to try this out.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.560
Our orange is cut in half,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.960
and the goal is to remove all of the fruit

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.800
but leave this fibrous center stem portion.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.000
That's actually what we're
going to try and use as the wick.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.960
All right. We've got our orange
pretty much cleared out now.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.900
We've still got the center fiber stem bit.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.340
So now we need to try filling
the orange with some vegetable oil.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.900
The lifehack didn't specify
if there's a good way to keep

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.420
your orange from tipping over.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.400
Well, so far, I'm definitely having
a bit of trouble getting that to light.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.400
Maybe it's still too full of orange
juice need to dry it off more.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.100
We had to dry out the wick and then
it took I'd say at least two

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.200
minutes of concentrated lighter
fire to really get that to catch.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.220
So you've got that, you might
have all of your light covered.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.340
But it does seem to be burning now.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.560
Not very strong.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.480
I think a good sneeze would put it out.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.960
Now, we're going to test a method
of making some campfire popcorn

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.800
using popcorn, oil,
aluminum foil and a stick.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.160
The idea is that we'll pour some
popcorn and some oil into the foil,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.220
hold it over into sort of a pouch,
and then we'll use two of the corners

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.900
to reach up and connect onto our stick,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.620
and then we'll be able to put
that whole contraption into the fire

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.800
over some coals and we should be

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.220
able to get some popcorn
popping inside the pouch.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.500
Probably still not going to be
anywhere near all the way popped.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.420
Lookie at that.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.200
There are still some unpopped
kernels and the ones that stayed

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.040
near the bottom did get fairly singed,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.700
but I would say that's more of an issue

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.700
of my technique than anything else.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.820
I think with a little bit more practice.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.100
I could make this work out pretty nicely.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.580
So we've got the one shoe that
had the T-shirt stuff down into it,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.900
and we have one shoe that
did not have anything in it,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.220
just trying feel a difference between them.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.200
It's actually been sitting
out here in a fair bit

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.240
of sunshine for a couple hours now.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.700
As it was, both of
the shoes were mostly dry.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.400
But the shoe without the t-shirt in it
was definitely a little bit more wet

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.100
down along the seams,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.100
Both of the upper portions of
the shoe were just the same,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.000
they both felt dry inside and out.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.520
But the one without the shirt
definitely had more water,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.300
you know, pooling down in these areas
where there isn't as much circulation.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.600
I think the T-shirt really did do a good
job of helping absorb that portion

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.160
of the water because
the shoe with the t-shirt in it

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.200
felt more uniformly dry, even though
both of them were doing pretty well.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.500
The next camping hack we want to test
once again involves half of an orange,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.260
and it's to see if we can cook a
cinnamon roll inside the orange peel

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.580
in the coals of the fire.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.900
Now, we'll take this.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.040
Let's put it in some coals, and just
leave it there and see how well it cooks.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.900
The cinnamon roll might be expanding
beyond the boundaries of our orange Peel.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.480
I don't like putting things in
orange peels. It doesn't work well.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.080
You will need to stop having this idea.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.700
Update on the cinnamon roll,
it very quickly expanded

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.160
beyond the boundaries
set by the orange peel,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.200
Parts of it sticking out
started burning and a lot of it

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.560
in the middle is still completely raw.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.280
I'm not liking the look of this one.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.020
Ah!

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.700
Taking a look at our cinnamon roll
cooked in an orange peel.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.940
Honestly, I came across
a lot of issues with this one.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.900
First off, the cinnamon roll quickly
began to expand and it grew to the point

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.680
where it's much larger than
the orange peel it was sitting in.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.900
The parts that reached
over the edge of the orange peel

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.000
very quickly started to burn and the
middle is still just incredibly doughy.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.200
This is not ready to eat.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.900
This part over here is just
burnt to straight charcoal.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.100
That's that's completely
inedible right there.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.700
Scoop it out of the orange.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.220
The bottom of our orange peel
has started to burn right through.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.020
So that's not providing
much of a barrier there.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.600
Let's burn bits.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.120
We probably do have some parts
of this that are edible.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.253
It's like charcoal and orange.

00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:21.000
In the end, there may be a great way
to go to cinnamon roll inside of an orange

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.580
peel but I don't think it's worth it.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.800
The method I chose just
failed in every possible way.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.600
I would not eat this at all.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.900
I would rather just take the dough
and wrap it around a stick

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.500
and carefully cook that over the fire.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.900
It's a lot more likely to work.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.480
Our next camping hack is for if you
find yourself in a situation

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.180
where you don't have quite
enough dishes to eat off of.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.320
The idea is that you can
take aluminum foil,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.300
mold them around something
that is dish shaped,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.800
and then use that to eat out of.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.400
Making this dish out of foil.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.800
We're just wrapping around the bowl,
but one of the key elements is

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.900
that you're supposed to
take all the extra foil

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.500
sort of crumpled that and pinch it
down to be a rim

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.600
that will help reinforce
the strength of the dish.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.260
There's one, let's try the same
thing using our propane canister.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.780
We've now got two small
dishes made of aluminum foil

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.400
and we need to test
how well these will actually work.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.900
Obviously, they hold their own shape.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.500
I think it's just a matter of how
useful they are at this point.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.800
Let's take the smaller one and fill
it up some water to see how it does.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.660
That way we can see if it work as a cup,
maybe a small bowl if you're eating soup.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.620
Seems to be holding up okay.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.800
It is warping a little bit as I'm holding it,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.020
kinda give it some support
from beneath really, but

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.580
but if you had soup,
maybe it can.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.040
You heated that up in the fire,
and didn't have anything out of,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.000
this could probably work for that.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.680
I was thinking I was going to try
and put this container in the fire

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.840
to see if I could get the water to boil in it,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.220
but I think even if I got it to boil,
there's no way I would ever be

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.500
able to get this container
back out of the fire.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.740
At that point, the foil would be too hot
for me to grab and this is far too flimsy

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.420
of a container to try and pick
up with something like sticks.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.040
Using our bigger container,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.280
we're going to use this little
desert moon pie and see how well

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.260
this dish works just for eating out of.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.760
I think the problem arises when
you want to use it as a normal plate.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.660
This isn't exactly something
you can use utensils on.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.540
I'm pretty sure it's just going
to cut right through the bottom.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.300
Now, this cookie dessert that I'm
cutting up is actually extremely soft,

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.820
and I could just cut it with a spoon,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.180
but using it with a normal fork and knife,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.020
I think you can see that I've
managed to stab some holes

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.820
right through the bottom of this plate.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.260
This is just aluminum foil.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.060
It's extremely thin even with
the double layer that I made.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.180
So, while these aren't terribly practical,

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.920
you may very well find yourself in a
situation where it's exactly what you need.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.260
It's just something to put food
in that you can scoot back out

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.480
and eat rather than having to use
your hands or something like that.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.240
Ten camping life hacks put to the test.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.320
Some worked great,
some didn't work at all.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.620
If you know any other
camping hacks or life hacks

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.000
that you want to see us put to the test,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.320
let us know down in the comments.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.460
Guys, that's not all,
we've got more for you to see.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.200
That little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.520
You should go check that out.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.640
The box at the bottom will show you what
YouTube thinks you need to be watching next,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.940
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to our channel

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.280
so you never miss a video.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.480
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we will see you in the next one.
