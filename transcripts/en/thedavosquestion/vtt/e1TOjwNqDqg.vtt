00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.340
Hello I'm Esnot Gandwe and I'm from Malawi.
I'm part of a network of global change makers

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.320
from around the world who are recently here
in Cape Town to have a discussion on the issues

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.050
that effect them and their country. The 2010
question is a very good question to ask and

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.350
I feel that 2010, even though it is in South
Africa, the effect of it will ripple around

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.880
the countries, the rest of the countries in
Africa. And this is mainly because, coming

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.560
form Malawi, the world cup as itself, the
world cup, it's the world cup, so many people

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.810
from around the world will be coming here.
South Africa can not

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.640
[pause]

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.160
contain the whole world. So teams will be
training in other parts of, especially Southern

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.190
Africa. So Malawi is one of them. So we'll
have many teams coming in to train on our

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.300
fields which will bring in a lot of tourists.
Which will bring in a lot of recognition on

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.830
their country as a whole. Ans which will bring
in benefits. So even though the world cup

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.330
as itself, the cup is in South Africa, the
effect of this world cup will be felt all

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.000
over Africa.
