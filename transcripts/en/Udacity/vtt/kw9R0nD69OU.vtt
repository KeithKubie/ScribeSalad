00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.462
Okay, so the first linear transformation algorithm we're going to

00:00:02.462 --> 00:00:05.540
discuss, is something called Principal Components Analysis. Okay Michael?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.560
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.920
&gt;&gt; Now just to be clear here, the amount of time it would take me

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.100
to derive Principal Components Analysis and work it

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.920
all out in its gory detail would take

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.550
forever and so I'm not going to do that,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.490
I'm going to leave that to reading. But I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.740
want people to understand what Principal Components Analysis

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.860
actually does and what its properties are, okay?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.670
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.210
so, Principal Components Analysis has a long history.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.670
It's a particular example of something called an eigenproblem.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.229
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.102
&gt;&gt; Okay. It's a particular example something called an

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.040
eigenproblem which you either already know what that means

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.780
or you don't. And if you don't then it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.758
means you haven't read the material that we've given

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:45.090
you so I'm going to ask you to do that. But, whether you have or have not let

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.250
me just kind of give you an idea of what

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.690
Principal Components Analysis actually does. And I think the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.920
easiest way to do that is with a very simple two dimensional example. So

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.950
here's my very simple two dimensional example.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.132
All right, so you see this picture Michael?

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:57.778
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:01.940
&gt;&gt; So this is a bunch of dots sampled from some distribution

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.260
that happens to lie on a two dimensional plane like this, okay?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.230
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.050
&gt;&gt; Now, what, so this is in fact two dimension. So we have two

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.691
features here, we'll just call them x and y. We could have called them

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.536
one and two, it doesn't really matter, this is just

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:19.020
the x, y plane. And let me tell you what Principal

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.360
Components Analysis actually does. What Principal Components Analysis does, is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.510
it finds directions of maximal variance. Okay, does that make sense?

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.310
&gt;&gt; Variance of what?

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.530
&gt;&gt; The variance of the data. So if I had to pick a single direction

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.990
here, such that if I projected it onto

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.170
that dimension, onto that direction, onto that vector.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.520
And then, I computed the variance. Like, literally the variance of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.890
the points that were projected on there. Which direction will be maximal?

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.810
&gt;&gt; I would think it would be the one, that is

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.010
sort of diagonal. It kind of, blobs along that particular direction.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.517
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly right. And, and to see

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:59.349
that, imagine that we projected all of these points onto

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.080
just the x dimension. That's the same thing as

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.200
just taking that particular feature. Well, if we projected all

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.430
of them down, we would end up with all of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.729
our points living in this space. And when we compute

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.390
the variance, the variance is going to be something that captures

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.810
the distribution between here and here. Does that make sense?

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.880
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.456
&gt;&gt; Similarly, if we projected it onto the y axis. Which is the equivalent of.

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:25.420
&gt;&gt; Those are examples of feature selection.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.950
&gt;&gt; Yes, of fea, it's exactly, it's a, it's a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.250
feature selection. It's equivalent of just looking at the second feature

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.560
here, y. I'm going to end up comput having a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.160
variance that spans this space between here and here. By

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.560
contrast, if we do what you want to do,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.170
Michael and we pick a direction that is about 45

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100
degrees if I drew this right. We would end

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.160
up projecting points between here and here. Now, it's not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.380
as easy to see in this particular case but the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.710
variance of points as they get projected onto this line

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.670
will have a much higher variance than on

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.788
either of these two dimensions. And in particular it

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:03.156
turns out that for data like this which I've

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.076
drawn as an oval that you know sort of

00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:09.300
has an axis at it's 45 degrees, this direction or axis is in fact the one that

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.030
maximizes variance. So, Principal Components Analysis, if it had

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.710
to find a single dimension would pick this dimension.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.850
Because it is the one that maximizes variance. Okay, you got it?

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.830
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.400
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now. What's the second thing what's the second component

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.170
that PCA or Principal Components Analysis would find. Do you know?

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.670
&gt;&gt; I don't know what you mean by second. This

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.820
is now a direction. That ha, that has high variance.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.089
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.319
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.773
&gt;&gt; The first one.

00:03:40.773 --> 00:03:41.440
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.920
&gt;&gt; because it seems like you know either the x or the y is

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640
pretty high or something that looks just like that red line but it's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.610
just a little bit tilted from it would also be very, very high.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.630
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly right so, in fact

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.520
what Principal Components Analysis does is it has

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.940
one other constraint that I haven't told you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.450
about. And that constraint is, it finds directions that

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.620
are mutually orthogonal. So in fact, since there

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.010
are only two dimensions here, the very next thing

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.210
that Principal Components Analysis would do, is it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.070
would find a direction that is orthogonal or we

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.470
think about it in two dimensions, as

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.220
perpendicular to the first component that it found.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.430
&gt;&gt; I see. So there really only, really only is one choice at that point.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.845
&gt;&gt; That's right. Or. You know there is two choices

00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:21.540
because you, doesn't matter which direction you pick in principal.
