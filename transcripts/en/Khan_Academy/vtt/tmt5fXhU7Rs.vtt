00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.055
- [Voiceover] What is the
perimeter of the figure below?

00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:06.214
So down here, we have this figure,

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:09.381
and we are asked to find the perimeter

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.125
of this figure.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.423
Perimeter is the distance

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:18.550
all the way around the outside of a shape.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.425
So in this case,

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.239
if I were to walk around the outside,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.160
or maybe a human's too big,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.104
if an awesome little ant was to walk

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:28.160
all the way around the
outside of this figure,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.660
how far she walked would be the perimeter.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.981
So to find that, what we can do is

00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.680
figure out how long is this side,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.783
and then combine it with
the length of this side,

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:42.064
and combine it with the
length of this side,

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:45.306
and once we combine all
of the side lengths,

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:46.698
we'll have the perimeter,

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:51.167
or the distance around
the outside of the figure.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.107
So let's start, we can start up here.

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:54.587
We can see that this side length

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.254
is five centimeters.

00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:59.614
So we have five centimeters,

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:02.195
plus, moving down the side here,

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.860
we have another three centimeters,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.209
and then going across,

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.042
next distance is four centimeters.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:16.372
After that, we go down
this side right here,

00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:20.346
which is another four centimeters,

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:23.225
and as we keep going,

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:25.635
across the bottom,

00:01:26.702 --> 00:01:29.277
we have another nine centimeters.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:32.779
And then, we head up this side, and uh oh,

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:33.753
we don't have a label.

00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:35.882
We don't know how far this is.

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:37.361
But to find perimeter,

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:40.633
we need the distance
around the entire outside.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.565
If this little ant,

00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:43.123
she walked the whole way,

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:46.966
we've gotta know the
entire distance she walked.

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.139
So what we can do is,

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:50.363
we can look over here and say,

00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:53.763
this length right here
is three centimeters.

00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:56.662
Well then, that same length over here

00:01:56.662 --> 00:01:58.829
is also three centimeters.

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.282
And where that three centimeters left off,

00:02:03.282 --> 00:02:05.194
this four centimeters,

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:07.147
this length, picked up.

00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:08.814
So from here to here

00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:12.180
is another four centimeters.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.948
So if we have four centimeters

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:18.299
plus another three centimeters,

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.716
that's a total of seven more centimeters.

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:25.531
So now we know the entire,

00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.096
all of the lengths, around the outside.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:31.358
So if we combine them or add them,

00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:33.820
we'll know the perimeter.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.320
So we can start, five plus three is eight.

00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:42.009
Four plus four is another eight.

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.409
Nine plus seven, let's
see, instead of seven,

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.815
I could do nine plus one and six,

00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:47.823
'cause that's the same as seven.

00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:49.586
Nine plus one is 10,

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.419
and 10 plus six is 16.

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:55.300
Eight plus eight is another 16,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.383
so we have a 16 and a 16.

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:00.348
16, let's see, six ones

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:02.848
plus six more ones is 12 ones,

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:06.169
and one 10 plus another 10,

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.836
or 10 plus 10 is 20.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.943
So another way we could add this

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:13.331
is 20 plus 12, which is a total

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.164
of 32.

00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:18.219
And we're talking about centimeters here,

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.719
so 32 centimeters.

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.748
The distance all the way around

00:03:23.748 --> 00:03:25.697
the outside of this figure,

00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:28.560
or the perimeter of the figure,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.060
is 32 centimeters.
