LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.870
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.660
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.640
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.930
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.520
meet up with a Googler
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.955
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:18.250
and why they do it.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.524
Today, we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:23.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.150
Hi everybody, and
welcome to this episode

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.680
of "Coffee With A Googler."

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.010
Today, I'm going to be meeting
with Lauren Dale, who's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.010
a product marketing
manager here at Google.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.749
Word is that she's responsible
for a lot of Google I/O.

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.040
So Lauren, thanks for coming
and meeting with me today.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.630
How are you?

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.970
LAUREN DALE: Good.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.178
Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:39.370
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: We're
so happy to have you.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.500
You're a product marketing
manager at Google.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.458
What does that involve?

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:44.094
What do you do?

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:46.510
LAUREN DALE: So I'm on our
Developer Marketing team, which

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.550
means that we make sure
developers know about all

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.920
of our latest and greatest
products and APIs,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.930
how to use them and
where to find them.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.030
A big part of that is
planning Google I/O.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.920
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So now, I hear you

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.570
are one of the VIPs responsible
for bringing the awesomeness

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.010
that is I/O to developers.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.940
Can tell us a bit
about it this year?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.216
LAUREN DALE: Sure.

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:04.840
Well, to begin, I'm
not the only VIP.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.070
There are a lot of
people who are involved

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.120
in bringing I/O to life.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.186
LAURENCE MORONEY: But thanks
for taking the time out

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:11.686
from planning to
meet with us today.

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:12.950
LAUREN DALE: Sure, no problem.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.450
I/Os going to be happening again
in San Francisco at Moscone

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.260
West from May 28th
through the 29th.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.840
Developers can expect a lot of
really inspirational sessions,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.120
one to one time with Googlers
to ask all their burning

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.609
questions, and a lot of
interactive experiences

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.900
in our Sandbox base so they
can actually touch and feel

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.190
and play with our products.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.398
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so we
talked about the Sandbox,

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:35.060
and I was at Google
I/O last year,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.480
and the Sandbox was awesome
with things like pop-up talks

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.430
and with code labs.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.680
Can you tell us like what's
going to be in the Sandbox

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.610
this year?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.410
LAUREN DALE: Yeah,
so the Sandbox

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.076
is actually going to
be bigger this year

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:45.610
than it was last year.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.250
So it's the most
popular part of I/O,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.610
so we want to make sure that
enough people can fit in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850
and we have enough
room for everyone.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.370
So we'll have even more pop-up
talks than we had last year.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.460
We'll have more code labs.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.540
Code labs are very, very
popular with developers.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.070
So, in addition
to more code labs,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550
we'll have more Googlers on
hand so that everyone can

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.320
get their questions answered.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.650
We'll have even more
interactive experiences

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.889
available for developers.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.954
So bigger, more experiences,
more space, more fun.

00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:15.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
bigger, better, more fun?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.290
LAUREN DALE: Yeah.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK,
that sounds really cool,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.250
because last year was pretty
big and pretty fun too.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.980
Now, one of the things is that
not everybody's lucky enough

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.580
to be able to go to
I/O. There's only

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.996
a limited number of tickets,
and they're sold out already.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:29.372
So what can people who
aren't able to go to I/O

00:02:29.372 --> 00:02:31.080
and experience this
for themselves-- what

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.612
options are available for them?

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:34.820
LAUREN DALE: Yeah, we have
a couple different options

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.450
for people who aren't able
to make it to San Francisco.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.340
We understand that not
everyone can travel,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.200
and also, we have space
constraints within Moscone--

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.152
we can't fit everyone.

00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:44.610
But for those who
can't make it, we

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.270
have one option,
which is I/O Extended.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.630
I/O Extended events happen
throughout the world.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.520
Some are hosted actually
at Google offices,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.640
and others are hosted
by local developer

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.430
communities in local spaces.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.530
Last year we had Extended
events in over 91 countries,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.080
so chances are, there's
something happening near you.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.640
If you're interested, you can
go to google.com/io and find

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.190
a list of the events that are
happening in your neighborhood.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.960
If nothing is
happening near you,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.310
then you can actually host
your own Extended event.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.769
We have details listed on how
to actually do that, as well.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, I
actually was lucky enough

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.350
to go to Google I/O Extended
in Kirkland, Washington

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.950
a couple of years ago.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.325
I have to say, it was an
amazing experience to the fact

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:28.075
that I sat there and
I watched the keynote

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:31.677
and I fell in love with
Google, and now I work here.

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:32.760
It worked out well for me.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250
Hopefully it will work
out well for Google.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.876
Time will tell.

00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:35.875
LAUREN DALE: I think so.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:37.020
I think you're doing OK.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.320
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Thanks, I'm enjoying it.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.329
So back to the conference
at South in San Francisco.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.870
I know there's lots of really
cool, lots of innovative stuff.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.745
You've spoken a little
bit about the Sandbox.

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:48.960
What kind of other fun stuff
should we expect to see?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.870
LAUREN DALE: Yeah,
well, we're really

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.930
trying to bring
the magic of Google

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.640
here in Mountain View
to San Francisco.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.050
So think, lots of food,
lots of fun spaces

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.180
to play and even comfy seating.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.770
Our offices-- we have a
lot of different features

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.391
that aren't your
typical corporates.

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:10.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: This
lovely quirkiness, right?

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.810
LAUREN DALE: Yes.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.300
Yeah.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.310
So we're really trying to
bring that into San Francisco

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.080
and into Moscone.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: Ah, I'm
looking forward to seeing it.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.366
LAUREN DALE: In
terms of content--

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:18.643
I can't give away too much.

00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:19.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: Can
you give a little?

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.175
LAUREN DALE: No.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:21.312
LAURENCE MORONEY: Aw!

00:04:21.312 --> 00:04:22.770
LAUREN DALE: We
don't want to spoil

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.720
the magic of what will actually
happen when we're there.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.760
But we will have a new format
for sessions, so bigger session

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.970
rooms than we've
had in years past.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.380
So people shouldn't
have to fight for space

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.730
to actually get into a session.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: There
were some long lines,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.690
so we're trying to avoid that.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.060
LAUREN DALE: Yeah.Yup.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.610
Definitely trying to
avoid that this year.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.300
We'll also more
inspirational content.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.390
So we have a lot of really
cool speakers lined up--

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.160
some women from our
Women Techmakers team

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.580
to talk about some amazing
products that they're building.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.230
We'll explore what's
new in Android.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.310
That's always a big
hefty topic, and so we

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.734
expect a lot of people
to be interested in that.

00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.900
Then, kind of highlighting
some new fun things we're

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.570
doing in the gaming space
and web platform space.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.220
I believe you brought a video
showing some of the magic

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.880
that we had last year.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.385
LAUREN DALE: I did.

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:07.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.695
Can we roll that video?

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:12.575
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.331
MALE SPEAKER: It's
great to see all of you.

00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:26.277
Welcome to Google I/O.

00:05:26.277 --> 00:05:27.260
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: Great video.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.270
It brings lots of
great memories,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.780
and hopefully in
coming I/O, we're

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.290
going to be building
lots of new memories.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.380
So what was the
website again where

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.810
people can go to find out more?

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.250
LAUREN DALE: Yes,
google.com/io is our website.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.840
People can find out all of the
sessions and various content

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.330
aspects that we'll be having
at the event this year.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.300
We also have a pretty
fun Chrome experiment

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.170
that developers can play
with and check out the source

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.970
code as well.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, yeah.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.286
I actually played with
that Chrome experiment,

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:53.170
and it's a real hoot.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.360
You can, like, stretch
rubber bands across pegs

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.290
and then play them and
play along with music.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.240
It's a really nice
little experiment

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.300
showing HTML5 can work,
and maybe a little taste

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.750
of the kind of things developers
can learn at I/O South.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.620
LAUREN DALE: Yeah,
and we definitely

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.690
encourage you to check
it out on your phone.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.820
It's even more fun.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: [LAUGHS]
I've got to try that.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.653
I haven't done that.

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:12.010
I've only done it on my laptop.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.705
So Google I/O 2015, end of
May here in San Francisco

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:17.370
in the Moscone Center.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.540
There's also going to be Google
I/O Extended events all around,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.580
so on google.com/io, you'll
be able to find out all about

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.080
them.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.070
So Laura, thank you so
much for coming today.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.279
It's been a whole lot of fun.

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.195
I've learned so much
about I/O, and I'm really

00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:30.410
looking forward to the event.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.160
LAUREN DALE: Thanks
so much for having me.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.010
It's been great.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: So everybody,
thanks for watching this far.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.720
We've got more episodes
of "Coffee With A Googler"

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.430
on the Google
developers channel.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.340
You can learn all about the
Google I/O on the website that

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.610
we mentioned, google.com/io.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.150
If you've got any
questions for me

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.330
or if you've got any
questions for Lauren,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.080
please just post them
in the comments area

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.430

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.600
Check out the rest of
our videos, and also,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.017

if you're at I/O,

special "Coffee With A Googler"

00:06:57.433 --> 00:06:57.950
event there.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.080
