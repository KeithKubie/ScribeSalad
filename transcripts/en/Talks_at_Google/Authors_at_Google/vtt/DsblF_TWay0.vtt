RODNEY: In the book
"Bored and Brilliant--

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.700
Rediscovering the Lost
Art of Spacing Out,"

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.870
Manoush Zomorodi explains the
connection between boredom

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.960
and being unplugged, and
how that state of mind

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.570
can ignite original thinking.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.270
Through reviews with
scientists, famous artists,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.790
and regular people,
Zomorodi explains

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.300
why putting the greater
emphasis on doing nothing

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.240
is vital in an age of
constant notifications

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.310
and digital distractions.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.190
She explores how we can harness
boredom's hidden benefits

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.220
to become our most
productive selves.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.890
Bored and brilliant--
it's permission to unplug.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160
Please welcome the author
and host of the podcast

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.077

Manoush Zomorodi.

MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Thank
you so much, Rodney.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.743
Thank you, you guys.

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:49.882
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.240
Thanks for being patient
with me and hanging out.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.810
I don't know.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.390
You rush off to
meetings at Google,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.460
or are you involved enough
that you don't have to do that?

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.710
I don't know.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.730
So I'm just going to
play you a little video

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.266
just so you get a
sense of what I've

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.140
been working on for the
last couple of years.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.006
Let's see if it plays.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.430
OK, so what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.630
going to tell you about
how this book came to be,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.050
because it's kind of unusual.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.500
I think it's truly the first--

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.640
and this is a mouthful-- the
first podcast crowdsourced

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.650
project to be
turned into a book.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.420
I'm going to take
that title for myself.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.380
I know everyone's
been clamoring for it,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.749
but I'm going to take it.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.790
So I'm going to tell you
about the genesis of it.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.550
I'm going to play you a little
bit of audio, some of the stuff

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.070
that I've been making, because
it all really comes down

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.960
to the podcast that
I've been making.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.550
And then I'm going to tell
you about the book tour

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.230
that I've been on for
the last two weeks

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.900
because it's been my own little
focus group across the country,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.770
and it's been fascinating to
hear the people who've come out

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.364
to spend time with me and
what's on their minds,

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:11.780
which I think is interesting
to all of us making the stuff

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.220
that they use.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.080
So if you don't
know it, my podcast

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.130
is called "Note to Self."

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.650
It's part of New
York Public Radio.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.660
I started out as a
hardcore journalist.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.500
I was with the BBC.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.676
I was with Reuters,
and my job was

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:26.300
flying around the
world for a long time

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.560
and covering hot spots.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.600
And then, once I had
kids, I was really more

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.760
covering business and tech.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.580
And then I got into
podcasting, and I realized

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.260
that my job had changed.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.020
It was less about reporting
on the developments that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.940
was happening at
companies like yours,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.160
but really, more
that as a podcast,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.860
there was an intimacy that
was there with my community,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.910
that people--

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.220
when you listen,
there was this sense

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.880
that we were talking
to each other.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.440
There was conversation, and
that what people really wanted

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.360
was some help.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.750
They were feeling as though the
world was moving at a really

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.840
accelerating pace, and
they felt unmoored by it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.990
because as you know, technology
is changing the way that we

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.960
fall in love, the way that we
parent, the way that we work--

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.950
everything.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.900
And people didn't
know how to handle it.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.360
And so that's what "Note to
Self" really evolved into.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.550
And so one of the
things that I did

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.872
was an interactive project
that was called "The Bored

00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:24.830
and Brilliant Project--

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.460
The Lost Art of Spacing
Out," and this was in 2015.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.840
And the genesis of this was
actually that the podcast--

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.710
it was doing well.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.150
It was 2014.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.950
Podcasting was starting
to take off, which

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.280
was super exciting for me.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.352
And I'd give us a
B-plus, A-minus.

00:03:41.352 --> 00:03:43.310
And I had this moment
where I was like, OK, how

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.560
am I going to step up my game?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.600
It was a cliched moment to have.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.580
How am I going to come
up with better ideas?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.140
And I had this
feeling like, well,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.020
when was the last time that I
did come up with my best ideas?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.370
And it was such a cliche.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.980
It was like, oh, when
I'm driving in the car

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.580
and staring out the window.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.300
I was never bored,
is what I realized.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.460
I realized that all
the cracks in my day--

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.680
when I was waiting to get a
cup of coffee or I was waiting

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.680
to get on the subway
or to pick up my kids,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.490
all those little moments
when I used to be spacing out

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.196
or thinking things through or
whatever, I now was looking--

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.820
somebody did leave
their phone up here.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.110
I was looking at this thing.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.080
And I guess I was like,
well, I guess never

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.107
being bored-- is
that a good thing?

00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:28.190
I guess it's a good thing.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.231
That's what they tell us.

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.280
Only boring people
get bored, right?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.260
But then I started
to wonder, well,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.650
what actually happens in our
brains when we get bored?

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.490
Or more importantly, what
could be happening to all of us

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.560
if we never get
bored ever again,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.520
if we don't experience this
human state that has, I think,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.130
been with us for millennia?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.740
And so I reached out to my
listeners, and I was like,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.570
are you guys thinking
about this too?

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.240
Are you wondering how your
smartphones are changing

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.040
your thinking patterns?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.470
Would you be interested
in maybe, I don't know,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.940
doing a week of
experiments where

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.520
we see that if we changed
our smartphone habits how

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.350
it would affect our thinking?

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.570
And I thought a couple
hundred people would sign up

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.350
to play with me for a
week, and within 48 hours,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.030
20,000 people signed up.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.790
And I was like, whoa,
OK, this is a thing.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.680
A lot of people
are feeling this--

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.725
people like [? Carin. ?]

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.050
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.180
- Hi, my name is
[? Carin. ?] I am

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.950
a New Yorker, born and
raised, and was desperate

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.100
for this Bored and
Brilliant challenge.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.830
It's perfect.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.750
I needed it.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.450
I've definitely developed
some compulsions

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.810
for Facebook, Instagram,
checking the news,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.380
checking email, replying
to email right away,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.680
texting, hunting
for funny emojis.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.290
I just-- I just need
a break from my phone

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.050
because I'm not sure that
these activities really add

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.210
all that much value to my life.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.690
And they certainly take
up a lot of my time.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.277
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:02.277 --> 00:06:04.610
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: OK, so
[? Carin ?] and I, for one week

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.740
in 2015-- every
morning we woke up,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.270
and we put out a
little podcast that

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.600
explained the neuroscience of
what is going on in your brain

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.010
when you actually get bored.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.410
It describes some of
the technology's design,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.960
in terms of getting our
attention and how we use it.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.970
And it asked them to do
a very small behavior

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.550
change, something
to try that day just

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.090
to see what would happen,
and then report back to us.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.840
And so, what we learned--

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.110
and I found that this
was fascinating-- we

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.770
are at an extraordinary
moment when

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.280
it comes to understanding
what happens in the brain when

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.750
the mind wanders.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.430
It's like-- it's really
hot news in neuroscience.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.520
So it turns out that
when you get bored,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.610
you ignite a network in your
brain called the default mode.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.960
And in the default mode, we
have our most original thoughts.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.970
We do our most
creative thinking.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.500
We take two seemingly
disparate ideas,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.160
we smash them together,
and create a new idea.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.860
And we do something that I
had never heard of before,

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.930
called autobiographical
planning.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.770
This is where you look
back at your earlier life

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.640
that you've had, and you take
note of the highs and the lows,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.620
and you build a
personal narrative,

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.150
and then decide, you know, where
am I going to go from here?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.100
What are my goals?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.950
And you set the steps that
you need to reach those.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.050
And so, kind of important stuff
that is going on in your brain.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.660
And it also turns out
that a decade ago, we

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.249
shifted our attention at
work about every 3 minutes.

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.790
And now, we're
shifting our attention

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.040
at work every 45 seconds.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.190
I found this amazing researcher.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.850
Her name is Dr. Gloria Mark.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.240
She's a professor of
informatics at UC Irvine.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.360
And she told me that the average
person is switching tasks

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.510
at work 566 times a day.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.730
So what I asked
Gloria was, I said,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.710
is it because the
technology has been

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.160
designed to take our attention
and get us switching like that?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.990
Or is this just a
human thing that,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.120
if it wasn't the
technology, we'd

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.290
be distracted by something else?

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.570
And here was her answer.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.820
GLORIA MARK: So I think
it's a combination.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.850
One thing that we found
is that there's actually

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.450
physiological reasons that
can explain why people shift

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.530
their attention so rapidly.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.030
So we find that when
people are stressed,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.850
they tend to shift their
attention more rapidly.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.390
We also found, strangely
enough, the shorter amount

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.680
of sleep, that a person
gets, the more likely

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.040
they are to check Facebook.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.050
So we're in this
vicious habitual cycle.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.299
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: I mean, I
thought that was hilarious

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.250
and made complete
and utter sense,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.620
because when I am
tired at night,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.980
that is when I find myself
going like this on my phone,

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.250
and not even looking at
whatever it is that I thought

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.150
I was looking for.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.090
And of course, I mean, I
think that has been a wake up

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.010
call for a lot of
Americans, this idea

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.890
that if the product is free,
then you are the product.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.530
And we're seeing that
conversation be more and more

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.210
prevalent and more mainstream.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.500
So really, the most
gratifying, I found,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.930
was that a lot of classrooms
across the country

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.110
did the Bored and Brilliant
project, mostly high schools

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.850
and freshmen college kids.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.210
And here's how I
put it in the book.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.810
"Talking, listening,
eye contact, downtime,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.480
responsiveness,
and yes, boredom,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.240
are all activities that
now need to actively

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.010
be put into practice.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.740
It's not that digital
natives don't feel or know

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.590
these things.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.950
It's just that they
don't get prioritized.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.370
And so, we must name,
schedule, and celebrate them,

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.320
whether it's the effect
that reading on screen

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.020
has on our attention
spans, or video game play

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.710
has on sociability, or
taking photos has on memory,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.500
we're living in an age
of self-experimentation.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.890
Technology is evolving faster
than researchers can study it.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.870
Science can't keep
up, which is why

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.990
we need a new interdisciplinary
approach, like the one we could

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.790
offer with Bored and Brilliant.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.760
Research now needs to
move out of the lab,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.370
because life is the new lab."

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.280
So just in case you think,
like, it's not a detox--

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.170
I absolutely refuse
to use that word,

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.980
because I don't
think it's a binary.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.620
It's not on or off, right?

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.140
I think what we're
finding is that users need

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.240
to understand how it
fits into their lives

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.950
and turn their phones from what
have become task masters back

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.919
into tools that actually
improve their lives.

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:23.210
And right now, they're not
feeling like they're-- a lot

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.168
of them are feeling like
they're not there yet.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.620
And I just want to play you
a clip so one of the days

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.060
that we had was called Delete
That App, where we asked people

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.480
to take the app that was
driving them bonkers bananas

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.897
off their phone,
just for the day.

00:10:39.897 --> 00:10:41.813
You know, you don't have
to quit it, whatever.

00:10:41.813 --> 00:10:43.700
Just delete that off
your phone so it's not

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.260
following you around.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.380
And I want to play you a clip
from a listener named Liam,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.726
who did the original project.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.710
LIAM: This is Liam
in Los Angeles.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:59.270
And I deleted Twitter, Facebook,
Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.800
and Vine from my phone
in one fell swoop.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.780
And it was kind of an
embarrassingly emotional

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.995
experience at first.

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:11.300
It felt weirdly lonely to
look at that lock screen

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.660
with no new notifications on it.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.700
But I really like
deciding for myself

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.240
when to think about or
access my social networks,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.280
not giving my phone the
power to decide that for me.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.170
So, thank you.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.420
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: I love Liam.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.860
He's such an extremist, right?

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.050
He's like, I'm taking
them all off, all of them!

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.330
OK, so people took all
kinds of things off.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.470
They took social media off.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.670
They took games.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.790
Some people took news off,
if you've got a headline

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.405
refreshing habit.

00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:41.030
But I will say, the
other thing that we

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.210
did during the original
project was that we partnered

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.550
with two different apps.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.230
And I did get some
push-back on that.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.813
People were like,
wait, you're telling

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:52.890
us to download certain apps
in order to take apps off?

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.440
I was like, look, we've got
to meet people where they are.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.820
So Moment was for the iPhone.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.630
Break Free was for Android.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.300
And what they did was measure
how many minutes a day

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.670
they were on their phone,
and how many pickups a day

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.880
they were on their phone.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.330
So we were able
to have thousands

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.410
of people contributing
their data back to us.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.170
And we were able
to measure which

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.600
days activities
were more effective

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.450
and which ones sort of were not.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.730
So the first time around in
2015, I was totally winging it.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.522
I just made all
the experiments up.

00:12:22.522 --> 00:12:24.230
I was like, I don't
know, let's try this.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.360
But what we were able to
do was go back and look

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.700
at all the data and the
stories, and codify it

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.580
into what is now
the book, of course.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.020
So in the end, we had
20,000 people that one week,

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.530
all 50 states.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.050
We measured that
90 percent of them

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.802
cut down on their phone
time, which, you know,

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.460
I kind of feel like,
OK, that's great.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.960
But really, the
more important thing

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.170
was that 70 percent felt as
though they had more time

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.580
to just think, which, I mean--

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.680
I just did a TED talk, and
they were like, I don't know,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.930
is that going to be enough
that, like, your message is

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.470
that people need to think?

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.900
I was like, shocking, right?

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.590
Liam got back in
touch two weeks ago,

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.340
because I did a shout
out to my listeners.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.560
And I was like, do you
remember the project

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.820
that we did in 2015?

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.590
I've got this book coming out.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.000
They totally remembered.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.700
Liam got back to me,
and he said, actually,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.960
I never put the apps back
on my phone after that week.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.437
I just decided that I liked
things better without them.

00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:22.520
So here's what he told me.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.890
LIAM: I'm currently on an
incredible trip to Europe,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.740
and I've stayed off
Facebook this whole time.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.270
Every time I ponder posting
a photo from my adventures,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.200
I think about how I'd keep
checking to see who liked it.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.250
And I think about how seeing
other people's adventures

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.010
on Facebook nine
times out of ten

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.980
ends up making me feel
depressed by comparing my life

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.195
to my perception of theirs.

00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:49.400
There's something about sharing
my life very sparingly now

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.680
that makes my experience
a little richer and more

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.174
introspective.

00:13:54.174 --> 00:13:56.590
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: So I was
like, OK, Liam's the extremist.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.330
Of course, he's going
to be all dramatic.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.580
He's an actor in LA, by the
way, so of course, there's

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.180
drama there.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.960
But it turns out,
a lot of people

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.919
made changes that
stuck with them.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:07.960
NAOMI: Hey, Note-to-Self.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.810
My name is Naomi, and I did
the Bored and Brilliant Project

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.610
back in 2015.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.950
One thing I did was delete
the Facebook app off my phone.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.177
And two years later,
I still don't have it.

00:14:18.177 --> 00:14:20.760
SPEAKER 1: I recently started
to use [INAUDIBLE] as my Boredom

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.930
points.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.910
It feels a little uncomfortable.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.550
But I think letting
my thoughts wander

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.570
is important to take
charge of my life.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.940
SPEAKER 2: At night, I
leave the phone downstairs

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.882
and turned off.

00:14:30.882 --> 00:14:33.620
And when I go on walks with my
wife, I don't even bring it.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.860
SPEAKER 3: I deleted
the Instagram app

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.490
because I was noticing
every time I logged on,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.170
I would get kind
of a stomach ache,

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.930
like that anxiety stomach ache.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.940
And I thought, I
don't need this.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.880
It's a time waster.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.190
And it doesn't bring me joy.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:48.989
So I'm deleting it.

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:51.280
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: But I just
want to tell you about one

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.690
of my favorite stories.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.770
This is from Vanessa
in Wisconsin.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.770
So the Bored and Brilliant
Project happened, she

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.210
was going through a breakup.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.090
She had to decide what she
was going to do about the farm

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.402
that she owned with her partner.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.110
She did the project,
and then at the end,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.600
she decided that
she bought her--

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.500
they broke up.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.290
She bought the farm
full, outright.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.110
And then decided that she
needed to do something

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.580
with the farm for the community.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.340
So she renamed it
Make Time Farm.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.590
And now, once a
month, she has a day

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.304
where she invites people to
come and just kind of hang out.

00:15:23.304 --> 00:15:25.720
There's a basket if they want
to put their phone in there.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.750
People bring their sewing
machine, their watercolor.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.660
They do all kinds of things.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.584
They nap.

00:15:31.584 --> 00:15:33.750
I would like to go to
Vanessa's farm and take a nap.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.380
That would be nice.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.510
They also, like,
think about, like,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.020
goal-setting, and
things like that.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.200
So Vanessa sort of decided
that this was something

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.700
that she wanted to
have in her life,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.210
and for the community,
which was great.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.260
And so now, with the book, I
am reaching a whole different

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.020
category of people who--

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.210
it's interesting what
kind of reaction.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.162
Some people are podcast
people who know the show,

00:15:58.162 --> 00:15:59.620
and know sort of
the things that we

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.601
talk about on the show, which
are a lot of ethics related.

00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:04.600
And other people. have
never heard of it at all,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.891
but this is something that's
sort of been on their mind

00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:08.660
and they want to explore.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.920
So I'm going around the country.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.340
And I'm having lots of fun.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.760
And I'm making people take
selfies, because as I said,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.750
this is not an all or
nothing sort of thing.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.380
There are moms
going out drinking

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.299
before they come to hang out
with me, which has been great.

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:25.090
And I thought this
review was really funny,

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.920
that "This could do
for unplugging what

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.950
Marie Kondo's 'The Life
Changing Magic of Tidying Up'

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.337
did for decluttering."

00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:33.170
I mean, I love that.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.500
That would be great, if I
was as big as Marie Kondo.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.350
But to me, what's more
interesting is really,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.660
since I finished
writing this book,

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.230
a lot has changed
in this country.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.610
It is really hard not
to continually refresh

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.770
the headlines, or Twitter.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.900
Just ask the president.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.760
But I think perhaps
it's time for us

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.970
to collectively rethink
some of our tech habits,

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.470
because the other
thing that happens

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.950
when you ignite the default
mode is you do empathy.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.620
You imagine what other people
around you are thinking,

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.910
and how they're feeling.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.430
And if there is one thing this
country could use right now,

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.970
is a little empathy, and
some creative problem solving

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.589
to sort of find solutions to
some huge economic, racial,

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.880
and environmental issues.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.690
And so, I think particularly
for young people

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:25.510
to understand that quickness
isn't necessarily a virtue,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.930
or as the Exchequer of
the Bank of England said,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.940
he's worried that quick thinking
could make for slow growth.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.410
So this is not just a, you
know, self-help-y sort of thing,

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.110
but I think, really,
an economic thing,

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.970
that we need people
to take a minute

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.560
and let a mediocre idea that
they might want to share just

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.700
sit on it for a little while.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.380
Let it turn into
something bigger.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.640
Let it turn into a big solution,
which a lot of young people

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.110
are not used to doing.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.560
So I'm just telling
people to get bored.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.440
That's all I want them to
do, on this big book tour

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.070
that I'm on right now.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.679
And you heard about the podcast.

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:06.470
You've heard about my
listeners experience,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.469
some of the new people
that I'm meeting.

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:10.010
And I would love to
talk to you guys,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.020
because you're the
first tech company

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.190
that I've gone to to
make this presentation.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.510
So I would love to hear,
like, what your thoughts are

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.220
on this, your comments, any
questions, personal experience.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.060
That would be great.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.020
And thank you for having me.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.700
RODNEY: Great.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.110
Thank you.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.090
Mic over here is
open for questions,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.159
for anyone who would like.

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:36.450
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: I also love--

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.037
I mean, I'm sure
you're all like, oh,

00:18:38.037 --> 00:18:39.870
my god, another anti-tech
person-- but like,

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.953
really, I really want to
hear what you guys think.

00:18:41.953 --> 00:18:44.530
One of the people in the
book is Tristan Harris.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.040
Have you heard of--
he was a Google

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.520
ethicist for a little while.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.480
And now, he's created
his own sort of--

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.360
starting to think about ways
that the tech could build

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.120
in ways of making
people communicate

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.800
more sort of in tune
with setting expectations

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.674
of other people.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.340
So I'd love to know
what you guys think.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:04.839
Hi.

00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:06.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:12.270
So I would be curious to know
how much this affects someone's

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.690
work life balance, if they're
checking their work email

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.860
and other work
applications on the phone.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.532
And I wondered if you
looked into that--

00:19:19.532 --> 00:19:20.490
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.650
So there's one chapter in
particular focused on workplace

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.227
reasons, because what I hear
from a lot of people who

00:19:28.227 --> 00:19:30.060
come to these events
is, they're like, well,

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.270
I work in social media.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.210
How am I supposed
to take time off?

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.010
So from a personal perspective,
I think having-- in the book,

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.700
I really try to
lay out how being

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.170
productive-- we
have to re-imagine

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.610
what being productive is.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.550
So for me, in my own personal--

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.220
when I'm riding the subway home,
I used to think, like, great,

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.767
this is my time to just
jam through email, right?

00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:53.850
Like, I'm going to hit it.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.460
But now I realize,
actually, no, this

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.780
is 30 minutes of me where I can
actually do some solid thinking

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.330
about something that's been
bothering me all day long,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.680
or a work issue that I haven't
had time to sort of really

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.520
drive into.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.690
So I've had to rethink what
productivity actually means.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.830
And what I'm hoping--

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.370
so there's a whole chapter
about specifically how

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.330
we define productivity
and problem solving.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.560
And then, there's also--

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.630
so the challenge that day
is to take a fake-cation,

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.810
which is to reset the
expectations of the people who

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.700
are hoping to hear
from you, right,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.100
because I think that's the
other thing that we've found,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.620
is that when we're waiting in
line for coffee, you're like,

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.430
oh, this is an opportunity--
these two minutes--

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.690
are an opportunity
to show my spouse

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.910
how I'm thinking of them,
or that I'm on top of,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.700
like, you know, what's for
dinner, or my coworkers,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.750
that I know that we
needed to follow up on x--

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.030
so resetting
expectations by setting

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.300
outgoing messages, which I
think a lot of people don't do.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.130
And so I tell people,
like, you know,

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.730
even if it's for a half an hour,
if your outgoing message says,

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.370
I'm working on
something, and that's

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.870
why you're not
hearing from me, it's

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.564
resetting their expectations.

00:21:08.564 --> 00:21:10.980
And other people are like, my
boss will never accept that.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.705
And I'm like, OK, so you have
a stomach virus for one hour,

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:14.580
you know what I mean?

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.470
Like, do what you've got to do,
because it's really important.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.136
But then, the other
thing that I've done

00:21:19.136 --> 00:21:22.650
is I joined a silent workspace,
where there's no talking.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.320
There's no eating, so no
crinkle, crinkle with, like--

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.670
I love my snacks,
but none of that.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.480
And for me, like, I've realized
the most important work

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.030
I do every week is
my writing, right?

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.910
And I know that I need
that three to four hours.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.650
I've tried to write
the show in less,

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.530
or I've tried to do it while I'm
jumping in and out of meetings.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.790
It doesn't work.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.800
I need the three to four hours.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.390
And so, I joined this workspace.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.640
I don't get there more than,
like, once or twice a week.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.520
But I think it's
worth it for me.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.310
So my fantasy is
that every company

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.400
has a silent workspace
where, you know,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.010
it's seen as productive
that you're going in there,

00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.920
and not talk--

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.880
yeah, right?

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.219
We're clapping in the front.

00:22:02.219 --> 00:22:04.260
Wouldn't that be amazing,
like, if you were like,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.269
no, I've got serious work to do?

00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:09.810
Because I don't know about you
guys, but like, in my office--

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.090
first of all, radio people,
oh my god, they never

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.862
stop talking.

00:22:12.862 --> 00:22:14.820
And there's a lot of
this, like, oh my god, I'm

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.164
so sorry I'm totally
interrupting you--

00:22:17.164 --> 00:22:18.330
and then they start talking.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.560
And you're like, no, like,
yes, you were interrupting me.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.780
So that's my big fantasy.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.400
And like, Susan Cain, she's--

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.550
I definitely quote her in the
book, The Quiet Revolution.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.530
But I think we
need to codify it.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.600
And it's not just
for introverts.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.120
Extroverts need to, like, be
quiet and do the hard work,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.410
too.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.120
So does that--

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.390
I think it makes a lot of sense.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.060
One of the things I
found was I recently

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.039
took my corporate
account off of my phone.

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:49.080
So I just have my personal
account on the phone--

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.350
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Interesting.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.050
And how's that going?

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.430
AUDIENCE: I was--

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.850
I had difficulty
with it at first,

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.835
because it was something
I was just constantly--

00:22:56.835 --> 00:22:57.210
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Sure.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.190
AUDIENCE: --accustomed to
having there on the phone.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.730
But I found that, A, my battery
lasts longer on the phone,

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.880
because it's not constantly
updating high volumes of email,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.760
B, it's something where I
don't just compulsively start

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.160
checking the work email--

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.118
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah.

00:23:11.118 --> 00:23:13.860
AUDIENCE: --and getting engaged
into the work-related tasks,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.490
and--

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:15.823
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: I'm so guilty.

00:23:15.823 --> 00:23:18.690
Like, I mean, all I do is
think about my podcast.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.440
It's all I do.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.680
And if it were up to me,
I'd be emailing and pinging

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.930
my producers all day long.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.955
And like, you know,
I've got to, like,

00:23:26.955 --> 00:23:28.410
walk the talk here, right?

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.140
So I try to save up and, like,
make my communication with them

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.780
meaningful and
constructive, as opposed to,

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.300
like, what you guys think
about yada, yada, yada?

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.552
Gloria Mark, that wonderful
informatics professor--

00:23:39.552 --> 00:23:42.010
you guys are, like, the only
audience I think I've ever had

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.260
that actually knows what
an informatics person is,

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.820
by the way--

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.190
she tried out-- this
kind of cracked me up--

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.090
she tried out a
mini Japanese zen

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.430
garden where she could put--

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.460
in an office where everybody
had a mini Japanese zen garden.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.370
And depending on the
formation of the rocks,

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.420
it indicated to your coworkers
whether you were in deep work

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.420
or whether you were willing
to be in conversation.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.270
So my team got me
a mini zen garden.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.500
It doesn't work.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.260
But it looks pretty, though.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.090
But Tristan, the person
that I mentioned,

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.710
he was talking
about this idea of,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.800
what if we could have
Google Docs where you had,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.820
like, a pause button
that was like, hey,

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.510
I'm in the middle
of working on this.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.792
Give me-- it'll
ping you when I'm

00:24:27.792 --> 00:24:29.500
ready for you to come
and look what I do,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.070
because as a podcast person,
we run on Google Docs.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.660
I mean, everything
is in Google Docs.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.922
And it drives me
bananas when I'm

00:24:36.922 --> 00:24:38.380
in the middle of
writing something,

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.330
and I see my producer's
face show up.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.470
I'm like, get out.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.810
I am doing something
here, you know?

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.110
But how do you, like-- hey,
can you come back later,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.790
basically, is what
I have to say.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.740
So it'd be so nice to, like,
snooze it or something, or--

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.850
and I think it's resetting
expectations, you know?

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.132
AUDIENCE: Well then, one
final question about this is,

00:24:58.132 --> 00:24:59.590
are there any
companies that you're

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.760
aware of that are doing
the analytics feedback

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:10.120
to the employees so that they
are given a nudge to separate

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.610
their work life environment?

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.560
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah,
so the big example

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.590
that I use is Boston Consulting
Group, where they did--

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.270
it was part of a
study that was done

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.260
by Leslie Purlow at
Harvard, where they tried

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.230
different ways of
setting up groups, where

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.270
one person in a group was
told to take time off,

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.630
like, specifically.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.630
And they were told
to, like, cook,

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:35.740
hang out with your family.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:40.270
And they knew that another group
member was covering for them.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.590
And BCG had been experiencing
really rapid turnover

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.552
and burn out.

00:25:45.552 --> 00:25:48.010
And so, they wanted to see if
this would make a difference.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.550
And their retention
levels went, like, way up.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.790
So that's the example I use.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:55.720
I think there are.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.380
I don't know a ton of
people trying it out.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.460
But I think if we start to think
of it as a way to, you know,

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.410
cut back on costs
because we don't have

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.356
to hire as many people,
deal with the burnout

00:26:07.356 --> 00:26:09.730
that so many places are seeing,
because we're working all

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.880
the time, but also think
of it as, like, you know,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.350
working smarter, not
necessarily harder.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.380
So, thanks for your question.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.159
Hello.

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:22.700
AUDIENCE: So I'm
also guilty of the--

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.290
I call it micro-efficiency,
where I try to extract every,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.430
like, thing I can out of
every minute of the day--

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.840
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: I love that.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.960
Can I use that,
micro-efficiency?

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.170
AUDIENCE: Sure, go ahead.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.430
And last year, as a
way to kind of help

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.540
myself not do that anymore is,
I joined the meditation group

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.710
at Google.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.667
And they encourage
that by donating money.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:42.250
MANOUSH ZOMORODI:
Megan's in the book.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:42.730
AUDIENCE: Oh, really?

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:43.600
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah, totally.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.516
He's been on the show.

00:26:44.516 --> 00:26:45.340
He's awesome.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.070
AUDIENCE: So I guess my
question was, do you do--

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.720
in the course of
writing the book,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.680
did you find that meditation
also helped with this,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.492
with increasing
creativity and kind of--

00:26:54.492 --> 00:26:55.450
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.575
AUDIENCE: --putting life
on pause for a little bit?

00:26:57.575 --> 00:26:59.320
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: It's
a different thing.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.760
Meditation ignites a
different part of the brain.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.630
It is completely different
than the mind wandering part.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:09.800
So the mind wandering thing
is when you are doing nothing.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.960
So it could be, like,
repetitive folding of laundry,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.880
or it could be walking
to work, or something

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.647
that doesn't require active
focus on what you're doing.

00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:20.230
The idea with
meditation is that there

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.930
is active focus on thinking
about nothing, right,

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:24.550
or the clearing of the mind.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.030
That is what you are focused on.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.310
And so that is its own thing.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.830
But this is truly letting--

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.410
the mind wandering part
goes into daydreaming.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.370
And it can also go
to some bad places.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.639
I mean, let's make no mistake.

00:27:35.639 --> 00:27:37.180
Just because you
let your mind wander

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.600
doesn't mean like, holy shit,
you have the next great startup

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.490
idea, right?

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:45.220
There's dysphoric
thinking, which

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.460
is a rumination, which is
going to be me tomorrow,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.370
going over this talk, and how
some of the PowerPoint slides

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.409
fired themselves, and how much
that annoyed me, and thinking,

00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:56.200
you know, if only I
could go back to Google

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.460
and give that talk
over-- you know,

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.126
I'm going to be
thinking about that, OK.

00:27:59.126 --> 00:28:00.170
So that's not good.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.840
Then there's also
the distraction kind,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.690
which is people who just
ping all over the place when

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.280
your mind is wandering.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.870
I'm certainly guilty
of that, as well.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.510
But then there's
the wonderful kind,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.560
which is positive
constructive mind wandering.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.320
This was Jerome
Singer, who did some

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.580
of the most deep pioneering
work on mind wandering.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.340
And that is when we start to
do that wonderful constructive

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.800
type of mind wandering.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.640
But Tade Mengteng, the
guy who I think you're

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.305
referring to, who started the
Google Inside Yourself course--

00:28:31.305 --> 00:28:33.430
is that something that,
like, everybody knows about

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.325
at Google, or is that, like--

00:28:35.325 --> 00:28:36.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:36.642 --> 00:28:37.600
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah?

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.284
Say that again.

00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:39.700
AUDIENCE: There's
signs sometimes.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.440
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Oh, OK.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:41.940
OK.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.990
And have any of you done it?

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.390
Anyone?

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.160
OK, all right.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.440
Yeah, so, the sense I got is,
like, it's relatively popular.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.620
So he talks about the
different kinds of meditation

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.460
that there are.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.440
And I think if you're getting
positive benefits from those,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.640
it's great.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.780
I mean, no reason not
to continue to do it.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.600
And this would
just-- mind wandering

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.192
would be a separate but also
equally wonderful thing.

00:29:07.192 --> 00:29:07.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.880
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Cool, thanks.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.870
AUDIENCE: So this idea
of kind of default mode

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.580
and a neurological basis for
this is really interesting.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.680
So I'm curious, I guess, what
is the sort of definition

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.350
of boredom?

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.891
So, like, for example,
the experience

00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:22.917
of walking down a nice
trail is very different

00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:24.292
from the experience
of, you know,

00:29:24.292 --> 00:29:25.380
walking down New York City--

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.635
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yes.

00:29:25.635 --> 00:29:27.250
AUDIENCE: --or even running
versus walking, I feel,

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.020
are kind of different.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.519
So I'm curious if there's sort
of activities or environments

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.300
that are more boring than
others, or if it matters?

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.400
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: So I
got a lot of push-back

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.229
when I first used the
word boredom on the show.

00:29:38.229 --> 00:29:40.770
People were like, could you call
it something a little nicer,

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.120
please, like daydreaming?

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.730
And I was like, no, actually,
boredom is the perfect word,

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.010
because I think that is
really what we're seeing,

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.470
is that why do we
distract ourselves?

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.670
Because we feel uncomfortable.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.060
And if you look at the
history of boredom,

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.760
I mean, there's a really
nerdy chapter on that, too,

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.510
which is that the word
didn't appear until 1853.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.950
Charles Dicken's
"Bleak House," boredom.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.110
And it makes sense, right?

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.440
Industrial Revolution,
people have more free time.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.330
They have time to be bored.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.040
But if you look
back even further,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.950
Kierkegaard preferred
the word idle.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.210
The French called it ennui.

00:30:21.062 --> 00:30:22.770
I'm thinking of other
philosophers who've

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.110
describe it as this sort
of existential angst

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.630
that we have-- what is
my purpose here on earth,

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.830
Heidegger in particular.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.310
So for me, using
the word bored--

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.920
I think there are
those of us who

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.685
find mind wandering
wonderful, or maybe we

00:30:37.685 --> 00:30:40.060
used to think it was boring,
but now we think it's great.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.060
I think parents, in
particular, who never have

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.000
time to get bored, like it.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.910
But I really specifically wanted
to use that word because I

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.120
think some people-- particularly
I see this with young people--

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.500
think that they
can skip straight

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.056
to the good original
thinking stuff, that like,

00:30:55.056 --> 00:30:56.680
an apple's going to
drop on their head,

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.304
and they're going to
have a great idea.

00:30:58.304 --> 00:31:01.340
And I feel like,
no, actually, you're

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.590
going to-- it's going to hurt.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.940
It's going to be painful.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.590
It's going to suck until
the good stuff comes.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.210
I gave the book
earlier this summer

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.530
to a chemistry major, a
student at American University,

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.020
and had him record
his experience.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.814
And you hear him just
like, oh my god, I

00:31:17.814 --> 00:31:18.730
don't want to do this.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.540
I really don't want to do
this-- just really struggling.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.430
I don't recognize this feeling.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.140
Normally, I would
just look at my phone

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.000
whenever I have these feelings.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.940
And then you get
to like, Day Five.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.060
And he goes for this
walk in Rock Creek Park.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.440
And he's like, I'm
just going to do it.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.670
I'm just going to, you know,
succumb to the mind wandering.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.640
And he comes up with
this amazing idea

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.880
related to solar
panels and the hometown

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.340
that he grew up in,
in Puerto Rico, which

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.950
has a disproportionate
amount of churches

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.010
that have a lot of roof,
square footage, that could be--

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.380
I mean, he just goes off
on this crazy tangent.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.170
And like, we kind
of heard, like,

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.940
an epiphany happening on there.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.300
So I think
particularly teenagers

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.890
said to me when
they did it, like,

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.370
oh, I don't like this feeling.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.920
I don't recognize it.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.690
I was like, yeah,
that's boredom.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.940
So just like, stick with it.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.060
Lean into it.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.660
But it's however you
kind of define it.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.460
It's as personalized as your
home screen, I would say.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.844
Anybody else?

00:32:23.844 --> 00:32:25.260
RODNEY: All right,
well, thank you

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.090
so much for joining us
and sharing with us.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.840
MANOUSH ZOMORODI: Yeah,
it was a pleasure.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.480
Anybody thinks that--
I mean, I really

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.280
want to know, like, do you
think this is total bullshit?

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.480
Like, I really, really--

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.860
--like, I'm really open to it,
because I think-- you know,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.850
I was at Powell's last
night in Portland.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.970
And I was like, oh, I'm
going to Google tomorrow.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.742
And some people in the
audience were like, ooh.

00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:46.060
I was like, really?

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.080
Should I be nervous?

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.820
But then, I had a lot of--

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.700
like, a guy from Apple
came up afterwards,

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.890
and was telling me about
all these great hacks

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.050
that he has to,
like, keep people

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.490
from bugging him on his phone.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.380
I was like, dude,
you should tell us.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.840
I didn't know that you could
do, like, some of the things

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.040
that you're telling me.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.861
Like, we should all know
about these little hacks,

00:33:05.861 --> 00:33:08.110
because I think it would
make people feel a lot better

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.760
about their tech use.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.680
I mean, I love my phone.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.300
I love my phone.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:19.660
But I see that it really plays
into some of my weaknesses.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.000
I'm a human and I am deeply
flawed, and my phone knows it.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.360
And it just knows how
to bring it out in me.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.560
So it's been a really
interesting conversation

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.180
that I'm having with people.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.700
And I'm really grateful for
any feedback you can give me.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.720
I really am.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.780
So, thanks again for having me.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.280
I'm going to hang out if you
have something you, like, don't

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.930
want-- if you want to shame me
in front of your colleagues,

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:41.740
or something like that.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.550
That's cool, too.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.900
[APPLAUSE]
