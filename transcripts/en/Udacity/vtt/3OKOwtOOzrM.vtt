00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Big Θ is just one of a bunch of different functions that we can define,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and there's a set that essentially corresponds to all the different ways you might

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
want to compare a function.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If f(n) is in little o(g(n)), that's kind of like saying f(n) is strictly less than g(n).

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It grows less slowly asymptotically.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
F(n) is in O(g(n))--there's our friend O--that's really like saying f(n) ≤ g(n).

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It might grow as fast as g(n), but it might be small.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Θ is the one we just looked at, which kind of like equality--they grow roughly at the same rate.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Ω--f(n) is in Ω(g(n)) means that it is an upper bound.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
F(n) is bigger than or equal to g(n).

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
G(n) is a lower bound on f(n).

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The ω, analogously, is kind of like strictly greater than.
