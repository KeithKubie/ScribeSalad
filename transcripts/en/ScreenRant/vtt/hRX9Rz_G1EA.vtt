00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.270
Ask the average comic book or superhero movie
fan to name the deadliest, most lethal, and

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.370
brutal comic superheroes, and the same names
will probably rise to the top: Wolverine is

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.869
almost guaranteed to take the top spot, with
insanely powerful heroes like Thor or the

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.330
Hulk close behind.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.230
But those characters are only blessed with
superpowers that let them destroy enemies

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.310
one by one, with brute force, or directed
attacks.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.250
But what about the heroes whose very abilities
threaten the lives of everyone around them?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.100
The movies won’t go into too much detail,
since it’s the claw-slashers, punchers,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.300
kickers, and enchanted hammer-swingers that
get the most attention.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.210
And usually, the least convenient side effects
of a cool superpower are written off or ignored

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210
completely.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.210
But not by us.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.940
In the interest of giving the unsung heroes
their time in the spotlight – and pointing

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.500
out how the science of their superpowers poses
a threat to everyone they meet – we’re

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.400
taking a look at Marvel’s most lethal heroes
in our latest docu series.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:14.150
Here is Screen Rant’s closer look at The
REAL Deadliest Marvel Superheroes.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.150
Cyclops

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.390
In most comic books, an incredibly powerful
ability or, in the world of the X-Men, mutation,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.530
is both a gift and a curse.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.030
For Scott Summers, that’s his energy blasts,
projected out of his eyeballs (or for the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.909
comic geeks, an alternate energy dimension
released through gateways inside his eyeballs).

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.950
But most fans won’t actually realize just
how dangerous Cyclop’s power really is.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.590
Taking off his glasses and unleashing energy
onto the target he’s staring down, or focusing

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.590
it through a visor might seem simple – but
human eyes are anything but.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.729
Just try to focus on a single point, or word
on a page, and you’ll realize that eyes

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.200
almost never keep still, but jump around from
point to point.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.920
These tiny jumps, called saccades (pronounced
“suh-kodds”) happen dozens, if not hundreds

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.979
of times a minute, and even more once adrenaline
starts pumping.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.710
The worst part?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.739
They can happen reflexively, as in, the brain
moves the eyes without us even realizing it.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.520
When you add in potentially lethal kinetic
blasts firing on each and every single point,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.070
Cyclops goes from a mutant powerhouse to a
mutant nuclear weapon.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.200
Honestly, most superheroes have at least some
way of controlling the powers they’re given,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.600
even if it takes years and years of concentration.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.500
But for Scott Summers, no training will keep
his eyes still, meaning just a few seconds

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500
of scanning a room could reduce it to rubble,
along with anyone inside it.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.600
And even if the movies show it as a more fine-tuned
power, they ignore the fact that not every

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
kinetic beam hits its target.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.130
If this were the real world, not only would
Cyclops be a walking eyebeam menace, but every

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.359
shot off target could wipe out a bystander,
a house, a nearby building, or even an aircraft

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.720
– even if they were hundreds of yards, or
miles away.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.200
Who knows how many he killed before he found
those ruby red Ray Bans.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
Thor

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.600
It isn’t just the Asgardian’s superhuman
strength, endurance, or combat skills that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.519
make him deadly, but the electricity that
comes with being the god of thunder.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.699
When the fight gets out of hand, or he just
needs a trick up his sleeve, Thor calls lightning

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.700
to his hammer, Mjolnir, and fires it onto
entire hordes of enemies, or massive monsters.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.530
But if this actually is lightning – and
fans are told that it is, since it’s coming

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.669
straight from storm clouds above – the release
wouldn’t be anywhere near heroic.

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.400
For starters, it would wound, incapacitate,
or actually kill the heroes fighting beside

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400
him.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.010
Since lightning being fired would be equal
to a flash from around 100 million lightbulbs,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.530
and loud enough to rupture eardrums or burst
blood vessels in anyone unlucky enough to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.170
be standing within a few dozen yards of him,
Thor would be as effective as unleashing a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.330
stream of flashbang stun grenades into a crowd.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.700
But the scariest part is that the sound makes
up just 1% of lightning’s energy – the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.919
rest is light… and HEAT.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.769
Enough heat to raise the air temperature to
close to 70,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.720
In nature, that heat dissipates into the air
faster than it can actually burn, which is

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.109
why people struck by lightning can survive
it.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.540
But when you have Thor unloading constant
streams of lightning, it’s a different story.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.540
That may not be a problem for the invincible
Thor, or protected Avengers like Iron Man

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.820
or Hulk, but for the human ones, including
Captain America, it means injuries.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.230
And the same goes for any innocent civilians
anywhere near him.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.860
The movies might ignore what lightning actually
is, but if Thor was to come to your rescue

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.840
in the real world, it would mean that blinding,
ear-splitting, burn-inducing blonde bomb was

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.980
suddenly the biggest threat to your life,
not the villain he’s there to battle.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.190
Quicksilver

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.400
No need to worry about the Marvel movie right
here, since both versions of the Marvel speedster

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.570
– the one from The Age of Ultron, and the
one seen in Days of Future Past – are probably

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.430
responsible for more deaths than most supervillains.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.220
As the saying goes, speed kills.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.530
And it’s just as true for mutants or “gifted”
test subjects.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.680
But speed doesn’t usually pose a risk to
the actual speedsters, since their muscles,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.140
organs, metabolism, and perception have all
been magically heightened too.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.550
But no matter how sound the science fiction
might be, a human being can only go so fast.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.900
Or, more accurately, accelerate.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.880
Good old-fashioned physics and inertia spoils
the fun for speedsters, since it’s a rule

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.440
that can’t really be broken: it’s only
a matter of time before Quicksilver takes

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.580
a non-speedster along for the ride (his sister
in Age of Ultron, and Magneto in Days).

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.810
In 
X-Men, he even makes sure to hold Magneto’s

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.780
neck to prevent whiplash, showing the filmmakers
grasp the problem.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.740
So his neck is kept straight, great.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.370
But the rest of his organs are liquefied about
a second later.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.500
Even if a person’s skin, muscles, or bones
remained intact after going from 0 to 600,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.310
the same effect as a car crash traveling 600
miles an hour, the organs inside wouldn’t

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.310
stand a chance.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.420
The human body is mostly water, anyway, and
the acceleration means a person unlucky enough

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.950
to be “saved” by Quicksilver wouldn’t
even have a split-second to feel as their

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.870
internal organs were left behind, and disintegrated.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.580
It’s a frightening idea, too: that rescue
scene in Age of Ultron may actually be the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.440
most gruesome massacre ever committed in a
comic book movie, with each one of Quicksilver’s

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.870
victims collapsing a second after the camera
cut away.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.430
The horror.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:38.050
(the scene aboard the train in Korea when
Scarlet witch and Quicksilver rescue people

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.730
from being run over).

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.730
Ant-Man

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.730
That’s right, Ant-Man.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.520
It seems only fitting that the superhero who
seems the most out of his depth, and literally

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.080
the smallest would pose the biggest threat,
but he does – and it’s thanks to actual

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
science.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.560
The movie, like the comics, tries to base
Scott Lang’s powers and the Ant-Man suit

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.870
in actual quantum and atomic science.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.000
They explain that the suit doesn’t shrink
the wearer, exactly, but uses Pym Particles

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.400
to shrink the distance between the wearer’s
atoms.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.610
In other words, an object’s mass stays the
same, but is just compacted by removing some

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.810
of the negative space between the molecules
it’s made up of.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.740
The movie ignores that simple explanation
when it makes small things bigger, but it

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.490
explains how Scott packs the same punch, weight,
and strength as a full-grown man when he’s

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.860
cut down to size (him shattering the tile
of the bathroom in his first shrinking scene).

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.770
But that science becomes a potential planet-killer
in the movie’s third act, when Scott is

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.840
forced to go “sub-atomic,” shrinking to
a size smaller than any atom, electron, or

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.701
recognizable form of matter (crazy shrinking
montage at the very end).

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:36.330
The problem here has to do with singularities:
what science fiction fans know as the infinitely

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.500
small, infinitely dense point that a black
hole is formed around.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.180
Usually, it takes the mass of an entire star
collapsing to create one, but quantum theorists

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.021
like Stephen Hawking have claimed that microscopic
black holes might happen all the time, when

00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:54.900
atoms and molecules collide – and some at
the Large Hadron Collider are even hoping

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.900
to create one.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.360
So why don’t we notice them?

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.419
Because they’re so microscopic, there isn’t
enough matter to fuel them, and they explode

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:02.419
almost instantly.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.410
And that’s where Ant-Man comes in.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.820
By shrinking to a size smaller than any observable
particle, but doing it with all of his mass,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.010
Scott would, according to actual science,
have created a black hole with a ton more

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.110
mass than would actually be needed to keep
it stable.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.520
Stable long enough to start pulling in the
matter around it – which happens to be Earth,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.680
and everyone on it.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.070
He might escape and save the day, but according
to the science that the movie lays out itself,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.301
Ant-Man wouldn’t just be the greatest killer
in the history of the planet… he’d be

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.380
the last.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.740
And we thought it was a comedy.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.940
That’s our shocking look at the not-so-heroic
effects of Marvel’s most heroic superhumans,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.480
and why sometimes it’s better for comic
book movies to play fast and loose with science

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.820
and their own science fiction.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.140
Still, it’s always nice to see our favorite
heroes in a new light.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.220
Which superhero powers do YOU think could
prove to be more trouble than movies or comics

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.220
make out?
