Hello my friends

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.000
Hey it's me Destin, i'm at the ordnance museum, let's go learn something.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm just Kidding

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.800
This is a Russian tank, a T-34

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.820
Hey this is the first tank, or actually the first vehicle to be called  tank.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.940
This is the um, the mark-4. The British made this in 1917, this is the female version.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.200
It just had machine guns on the side. The male version had cannons at the side.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.660
Anyway, the reason it was first called a tank is because the British tried to hide the fact from the Germans that they had an armored vehicle.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.140
To go against the trench warfare  that was going on world war I

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.120
Anyway, they called it a tank to make the Germans think that it was a mobile water tank they were using to supply the troups out front

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600
That why we call armored vehicles tanks today

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660
Or at least some of them

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.200
There, now you know.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580
Guten Tag.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.960
So back before armoured glass existed they did something pretty interesting

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.680
To protect against bullets in armoured vehicles

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.900
Here you can see on an Italian tank they had a slit

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.840
And that's what the driver would look through

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.720
Also

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.340
On the sides there's little holes for guys to stick their weapon out of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.780
This is a really, really tiny armoured vehicle

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.220
I'll go show you that slit on another vehicle over here

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.740
Okay this is a german vehicle and you can see it had the same- (slit)

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.440
This is early turn of the century stuff

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.400
You can see that's where these guys could see, this armoured block was moved

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.040
This was 1937, I was wrong not the turn of the century

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.220
Pretty awesome

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.460
Captured in Korea. My granddaddy helped do this

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.340
Yea

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.520
God bless America
