00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
So above this dotted line, I have a certain number of boxes.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.198
And we could see each of these gold bars, they have 10 boxes in them. 1, 2, 3...

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:13.438
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:17.776
And I have two groups of these tens. So I have two tens.

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:20.380
I have two tens and I have 1, 2, 3 ones.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.750
That's how many boxes I have above that line and below that line...

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:28.722
I have 1, 2, 3, 4 tens.

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:31.132
Four tens.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:33.543
And I have 1,2,3,4,5...

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.398
I have five ones.

00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:40.595
So, this first number is two tens and three ones or 23.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:45.753
Two tens, three ones. The second number is four tens and five ones.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.676
Four tens and five ones...45, now, what I want to do is add the numbers.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:54.039
So let's do that. So let's add, so let's

00:00:54.913 --> 00:00:59.442
add that amount. This amount to this amount.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.300
23 to 45.

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:07.114
Well, I have three ones here, I have five ones here, so if you add those to those you're going to end up with

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:08.040
eight ones.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.491
So let me do that in that blue color.

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:12.422
So you're gonna have: 1,

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.394
2, 3, 4, ...

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:19.951
5, 6, 7, 8 and if we look at it...

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:24.155
look at it over here where we write down the numbers with digits,

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:28.678
or with numerals. Then here you're gonna have three ones plus five ones

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:31.317
is eight ones. Eight ones... eight ones.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:36.187
Now you have two tens plus four tens.

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:40.282
Well, that's going to be six tens. So let me actually copy and paste this.

00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:45.249
So I have two tens.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:51.251
So two plus four is six. So two,

00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:54.028
four and...

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:57.687
two, four and six.

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.661
So I have... I have.

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.194
Let me change my tools. So

00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:05.862
I have

00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:08.231
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 tens

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.844
Woops, using the wrong thing. I have...

00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:15.457
I have

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:17.602
six tens. So just like that,

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:22.392
you can see when I had 23 to 45, I just added the ones place. Three plus five was eight.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.377
Three plus five is eight. Three ones plus five ones is eight ones.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:28.042
And I added the tens place.

00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:29.740
Two tens plus four tens is equal to 6 tens.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.080
So I got 68.
