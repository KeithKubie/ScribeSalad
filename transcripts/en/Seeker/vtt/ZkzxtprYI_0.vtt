00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.069
We already wear technology, from Apple watches
to devices that monitor our vitals for medical

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.069
reasons.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.469
There are even researchers in Sweden developing
an in-body intranet that can link all wearable

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.469
medical devices!

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.920
As more and more things become integrated
into our bodies, batteries will have to follow.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.660
Right now, batteries are rigid, meaning whatever
you put them in -- like a cell phone -- has

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.660
to be rigid.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.750
Then there’s that pesky issue where lithium-ion
batteries in cellphones have a tendency to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.360
explode when bent or punctured.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.720
We’re going to need a different power solution
before we can better integrate personal devices

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.490
around our flexible bodies, and we’re already
seeing some early flexible battery technologies

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.790
in the making.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.100
One recent development isn’t the battery
elements but a binding agent for the elements.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.210
But let’s back up for just a second.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.720
All batteries are like little columns or bricks.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.130
The internal elements are: the negatively
charged anode, the positively charged cathode,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.970
and some kind of the electrolyte that separates
them.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.140
Once the circuit is closed — say when a
battery is put in a flashlight — electrons

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.140
can travel from the anode to the cathode,
powering the light bulb along the way.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.140
So back to this new thing…

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.020
A team of researchers have created a new kind
of glue that can bind battery elements together

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.970
with hydrogels.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.579
Hydrogels are water-based materials that aren’t
dissimilar to the tissues that make up human

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.950
muscles and flesh.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.920
The battery isn’t stretchy, but the casing
is!

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
The new glue is made of super glue's main
ingredient — cyanoacrylate — mixed with

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.530
an organic non-solvent that delays the fluid’s
hardening.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.829
This allows the adhesive to permeate porous
materials before it sets, creating an instantaneous

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:33.880
and strong bond.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.460
It’s an adhesive that can hold 2.2 pounds
(1 kilogram) and stretch as much as 2,000

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.460
percent.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.439
The glue tech is well suited to stretchable
batteries, electronic skin, and even hydrogel-based

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.039
patches loaded with sensors.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.040
But it’s not just this new glue that’s
getting us closer to stretchy electronics!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.369
A different team from the University of California
Berkeley developed a battery that can stretch

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.369
and bend.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.570
They took the elements of a battery and arranged
them end to end along a helical spring or

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.929
flexible wire… basically a tiny slinky that
experiences minimal stresses when it’s bent.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.069
This is an ideal form for a bracelet, making
these stretchy batteries a great option for

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.680
wearables that need to be in contact with
the skin.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.760
Another design sees a wire snaking along in
a flexible polymer such that when it’s flexed

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.520
the wire stretches without decreasing the
battery’s chemical power.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.129
These batteries can be charged like any other
battery, but the Berkeley team is looking

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.299
ahead at incorporating tiny solar cells, because
the more devices we have the less practical

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.530
it will become to plug each one into the wall
to recharge.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.849
So, we have a stretchy case and we have stretchy
battery elements, but this is all still in

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.849
the lab.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.349
Stretchy batteries are years away, but, like,
5 years away, not decades!

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.829
Just think, someday stretchy batteries could
let us bend a cell phone around our wrists

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.790
before we work out… or maybe bring back
slap bracelets -- but way more technologically

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.939
awesome ones.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.900
If you’re worried about plugging all these
things in though -- maybe don’t?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.280
Wireless charging might be on the way thanks
to this new design.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.860
Check it out here.
