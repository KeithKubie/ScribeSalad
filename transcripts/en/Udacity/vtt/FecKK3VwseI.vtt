00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.590
Bertrand Mayer, author of the Eiffel programming language has

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.610
proposed the open-closed principle: that a class should be open for

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.940
extension but closed for modification.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.980
The implication is that after you have released the class, any enhancement to it

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.870
should be made only in subclasses. This policy, this policy will help deal with

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.720
the fragile base class problem that we mentioned in an earlier lesson.
