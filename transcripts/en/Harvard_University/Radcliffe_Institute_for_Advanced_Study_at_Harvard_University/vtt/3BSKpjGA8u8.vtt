00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.904
- Thank you all for coming
in this dreary weather,

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.320
and I really
appreciate it since I

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.510
know there's so much going
on all the time around here.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.420
Thank you to my
fellow Radcliffers

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.700
for being so generous, and so
smart, and stimulating already.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.280
And I've already learned
so much and look forward

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.050
to learning more from.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.710
This fellowship came to me
at a very important moment,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.480
which is probably what
everybody says when

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.490
they get any fellowship, right?

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.780
But specifically, for me, I
feel like I'm desperately trying

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.850
to let go of an old project--

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.890
a long term project and move
on to one, or two, or three,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.440
or however many projects I'm
able to accomplish in my time

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.939
here.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.010
And it's already beginning
to be an exciting--

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.070
I already feel the
energy of that.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.002
So don't be frightened by the
overwhelming amount of images.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.710
It's not just because
I'm a visual artist

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.251
that I'm showing
you images, but it's

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.570
because images are really
important to my practice

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.660
and my way of working.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.110
So if you don't know
any of the names

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.760
I'm mentioning, or don't
know what's happening,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.450
or are confused at all,
that's perfectly fine,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.190
and hopefully there's more
to the work than that.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.980
So I'm just going to begin.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.560
So I really had
no idea what I was

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
doing when I came across this
image back in graduate school,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.740
and I certainly
had no idea that it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.070
would lead me slowly and somehow
circuitously to the place

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.800
that I'm at now, but it
remains relevant to what

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.720
I'm interested in
still today, I guess

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.420
because it's the first
time I was consciously

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
aware of a shift in my interest
from architecture as building

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.040
to architecture as
image, for at the time,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.230
I had been merely,
though lovingly,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.810
making drawings of somewhat
bleak communist inspired

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.030
architecture, as
Judy mentioned, that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
hearkened back to my six years
in Czechoslovakia as a child.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.940
When this image by the
architect Adolf Loos,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.080
captioned "bedroom for my
wife, or my wife's bedroom"

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.120
crossed my path.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.100
There were only two
images of that bedroom

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.949
that I found in print of two
slightly different views.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.430
And as far as we all know,
there is no other record

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.275
of this space that exists today.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.510
From that image and for
various reasons, including

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.340
the architecture
itself, I became,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.070
for a time, absorbed with the
many other images of interiors

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.650
by Adolf Loos, and,
as I already said,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.590
I didn't know exactly
why at the time,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.450
but I would later learn
through the writings

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.720
of Beatriz Colomina about
how Adolf Loos destroyed much

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.230
of his own archive and doctored
the photos of his interiors,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.920
maintaining full control of
how his work was disseminated

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.870
in contrast to the
work of Le Corbusier,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.360
for example, who kept
every single thing

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.935
and embraced mass
media as a strategy.

00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:56.010
The Loos images seemed
enigmatic, doctored, presented,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.394
stage-like, fictional.

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:00.810
And just a small
example of that--

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.730
if you notice in this
image, there is a face.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.370
I don't have a
pointer, but if you

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.310
look at the little square of the
door, just to the right of it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.446
there's somebody's profile
walking up the stairs.

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:14.070
And whether or not
this was accidental,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.645
or whether he missed
this in taking the photo

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:18.520
and it was just about
movement, I'm not sure,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.780
but these are the funny things
that kind of sometimes came up

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.230
within his sort of
very controlled images

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.150
of his architecture.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.650
I spent some time
in Vienna, visited

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.066
much of his
architecture, and made

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:33.990
some of my own interventions in
the form of drawings and larger

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.360
installations.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.070
And from Loos, it
then seemed natural

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.830
that I moved my way
through more images

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.410
and architectural documents
by all, or at least

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.650
a large portion, of the other
modernist architects in Europe,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
mostly working post turn of the
century and pre-World War II.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.950
Zigzagging across the continent,
discovering everything

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.000
from the likes of the lesser
known Robert Mallet-Stevens,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.390
who, on top of creating
many captivating structures

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.600
and buildings, also produced
stage sets for films,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.670
such as this image here.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.190
Images of his seemed to
fuse together consciously

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.770
and publicly the stage
in architecture in a way

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.939
that Loos did somewhat
accidentally and privately.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.980
Then, staying for a while
in France, for example,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.750
I was impressed by
the technical magic

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.840
of Jean Prouve, a collaborator
of Mallet-Stevens.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.460
And again, all
along I was playing

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.740
around with my own
reinterpretations

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.870
as in this example of a
larger piece exhibited

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.580
in London that uses
Prouve's screen

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.790
structure as inspiration.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.250
I continued to both physically
and metaphorically move

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.870
around from country to country.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.000
I spent some time in the
north in the Netherlands

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.610
with the compelling, broad
range, socially engaged,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.830
yet somehow aesthetically
rigidly defined

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.240
work of JJP Oud and the better
known De Stijl heroes, Theo van

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.480
Doesburg and Gerrit Rietveld,
all the while being drawn

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.900
into images such as
this one, a house by Oud

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.490
and a floor by Doesburg.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.170
I particularly love
it when questions

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.060
arise when looking at
images of interiors

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.570
like, what is that floor doing?

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.850
Is this even a real space?

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.350
It seemed funny to
me that something

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.140
so practical and solid
such as architecture

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.580
would be represented
by something

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.382
so fuzzy and uncertain.

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:17.340
Again, finding ways to
make something of my own

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.070
in response to their work, I
was learning about architecture

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.710
through redrawing, collaging,
making installations,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.950
and expanding the framework
of the images I was seeing,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.000
trying to find my own way
into a space, some space,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.460
perhaps the space
of the image itself.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.480
And maybe, though it
might be a stretch,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.290
I was unconsciously practicing
in a subtle form of mimicry--

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.960
or not so subtle at times--

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.720
all the while getting over
ever closer to Eastern Europe,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.880
as is visually obvious
from this work, where

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.620
it seems like I
had my own brief,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.780
but intense relationship with
the Russian constructivists.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.550
Quite embarrassingly
so, I would say.

00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:02.330
And as I was sifting through
the doctrines and the dogmas,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.660
it became clear that it was the
documentation of architecture

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.880
that was more and more
interesting to me.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.160
Just as I would later read
in the Colomina texts,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.610
it was the correspondence,
the travel, the connections,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.000
the pamphlets, and the
image, as Colomina posits,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.100
where the true site of
modernity takes place

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.380
and where the private
becomes public.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.110
It was, for me, about what
lies just outside of the image

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.640
and beyond the frame, and
therefore, slowly, in a way,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.110
biography secretly
became my subject matter.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.827
It was, at least still
a secret to me then.

00:06:35.827 --> 00:06:37.660
Throughout my research,
I was no doubt quite

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.270
taken with the work and life of
Charlotte Perriand and Eileen

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.080
Gray.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.780
Working diligently alongside
their male colleagues,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.360
they were extremely
innovative, adventurous,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.540
and working against all odds
while somehow never conforming

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.830
to the normative, both
in lifestyle and design.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.110
This is an early Charlotte
Perriand bar designed in 1927,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.080
and this is the guestroom
in Eileen Gray's

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.940
now legendary and
almost mythical

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.930
seeming E-1027 House on the
coast of south of France

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.590
where so much happened that
it almost seems unbelievable.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.720
As some of you might
know, there was

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.050
a whole lot of confusion about
who actually made the house.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.830
Was it Corbusier?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.730
And also Corbusier
was painting paintings

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.190
while being naked on
her walls, and so there

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.800
was all this great stuff that
happened there that almost

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.990
seems like it's not real.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.740
If you don't know about
it, I can tell you

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.573
more about it later.

00:07:32.922 --> 00:07:34.380
And so the stories
are complicated.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.820
The lines are often blurred.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.930
Who made what?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.190
Were they a couple?

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.260
Did one steal something
from the other?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.630
There is still most
likely much that

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.200
is unknown about the practices
of architects and designers,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.250
about their collaborations
and their achievements.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.250
There's Lilly Reich
with Mies van der Rohe,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.660
Charlotte Perriand with Le
Corbusier, Walter and Ise

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.330
Gropius, Stepanova
with Rodchenko,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.250
Nelly Doesburg with
husband Theo van Doesburg--

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.560
all of the fierce, stylish
Bauhaus woman ahead

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.180
of their time.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.370
And I don't want to undermine
their already obscure

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.610
achievements, but it's
just true that they really

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.520
did have the best hairstyles.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.330
There's no denying it.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.370
And after all of this,
I guess one can call it

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.930
some form of research.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.450
The file boxes and
binders in my studio,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.700
in addition to obviously
also being named

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.159
by the names
themselves, then read

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.409
with headings and subheadings
the Austrian architects,

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.049
the French architects,
the Hungarian architects,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:42.814
the men working.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.360
There's quite a lot
of those, obviously.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.090
For every image,
there's like 1,000

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.870
more that I didn't
include, obviously.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:59.500
Men looking at their models is
a whole subcategory that I love.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.800
The man with woman.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.080
The woman with groups of men.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.700
There's some of those.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.220
The woman looking
out of the windows

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.650
of various architectural
spaces designed by men

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.770
with their backs turned to us.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.830
That's a large category.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.170
The woman reading in
various architectural spaces

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.130
designed by men.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.847
And in case you were
beginning to get worried,

00:09:36.847 --> 00:09:38.805
there are even a few
pictures of women working.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.980
And eventually, by far the
greatest number of files

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.130
became dedicated to the
regional and lesser known area

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.290
of modernism in Eastern
Europe, including, of course,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.780
the work of designer
and architect

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.520
Petra Andrejova-Molnar.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.640
I will briefly read to you a
section of Molnar's biography

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.310
as it was written in the first
catalog that was published

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.440
on the occasion of an
exhibit called Between Brno

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.470
and Budapest in Cologne.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.420
During the inter-war
period, young architects

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.810
such as Joseph Fischer,
Bohuslav Fuchs, Jaromir Krejcar,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.199
and Petra Andrejova-Molnar,
to name a few,

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:26.490
were at the center of a
vibrant architectural community

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.170
in the newly
established Czechoslovak

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.960
and Hungarian People's Republic.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.965
Born between 1895 and
1901, they came of age

00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:35.340
with the countries
that rose from

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.130
the Austro-Hungarian empire's
demise in October, 1918.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.500
In the shifting political
arena of redrawn boundaries,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.840
these architects were
emboldened by the utopian spirit

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.910
of the age and embrace
an architecture that

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.150
championed modernity,
efficiency, functionality,

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.410
and a commitment to human
progress and innovation.

00:10:55.117 --> 00:10:56.700
While dedicated to
architecture's role

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.602
in the politically
reorganized region,

00:10:58.602 --> 00:11:00.060
these architects
were international

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.880
in their sophisticated
aesthetic approach.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.090
Publications such as
[INAUDIBLE] and Devetsil

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.100
were instrumental in
publicizing developments

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.070
from Western Europe
and the United States.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.500
While CIAM and the periodicals
provided a connection

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.720
to international
developments and architects

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.760
in France, the
Netherlands, and Germany,

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.980
the demands of a local
clientele and the desire

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.650
of the Czechoslovak and
Hungarian CIAM members

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.770
impressed a unique
quality on their projects.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.750
Reinforced concrete
architectural skeletons,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.670
for example, were
frequently combined

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.010
with dramatic terraces
along the hillsides

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.130
and coasts of the region.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.810
The tendency to
linear efficiency

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.580
and an aesthetic
emphasis on load bearing

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.860
and otherwise functional
building components

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.410
was applied to smaller
single family homes,

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.080
rather than to elaborate
villas for the wealthy,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.907
thus concentrating
on functional housing

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.240
through which to build a
better world in the new Europe.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.600
This forward looking approach
was central to several seminal

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.808
exhibitions, beginning with
the first housing exhibit

00:11:57.808 --> 00:12:02.260
at the newly formed Czechoslovak
[NON-ENGLISH] in Brno in 1928.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.050
The location, Brno, known where
both Fuchs and Molnar spent

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.230
extended periods in the
1920s, was rapidly becoming

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.480
a center for architectural
investigation

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.157
and had begun to attract
international attention.

00:12:13.157 --> 00:12:15.490
Mies van der Rohe built the
famous Tugendhat House there

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.140
in 1929 and '30.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.080
Such was the fertile environment
in Petra Andrejova-Molnar's

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.020
design ambitions were nurtured.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.280
PA, as she later came to
be professionally known,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.370
was born Petra Josefina
Andrejova in [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.040
Moravian Czechoslovakia in 1898.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.920
She studied at Vienna's
Academy of Fine Arts

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.860
and traveled extensively in the
early 1920s, spending periods

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.150
of time in Brno, Budapest,
Prague, Vienna, and Berlin.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.900
It was in these years
that she encountered

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.940
the Hungarian architect
Farkas Molnar, who

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.122
would later become her husband
and sometimes collaborator.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.181
PA's work comprised of
many drawings, models,

00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:58.430
and unrealised projects for
Czechoslovak [NON-ENGLISH]

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.870
exhibits.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.900
Her contributions, such
as Modern Apartment,

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.600
Brno, 1927, are principally
small scale housing designs

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.910
that reflect the contemporary
European interest

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.350
in ideal dwellings and
efficient spatial organization.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.820
While PA's
architecture is steeped

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.317
in contemporary
developments, she

00:13:15.317 --> 00:13:17.900
would have been aware of earlier
Czech architects, such as Jan

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.630
Kotera, the one time
Otto Wagner protege, who

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.480
both brought secessionist
inspired design to Prague

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.810
and advocated a
specifically Czech style.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.370
As a student in
Vienna, PA would have

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.744
been exposed to
the Austrian work

00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:34.204
of her Moravian predecessors,
Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos.

00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:36.120
While her aesthetics
would seem to be divorced

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.950
from these earlier
architects, she subtly

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.960
drew from their
approach to materials--

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.710
for example, in the shade
wall of her Hotel Nord-Sud

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.680
or in the storefront
designs of 193-39,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.500
which hold Adolf Loos and
the Austrian style in mind.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.390
By the second half
of the 1920s, PA

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.940
had begun to gain practical
architectural experience.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.340
Despite her youth and the
dearth of opportunities offered

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.207
to her gender, she
secured positions

00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:00.790
in some of the
region's most prominent

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.200
architectural offices.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.290
From 1927-29, she worked
with both Bohuslav Fuchs

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.170
on his Avion Hotel,
which in its simplicity

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.120
and open economically
stacked spaces

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.224
informed her future
hotel designs.

00:14:13.224 --> 00:14:14.890
She furthered her
training in the design

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.082
of public buildings
in 1928-30 when

00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:18.790
she worked with the
architect the Jaromir

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.280
Krecjar on his Machnac
Sanitorium in Trencianske

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.740
Teplice.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.630
Krecjar's functionalist
approach to design

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.780
would be a strong influence
on PA's later work,

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.210
and his attention to symmetry
and emphasis on terraces

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.570
would inform PA's designs.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.460
In 1932, PA embarked upon
what was to become undoubtedly

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.520
her signature inter-war work,
the remarkable Hotel Nord-Sud.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.060
Unfortunately abandoned after
the war and later destroyed,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.190
the hotel was located on
the coast of Yugoslavia

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.740
near the town of Zadar.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.380
Both Molnar and Fuchs gave the
project their full support,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.420
but the triumph of this
understated masterwork

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.700
is PA's alone.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.100
This small hotel, her first
large scale construction,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.580
contained 14 cabin-like
bedrooms and two suites,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.770
all with balconies, as well
as an impressive lookout

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.220
cafe on the third floor, and
an open restaurant and bar

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.010
on the second.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.450
The Hotel Nord-Sud's most
arresting design elements

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.610
were surely the
remarkable terraces

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.640
that united interior to exterior
with only the separation

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.690
of glass.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.420
The hotel's ground floor
boasted four meter high ceilings

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.020
in a flexible, open reception
and, again here, extensive use

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.700
of glass that allowed the
constant sight of the sea

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.320
through the structure's
floating, transparent supports.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.860
Finally, the cantilevered roof,
nautical and yet restrained,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.670
was balanced by symmetrical
modular interior spaces.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.650
The Hotel Nord-Sud
was the culmination

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.380
of Molnar's formative
years and, in many ways,

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.210
synthesizes the architecture
trends of the time.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.170
It is a structure that defines
an era that is now lost to us,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.641
like the building itself.

00:15:53.641 --> 00:15:55.390
Architecture in Central
and Eastern Europe

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.180
was no longer able to embrace
hopeful internationalism

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.060
and youthful idealism,
and though PA and many

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.610
of her contemporaries continued
to practice architecture

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.280
after a hiatus
occasioned by the war,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.350
they did so in a
world vastly altered

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:13.510
from the inter-war years
between Brno and Budapest.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.160
This is a second
publication dedicated

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.490
to Molnar's work, recently
published in 2016,

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.160
from which I'll read a short
section of a beautiful essay

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.155
by architectural
historian Sean Keller.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.690
"Against all of this,
one might object.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.050
What about those male
heroes of heroic modernism?

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.510
Yet how real were they
with their invented names--

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.610
Le Corbusier, van der Rohe--

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.120
and their costumes-- the
cape, the glasses, the cigar--

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.360
and costume parties, with
their doctored photographs,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.970
pasted up collages,
and canvas mockups,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.250
cutting and gluing their
past, present, and future

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.380
into the shapes they desired.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.600
Their little self-important,
self published journals

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.660
written by themselves, perhaps
under multiple pseudonyms

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.690
and a few friends, and all of
those buildings, even cities

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.570
for one million, designed
for people, and technologies,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.380
and opinions that
didn't yet exist."

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.150
"For what was modern
architecture if not

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.300
the summoning up of a new world,
new ways of living, seeing,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.304
and building?

00:17:11.304 --> 00:17:12.970
This world had to be
projected before it

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.210
could be legislated and built,
projected through drawing,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.230
model making,
photography, and writing.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.530
The incredible magical
fact is the extent

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.450
to which this summoning worked.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.240
Those odd journals, grainy
photos, and miniature buildings

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.200
did, somehow, remake the world.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.670
And what, too,
about the myth that

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.040
says that the architect
makes architecture?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.680
Isn't the architect really
more like an organizing force,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.370
perhaps even an imaginary one,
wrapping around or running

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.970
through a flow of people,
materials, images, money,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.810
space, and time, trying
to cajole and compel

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.390
all of the hands that sign
contracts, write checks, draw

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.870
details, dig holes, lay bricks,
paint walls, manufacture lamps,

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.670
take photographs,
and write reviews

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.030
to construct something they
may never have seen before?"

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.730
"Yet, like some myths, the
story of the architect making

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.350
architecture is both literally
untrue and still not false,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.230
for there is, or may be,
a singular sensibility

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.720
and intelligence
guiding the production,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.750
but given the complexity of
realizing any project, who

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.750
could say where the
architect stopped or started?

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.450
Or if, perhaps, he or she
were ever there at all?"

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.010
I had asked Sean
Keller to contribute

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.950
to the catalog of Molnar's
work, and since he

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.020
is a legitimate
historian of architecture

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.210
at Illinois Institute
of Technology,

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.690
he felt uncomfortable talking
about PA as if she was real.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.660
And by now I'm assuming everyone
here knows that she's not--

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.230
or you knew that already--

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.350
but without even
mentioning Molnar's name,

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.120
he beautifully
captured the essence

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.487
and put his finger on some
of the ideas and issues that

00:18:44.487 --> 00:18:46.820
have become important to me
throughout creating Molnar's

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.779
archive over the years.

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:51.820
These last few images were
of several exhibitions

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.650
that have taken
place-- for example,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.190
the exhibition in Cologne,
Between Brno and Budapest.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.350
In each new exhibition
iteration of her work,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.940
a different context
is developed.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.220
New work is added, and a
slightly longer or different

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.420
story is told.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.200
Models are made that recreate
fictional and actual buildings,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.030
built and unbuilt. For example,
in this case, Farkas Molnar's

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.800
red cube house project, which
garnered attention, but was

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.160
never realized during his
short time in the Bauhaus.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.010
In this exhibition, the
biographies as wall text

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.140
become an equally
important means by which

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.670
authority is put into question.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.730
Sometimes the realness
of actual biographies

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.560
becomes a little suspicious.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.130
Hotel Nord-Sud 1932-34
design and correspondence

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.320
took place at the
ICA, foregrounding

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.600
the influence of sanatorium
design on PA's Hotel Nord-Sud.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.250
The exhibition focused
on a closer look

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.370
at Nord-Sud Hotel's interior.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.260
The lobby furniture,
such as wall sconces,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.060
and light fixtures,
and hotel signage

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.570
was all particularly situated
within PA's design language.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.880
The wall text stated that,
while much of this furniture

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.592
claimed to be lost
or destroyed, it

00:20:01.592 --> 00:20:04.050
was reproduced according to
the drawings and documents that

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.270
remained.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:08.810
The writing desk, vanity
chair, and bed with night table

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.940
all reiterate the stylistic
proportions and horizontal

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.465
cantilever design of the hotel.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.950
Some installation images
from the exhibition.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.320
At the Kunstverein
Langenhagen in Hanover,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.140
the work focused on the
collaborative efforts of PA

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.420
and the ways in which the
many historical publications

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.850
functioned to distribute
and disseminate ideas

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.715
across continents.

00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:35.340
There are certain
objects and interests

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.514
that run throughout PA's
career, like for example,

00:20:37.514 --> 00:20:39.930
her interest in the screen
structure as a dividing element

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.857
throughout interiors
and exteriors.

00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:43.440
Many of these were
unrealized, but she

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.200
seemed to have a particular
investment in their development

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.100
nevertheless.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.710
In the last iteration,
an exhibition

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.900
focused on PA's earliest
collaborative project,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.750
before her career had really
begun, designed by Josef Gocar,

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.470
the Czechoslovakian pavilion
at the 1925 International

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.860
Exposition of Modern Industrial
and Decorative Arts in Paris--

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.170
that's a long sentence--
bridged traditional designs

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.910
and an avant garde aesthetic.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.590
While the pavilion's
exterior was

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.110
inspired by abstracted
nautical forms,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.720
its interior rooms combined
self-conscious references

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:18.000
to folk art and the Renaissance,
alongside geometric cubism.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.590
Working under Gocar and Janak,
the exhibition wall text

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.280
states that PA was assigned to
many aspects of the pavilion

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.190
design, and although precise
records of her involvement

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.490
have not survived, her
characteristic desire

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.990
for efficient
simplicity of form can

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.266
be seen in a number of
the pavilion elements.

00:21:33.266 --> 00:21:34.890
Perhaps her greatest
known contribution

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.990
was the terra cotta
brise sole which

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.882
projected from either
side of the building.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.340
And here you can see in the
exhibition the terra cotta wall

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.830
reconstruction.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.160
In addition, PA was
largely entrusted

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.080
with the design and
tapestry work for two

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.330
of the pavilion's interiors--

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.470
the Room for a Modern
Man and its companion,

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.810
Room for a Modern Woman,
which featured furniture

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.130
by Jan Kotera.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.690
Despite references to
Czechoslovakian folk art,

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.440
PA's designs remain
abstract, and their geometry

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.620
compliments Kotera's interest
in space and construction

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.890
and his move away from
form and decoration.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.010
PA's hand can also be seen in
smaller, but important elements

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.680
of the exhibition design,
such as the small shelves,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.720
mirrors, and wall
sconces she conceived

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.450
for the two idealized
modern rooms.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.130
And finally in the
pedestals on which

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.400
Czech ceramics by Vlastislav
Hofmann, Paval Janak,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.930
and others were displayed.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.110
Here, too, PA presented
simplified geometries,

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:38.040
pared down forms which echo
the ceramics' angular planes.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.140
The project of creating
a fictional character

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.810
was not at all a well
thought out decision for me.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.870
I had not set out or
planned to create her.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.690
It occurred organically
because of several interests.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.450
At first, because of my love
of architectural drawings

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.970
and the potential that
I saw in them to convey

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.720
latent content veiled beneath
the seemingly pragmatic,

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.680
as well, of course, because
of my love of making objects.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.690
Then because of my interest
in the dissemination

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.190
of architectural
image, as I tried

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.330
to describe earlier, as well
as an interest in the ideology

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.570
and discourse coming out of
utopian modernist thinkers,

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.660
and consequently the
following failure of that very

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.870
same thing.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.220
And, of course, an interest
in how the biographical plays

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.810
a role in our ability to connect
to and understand the past.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.640
It was probably,
also, a personal

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.160
attempt to interject myself
into a location and time

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.440
that I felt originally
I had come from,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.240
but was disconnected with.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.100
And last but not
least, the project

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.200
became a way to
insert what I thought

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.620
was missing from one version
of modernist history.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.010
So how to follow a very
long fictional project,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:49.030
and will I ever get out of it?

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.300
Born Francesca Porges in
Vienna, my current subject

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.810
immigrated to the US in
1938, attended Smith College,

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.690
and in 1944 obtained her
master's degree from Harvard's

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.460
Graduate School of Design.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.370
After running her own furniture
design company, Hosken Inc.,

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.180
for a decade, Hosken became an
activist for women's health.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.410
Her archives here at the
GSD, the Schlessinger,

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:14.732
and elsewhere tell the vivid
story of an underexamined life.

00:24:14.732 --> 00:24:17.190
I came upon the four boxes at
the Graduate School of Design

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.500
by accident when I first
arrived at Harvard,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.555
and I instantly
became fascinated.

00:24:21.555 --> 00:24:23.520
The archival photographs
of her furniture

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.040
and of herself posing
with her creations

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.200
were immediately intriguing.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.420
They seemed to provide
the real for the fictional

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.400
that I was already
so steeped in.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.410
The images, documents,
and story that

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:36.900
was unfolding within
Fran Hosken's archives

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.386
mirror the story I was trying
to tell through Molnar.

00:24:41.386 --> 00:24:43.010
The archives of the
GSD consists mostly

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.187
of photographs of Hosken's work,
rather than the work itself.

00:24:46.187 --> 00:24:48.020
Except for some of the
jewelry she designed,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.640
it mostly consists
of a large number

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.160
of images of her
furniture, staged

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.000
and used for advertising
the work for clients.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.830
There are approximately
45 unique works

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:02.010
of design documented
in the archive.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.520
Several versions of slightly
different serving carts.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.240
MDF trays and magazine racks all
made out of simple materials,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.432
easily produced, and
made to be affordable.

00:25:13.432 --> 00:25:15.890
There's pamphlets and financial
documents from the company,

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.280
drawings, jewelry,
correspondence, et cetera.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.320
So from a first
look at the archive,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.350
it appears to be a fairly
successful business

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.800
and design career,
except, of course,

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.360
it wasn't, as you can see in
this letter from 1974, which

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.890
was received after Hosken,
already engaged in a long back

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.650
and forth complaint battle
with Harvard and the GSD

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.720
for having
nontransparent, dubious,

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.080
and non-diverse
hiring strategies.

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:48.640
Take a minute to read it.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.290
Sorry.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.770
It just didn't cut it.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.900
The context Hosken
was working in

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.870
is also evident in the various
compelling correspondence

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.180
with some of the major
architects in the area.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.270
Walter Gropius, Philip
Johnson, Saarinen, Tack,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.310
and a few others.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.230
In the above letter,
Hosken is asking

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.010
Gropius to help her sell
Hosken Inc. because it is

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.550
no longer financially viable.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.610
It's a long letter, but that's
basically what happens in it.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.110
In this back and
forth, for example,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.230
with Philip Johnson, which you
can see in the gallery space--

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.310
I believe it's there.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:33.660
Phillip Johnson is interested
only in Hosken's legs,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.340
without the table tops, to
offer some of his clients--

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.430
a very sort of strange
attempt that actually

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.170
resulted in failure, as well.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.980
"Yes, dear Francesca, I am
much impressed with your table

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.480
legs."

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.290
That goes on for a little bit.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.030
So it's clear that
Hosken decided

00:26:56.030 --> 00:27:00.710
to turn her life into solely
a feminist and activist cause.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.070
She did, in fact, within
that field, accomplish much,

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.550
and it's not that the endeavor
isn't fully respectable--

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.740
and most likely, even more so--

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.260
but it's hard to try to
understand how much failure

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.860
and rejection one needs to be
met with before they throw away

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.860
a career ambition
or life passion.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.540
Is that even an interesting
or relevant question to ask?

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.200
My first instinct was to exhibit
Hosken's work, accompanying it

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.270
with the first
comprehensive catalog.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.610
My methods are thoroughly
interdisciplinary,

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.110
first beginning
with research, which

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.940
I've obviously just begun.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.640
Furniture needs to be
tracked down or remade.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.830
How much biography
will be included?

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.990
Questions about the
innovation of her design

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.900
and justifications for the
failures and shortcomings

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.700
will surely arise.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.230
Does any part of
the activist work

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.940
inform the reading
of her practice

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.040
as a designer in any way?

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.000
Will this research even
result in anything regarding

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.950
the design work
at all, or will it

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.560
rather become more immersed
with the topic of the obstacles

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.807
surrounding her?

00:28:01.807 --> 00:28:03.890
Since, of course, I am an
artist and obviously not

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.460
a historian or a scholar, it's
in the studio where research

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.830
is thought through, where forms
for the exhibition catalog

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.240
and who knows what
else get invented.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.660
The project will be hands on,
subjective, and speculative,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:23.090
but also will hopefully harness
modes of scholarly writing.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.310
There is much that happens
in contemporary art out

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.290
of research, but I am
interested in a more

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.680
nuanced and multidirectional
approach, producing

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.842
some of the scholarship
from which I draw.

00:28:32.842 --> 00:28:34.550
It isn't surprising
that many artists who

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.800
are interested in the
archive as a subject matter

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.460
are in some way drawn to the
misplaced, the incomplete,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.290
the unfulfilled, and often look
for something in the archive

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.860
to offer a point of departure.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.800
And finally, I'll conclude
my talk by adding that,

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.050
in order to help move the
research of Fran Hosken

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.270
into new territory
hopefully, I want

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.790
to bring up a blip of
an unfinished project

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.640
from earlier this year, which
I hope can act as a guide

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.590
to a non-linear
research strategy.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.840
I'll try to tell the story
as quickly as possible.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.810
I was invited to do a
workshop and exhibition

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.990
for the inauguration
of a recently restored

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.260
beautiful Peter Behren
synagogue in a town located

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.430
40 minutes away from my parents
origins in rural Slovakia.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.220
I wrote up a fancy agenda
and syllabus for the workshop

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.740
and invited local
students to participate.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.350
We were supposed to
create models of aspects

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.180
or recollections of our past--

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.210
or someone's past-- much in
the same way I was already

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.030
trying to do at the time,
which I consider also

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.810
an unfinished project that
lacks the proper form still,

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.590
but my attempt was
to construct models

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.110
of the memories of my
parents' time in a refugee

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.200
camp in Yugoslavia while
waiting for papers to immigrate

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.560
to Canada.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.130
I had realized that no
photos from that time exist,

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.375
though we have plenty from
before and right after,

00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:52.750
and so new aspects of the
story kept coming up every time

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.310
I asked something--

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:59.680
things I had not heard from my
parents about this time before.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.270
Like this cabin,
for example, which

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.100
I had no idea we spent time
in, was given to us by the UN,

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.580
and somehow I so
desperately wanted

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.913
to know what it looked like,
even though it was probably

00:30:08.913 --> 00:30:10.300
a banal camping cabin.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.000
So I tried to create it based
on their messy and confused

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.140
descriptions.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.210
Trying to remember
specifics and materials

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.090
became an interesting
process of back and forth

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.830
and brought up all kinds
of new revelations.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.580
And there is this model of the
US embassy entrance in Zagreb

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.530
that my mother tried
to recall, but all she

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.560
remembered was hurriedly walking
down some terrazzo stairs

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.120
while hearing
footsteps behind her,

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.520
paranoiacally thinking
she's being followed,

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.027
and ignoring her family outside
so they wouldn't get caught.

00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:42.610
So back to the
synagogue, the students

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.568
were supposed to be
thinking about architecture

00:30:44.568 --> 00:30:47.180
as a witness, the theme
of my fancy workshop,

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.990
but without getting into
the details, in many ways,

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.160
the entire workshop
was a failure.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.790
We had nothing to show for our
three intense days of meeting,

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.380
and somehow something
of a piece had

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.290
to be left in the space of
the synagogue for the opening.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.970
I tried every
avenue and ended up

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.250
with this minimal
footprint of a piece that

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.100
told the story of me
trying to make the piece

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.080
and linking it to
every other thing

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.810
I was thinking
about at the time.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.790
What resulted were five
simple fake plaques

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.220
that told some aspect of
how different events related

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.390
to the space of the synagogue,
even if in less obvious ways.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.820
This particular plaque
commemorated a small moment

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.840
of the workshop, and those are
all the participants' names,

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.570
and we read a passage
from a Sebald book.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.050
My uncle had a very personal
relationship to the synagogue,

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.790
as his family is from
that town, and he

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.580
told me a very interesting
story that I was not

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.760
allowed to share with anyone.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.270
And so I made a plaque for that.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.210
So it reads this
synagogue is known

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.210
to him because of his eight
years of study at the gymnasium

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.240
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.990
He used pass it on his
way to and from school.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.490
He told me a very
interesting story

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.280
about the house with three
apartments that his parents

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.770
built in [INAUDIBLE] in 1931.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.620
A few hours later, he asked
me not to share the story,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.030
so I'm honoring his wishes.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.010
And I wove the UN cabin
back into the story,

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.730
as well, because that same uncle
sponsored our move to Canada.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.200
And lastly, this
is a commemoration

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.730
to the important
conversations that

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.070
were exchanged during that time
that might lead to something

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.700
exciting in the
future, for it's always

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:27.320
really hard to put an object
to these types of exchanges.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.040
These seemingly
disparate plaques

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.350
attempt to tell a story
in a non-linear way that

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.000
incorporates or
keeps the presence

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.820
of the building as an integral
component of experience

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.780
and memory.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.670
It is a tiny
project that is more

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.800
like a clause within
a sentence still,

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.660
but I hope that my
work with Fran Hosken

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.730
will be somehow
informed by this,

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.650
and that perhaps her
life and her work

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.220
will ultimately function
as a point of departure.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.090
Thank you.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:55.340
[APPLAUSE]
