00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.863
This is really easy to do considering we are reminded of the general formula

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:09.733
right here, and we have values for h and k. We just plug those in to get a final

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:14.917
equation of y plus 4 equals x plus 3 squared. Here, the vertex is at negative 3,

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:15.767
negative 4.
