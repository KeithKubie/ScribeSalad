00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:10.488
Your favorite athlete 
closes in for a victorious win.

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.296
The crowd holds its breath,

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:15.655
and, at the crucial moment,
she misses the shot.

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:19.461
That competitor just experienced 
the phenomenon known as "choking,"

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.225
where despite months, 
even years, of practice,

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.960
a person fails right when it matters most.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.588
Choking is common in sports,

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:29.706
where performance often occurs 
under intense pressure

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.566
and depends on key moments.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:35.536
And yet, performance anxiety 
also haunts public speakers,

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.457
contestants in spelling bees,

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:39.748
and even world-famous musicians.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.796
Most people intuitively
blame it on their nerves,

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:46.886
but why does being nervous 
undermine expert performance?

00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:48.686
There are two sets of theories,

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:54.267
which both say that primarily, choking 
under pressure boils down to focus.

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.146
First, there are the distraction theories.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:00.736
These suggest that performance suffers 
when the mind is preoccupied

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.845
with worries, doubts, or fears,

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:07.675
instead of focusing its attention
on performing the task at hand.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.136
When relevant and irrelevant thoughts 
compete for the same attention,

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:13.188
something has to give.

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:16.686
The brain can only process 
so much information at once.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.786
Tasks that challenge working memory,

00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:20.676
the mental “scratch pad” we use

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.775
to temporarily store phone numbers 
and grocery lists,

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.894
are especially vulnerable to pressure.

00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.325
In a 2004 study, 
a group of university students

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.218
were asked to perform math problems,

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:36.187
some easy, others more complex 
and memory-intensive.

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:40.637
Half the students completed both problem
types with nothing at stake,

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:44.985
while the others completed them 
when calm and under pressure.

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:47.525
While everyone did well 
on the easy problems,

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.577
those who were stressed 
performed worse

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:52.386
on the more difficult, 
memory-intensive tasks.

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:56.436
Explicit monitoring theories make up 
the second group of explanations

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:58.116
for choking under pressure.

00:01:58.116 --> 00:01:59.471
They’re concerned with how pressure

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:03.176
can cause people to overanalyze
the task at hand.

00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:06.707
Here, the logic goes that 
once a skill becomes automatic,

00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:11.341
thinking about its precise mechanics 
interferes with your ability to do it.

00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.655
Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be
most vulnerable to this kind of choking.

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:20.005
A study on competitive golfers compared 
their performance

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.936
when instructed to simply focus on
putting as accurately as possible,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:26.877
versus when they were primed 
to be acutely aware

00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:29.326
of the mechanics of their putting stroke.

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:32.467
Golfers usually perform 
this action subconsciously,

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:36.547
so those who suddenly tuned in 
to the precise details of their own moves

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:39.912
also became worse 
at making accurate shots.

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:42.787
Choking may not be inevitable 
for everyone though.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:46.166
Research suggests that some are
more susceptible than others,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.166
especially those who are self-conscious,

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:49.221
anxious,

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.092
and afraid of being judged 
negatively by others.

00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:55.386
So, how can we avoid choking 
when it really counts?

00:02:55.386 --> 00:02:58.927
First, it helps to practice 
under stressful conditions.

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:01.138
In a study on expert dart players,

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:04.757
researchers found that those 
who hadn’t practiced under stress

00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:06.694
performed worse when anxious,

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:10.146
compared to those who had 
become accustomed to pressure.

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:15.117
Secondly, many performers extol the 
virtues of a pre-performance routine,

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.506
whether it’s taking a few deep breaths,

00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:19.056
repeating a cue word,

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:21.796
or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements.

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:24.558
Studies on golfing, bowling, 
and water polo

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.885
find that short rituals can lead 
to more consistent

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:30.217
and accurate performance under pressure.

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:31.998
And thirdly, researchers have shown

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:35.226
that having an external focus 
on the ultimate goal

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:37.536
works better than an internal focus,

00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:41.165
where someone is tuned into the mechanics 
of what they’re doing.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:44.926
A study of experienced golfers revealed 
that those who hit chip shots

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:47.037
while focused on the flight of the ball

00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:51.456
performed significantly better than those
who focused on the motion of their arms.

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:54.587
So, perhaps we can modify 
that age-old saying:

00:03:54.587 --> 00:03:55.417
practice,

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:56.426
under pressure,

00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:57.788
with focus,

00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:00.209
and with that glorious end goal in sight,

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.747
makes perfect.
