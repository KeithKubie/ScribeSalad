00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.340
Here, I have another question for you. What does the myelin sheath do for the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.178
axon? Remember, the myelin sheath wraps around the axon. Does it keep it

00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:14.622
together so the impulse doesn't fall through the cracks? It insulates it making

00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:19.536
the neuron more effective, or does it protect it from synapticitis when the

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:22.623
synapse eats the axon?
