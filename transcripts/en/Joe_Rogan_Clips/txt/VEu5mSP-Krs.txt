Speaker 1:          00:01          I go back and forth with conspiracies. I have a love hate relationship with conspiracies. I love some of them. Some of them are fascinating. Some of them like, okay, what the fuck happened there? You know, but, and then some of them work. I can't do this anymore. Yeah, I didn't. When I was younger. I used to think about it, but then I think when I had a kid at, well, I don't have time for that. No time for nonsense and becomes very precious. This becomes food. How exactly not over here worrying about the fucking Illuminati. I don't even know what that means. What's the Illuminati? Exactly. I'm busy. I kind of go, but I get how people get sucked into that rabbit hole, you know? Yeah. No, no, no. I could see it. I went into a rabbit hole the other day, but with aliens, I watched three alien documentaries in a row.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I Raja this one on Bah Blah czar. Who was the guy who claims that he worked at area 51 very compelling. Very interesting. Because at the top, but that's the one you would suggest. Yes. That's the one I would suggest. It's called area 51 Bob Lasar area 51 and flying saucers, I think it's called. It's on iTunes right down. It's fucking good. Take notes because there's some things that this guy knew that it's almost certain that he worked where he said he worked, that he worked at area 51 the question becomes, he told all the truth about all these things that have since been proven to be true. Um, weird. So he gave, he gave first cut at those truths, right? Yeah. Well he did a long time ago too. He came out about this like 30 years ago. There was a Nevada. Tell heard about this Bob.

Speaker 1:          01:36          He would. He would. He was worried about his life. Here's what happened. Apparently the guy was working in this area doing research for whatever the government wanted them to do, an area 51 what he did there, who knows? He gets fired from this job and then takes his friends to this viewing position in the mountains where they can see them flying, flying saucers. He was telling them they fly them at his base. I'm going to bring, you guys were going to watch it. He, they videotape this on old school VHS tape. You can see these flying saucers flying around area 51 and he says, these are not w not being piloted by a, uh, by aliens. These are being piloted by human beings, but that these are real devices. These things are real. It's a real vehicle. And they got this real vehicle from some other, some other civilization from somewhere in space and they had nine of them.

Speaker 1:          02:32          It sounds like total horseshit when you hear it, but then you watch the video and so the questions come like, well, how did he know that they were going to be flying these things up there? How do you know they were going to do them on Wednesdays? How do you know where to be and where he could see it? How did he know? How did he know about the biometric data? How do you know about element one 15 he was talking about this element, this manmade element that it's a real element that they've now identified. But when he was talking about it in 1981 knew what the fuck he was talking about or 1984 or whatever it was when he was, when he first got interviewed about this. So when this guy is bringing this stuff up today and people are, are looking back at all the different things that he said that have since been proven to be true, especially the existence of area 51, the, the government had to, at some point in time in the 90s, they had to say that they own the base and say that it did in fact exist.

Speaker 1:          03:26          The, uh, top secret area or the, uh, do you know, like there's a do not enter zone or they'll pull you over and arrest you if you get past a certain spot. They wanted to broaden that area so people couldn't be watching their crafts fly around like Bob Lasar was. And when they did that, when they expanded the territory, that's when they had to actually admit that the base was real. So he was proven to be correct on so many different things that he said, like explain how they get them out there, explain what the research was. And he said that they had these things that run on some, they, they manipulate gravity in some way and they're very small because these aliens are very small little creatures. Like a child, like a eight, 10 year old child. Huh. It makes you go, what the fuck man?

Speaker 1:          04:10          Like I, so he talked about, he said, well, he saw them, he knew how they operated. Wow. The things that he knows that are true, that that turned out to be true. That how could he have known them if he didn't work at area 51 or the most compelling aspects of it. And the fact that area 51 was at one point in time by the governments take it didn't exist. And then it was like a legend. And this was when he was talking about it. And so watching this documentary and seeing this guy 30 years later, still basically saying exactly the same thing with a bunch of things have been proven. Have improvement. Cynthia. Yeah, that is intense. It's a trip, man. I mean, if the government really did at one point in time have some craft that it got from another planet, like what the fuck man? But the thing is like, how would we take that? How do you think people would take that if they found out? How do you think that handle that? If they really knew there was something that was so sophisticated that it could visit us from another planet. It could be here in minutes, g land in the White House lawn and do whatever the fuck I wanted to. You couldn't even shoot it with bullets. How would

Speaker 2:          05:16          people take that? I think that people would just keep going on like with every other scare. I think so, yeah. I think, okay, there's, um, there could be a media that's supposed to hit us. Right, right. I mean, how do people take it? I mean, that's what they're saying. They said it could happen. I think it would be a fuck fest in the streets. Yeah. But what they say they say could happen. I mean, you know, if you saw one common yeah, but I'm saying that if you saw one company because you don't see the alien coming, if people realize that yeah, these guys could show up. Right. I don't know. I remember the conspiracy that um, when I, I remember, I do remember that. I remember that when they would be like these booklets of like xerox stuff going on, like the one about aids and stuff like that. Maybe that one. Yeah. That one had be going for a while. The con, the AIDS conspiracy, the Irish stroker memorandum. Oh yeah, yeah. People are used to hand those out. Right. Don't try and tell people that aids was a hoax, not a hoax. That it was like all this stuff memorized. I always got to host a government conspiracy. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Way Out for a while. I remember I was video I was making, I was making copies and passing along guys. That blew my mind. Wow. There was a

Speaker 1:          06:19          one doctor at one point in time that was trying to say that that HIV does not cause aids and we had him on way back in the day early on. Was that guy's name Duesberg? Dr Peter Duesberg. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. Our man, I just remembered it. He is a professor at the University of California Berkeley I believe. I think he's a Bot biologist and his take was that HIV does not cause aids that would causes AIDS as a compromised immune system. That HIV is actually a weak virus and it shows up in the immune system so people that are already compromised. That's why you're finding it in these people that it's not the cause of their immune system being compromised. Compromise. It's a symptom of it and that with these people are really dying from is there their whole system being fucked up by drugs that either they're taking AZT, which destroys their body.

Speaker 1:          07:14          You know, it was a cancer medication, like a chemotherapy that was so powerful is killing people quicker than the cancer was. And then they switched it over to using it with people that had aids because in, in the early days they would call aids the gay cancer. There was all these different, like they were trying to figure out what it was and what it did. And early on this guy was saying this and we had them on the podcast and people got so mad there, there were so mad that given this guy a platform to spread his, his propaganda in his lies. And I was like, wow. But he is a professor, right? He has done like legitimate cancer research. He's, you know, I mean, don't you want to listen to them? And, and I, I wanted to get someone on to debate him, but nobody wanted to debate him.

Speaker 1:          07:57          It was like trying to get someone to debate a Holocaust denier. Like, nobody wants to give them the platform and when he wants me to talk to them, which I understand, but those, those kinds of, I mean it's very highly unlikely that all these doctors are incorrect in her hiding the fact that HIV, you know, and then now the fact that they've got these, um, HIV medication, so basically they can take people and make them HIV negative now. Right. Then they have like a couple people have tested HIV negative after her medications. Yeah. I Dunno. I'm too stupid. Too stupid to understand what's really,

Speaker 2:          08:31          yeah. That's, that's for me that I know that I'm like, when I watch some of those things, you know, they, some of them, they will like lead off with these statements and we all know and we know this. I'm like, I don't, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. There's too much to know. Yeah. Yeah. How do we get in the subject of AIDS? I don't know where we're talking about conspiracy theories. And that was the one that I, that one, that one when it was back in what? [inaudible] 89 or something. 88 when those little pamphlets are growing around. Yeah. I was like, yeah, well marijuana and conspiracies go together like cookies and milk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. This is nothing like we, it starts your, your gears turning and you start thinking that's where a lot of people start thinking conspiracies are against them too.

Speaker 2:          09:14          Right. You get high and they start thinking that the world's closing in on you. Everybody's watching you surveillance. But do you don't probably don't feel like that when you get high. No, I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Sometimes I kinda like it though. You know why I like it? Cause it ends and when it ends you feel great. It's almost like a, a brutal brain workout. Like you, you go digging deep into your psyche and find out all the things you're scared of. Right? Yeah. No, it's like it's work. Yeah. It'll work. You like took a look at, you said, and you know I never thought about me from that angle before. Yeah. I like to do it. I'm going to clean up mine. Yeah, yeah. Clean up your shit.
