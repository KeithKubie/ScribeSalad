1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.430
In light of the fact that I have just sent you paper topics.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.420
My lecture today is going to do two things.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.290
It is going to give you a way into Franny and Zooey but it's going to actually

4
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:18.120
give you more than a way into it.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.210
It's really going to give you a whole packaged reading of Frannie and slowly we

6
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:25.500
have just the one day on this novel

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.030
and what I'm going to be doing for you is modeling the way literary critics use

8
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.240
evidence to advance an argument.

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.980
It's useful to you when you think about writing a paper to remember if it's been

10
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.940
a long time since you've written an English paper or even if it isn't a long

11
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.941
time since you've written an English paper that the facts that we literary

12
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:56.520
critics and you writers on literature,

13
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.660
the fact that we deal with are the details of the text itself.

14
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.990
You may have noticed that I am very fond of reading aloud to you from these

15
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:14.130
novels.
I'm very fond of reading out passages.

16
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:18.510
I do it a lot.
Why do I do it?
Well,
there are two reasons.

17
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.760
One because I want you to hear literary art.

18
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.770
Literary art is a verbal art.

19
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.160
And I think too often we only read it silently,

20
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.180
probably not since you were children that people read to you so much.

21
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.290
So to get a sense of that,

22
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:42.000
you have to have it in your ear and feel the sound and the rhythm and the

23
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.430
quality,
the Tambour,

24
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.440
the expression of the voices that we have in these novels are writer for today,

25
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.890
thinks so highly of that capacity of literature to embody the human voice that

26
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.040
he imagines a whole religious world around it.

27
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.230
That's going to be the gist of my argument today.

28
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.130
But then there's a second sort of less,
uh,

29
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Mr. Cole reason and that's that these are the facts of a literary argument.

30
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.510
These words that I give to you,

31
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.290
it's like if you are in an astronomy lecture,

32
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.040
they're going to give you some facts about the composition of a planet or its

33
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:27.750
atmosphere or whatever.
Those are the facts for that field,
for this field.

34
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.520
These are the facts.
So in your papers,

35
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.450
if you find yourself writing and you get to the end of a page and you look back,

36
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.170
you scan back over your page and you see that there are no quotation marks,

37
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.010
you are not using any of the facts of the novel to produce your argument to

38
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:55.110
support your claims.
So that's like the eye test,

39
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.250
the glance test.
Are you supporting your claims?

40
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.380
If you have very few quotations,
chances are you are not.

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.440
So think of this lecture as I go through it as a kind of model,

42
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800
pay attention to what I'm doing in using these textual bits and pieces and

43
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.970
putting them together and making claims for them.
I do it every week.
Um,

44
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.500
it just so happens that this argument is more closed,

45
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.630
more settled in my own mind.

46
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.430
It's less of an opening argument than it is something that I want to convince

47
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:35.260
you of.
So there's a,
there's a reason for that.

48
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.170
Um,
and that is that I'm writing about this novel.

49
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.850
It's in the introduction to a book that I'm writing about the literature of this

50
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.510
period.

51
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.130
And so it's very present to my mind as a sort of piece of a larger argument

52
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.220
about religion and the American novel in this period.
Um,

53
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.240
so that's what I'm giving you.

54
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.050
When you approach any novel to make an argument about it.

55
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.390
If you want to be ambitious,
the first thing to think about is,
well,

56
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.160
what's obvious about the novel?

57
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.860
What can you observe at first glance about it's style,

58
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.670
about its form,
about setting,
about its character,

59
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:16.900
about its presuppositions in Franny and Zooey.

60
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.250
What did you notice?
Tell me what you noticed at first bat,

61
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.390
if any of you have read it.

62
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.470
What did you notice about the novel

63
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.690
<v 1>doesn't move around,
stays in one place.</v>

64
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.330
<v 0>Absolutely.
Confined settings.
Very confined settings.
Absolutely.
Yes.
What else?</v>

65
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.880
Yes.
Lots of dialogue.
Yes.
What else?

66
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.750
<v 1>[inaudible]
very much in the living room.</v>

67
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.830
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
There's a backstory.</v>

68
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.070
You can feel that backstory to the novel.
Yeah.
What else?

69
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.510
What else did you notice?

70
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.860
<v 1>Yes,
that's a lot of focus on like little motions that people do like yeah.</v>

71
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.030
Cigarettes and dropping things.

72
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.970
<v 0>Yeah,
a lot of attention to physical detail and physical movement.</v>

73
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.850
And that's connected to this point about confined spaces.

74
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.440
It's the movement of bodies within confined spaces that really preoccupies this

75
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:21.950
novel.
What about the style of the novel?
Talk about dialogue.

76
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.010
Is there anything else about the style that you noticed?

77
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.263
<v 1>Yes.</v>

78
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.090
<v 0>One of Italics.
What does that connote to you?</v>

79
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.750
<v 1>MMM.
[inaudible]</v>

80
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.730
<v 0>yeah,
absolutely.
A lot of emphasis,</v>

81
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:42.930
a lot of variation in tone in the Italics are part of the representation of
that.

82
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.490
Yeah.
What else?

83
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.063
<v 1>Yes.</v>

84
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160
A lot of the dialogue seems to be [inaudible].

85
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.140
<v 0>Yes.
This is a book about arguments.
Absolutely.
What are they arguing about</v>

86
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.750
most of the time?

87
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.130
All right,
well that's where I will pick up.
Oh,
Sarah,

88
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.780
do you want to say adds jobs,
things intellectual?
Yeah.

89
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.710
Yeah,
absolutely.
They're,
they're talking about abstract,
intellectual ideas,

90
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.650
often religious or philosophical ones.
Um,

91
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.440
and that plus it's setting,

92
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.860
I hope you notice the sort of new haven ish setting of Franny's breakdown where

93
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.980
we're told that a lean isn't exactly a Yale man,

94
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:35.400
but he sure looks a lot like a Yale,
Yale,
English major.
Um,

95
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.170
dare I say such an unpleasant character.
Um,

96
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.620
and so,
so pompous.

97
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.130
What you do when you write a paper or try to advance an argument.

98
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.700
It's try to write an argument that will attend to all those things that you guys

99
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:01.250
just said,
that you take the obvious things.

100
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.940
And when you craft an argument,
the best thing,

101
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:09.941
the most ambitious thing to do is to come up with something where in the end you

102
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:14.240
can say something about those major aspects.

103
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.830
You don't have to do it in the paper,

104
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.430
but it should be an argument that has something to say back to those obvious

105
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:26.300
things.
Why is the style this way?
Why is the plot working this way?

106
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.530
Why are these particular characters behaving in this way?

107
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.050
Why use those confined spaces?

108
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.400
So my argument today is going to try to have something to say back to all those

109
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.830
obvious aspects that you pointed out.
Um,
so rightly,

110
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.890
but I'm going to start from a much more pointed and local question.

111
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.220
And this is the other thing that a good short paper especially does is that you

112
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:01.940
don't get it all that big stuff by kind of taking it head on,

113
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.370
you have to come down to the facts that I was talking about.

114
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.730
The bits of text,
the text itself,

115
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.330
the words that author chose,
that's where you begin.

116
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.960
And part of the genius of a strong paper is choosing the place in the text to

117
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:24.410
begin that pointed analysis.

118
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.060
So my choice for this is that odd introduction in between the two stories,

119
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.170
and this is on 48 and 49

120
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.553
this is,

121
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.100
we come to find out buddy Zoe's older brother narrating the story and buddy

122
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:52.871
gives us a little preamble telling us how the real characters in the story,

123
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:58.050
the real people who are van characters in his story,

124
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.300
how they felt about the story and what their objections to at were.

125
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.090
And this is on 48

126
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.380
we find out that Franny objects to the stories distribution in the world or the

127
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.790
movie,
the pros home movie as buddy calls it.
Uh,

128
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.300
because it shows her blowing her nose a lot.

129
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.710
<v 0>His mother Bessie objects because it shows her in her house coat,</v>

131
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.820
but Zoe has a more substantive objection.

132
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.230
It's the leading man.
However,

133
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:41.190
who has made the most eloquent appeal to me to call off the production.

134
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:46.191
This is in the middle of page 48 he feels that the plot hinges on mysticism or

135
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:50.850
religious mystification in any case,
he makes it very clear,

136
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.720
a to vividly apparent transcendent element of sorts,

137
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.480
which he says he's worried can only expedite,

138
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:01.740
move up the day and hour of my professional undoing.

139
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.660
People are already shaking their heads over me and any immediate further

140
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:09.600
professional use on my part of the word God,

141
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.340
except as a familiar healthy American expletive will be taken or rather

142
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:19.341
confirmed as the very worst kind of name dropping and a sure sign that I'm going

143
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:21.240
straight to the dogs

144
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.680
and he speaks back to Zoe.
He says,
well,

145
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:28.620
I'm going to still distribute my story.

146
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.930
I still want to tell this story.

147
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.760
And he does it in a kind of roundabout way,
and this is on on page 49

148
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.353
<v 1>okay.</v>

149
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.960
<v 0>Somewhere in the great Gatsby,</v>

150
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:44.310
which was my Tom Sawyer when I was 12 the youthful narrator remarks that

151
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:49.110
everybody's suspect himself of having at least one of the cardinal virtues and

152
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:53.280
he goes on to say that he thinks his,
bless his heart.
His honesty,

153
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.900
mine,

154
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:59.901
I think is that I know the difference between a mystical story and a love story.

155
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.230
I say that my current offering isn't a mystical story or a religiously

156
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.670
mystifying story at all.

157
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.860
I say it's a compound or multiple love story.

158
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.990
Pure and complicated.

159
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.300
<v 0>What buddy does in this passage is set up this opposition between his own</v>

161
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:28.320
reading of his story and Zoe's.
Now,

162
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.690
why are we given these objections?

163
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.900
I think it's to give us a dynamic sense of the family conversation going on

164
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:37.194
between them,

165
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.570
but it also addresses one of those obvious things.
They talk a lot,

166
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.740
as Sarah said,

167
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.920
they talk a lot about abstract questions and this puts the meaning of the story

168
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.450
in that abstract register.

169
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.150
Is it a love story or is it a religious story?

170
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:56.770
A mystifying story,

171
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.620
<v 1>which is it?</v>

172
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.500
<v 0>I am going to argue that it's both and I'm going to advance that argument by</v>

173
00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:11.261
going straight to the theological question that Zoe is so intent on solving when

174
00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:17.450
Franny is having her breakdown in the living room.

175
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.150
<v 0>So just to,
uh,</v>

177
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:26.230
review Franny has her breakdown when she comes into what I suspect is new haven

178
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.650
to attend the Yale Harvard game football game with her boyfriend lane.

179
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.893
So

180
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:36.890
<v 1>yeah.</v>

181
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.890
<v 0>Frannie when she sees lane affects great enthusiasm and so on.</v>

182
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.870
But this is what we hear about lane from the narrator.

183
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.280
This is on page 11

184
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.380
lane was speaking now as someone who does,

185
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.700
who has been monopolizing the conversation for a good quarter of an hour or so,

186
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.590
and who believes he has just hit a stride where his voice can do absolutely no

187
00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:08.790
wrong.
You know,
I always read this and I think I'm lecturing.
It's all good.

188
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.210
I mean to put it crudely,
he's,
he was saying,

189
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:17.040
the thing you could say he lacks is testicular parity.
You know what I mean?

190
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.990
He was slouched rhetorically forward toward Franny is receptive audience,
uh,

191
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.410
supporting forearm on either side of his Martini.

192
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.490
Lacks what Franny said.
She'd had to clear her throat before speaking.

193
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.850
It had been so long since she had said anything at all.

194
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.980
Laying hesitated masculinity.
He said,
I heard you the first time.
Anyway,

195
00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.890
it was one of,
it was the Motif of the thing,
so to speak.

196
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.890
What I was trying to bring out in a fairly subtle way.

197
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.770
Lane said very closely following the trend of his own conversation.
I mean,
God,

198
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.150
I honestly thought I was,

199
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.750
it was going to go over like a goddamn led balloon and when I got it back with

200
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.870
this goddamn a on it in letters about six feet high,

201
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.190
I swear I nearly keeled over Frannie again,

202
00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:03.090
cleared her throat.

203
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:08.100
Apparently herself imposed sentence of unadulterated good listenership had been

204
00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:12.750
fully served.
Why?
She asked lane looked faintly interrupted.
Why,

205
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:16.140
what,
why do you think it was going to go over like a lead balloon?

206
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.870
I just told you,
I just got through saying this guy,
uh,

207
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:24.000
brome is a big flow bear man or at least I thought he was.
Oh,

208
00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:25.320
Franny said she smiled.

209
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.510
Franny is disgusted by his pomposity.

210
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.470
<v 0>This experience combined with her experience in a religion seminar with this</v>

212
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:38.861
man,

213
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:43.861
Professor Tupper at school has convinced herself that the world is superficial,

214
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.950
that it's impossible to find anything meaningful in the academic discussion of

215
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.240
these pseudo intellectual problems.

216
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.600
The test secularity of one writer or another.

217
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:04.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

218
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:09.710
<v 0>And lanes engagement with literature specifically is all about his ego</v>

219
00:15:12.751 --> 00:15:13.620
inflation.

220
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:19.100
So he can't wait to tell Franny that the professor said he should try to publish

221
00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:22.890
it.
And then my favorite thing,

222
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.850
he wants to read it to her over the football weekend.
Hey,
come,

223
00:15:26.851 --> 00:15:30.840
let's read my English Essay.
Hello?

224
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.670
Uh,
no you can't.
Sorry.

225
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.950
And I'm worried about email

226
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.380
talking about pricking my pomposity.
Um,
all right,
so,
so,

227
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.710
so she starts saying the Jesus prayer,

228
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.420
which is Lord Jesus Christ,
son of God,
have mercy on me,

229
00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:07.254
a sinner.

230
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.670
Now she has taken this prayer from a book called the way of the pilgrim.

231
00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:15.990
It's a Russian Orthodox religious classic,
very old text.

232
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.620
And it depicts the life of a pilgrim.

233
00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:23.520
And we get the summary of this a little bit in the novel as Frannie explains it

234
00:16:23.521 --> 00:16:27.810
or tries to explain it to lane who's entirely uninterested.
Um,

235
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:33.180
it is about a man who tries to take seriously the bibles in junction to pray

236
00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:34.170
without ceasing.

237
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.900
And the prayer for Franny becomes a kind of mantra.

238
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.040
She's trying to say it over and over again as she goes about in this world that

239
00:16:46.321 --> 00:16:50.220
is so disappointing to her feel so false to her.

240
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.650
And so finally,

241
00:16:52.651 --> 00:16:57.651
the strain of trying to hold out this kind of religious awareness in the face of

242
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.780
lane and his English paper is just too much and she faints.

243
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.190
Now,

244
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:13.190
Zoe has a big problem with her use of this prayer and this is what gives the

245
00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:18.900
book that sort of combative tone,
um,
that we,
uh,

246
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.050
that we were talking about a little earlier that somebody mentioned.

247
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.480
So if you look on page one 69,

248
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.220
my question now is in my argument,

249
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.890
what is Zoe's critique of Franny's use of the prayer?

250
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.270
What,
what constitutes that critique?
What's wrong with it?

251
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:42.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.240
<v 0>So in one 69,
he says to Franny as she's snuggling on the couch,</v>

253
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.110
God Almighty,
he said,
if you're going to say the Jesus prayer,

254
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:57.111
at least say it to Jesus and not to Saint Francis and Seymour and Heidi's

255
00:17:57.571 --> 00:17:59.520
grandfather all wrapped up in one.

256
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.140
Keep him in mind if you say it and him only and him has,

257
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:06.570
he was and not as you'd like him to have been.

258
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.240
You don't face any facts.

259
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.560
This same damn data tude of not facing facts is what got you into this messy

260
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:17.280
state of mind in the first place and it can't possibly get you out of it.

261
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.440
And then this,
this,
um,

262
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.490
this argument goes on for a couple of pages and I'm just going to pick up the

263
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:28.360
end of it here on the bottom of one 71,
he's,

264
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.860
he's explaining who Jesus was.
If you don't understand Jesus,

265
00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:36.910
you can't understand his prayer.
You don't get the prayer at all.

266
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.490
You just get some kind of organized can't.

267
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.230
Jesus was a supreme adept by God on a terribly important mission.

268
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.220
This was no seat.

269
00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:50.221
Francis with enough time to knock out a few canticles or to preach to the birds

270
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.550
or do any of the other endearing things.
So close to Frannie glosses heart.

271
00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.470
I'm being serious now.
God dammit.

272
00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.850
How can you miss seeing that if God had wanted somebody with Saint Francis is

273
00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:04.420
consistently winning personality for the job in the new testament heat have

274
00:19:04.421 --> 00:19:08.680
picked him.
You can be sure as it was,
he picked the best,
the smartest,

275
00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:11.110
the most loving,
the least sentimental,

276
00:19:11.111 --> 00:19:15.040
the most an imitative master he could have possibly picked.

277
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.160
And when you miss seeing that,
I swear to you,

278
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.070
you're missing the whole point of the Jesus prayer.

279
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:22.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.920
<v 0>So Zoe's critique is that Franny is not being specific in her use of the prayer.</v>

281
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.660
She's paying no attention to who Jesus was and what it means to actually pray to

282
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:38.034
that figure.

283
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:40.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.840
<v 0>But to anyone paying attention to the other things that Zoe says and the other</v>

285
00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:49.810
things that he does in this novel,

286
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.670
this is kind of odd and it's hard to square.

287
00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:00.180
So my next kind of question is how does that vary?

288
00:20:01.631 --> 00:20:06.631
Doc tribally specific understanding of the Jesus prayer relate to the whole

289
00:20:07.121 --> 00:20:12.121
religious education that buddy and Seymour gave him and that he seems to be

290
00:20:12.161 --> 00:20:15.850
thinking so hard about as he reads that letter in the bathtub.

291
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:17.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.580
<v 0>The letter in the bathtub tells us about that education and let's look on 61</v>

293
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.213
<v 1>yeah,</v>

294
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.220
<v 0>sorry.
I want to,
that's not exactly the right page.
This is 65 I'm sorry.</v>

295
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.653
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.150
<v 0>In this buddy explains</v>

297
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.780
<v 1>to Zoe what he and Seymour had been trying to do.</v>

298
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.230
Much,
much more important though.

299
00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:01.260
Buddy says in the middle of 65 Seymour had already begun to believe and I agreed

300
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.570
with him as far as able,

301
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.600
as I was able to see the point that education by any name would smell as sweet

302
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.190
and maybe much sweeter if it didn't begin with a quest for knowledge at all.

303
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.150
But with a quest as zen would put it for no knowledge.

304
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.130
Doctor Suzuki says somewhere that to be in a state of pure consciousness,

305
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:27.970
Satori is to be with God.
Before he said,

306
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.330
let there be light.
Seymour.

307
00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:35.500
And I thought it might be a good thing to hold back this light from you and

308
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:39.760
Franny,
at least as far as we are able and all the many lower,

309
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:43.660
more fashionable lighting effects,
the arts,
sciences,
classics,
languages,

310
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.370
till you were both able,

311
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:50.430
at least to conceive of a state of being where the mind knows the source of all

312
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:52.054
light.

313
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.440
So the religious education that Zoe's response to Frannie comes out of is

314
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:05.641
precisely not a doc triangley specific Christian education.

315
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.070
Rather,
it's something more like a Buddhist tradition,

316
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.650
a syncretic mystical tradition.

317
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:20.080
The idea is that there is some state of being with God,

318
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.670
knowledge,
all the arts and sciences,
literature,

319
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:29.671
all the religious writings of the world are manifestations of that voice that at

320
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:37.360
its origin is God's saying,
let there be light.
It's the voice of creation.

321
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.940
<v 0>Seymour and buddy want Franny and Zooey to rest at that origin undistracted by</v>

322
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:52.591
the manifestations of the creation and know some kind of consciousness of God in

323
00:22:55.511 --> 00:22:56.440
that place.

324
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.220
So Zoe pretty much subscribes to these,

325
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.320
these tenants,
and you can see it,

326
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.110
especially on page one 75

327
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:12.803
<v 1>okay.</v>

328
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.400
<v 0>When he goes into his brother's old room.</v>

329
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:20.790
Now let me explain a detail that I think is important,

330
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:25.740
but I think a little lost to us in today's world of technology,

331
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.220
there's a phone and buddy and Seymour old room that is a PR,

332
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:37.320
a private internal line and it just goes from one room to another in the

333
00:23:37.321 --> 00:23:41.400
apartment.
It's not an outside phone line.

334
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.250
And what's interesting about it and what,
um,

335
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:49.310
indicates importance to buddy is that Betsy gets on about him getting a phone

336
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:52.700
where he's teaching,
uh,
in upstate New York.

337
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:57.550
He's teaching writing as a visiting writer at a college in upstate New York.
And,

338
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.450
and Bessie,
his mother keeps saying,
well,
why don't,

339
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:02.270
why won't you get a phone buddy?
You're,

340
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:07.271
you're paying to maintain this interior align in our apartment and yet you won't

341
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:10.220
get a phone for buddy.

342
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.440
The phone that's within the family compound,
so to speak,

343
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:20.150
family apartment is the more important line of communication.

344
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.940
So when Zoe goes upstairs to use that phone,

345
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.140
it's freighted with all the significance that buddy has put upon it.

346
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.310
But there's a whole ritual involved.

347
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

348
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.140
<v 0>In Zoe's entrance into this place.</v>

349
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:42.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.400
<v 0>This is on one 75</v>

351
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:48.710
<v 1>yeah.</v>

352
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.230
<v 0>At the far end of the hall,
he went into the bedroom.</v>

353
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:56.030
He had once shared with his twin brothers,
which now in 1955 was his alone,

354
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.700
but he stayed in his room for not more than two minutes.
When he came out,

355
00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:03.590
he had on the same sweaty shirt.

356
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.170
There was however a slight but fairly distinct change in his appearance.

357
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.680
He had acquired a cigar and lighted it and for some reason he had unfolded,

358
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.370
unfolded white handkerchief draped over his head,

359
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:24.200
possibly to ward off rain or hail or brimstone.

360
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.910
So why does he do this?
What's the meaning of this little,

361
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:33.560
the tale of Zoe's appearance?
Well,

362
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:38.120
one thing that a literary argument can do is take something small like this and

363
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.520
try to give an account for it.
So that's what I'm going to do.

364
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.520
He's venerating the state,

365
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.910
the room that Seymour and buddy occupied.

366
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:52.250
He's covering his head in a traditional religious fashion.

367
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:58.710
So in order to enter this holy place,
he covers his head,
the cigar.

368
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.990
I don't have an account of that.
You guys figured that out?

369
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.250
<v 0>That's the other nice thing about literary arguments.</v>

371
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:09.030
There are always little details that they don't account for.
And that's the,

372
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.540
the loose thread that you can pull to make your own.

373
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:14.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.290
<v 0>And so what does he find when he goes into this holy space?</v>

375
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.580
Well,

376
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.080
he finds two panels of

377
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.520
beaver board on one 78,
179.

378
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.270
And they have the quotations that Seymour in buddy have collected from all their

379
00:26:36.271 --> 00:26:41.130
favorite religious,
philosophical,
mystical literary reading.

380
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.200
And I'd like you just to,
uh,
think about one of them.

381
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.570
So this is the bottom of one 78.
This is from Sri Ramakrishna.

382
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.203
Sir,

383
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.460
we ought to teach the people that they are doing wrong in worshiping the images

384
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:03.000
and pictures in the temple.
Rama,
Krishna,

385
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.950
that's the way with you Calcutta people you want to teach and preach.

386
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.640
You want to give millions when you are beggars yourselves.

387
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.440
Do you think God does not know that he is being worshiped in the images and

388
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:19.530
pictures?
If a worshiper should make a mistake,

389
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.980
do you not think God will know his intent?

390
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.470
This is,
I think,

391
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:30.390
one of the best examples of that syncretic view of religion,

392
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.320
that basically all worshipers are worshiping the same God.

393
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.750
They may do it in different forms,
they may make mistakes,

394
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.140
they may be mistaken about where God resides,

395
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.000
but in this view,

396
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.120
God is so powerful and so transcendent that God will know the heart of the

397
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:57.450
worshiper.
So if you apply that back to Frannie,

398
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:02.460
why,
why does Zoe have this difficulty?

399
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.920
Why does he have this difficulty in the specificity of her prayer?

400
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:13.170
What is it that is bothering her,
him?
Well,

401
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:18.171
I think you begin to get an answer to this tension between specific doctrine and

402
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:24.510
syncretic religion.

403
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.770
When Zoe gets to the subject of acting,

404
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:33.510
which is what this second attempt at speaking to Frannie this time over the

405
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:37.560
phone is,
uh,
concerned with,

406
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.680
there's a detail here of course,

407
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:45.890
that Zoe and making a second attempt to converse with Frannie about this

408
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.820
impersonates his brother buddy on the phone.

409
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.830
Now I'm just going to leave that observation,
remind you of that.

410
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.810
I have a way to account for that,

411
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:00.150
but it's gonna take to the end of my argument to do that.

412
00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.660
So I'm going to argue that that's significant,

413
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:06.060
but I'm not going to talk about why it's significant yet.

414
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.470
But let's look at that theology of acting.

415
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.420
This is on page one 98

416
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.930
this is coming towards the climax of their conversation.

417
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.410
Part of what's been bothering Franny is her frustration with acting and that's

418
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:30.750
one of the things that lane is so surprised she has given up.

419
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.700
It was the only thing she was passionate about.

420
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
And we know from reading buddies letter over Zoe's shoulder in the bathtub.

421
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.690
We know that Zoe had concerns about his own acting career,

422
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:45.340
his own commitment to acting

423
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.300
that buddy tried to persuade him out of.

424
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:57.150
You can say the Jesus Prayer Zoe says to Franny from now until doomsday,

425
00:29:57.151 --> 00:30:00.450
but if you don't realize that the only thing that counts in the religious life

426
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.740
is detachment.

427
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.220
I don't see how you'll ever even move an inch detachment buddy and only

428
00:30:07.231 --> 00:30:10.980
detachment desire less snus cessation from all hankering.

429
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.170
It's this business of desiring.

430
00:30:13.171 --> 00:30:17.460
If you want to know the God damn truth that makes an actor in the first place or

431
00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:19.800
are you making me tell you things you already know?

432
00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:24.300
Somewhere along the line in one damn incarnation or another,
if you like,

433
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.320
you not only had a hankering to be an actor or an actress,

434
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.740
but to be a good one,
you're stuck with it now.

435
00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:36.420
You can't just walk out on the results of your own hankerings cause and effect

436
00:30:36.421 --> 00:30:39.450
buddy cause and effect.
The only thing you can do now,

437
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.190
the only religious thing you can do is act,
act for God.

438
00:30:44.191 --> 00:30:49.020
If you want to be gods actress,
if you want to,
what could be prettier?

439
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:57.180
Zoe has this understanding of the cosmos that suggests that strong specific

440
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:03.870
human desires actually changed the course of cosmic futures.

441
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.860
So somewhere,

442
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:10.861
maybe in pre incarnational time before Franny became Franny,

443
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.660
she wanted to be an actress.

444
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.820
The religious things always says is to inhabit that,
to honor that,

445
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.110
to follow up on the results of that prior desiring,

446
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.440
but why is it acting?

447
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.660
Why specifically acting and why this weird comment at the end,

448
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.190
what could be prettier?
What does prettiness have to do with this?

449
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.920
Well,
if you look at the description for instance of Zoe's face,

450
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.660
there's a beautiful description of how his face is beautiful in what way?

451
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:50.200
His face is beautiful.
We know that Franny is,

452
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.570
is an attractive young woman.

453
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:58.470
We know that she worries about beauty and especially in poetry when she's trying

454
00:31:58.601 --> 00:32:00.100
to explain what's wrong.

455
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:05.050
Part of what's wrong is that when she learns poetry in the classroom,

456
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.570
none of it seems beautiful to her.

457
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.400
It all seems like some other kind of production,
not the production of beauty.

458
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.150
<v 1>Okay,</v>

459
00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.360
<v 0>so prettiness beauty.
The aesthetic</v>

460
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
is at the heart of the spiritual practice that Zoe is urging upon Franny,

461
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.600
the spiritual practice of acting.
And I would remind you,

462
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:33.601
looking back to that passage on page 65 and into the 66 that specifically among

463
00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:41.930
the figures that buddy mentions,

464
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.960
the religious and literary figures we find Shakespeare and I think Shakespeare

465
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:51.971
in this train of figures represents the literary that is also the dramatic.

466
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.070
So in our tradition,

467
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:02.630
Shakespeare is the literary name above all others.

468
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.940
It's important for Salinger that Shakespeare was a dramatist.

469
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.230
It's important for this novel that Shakespeare was a dramatist,

470
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:20.830
not just because Zoe wants Frannie to inhabit acting fully as her desire and as

471
00:33:22.521 --> 00:33:26.450
her religious practice as opposed to saying the Jesus prayer

472
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.600
acting has a deeper relation to the novel and here's where we get back to that

473
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:35.750
question of the enclosed spaces and the lack of movement.

474
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.440
If you think about this novel,
it has the structures of drama,

475
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.600
it takes place in small rooms.
You can almost,
if you begin to think about it,

476
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.730
you can almost see the set changes
in the diner

477
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.040
on the train station.
That's about the most open place on the train platform.

478
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.900
That's about the most open place we see in the diner.

479
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.280
In the apartment.

480
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.150
All you do in the apartment is moved from one room to another.

481
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.940
These are dramatic spaces.

482
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.890
Moreover the bathroom completely a dramatic space.

483
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.920
It even has a curtain hiding Zoe from his mother.

484
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

485
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.230
<v 0>Acting becomes a religious</v>

486
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:29.050
practice for much more than Franny,

487
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.700
not just for Franny and for Zoe Cause Zoe's enactor too.

488
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.790
It's a religious practice for the novel itself.

489
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.253
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:46.860
<v 0>And that I would suggest to you is where we can begin to bring some of those</v>

491
00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:50.400
obvious things,
the prevalence of dialogue,

492
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.650
those enclosed spaces,
the tone,

493
00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:00.240
the exaggerated tone,
the somewhat histrionic quality,

494
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.950
the combativeness of that conversation.
It's sheer style.

495
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.140
These are great talkers.

496
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

497
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.490
<v 0>But I would suggest to you Salinger is trying to balance something very</v>

498
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:18.491
carefully that relates back to this question of doctrine versus syncretism in

499
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:20.780
the religious sphere of the novel,

500
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.370
in the religious thematic material of the novel.
And for this,

501
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.480
I'd like to look at the very end of the novel.

502
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.280
Zooey finally suggests that it's attention to the audience that makes an actor

503
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:42.623
really

504
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.680
a special actor or religious actor.

505
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.790
And he points back to advice that buddy gave him.

506
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

507
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.600
<v 0>About,
sorry about that.</v>

508
00:35:56.601 --> 00:36:00.080
Seymour had given him about performing on a radio show.

509
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.620
So they were all radio show.
We as kids.

510
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:10.140
<v 0>And one day Zoe had not wanted to shine his shoes and says,</v>

512
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.080
this is on page 200.
Um,

513
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.760
that the announcer was a moron.
The studio audience.
We're all more on.

514
00:36:18.761 --> 00:36:22.270
The sponsors were more ons and I just damn well wasn't going to shine my shoes

515
00:36:22.271 --> 00:36:26.680
for them.
I told Seymour,
I said they couldn't see them anyway where we sat,

516
00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:31.420
he said to shine them anyway.
He said to shine them for the fat lady.

517
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.260
Now why the Fat Lady?
It's this mythical,

518
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:41.190
incredibly humanly embodied and whenever you see a fat lady in a novel,

519
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.900
one of the first things you want to ask is why is that person need to be

520
00:36:46.901 --> 00:36:51.520
excessively embodied?
That's what fatness is.
In a novel like this,

521
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.120
it's excessive embodiment.
The human.

522
00:36:55.121 --> 00:36:56.770
That's what this woman represents.

523
00:36:56.771 --> 00:37:00.400
The human connect to the human audience,

524
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.590
respect the human audience,
act for them to them.

525
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.530
Don't act as if they're just some,

526
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.520
a bunch of Philistines out there who can appreciate your art.

527
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:14.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

528
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:18.020
<v 0>and then he says to Franny,</v>

529
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.160
I'll tell you a terrible secret.
Are you listening to me?

530
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.930
There isn't anyone out there who isn't Seymour's fat lady.

531
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.000
That includes your professor,

532
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:34.080
Tupper buddy and all his goddamn cousins by the dozens.

533
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.490
There isn't anyone anywhere who isn't Seymour's fat lady.

534
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.720
Don't you know that?

535
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:45.030
Don't you know that God damn secret yet and don't you know.
Listen to me now.

536
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.830
Don't you know who the Fat Lady really is?
A buddy,

537
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:54.030
a buddy.
It's Christ himself,
Christ himself.
Buddy,

538
00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.660
this seems like a completely Christian answer to Zoe's problem and we're back on

539
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:01.800
the horns of that dilemma.

540
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:05.550
Is this a syncretic religious vision or is it a Christian one?

541
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.870
But look what follows.
This is not the last word

542
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.240
for joy.

543
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.900
Apparently it was all Frannie could do to hold the phone even with both hands

544
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.290
for a foolish half minute or so.
There was no other words,

545
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:22.500
no further speech then I can't talk anymore buddy.

546
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:27.650
The sound of a phone being replaced on its catch followed Frannie took in her

547
00:38:27.811 --> 00:38:31.830
breasts slightly,
but continued to hold the phone to her ear,

548
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:37.090
a dial tone of course.
Follow the formal break in the connection.

549
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:42.420
She appeared to find it extraordinarily beautiful to listen to rather as if it

550
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:48.331
were the best possible substitute for the primordial silence itself.

551
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.520
The dial tone is that state of awareness of the divine that buddy speaks of when

552
00:38:58.411 --> 00:39:02.520
he says when he speaks of being with God before God said,

553
00:39:02.521 --> 00:39:07.521
let there be light Zoe's voice breaking that dial tone in the beginning in his

554
00:39:07.951 --> 00:39:12.000
phone call.
And then the resumption of it afterwards,

555
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.450
that dial tone in cases,
Zoe's voice.

556
00:39:15.451 --> 00:39:20.451
So that what Zoe says to her is one of the rays of light of God's creation.

557
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.660
One of those things like Shakespeare that is part of the whole created world.

558
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.720
But what Frannie can tune into after hearing his voice is that very essential

559
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.770
divine sound,
meaningless sound.

560
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:40.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

561
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.720
<v 0>And so this is how sound your balances the syncretic,</v>

562
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.960
these sort of empty mysticism of Seymour and buddy with the embodied doc trinal

563
00:39:53.571 --> 00:39:58.571
specific insistence that we see from Zoe from the insistence on humans

564
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:02.420
specificity,
the fat lady,

565
00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.680
the very material human fleshly person

566
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.870
Salinger's own novel performs in this way.

567
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.420
And that's how you would,

568
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.400
that's how you would want to think about moments like,
um,

569
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.110
on the bottom of one 80.

570
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.680
<v 0>This is describing the bedroom,
uh,</v>

572
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:31.470
of Seymour and buddy as Zoe walks in

573
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.880
a stranger with a flair for cocktail party.

574
00:40:35.881 --> 00:40:40.830
Descriptive prose might've commented that the room at a quick glance looked as

575
00:40:40.831 --> 00:40:45.780
if it had once been tenanted by two struggling 12 year old lawyers or
researches.

576
00:40:45.781 --> 00:40:47.190
It's um,

577
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.290
and then if you flip back to,
um,

578
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.350
let's see,
one 72,

579
00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.490
<v 1>okay,</v>

580
00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:02.350
<v 0>describing Zoe's sweaty shirt,
his shirt was in the familiar phrase,</v>

581
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.180
wringing wet.

582
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.310
And there are lots of moments like this self conscious moments of style.

583
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:14.380
So in the familiar phrase,
wringing wet,
he's saying,
I'm about to use a cliche.

584
00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:17.260
Here it is.
There it is.
He says,

585
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.760
someone with a flair for cocktail party conversation.

586
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.540
A witticism would say this,
he gives it to us,

587
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:29.320
but he frames it as an affectation of style.

588
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.490
So what Salinger I think shows us is that affectation without something like

589
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.140
love
is just affectation.

590
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.970
And that's what lane represents.

591
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:48.680
That's the affectation of literature without any human connection.

592
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.990
That's why when he talks on and on,

593
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.480
it's as if Franny isn't even there listening to him.

594
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:56.630
He's been going on a quarter hour and he's just hitting his stride.

595
00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.790
Franny,
Zoe,
buddy,

596
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.343
Bessie,

597
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:08.760
they all tried to speak directly to

598
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:11.123
each other.

599
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.420
The family language is what makes them very human.

600
00:42:18.301 --> 00:42:21.180
They embody this very specific family language.

601
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:24.150
And so I would argue to you that sound,

602
00:42:24.151 --> 00:42:29.151
you're imagines literature as a performance of this kind of performance of a

603
00:42:30.991 --> 00:42:35.991
language of family love that is nevertheless also an aesthetic language.

604
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:42.980
And I think actually probably the best image of that is in Seymour's diary.

605
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.880
When Zoe sits down to make that phone call,

606
00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:52.881
he opens up Seymour's diary and he sees Seymour's account of his birthday

607
00:42:53.551 --> 00:42:58.551
celebration where the family had put on a Vaudeville show right in their living

608
00:42:59.941 --> 00:43:02.670
room.
Remember,
his parents are Vaudevillians.

609
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

610
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:07.950
<v 0>And that description,
uh,</v>

611
00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:12.550
which I won't read just because we're running out of time,
it's on 180180180 two.

612
00:43:12.551 --> 00:43:13.930
You can look at it yourself.

613
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.950
It's brimming with pleasure and love.

614
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.780
This is why body really can't insist that Zoe is wrong about this being a

615
00:43:29.321 --> 00:43:34.321
religious novel because being a religious novel and being a love story are

616
00:43:35.441 --> 00:43:39.190
finally for Salinger the same thing.

617
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:45.700
It's the performance of human connection.

618
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.680
That's the phone line.
That's conversation,
that's letters.

619
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.120
The performance of family conversation is like acting.

620
00:43:55.150 --> 00:44:00.040
And that is why Zoe impersonates buddy,
he's acting,

621
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.470
but Frannie can hear the specific voice.

622
00:44:05.471 --> 00:44:10.340
And this is when you know that Franny is not just a sort of empty air head.

623
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:14.470
She may be mistaken about who she's praying,
two in the Jesus prayer,

624
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:19.590
but she damn well knows the Tambour of her brother's voice and his particularity

625
00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:25.690
of speech.
And so when he tries to imitate buddy,

626
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.730
she finds him out very quickly.

627
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.820
And this is when you know that Franny really does benefit from Seymour and

628
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:37.230
buddy's religious education in the same way that Zoey has.

629
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.210
And so if we step back for a minute now from my reading,

630
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.440
there are a couple of things I want to say.
First of all,

631
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:50.280
I hope you can see just as using that as a model,

632
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.880
how I went from big claims about the novel into specificity to support those

633
00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:01.560
claims.
That's the structure of any good literary argument.

634
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.870
The attention moves from the very small to the large and back again,

635
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.280
there's a kind of rhythm to that that folds in those obvious parts of the novel

636
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.290
to a more thematic sets.

637
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:20.460
A set of concerns in this case about the religious,
um,

638
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:21.990
philosophy of this novel.

639
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:27.090
So as you think about writing papers,

640
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:32.040
go through that two step process of thinking about the large picture of what a

641
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:37.041
novel is doing as a piece of literary art and then thinking about a focused set

642
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.640
of concerns and in the final development of your paper,

643
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.580
making sure that those two can relate to one another.

644
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.040
The second thing I want to say is less about paper writing and more about the

645
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:54.840
trajectory of this course in what we're seeing in common between these novels.

646
00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.440
So you can read this very closely to on the road if dean cared for nothing,

647
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.950
but for everything in principle,

648
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.820
you could say conversely that Salinger cares for everything in particular and in

649
00:46:17.461 --> 00:46:19.440
principle nothingness.

650
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.640
It's nothingness that is the mystical state rather than everythingness.

651
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.780
And it's interesting to think about whether those two are really opposites.

652
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.110
I think these novels imagined them to be opposites,

653
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.420
but it's something for you to think about about whether they really are.

654
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

655
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.040
<v 0>So Zoe's specificity is the specificity of doctrine,</v>

656
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:53.210
but it's also the specificity and more importantly,
the specificity of person.

657
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

658
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:56.060
<v 0>So that's that.</v>

659
00:46:56.061 --> 00:47:00.050
That's the everything that he cares about person,

660
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.710
I will stop there.
And,
um,

661
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.150
please bring both on the road and Franny and Zooey to section this week.

662
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.830
And by the way,
one last thing,

663
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.370
if you've been sketchy about your section attendance,

664
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.410
I suggest that you try to pull up your socks and go,

665
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:23.300
um,
we will be talking about papers in the section.

666
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.440
It will be helpful to you and it will also give you a chance to talk about these

667
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:29.210
books.
So please do go.
