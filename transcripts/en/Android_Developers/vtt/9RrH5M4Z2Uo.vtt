MARC TOBIAS KUNISCH:
Developers have

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.180
been creating Instant
Apps for over a year

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.540
now, enabling users to enjoy
their apps by simply tapping

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.000
a link or pressing a
button in the Play Store

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.850
instead of installing
the entire app.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.800
But we didn't want
to stop there.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.280
Games are a big part of the
user experience on phones.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.400
For this reason, we've extended
the Instant App technology

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.870
to games.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.810
Welcome to Google Play
Instant, where apps and games

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.530
can be played instantly.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.020
You might have seen the UX
best practices for Instant Apps

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.110
that we published last year on
the Android Developers Channel.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.720
If you haven't yet,
they're worth checking out.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.550
The link is in the
video description below.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.150
Don't worry.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.483
I'll be here when you come back.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.820
But since games are a
little different than apps,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.100
I'd like to talk a bit
about the user experience

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.580
specifically for games
on Google Play Instant.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.920
There are many different
ways that users can access

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.200
a game without installing it.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.260
Users may be coming from
an ad, a link on a website,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.540
a message from a friend, the
Play Games app, Google Search

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.930
results, or the Try Now
button on the Play Store.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350
Consider what you want your
gaming experience and Google

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.949
Play Instant to accomplish.

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:13.740
Do you want it to be
a standalone game that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.870
is completely instant?

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.450
Or can you make the
first level of your game

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.120
available to be accessed
instantly, allowing users

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.580
to try out your game?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.770
Developers have created
this sort of companion

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.750
to their existing games.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.420
This experience creates
excitement with your gamers

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.910
by showing off the most
exciting parts of a game

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.090
before installation.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.150
There are plenty of exciting
options to choose from.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.820
Think about which route you
want to take, and be deliberate

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.250
when building out your
Instant experience.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.080
In doing so, you'll
increase your reach

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.650
by providing value
to your gamers.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.200
We've created a new loading
UI for launching games

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.730
from Google Play Instant.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.890
We think it's much more
appropriate for a gaming

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.850
experience.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.880
And users have been telling
us that they love it.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.610
It sometimes takes a little
longer to launch a game

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.260
than it is to launch an app.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.660
So it was important for us
to keep users entertained

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.160
while a game is loading.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.889
To avoid users abandoning
your experience,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.670
try to get them into the
gameplay as soon as possible.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.800
If it is necessary to
show an additional loading

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.790
screen in the game, try to
shorten it as much as possible.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.950
You can load in additional
parts of your game

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.860
during runtime using the
Google Play core library.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.980
When prompting users to install
your game or to preregister,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.030
show a button in your UI
that uses the words Install

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.970
or Preregister.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.090
In games, it is usually
better to not just

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.780
rely on the Download
or Install icon alone.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.730
You can choose to show
the prompt permanently

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.230
in your UI between levels
or as part of the main menu.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.100
Whether you choose only one of
these options or all of them,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.860
make sure that your users can
have a great experience even

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.365
without installing your game.

00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:58.740
Your Instant
experience shouldn't

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.710
be reduced to an ad banner.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.840
It is important to save your
users' progress when they play

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.050
your game after installing it.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.690
In particular,
their achievements

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.210
and their purchases must
not go missing after they've

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.160
decided to install your game.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.380
You can use the cookie and
storage APIs to do this.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.500
People will want to
keep the magic battleaxe

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.900
that they fought so hard for
against those ugly goblins

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.060
in that dungeon.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.070
As it is possible to access
games on Google Play Instant

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.440
by simply clicking
a link, some users

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.860
will access them serendipitously
or unintentionally.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.840
For those users, it
is important to have

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.830
a way back out of the game
if they choose to leave.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.960
Do not disable the
Android Back button

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.640
at the bottom of the screen.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.200
It is fine to show
a warning when

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.440
it is pressed to alert users
they're about to exit the game.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.330
But it is good
practice not to disrupt

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.540
established
navigational patterns.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.670
Google Play Instant
is a fantastic way

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.850
for users to share their
gaming experience with friends

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.010
and let them try
it out themselves.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.320
In your game, make
it easy for users

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.690
to invite others to join them.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.510
Players are much more likely
to join if they're not only

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.820
invited by someone
they know, but also get

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.710
to try out the experience
before they commit

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.890
to purchasing it themselves.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.120
To recap, when designing
a user experience

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.550
for your game on
Google Play Instant,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.020
consider the right entry points
and use cases for your game.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.710
Remove any unnecessary latency,
and let your users experience

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.980
the game as quickly as possible.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.440
Think about the right
moment in your experience

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.400
to prompt for installation
and preregistration.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.920
Make sure your users
maintain their progress

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.530
after installing the game.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.900
Don't disable the
Android Back button.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.310
And provide a way for users
to share a game with others.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.500
We believe that games
on Google Play Instant

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.720
are a great way to remove
friction for your users.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.070
We can't wait to see what
you will build with it.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.100
You can find everything I
talked about here and much more

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.070
