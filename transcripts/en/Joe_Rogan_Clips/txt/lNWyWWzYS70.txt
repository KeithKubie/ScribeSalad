Speaker 1:          00:00          During the Pan s period or some shit. Pangea. Do you know what that is? It's the era. No, it's, well when they think that all of the continents were connected together. We are one, we are one flat earth as one flat table. Just flat. No, no, no. Just obviously not like giant chunk and then the rest was water and then it spread out, which is fucking weird. Like what is happening? How did that and like also is that happening on our insides on like it's obviously on a cellular level of the things. Just splitting and being torn. The fuck apart is, here's the, the modern pangea map. This is modern. It's a modern country separations and all that because, oh this is what it looked like if he brought up, I thought this was, there's more to pitch is still real America. What is that? I thought there was some knuckleheads that thought that.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Is that really all of the continents together? Whoa. It shows you how much God damn water there is like that's a mind fuck. Yeah. Cause you'd really like to think that we're all dirt and not as much water. It's so much water. It's all water. It's like a little speck in a huge ass ocean. This was really crazy so it was ground dwelling. Motherfuckers have figured out how sock all the fish out of that water just to be able to get those suckers out your bare hands and then they were like, Yo, we need something. We need a smaller situation. I think until they, they came up with the nets and stuff like that. I don't think they were real effective. I think they just got what they got and they ate that but the populations were fine but in the last whatever hundred and 50 years they've been using nets, they just jacked that whole ocean. What do you think happened to the dude who figured out like the hook? He probably got all the pussy in town. That dude or like hook the fish. He was getting all those fishies. He was getting the ones that were way deep to what the kind of pussy that you would get back when you invented a book. You don't want it in your modern mind you don't, but back then you're like, Yo, this is fresh, fresh. It only smells like musty. How'd you become a African American? Something's happening to you.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Wake and bake in this, taking you to another level. Another level for sure. Yeah. Let's guess how long ago do you think they invented the fish work? Did they even know? I'm going to say it's a really old invention. Rolled Arrowhead time period close to like native, native before pre need pitches would just break. If you think about a big fish hooking like a little thin, what would they make it? A bone probably must be [inaudible] hard, but you would think don't want to be too heavy. You should just sinking wold also break. Yeah. I want to be able to go get well. Yeah. It must've been bone. I bet it was bone and the bones get brittle, especially after like you know they're off the body and they start to calcify and all that.

Speaker 1:          03:00          How old do you think it is? This guy, really old juniper. What it says? Juniper wood was the first one, 21 to 23,000 years ago. Jesus Christ. There is Norwegians. Yeah, they're made from sea snail shells. There's a bunch of information I'll put together in this thing. Okinawa island data between 20 2003 80 and 20 2007 70 in that crazy. They'd get it that close. They're basically in an inter, you know, give or take 80 90 years, hundred years it carbon dating. I mean that's the only thing I remember from high school. How do you even, how do you date it back? Do they find, is it like a forensic thing where they grab a fly and they're like, yeah, this was six years ago because of the juices on the wings. I think it's, there's like a bunch of factors. Like one of them is the dirt that's around where they find it.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Like if they find it on the ground, then it's covered with dirt over hundreds and hundreds of years. He could take some of that dirt and test it. Yeah, they can see what's in it. They they're trying to test, I think. Whoa. That was crazy. I want those earrings. Is that a fish hook? I clicked the other shelves. Those are fresh. Those are really nice. I would rock those. What'd you the comedy store? Oldest fish hook found at Okinawa. Wow. 23,000 years ago. That's crazy. So they're saying that the oldest fish hook is linked to the Norwegians? I would say Japanese. This is Okinawa. Norwegian thing was saying that and up until the 1950s there were, they were still using wood and just like a added fact and one of these make sense if they all figured it out the same time, different spots in the world, you know, wonder if it's one of those things like, you know, like the, there's just some weird thing.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Who's that? Is that Rupert Sheldrake is the morphic residence theory. He's got this weird theory that I think the idea is that if some a rat learns amaze on the east coast rats on the west coast, we'll learn that maze quicker. What, what, how like uh, like, uh, they don't know the no consciousness amongst the rats. As weird as it sounds. There might be some sort of strange connection that all rats share and not just all rats, but all living beings. His argument was that if this is demonstrate a bubble with a rat in a maze, that if they did something like a with human beings, if they could figure out a way to, uh, to prove this, that's likely what's happening. Is it like he, he brought up a bunch of different factors, like inventions that are simultaneously taking place like all over the world, like one and strain. Yeah. You shouldn't attribute some of that to education, right? Like, yeah, definitely a challenge that's going on, like the, the trends that are happening in education, but they also think there might be something else going on underneath the surface, like on a different realm. Like if you learn, if we're all a species and you're on one side of the world, you learn something that people on the other side of the world have greater access to it in some weird way. That's really bizarre.
