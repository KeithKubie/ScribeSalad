00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey Freburg: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.680
Welcome.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.680
[crowd chatter]

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.630
So, it's a real pleasure of mine to introduce
our guest today, Chef Jacques Pepin.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
He actually taught me how to cook when I was
a little kid, so it's really a treat for me

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.440
to talk to you today.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440
So, welcome to Google.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.980
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Thank you.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.119
[applause]

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.269
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, you're here to talk about
your new book, and--.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.349
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: That's what I'm here for.

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.349
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yes.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.349
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: OK.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.349
Good.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.349
[laughter]

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.880
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, well, hopefully we can
get you a little lunch, too, on top of that.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.880
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: All right.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.270
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: But really love the book.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.670
It seems like a great recipe bank, but one
thing that I really liked about it was the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.810
discs that you included, with all techniques.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.810
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yes.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.449
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, you wanna talk about that
a little bit?

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.719
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yes.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.879
Probably I would agree with you.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.430
The DVD that I have in there, three hours
of technique, ran from tightening your apron

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.609
to sharpening a knife to boning out a chicken,
making an omelet, doing a caramel cage.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.050
All of those are very visual and very difficult
to explain in word.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.900
It take page and page for me to tell you how
to do a cornet with a piece of wax paper.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.110
You know, to do decoration.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.280
Fold it in the right angle, cross it in the
center of the hypotenuse, your [inaudible

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.930
] your right hand.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.549
Fold it.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.650
You see it done.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.650
Yeah.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.060
You see it done and it's that's the beauty
of it.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.940
And I am Dean of Study at the French Culinary
Institute in New York City.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.130
And I teach at BU, Boston University, for
about 31 years.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.939
Something like that.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.369
I live in Connecticut, as you see by my Yankee
drawl.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.670
[laughter]

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.899
So, and in those school, I mean, this is the
technique that we teach.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.860
Fifty, forty-five thousand dollars at the
French Culinary Institute for the program.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.840
But that's basically it, you know?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.710
And the technique for me are very important.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.700
It's a question of repeat, repeat, repeat,
repeat, so that it becomes so much part of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.380
yourself that now you can afford to forget
it.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.050
Now, I can think in term of color or texture
stuff and my hands are just moving.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.560
And certainly, for anyone who work in the--.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.720
Can you hear me OK?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720
Yeah.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.110
Anyone who work with his hand, whether you
are a cabinet maker, whether you are a surgeon

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.250
for that matter, a sculptor, a painter and
all that, you first have to become a craftsman

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.940
in my book.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.830
And if you happen to have talent, then the
craftmanship in your hand enable you to take

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.180
that talent somewhere and do something with
it.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.310
So, if you're a good craftsman, you can run
a restaurant.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.000
I knew a fair amount of chef who run restaurant,
but they are relatively lousy cook.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.090
But they are a good craftsman, so they run
the place fine.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.700
Someone has a lot of talent and you can take
that--if you are Thomas Keller or someone

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.580
like this and you can really bring it to extraordinary
food, or to great food maybe.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.980
And if you put a bit of love into it, then
it make it to extraordinary food and so.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.350
So, I am very happy with that DVD.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.190
I do that, I mean, I've been teaching or doing
show on television here, actually at KQED

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.610
for the last 25 years.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.450
I've done 12 series of 26 show here in the
last.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.150
And out of that book, there is a series now,
which is here.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.820
I think it's Saturday morning, my show here
at KQED.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.960
So, we did 26 show usually series.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.660
Twenty-six show for some reason on PBS.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.630
And I have four, five recipe in each of those
series.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.770
I have my daughter on it and my granddaughter.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.960
I have my friend Jean-Claude.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.510
So, this is part of the book as well.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.360
And it's always better to see it done than
just to read it.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.650
But the recipes themselves, I didn't even
want to do that book.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.960
This is, I think, number 27, my books which
I have done many book.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.190
And that book a kind of recap of recipe book
which were out of print that we start looking

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.190
at again.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.370
So, I started doing about 25 hundred recipe
there, a lot where we don't have.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.780
I look at salmon.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.120
I see three or four salmon.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.150
They have tomato in it.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.200
So, I eliminate and so forth.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.790
And the point is, well, either to leave it
the way it was--.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.710
I think the New York Times did a big book
last year, the "New York Times Cookbook,"

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.650
the last 30, 40 years.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.810
And they left the recipe the way they were
at that time.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.110
And it was just to show people.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.820
So, it was either this for me or change them
to make them usable and more in the style

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.830
of what we do today.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.280
And I choose the second option.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.640
And it end up being more work than doing a
book.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.940
[laughs] So, from scratch, we don't cook the
vegetable in the same amount of time.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.870
Fish also--amount of cooking.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.980
The amount of fat that we put in it, the type
of fatâ€”from butter to cream to olive oil

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.810
to--all change a great deal.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.060
There are a fair amount of changes.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.230
But anyway, so it came out in the fall last
year.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.170
And we did that series on television.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.720
It started.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.640
And I was supposed to be here last fall to
publish, to do a book tour, which I did part

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640
of it.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.300
And all of a sudden, I had to have a hip replacement,
so I was stuck for a little while.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.150
The beauty of getting old, you know?

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.740
And now I'm back.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.740
So.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.740
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.210
And so, I watched your DVD and one thing that
I found very interesting is that you mentioned

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.860
that like, through your career, you changed
your technique.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.670
Do you wanna talk about that and how you changed
and what you did?

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.430
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Well, actually I don't know.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.030
I think I said I don't change my technique.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.380
Can that, the--.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.380
Yeah.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.430
A little bit, but I have a book called "La
Technique," an illustrated manual of cooking

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.430
technique.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.210
Very large book, which have three thousand
picture, black and white.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.100
[clears throat] I did that book in '76, I
believe, the book called "La Technique," and

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.180
a follow-up called "La Methode," who are looking
for a similar name.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.060
And eventually, those two book got together,
which is that large book.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:18.290
Well, that book got a prize two years ago
in Europe for whatever and I won, at the IACP--International

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.960
Association Culinary Professional--was in
New York two weeks ago, as one of the greatest

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.600
book of well, the last half-Century or whatever.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.640
And not saying that to brag, but maybe a little
bit, but--

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640
[laughter]

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.010
the point is that book is still in print because
the technique are the same--the way you sharpen

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.110
a knife, the way you beat an egg white, the
way you do an omelet.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.420
All of that have never changed.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.330
I mean, my recipe are quite different than
they would have been 25, 30 years ago, but

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.050
the technique themself are the same.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.950
And that's why you try to teach technique
in a professional school.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.690
That is, teaching you how to cook.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.520
And then, after you take it and you do something
else with it.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.790
I mean, as a young chef, it's not too complicated.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.910
All you have say is, "Yes, Chef."

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.440
Chef never asks your opinion.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.880
So, you work with someone for a year, year
and a half.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.320
Someone like Thomas Keller at Bouchon, if
you have the chance to.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.210
And you're idea there, really, is to try to
visualize the food through his eyes, through

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.790
his sense of aesthetic, and through his talent
because that's why you work there--to work

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.790
with someone like that.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.580
So, you absorb as much as you can.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.210
And you move to that area of New York and
you do the same thing for another two years.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.320
Then, you move to Jean-Georges or whatever
and do the same thing for another two years.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.660
And after five, six year, that young chef
had absorbed an enormous amount of material

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.850
just saying, "Yes, Chef."

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:47.669
At that time, you kind of--excuse the pun--but
you can regurgitate it.

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.990
But now, you filter it through your sense
of aesthetic, your sense of taste.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.710
And now, you start doing your food, but not
before that really.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.910
It does take time.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.890
What am I talking about anyway?

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.890
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Oh, nothing.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:00.890
[laughter]

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.890
That was great.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.490
So, I heard a really interesting fact.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:09.200
At the time you were offered the job with
the Kennedy's to be the Chef at the White

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.760
House and you turned it down to work for Howard
Johnsons.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.300
I'd like to hear more about that.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.430
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Not a big deal.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.430
[laughter]

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.430
It's not really.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.380
I mean, I had been the chef in France from
'56 to '59 to three Presidents.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.330
I finished with de Gaulle in '59.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.370
So, I came to this country.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.740
I work at Le Pavillon in New York.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.260
I was going to stay here two years in New
York.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.400
Most people come to America to get a better
life for economic reason, religious reason,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.270
political reason, too.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.770
It wasn't my case.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.980
I work at Le Pavillon, which was considered
maybe the greatest restaurant, French restaurant,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.550
in America at that time.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:59.990
And I worked there and Howard Johnson was
one of our customer, Howard D. Johnson, the

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.440
one who created the company.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:11.060
But in the Spring of 1961, Kennedy were very
regular at the house, start to planning for

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.860
the White House, so they called me.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.600
At that time, it was very casual.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.110
I mean, did they call the owner of La Caravelle,
the restaurant which called Roger, the chef.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.160
Roger called me.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.260
I said, "I don't think so."

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:30.240
Pierre Franey was at the Le Pavillon, was
leaving to go to Howard Johnson and he said,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.660
"Come with me," and so forth.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:39.320
So, he had no idea, to be truthful, of the
inkling of the possibility of publicity from

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.870
the White House and all that because he did
not exist.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.450
So, you have to realize that 30 years ago,
I would never have been sitting here.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.080
The chef at the bottom of the social scale
and when I was in Paris, when I worked with

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.360
the French President, I served people like
Eisenhower, Nehru, Tito, Maximilan--those

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.510
that were Head of State at the time.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:04.529
No one ever would come to the kitchen, not
even a thank you or whatever.

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:06.960
You'd never even have a thank you or anyone
thanks.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.280
Someone comes to the kitchen because something
was wrong.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.910
And then you get it.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.490
But otherwise, never, you never.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.730
So, that was the way it was.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.860
I mean, I'm not complaining.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.750
It was the way it was for everybody.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:24.060
So, when I was asked to go to the White House,
I had no idea of the possibility of publicity.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.660
I'd never been in a newspaper, in a magazine,
television barely existed.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.740
So, that was--.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.649
Any good mother would have wanted her child
to marry a doctor, a lawyer, an architect,

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:36.190
but certainly not a cook, you know?

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.190
[laughter]

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.190
Now, we are genius.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.320
So, I don't know what happened.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
[laughter]

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.710
In any case, to validate my choice, this is
I did that certainly because of that.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.760
I didn't realize.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.710
But it was very good.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.320
I worked ten years Director of Research for
Howard Johnson.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.190
I did work like specific gravity and coliform
and that area stuff.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.180
I learned the American eating habit.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.050
I worked in a totally American environment.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.120
So, it was very good for me.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.890
I opened the World Trade Center in 1973, I
believe.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.790
Yeah, '73.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.960
I opened a restaurant first when I left Howard
Johnson on 5th Avenue in New York called La

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960
Potagerie.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.490
It was a place with a very high volume to
some group of investor wanted to do that,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.230
so I created the concept, the name, and I
did thing.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.800
Then I opened the World Trade Center in 1974.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.410
I did a commissary on the list for the two
tower.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.870
And we had 26 restaurants on the main course.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.130
And that, in addition, Window of the World,
Skyline on 44th Street and so forth.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:53.959
I have to say that the commissary that I had
under Tower One was blown out in 1993 by a

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.990
guy who brought the truck there with bomb
in it, you know?

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.990
A terrorist.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.540
And they blew out that part of the building,
the terrorists.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.040
And then after, of course, they blew the whole
things.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.399
After that, I work, I was a consultant for
the Russian Tea Room in New York, too.

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:12.360
I am staying only on those job because I could
never have been able to do the commissary

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.750
at the World Trade Center, or that soup place,
or the Russian Tea Room, if I hadn't had the

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.529
training of Howard Johnson that I had.

00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:25.140
As a chef, I didn't know anything about production,
stuff like this.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.354
So, Howard Johnson was very good to me--

00:12:26.354 --> 00:12:27.354
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Great.

00:12:27.354 --> 00:12:28.354
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: in that way.

00:12:28.354 --> 00:12:31.950
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, what are some of your
fondest food memories?

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:38.150
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Fondest food memories are
always sitting down with my wife or my mother

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.870
or my kid or friend.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.040
Friend is always the fondest.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.010
I mean, food itself is nothing in itself.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.620
The sharing of the food and on the table and
all that is what makes it.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:56.790
I mean, this is maybe the most civilized way
of having a conversation--around food--and

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.790
discuss it.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.800
So, that's important.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:05.000
In my family, it's, of course, with bread
and wine there is always bread and wine on

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.810
the table [laughs] so we can see a meal.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.690
Without a basket of bread and a bottle of
wine.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.000
And I've been married 45, almost 46 years.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.570
And I don't remember one day that my wife
and I didn't sit down for dinner--don't have

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.510
time really for lunch.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.950
We sit a little bit for lunch, but having
dinner and drinking wine, often two bottles

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.029
of wine,

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:29.029
[laughter]

00:13:29.029 --> 00:13:33.173
but the point is if I start cooking at four
o'clock in the afternoon, I happen to have

00:13:33.173 --> 00:13:37.610
a bottle of wine--white wine--and then, by
the time we sit down to eat at seven, eight

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.610
o'clock, it's gone.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.730
So, we open a bottle of red wine.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.730
[laughter]

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.610
So, now when I go see my doctor, he say "How
much wine do you drink?"

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.570
I've decided to only buy my wine in magnum
now--

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.570
[laughter]

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:56.029
because I say, "One bottle a day."

00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:57.029
Then, I avoid problem.

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:58.029
[laughter]

00:13:58.029 --> 00:14:00.900
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, you mentioned that you
were cooking with your daughter and your granddaughter.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.820
Are they good cooks as well?

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.430
Has that been a good bonding experience for
you?

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.890
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Well, my wife is a good cook.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.950
My wife was born in New York City from a Puerto
Rican mother and a Cuban father, so she's

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.670
a real New Yorker.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:20.160
That's why that book, often I maybe looked
at on the quintessential French chef, you

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.870
get to page--I don't know--32 and you have
black bean soup with banana and cilantro on

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.820
top, which is really Cuban.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.830
Next, you have ceviche.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.350
Next, you have whatever.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.100
That represent the last 50 years in my life
for me in America.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.740
So, it's a very American cookbook in that
sense.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:46.459
I do have some true French technique and French
recipe, but in a sense, I don't try to be

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:48.220
French.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.660
And by the same token, I don't try not to
be French.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.290
I don't really think about it in those terms.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.940
I cook whatever is around.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.820
And I have a place in Mexico.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.820
Just came back ten weeks.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:04.480
So, I go there, buy a bandera, look at a paper
and can start cooking with that.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.950
So, that make its way into recipe.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.960
And the series that I did before, I did two
series on PBS prior to this one.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.760
I've done 12 here, but two series, the last
two, were called "Fast Food My Way."

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:25.250
And those were, each one of them has a little
book, and those are very easy recipe to follow

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.250
through.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.450
Maybe the best, maybe the recipe that people
use maybe the most.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:36.930
What I did there in those book, when you are
in a professional kitchen, you have the prep

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.630
cook who came in the morning.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.950
"La maison plas," we call it in French.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:46.690
So, the prep cook bone out the chicken, bone
out the fish, slice the mushroom, shell the

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.790
shallot, wash the spinach, they do all that
stuff.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.620
Shove the tomato and all that, so you have
everything ready.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.410
I get to the stove, everything is fresh ready.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.550
Someone order filet of sole.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.120
I grab the filet of sole ready.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.750
I put some shallots on top, a bit of sliced
mushroom, dash of white wine, bit of olive

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.640
oil, bring it to a boil, finish it up.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.550
I do it in three, four minutes, five minutes.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.550
Why?

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.550
Because everything is ready.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.339
So, that what the premise is in those book.

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.670
I use the supermarket as a prep cook.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.860
I can go there, buy two breast of boneless,
skinless chicken.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.860
I use a no-stick pan.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.820
I have pre-wash spinach, pre-sliced mushroom,
whatever I can buy at the market.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.250
And with minimum amount of effort, fresh food,
I can do a menu.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.860
In fact, when we did that, those show are
half an hour.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.300
I did three dish.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.670
I never use the back kitchen.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:40.570
I did those three dish, or four dish sometime,
in the 30 minutes that I was on television.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.000
So, it's a nice way of cooking, too.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.900
A bit different from that, you know?

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:52.440
And certainly, at the [inaudible] if you want
of my book on technique, where if I don't

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.980
show you how to prep the chicken, and goose,
too.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.240
I used to.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.920
Skin the rabbit and then cut it and eviscerate
it and so forth, that's cooking from the beginning.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.490
It's another way of doing it, you know?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.250
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, what was the last meal
that you made?

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.669
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Last meal that I made.

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:10.669
OK.

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:13.659
When did I leave home?

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:19.760
I was in Pebble Beach Thursday, Friday, Saturday
for the Food and Wine Festival.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.730
Then, I was in Phoenix on the PBS station.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.769
I did like, five show and other things.

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:27.929
And I came here on Monday.

00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:31.040
So, Friday.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.610
Wednesday night we went out for dinner.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.879
[laughter]

00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:38.489
I think Tuesday, the Tuesday before I did
a chicken.

00:17:38.489 --> 00:17:39.489
Oh, no.

00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:41.460
The last time I cooked was in Pebble Beach.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.590
I did a chicken in vinegar.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.869
They are the most special with my daughter,
which I have in there.

00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:48.609
Chicken in vinegar, which I thought was really
good.

00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:49.609
[Jeff Freburg laughs]

00:17:49.609 --> 00:17:51.350
I mean, I haven't done that in 25 years.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.789
I didn't even remember it.

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:53.789
I say, "Wow.

00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:54.789
That's good."

00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:55.789
[laughter]

00:17:55.789 --> 00:18:00.759
And I did a mashed potato, turnips, turnips
and potato, mashed potato with garlic in it,

00:18:00.759 --> 00:18:01.929
and some apple fritter.

00:18:01.929 --> 00:18:02.929
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: OK.

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:05.010
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: So, that's what I did.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.010
Yeah.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.659
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, what are some of the things
that you really like to cook?

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:10.390
What are some of your favorite ingredients?

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.850
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: The market, you know?

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.659
The market and the season for me, that will
define.

00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:19.850
But I mean, certainly, I could be on an island
if there is chicken and eggs.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.039
Eggs, for me, I love eggs.

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:27.330
But people say, "What's the best thing you
can put in your mouth?"

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.210
Well, if I have the greatest possible bread
that I can take and the greatest possible

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.059
butter, very hard to beat bread and butter,
I tell you.

00:18:36.059 --> 00:18:37.059
[laughter]

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:40.309
And that being said, there is many other thing
you cook, but--.

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:43.879
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, what are some of your
favorite restaurants in San Francisco?

00:18:43.879 --> 00:18:46.380
And where are you going to be eating while
you're here?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.220
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: That's a leading question,
right?

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220
[laughter]

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.230
But certainly, to paraphrase James Beard,
I think who said the best restaurant is where

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.859
they know you, and it's true in many ways.

00:18:56.859 --> 00:18:59.210
I'll go see my friend [inaudible]--

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.169
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:03.140
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: too.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.649
I stay at the, I used to love Ter Posterie.

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:09.740
I stay at the Prescott Hotel now.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.039
Now, it's closed, too.

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:14.090
But there is so many other restaurant that
I go to here.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.950
I mean, tonight I'm going to be.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.950
Tonight?

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.950
Yes.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:21.950
Yeah.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.950
City, City Center.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.950
Whatever there is that.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.840
And I'm being carried by Daniel Patterson,
from Coi, you know?

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.539
And while La Folie, this is a great restaurant.

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.639
I mean, two star in the Michelin.

00:19:35.639 --> 00:19:37.299
It's extraordinary.

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:43.169
With that being said, if I'm here for a while,
when I come and we film, we end up in Chinatown

00:19:43.169 --> 00:19:44.169
a fair amount of time.

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:47.220
I love Chinese food and other type of Oriental
food.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.451
As well as when you go down Post, you turn
underneath that alley.

00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:52.451
I forget.

00:19:52.451 --> 00:19:53.451
Something Alley and there is--.

00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:54.451
&gt;&gt;male #1: Belden?

00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:55.451
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Ah?

00:19:55.451 --> 00:19:56.451
&gt;&gt;male #1: Belden, maybe?

00:19:56.451 --> 00:19:57.750
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: There is a Spanish restaurant
there.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.929
There's a French restaurant.

00:19:58.929 --> 00:20:00.590
Three or four, five little restaurant.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.710
Really good, especially the Spanish one.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.710
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: OK.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.549
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: I forget the name of it,
though.

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:06.549
But--.

00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:07.549
&gt;&gt;male #1: Belden.

00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:08.549
B-E-L-D-E-N.

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:09.549
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: B-E-A-L?

00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:10.549
&gt;&gt;male #1: B-E-L.

00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:11.549
Belden.

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:12.549
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Oh, yeah.

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:13.549
I think so.

00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:14.549
Yes.

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:15.549
Right.

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:16.549
Yeah.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:17.549
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, when people found out
I was gonna talk to you today, everyone wanted

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:18.549
me to ask you about Julia.

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:19.549
So, do you care to talk about that?

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:20.549
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: No.

00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:24.960
I mean, actually, I just did a tribute to
her yesterday for KQED.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.169
And I had another one at the IACP here.

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:29.210
I speak with the tape.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.399
And then, I'm doing one with the WNET in New
York, WGBH in Boston, W--.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:38.470
There are gonna be her hundredth birthday,
on the twelve of August.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:43.489
So, people are doing a tribute to her.

00:20:43.489 --> 00:20:49.639
I met Julia in 1961, or '60.

00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:51.389
1960.

00:20:51.389 --> 00:20:52.940
Food world was really, really small.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.269
And I say, "Well,--."

00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:59.720
Craig Claiborne was the food editor of the
New York Time, which many people have forgotten

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.309
as one of the most important figure in food
in the last half a century.

00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:06.519
And James Beard.

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:13.850
And Julia, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, were
very, the trinity of cooking in this country.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:19.419
When I work at Le Pavillon there in 1959-60,
Craig came to Le Pavillon to do an article

00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:21.529
on Le Pavillon and Pierre.

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:23.140
And I became friend with him.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.400
He introduced me to Helen McCullough.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.609
Helen McCullough was the food editor of McCall
House Beautiful.

00:21:29.609 --> 00:21:31.289
And she was never married.

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:34.559
She was an old lady and she took me under
her wing.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.759
I mean, she was kind of my surrogate mother.

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:38.259
"Don't wear those stupid socks.

00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:39.279
Don't wear this."

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:40.279
You know?

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.279
That type of thing.

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:46.260
And, but she spoke with James Beard on the
telephone, like two hours every day.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.850
So, through her, I knew James Beard a few
weeks later.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.470
And in the Spring of 1960, Helen told me,
"Here.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.820
I have a manuscript.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.200
I want you to look at that manuscript I received
there."

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.590
I said, "Yes, it's pretty good.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.590
Very nice.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.590
Explain."

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.419
So, she said, "Well, the woman is from California.

00:22:02.419 --> 00:22:04.259
She's coming to New York next week.

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:05.259
Let's cook for her."

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:07.499
She was a big woman with a terrible voice--

00:22:07.499 --> 00:22:08.499
[laughter]

00:22:08.499 --> 00:22:09.600
but for a cook, that was Julia.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.659
So, first time I met her, I spoke French with
her.

00:22:14.659 --> 00:22:18.860
Actually, my French was better than my English.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.539
And that was 1960.

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:25.019
So, at that point, no one knew her because
television did not exist.

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:27.679
She didn't do any television.

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:31.610
And she had never written a book, of course.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.080
And she never wrote for a magazine, newspaper,
whatever.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.249
So, she wasn't known.

00:22:36.249 --> 00:22:37.369
She just came from France.

00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:40.509
She had been at Le Courdon Bleu for a number
of years.

00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:41.799
So, that's how I met her.

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:43.779
So, we stay friend.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.359
And then, she lived in Cambridge.

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:49.809
So, I teach at BU, as I said, for 31 years
now.

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:55.570
So, each time I go to BU, I call her for breakfast,
lunch, or dinner and then we started doing

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.759
classes for the student at BU just for fun.

00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:58.759
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Mm-hmm.

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:01.779
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: And I said, "Well, let's
do a special for PBS on that."

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:05.490
So, we did "Cooking in Concert," a two-hour
special for PBS.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.760
We did at BU.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.419
In a couple of years, we did another one.

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:13.989
And we were giving a lot of class together
and finally, we did a series together.

00:23:13.989 --> 00:23:18.690
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, what are some of the things
that you're most proud of looking back on

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.690
your career?

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.479
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Well, it's to make people
happy.

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:24.190
That's what cooking is all about.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.970
It's rewarding.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:33.499
In our time of political correctness, we cannot
talk about gender, about size, about color,

00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:40.029
about religion, about anything, so we talk
about food--the only safe thing we can talk

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:41.029
about.

00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:42.509
So, that's what happened.

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:44.700
And spending time around the table.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:51.620
And yesterday, I was on the Michael Krasny
Forum show, which is a very good show.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.720
It's amazing the amount of people who call
you and say, "You kind of changed my life

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.890
by [inaudible] my father."

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:58.890
And all that, too.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.990
And I know I had that book, "La Technique,"
like I said.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.190
And people used to say, "Can you sign that
book for me?

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.190
It's great."

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.350
A number of years went by and they say, "You
know, my mother is crazy about you.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.720
Could you sign that book for her?"

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.480
And then now, people say, "You know, my grandmother
really likes you a lot."

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480
[laughter]

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480
Whoa.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.190
That book has been there.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:23.159
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, what do you think about
the state of cuisine in America and where

00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:25.019
do you think it's gonna be headed towards?

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:31.039
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Well, this is basically an
impossible question because as I said, my

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:36.669
book here is probably a very American book
now because the ethnicity in it and the change

00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:37.669
and all that.

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:45.140
I mean, if you go to France, people still
each French 98, 99 percent of the time.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.639
There is some Chinese or Italian restaurant,
but basically, the cuisine is this way.

00:24:50.639 --> 00:24:53.090
It's part of your tradition.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.879
It's kind of visceral and that's how you eat.

00:24:54.879 --> 00:24:55.879
And that the way it is in Italy.

00:24:55.879 --> 00:25:00.860
And that the way it is in Spain or in Portugal
and Germany, for that matter, too.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.549
But not America.

00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:07.729
People eat Turkish one night and they go to
Chinese one day, to especially in urban center

00:25:07.729 --> 00:25:09.769
like this, the center of the world.

00:25:09.769 --> 00:25:14.929
And this is the reason why someone like me
could come from another country and make it

00:25:14.929 --> 00:25:19.840
to a certain extent, which would be difficult
for--certainly much harder--for Chinese chef

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.519
or Greek chef, to make it in France or in
another country in Europe.

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:27.539
It's America that that the way it is.

00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:35.740
And when I came here, I remember live in New
York in Manhattan on 50th and 1st Avenue going

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:41.349
to D'Agostino Brothers, typically fancy market,
and asking, "Where are the mushrooms?"

00:25:41.349 --> 00:25:42.710
They say, "Aisle five."

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.580
That was canned mushroom.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:49.360
You had to go to a specialty store just to
get regular, white button mushroom.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.179
There was only one salad in supermarket.

00:25:51.179 --> 00:25:53.090
That's what I heard, but nothing else.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.029
There was no leek, no shallot, no Oriental
vegetable, none of the vegetables.

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:58.479
It's amazing.

00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:02.440
So certainly, the supermarket have never been
as beautiful as they are now.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.619
It's just amazing.

00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:06.669
And people already saying "no one cook anymore."

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:07.750
Well, no one cook.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.760
I mean, what do they do with the stuff at
the supermarket?

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760
[laughter]

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.359
At the end of the week, someone would dump
it.

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:15.169
Someone must be buying it.

00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:16.629
So, yes.

00:26:16.629 --> 00:26:18.809
It has explode.

00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:24.460
And someone on television the other day was
saying there is 407 television, I mean, cooking

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.740
television show on television, from The Cooking
Channel, to the Food Channel Network, from

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.690
Travel, from Oxygen, from PBS, too.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.519
That at the time when I was doing even the
show with Julia, before it was pre-Food Channel

00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:43.110
Networks, so, except for PBS, there wasn't
that many thing going on in cooking.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.889
I'm still on PBS.

00:26:45.889 --> 00:26:51.599
And for me, PBS is the best because I don't
have to look out to the sponsor, I do basically

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:53.119
what I want to.

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:54.119
It's--.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:57.619
And I'm faithful when I'm good somewhere.

00:26:57.619 --> 00:26:58.619
I stay.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:00.239
So, that's what I did.

00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:01.629
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Great.

00:27:01.629 --> 00:27:06.799
So, I'm gonna open up questions to our audience
'cause we have a very inquisitive audience,

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:07.799
I'm sure.

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:09.559
And I'm sure they wanna ask you lots of questions.

00:27:09.559 --> 00:27:10.559
So.

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.989
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: All right.

00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:14.359
Yes, sir?

00:27:14.359 --> 00:27:20.879
&gt;&gt;male #2: I remember watching your shows
that you did with your daughter.

00:27:20.879 --> 00:27:23.249
And I couldn't help feeling that there was
some frustration on your part with her cooking

00:27:23.249 --> 00:27:24.249
ability.

00:27:24.249 --> 00:27:25.249
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: I'm sorry.

00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:26.249
You know, my--.

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:27.249
I'm getting old now.

00:27:27.249 --> 00:27:28.249
My hear is--.

00:27:28.249 --> 00:27:29.249
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, he was wondering, he saw
you cooking with your daughter one time.

00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:30.249
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Oh, yeah.

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:32.299
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: And noticed some frustration
on your face.

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:33.299
[laughter]

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:37.029
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Do you have kid?

00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:38.029
[laughter]

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:39.029
I mean, yeah of course.

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:40.029
I cook with her--.

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:41.029
[laughter]

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:43.989
I cooked with her last week in that series
here.

00:27:43.989 --> 00:27:49.029
I have Claudine cook with me a couple of show
and my granddaughter, Shorey, cook with me,

00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:50.029
too.

00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:51.700
It was really fun.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.840
When Claudine was small--.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.580
I mean, I never got baby food, you know?

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.789
Whatever we cooked, I put it in the blender
and gave it to her.

00:27:59.789 --> 00:28:04.520
I mean, I stuffed the seasoning, too, so that
she get used to the taste of pasta with garlic

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.590
or whatever.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.590
It's kind of crazy.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:15.749
People, they are going to have pizza for the
kids or buy food and then, once a month everyone

00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:19.410
eat together or they have friend coming for
dinner.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.690
The do a roasted veal with artichokes and
they send pizza for the kids or whatever.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.330
And then, the kid get to be ten years old
[clears throat] after his first communion

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.379
or his bar mitzvah or whatever, almost at
once say, "Now, you eat that."

00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:33.520
Kid say, "I won't eat that stuff.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.520
What is this?

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.399
I never eat that in my life."

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:38.529
You cannot treat the kid this way.

00:28:38.529 --> 00:28:40.419
It has to eat exactly what you're eating.

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:45.279
When Claudine was not even a year old, in
the kitchen, she was I gave her a spoon and

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:46.279
she stir.

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:47.279
I say, "Stir it."

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.279
So, she stir the pot.

00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:49.749
So, she stir when she made it.

00:28:49.749 --> 00:28:52.529
And she was going to taste it, of course.

00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:56.869
And then, we always sit down for dinner.

00:28:56.869 --> 00:29:00.690
And it's not like we eat a la carte and everyone
is like, "I want this."

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.690
No.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.979
Claudine comes, three years old, she says,
"Mom, what's for dinner?"

00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:06.509
My wife say, "Food."

00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:07.509
[laughter]

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:10.169
And she still says that now she's 43.

00:29:10.169 --> 00:29:12.299
So, and with her daughter.

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:13.299
So, yes.

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:14.299
It's very important.

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:19.480
I mean, the kitchen is about the best place
that a child can be in.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.159
After school, come there to do your homework.

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:27.450
The clinking of the noise of the kitchen,
the voice of your mother, the voice of your

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.659
father, those smells, those tastes, that will
stay with you the rest of your life.

00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:34.499
There's something very, very secure in there.

00:29:34.499 --> 00:29:40.720
You look at those kid in Afghanistan, 20,
22 years old in time of danger.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.320
What do you think they think of?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.869
They think of their mother apple pie or the
clam chowder or whatever it may be because

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:49.690
those tastes are more than the food itself.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.609
There is a security to this there with others.

00:29:52.609 --> 00:29:55.570
I think was a Chinese philosopher who say
"What is patriotism?

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.899
It's only the taste of the dishes you had
as a child."

00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:02.450
And there's a great deal of truth in this.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.070
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Great.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.149
Thank you.

00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:06.149
Anyone else?

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:07.149
[pause]

00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:08.149
All right.

00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:09.440
Come on.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.249
We have a food legend here.

00:30:11.249 --> 00:30:12.249
[laughter]

00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:16.909
&gt;&gt;female #3: Building on top of that question.

00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:19.252
What's your first memory in the kitchen as
a child?

00:30:19.252 --> 00:30:20.809
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: My first memory in the kitchen
as a child, I think I discuss it.

00:30:20.809 --> 00:30:25.049
I have a book called "The Apprentice," which
I did before that guy did that show called

00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:26.509
"The Apprentice."

00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:27.509
[laughter]

00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:29.960
And it's a cook's memoir, you know?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.029
And I left home when I was 13 to go into formal
apprenticeship.

00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:38.429
But when I left home, home was a restaurant
where my mother was a chef.

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:43.690
So, from age, I don't know, five, six, I was
in the kitchen and my aunt had restaurant.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.239
What I talk about there [clears throat] an
instance which happened to me during the war

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:49.239
in France.

00:30:49.239 --> 00:30:50.559
I was, I think, five years old or so.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:53.229
And I was sent to a farm for the summer.

00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:55.149
[clears throat] Excuse me.

00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:56.469
We really didn't have much to eat.

00:30:56.469 --> 00:31:00.169
But there, we knew during the vacation we
going to a farm where there is cow.

00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:03.440
And then, there is butter and milk and stuff
like this.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:10.179
And I remember my mother taking me there and
leaving me there with the farmer.

00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:19.110
And I went, the farmer took me to the barn
where the woman was milking the cow there.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.230
And I was sad.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.179
I mean, my mother left.

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:23.442
I was a little kid.

00:31:23.442 --> 00:31:29.970
So, she gave that glass of milk there--transforming
and still warm from the, right out of the

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:30.970
teats.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:35.659
And that probably one of the first remember
that I--.

00:31:35.659 --> 00:31:38.210
Because especially at that time, that wasn't
that common.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.739
We really didn't have milk for lunch or something
to drink.

00:31:41.739 --> 00:31:44.409
But that was a powerful memory.

00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:46.269
An old one, too.

00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:47.919
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yes.

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:51.419
&gt;&gt;female #4: What would you eat for your last
meal?

00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:53.409
I know there would be bread or wine, but what
else would you put--?

00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:54.409
[laughter]

00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:55.409
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Bread and butter.

00:31:55.409 --> 00:31:56.409
Well, we did, yeah.

00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:57.409
See, all of those--.

00:31:57.409 --> 00:32:00.749
I got a book published a couple of years ago,
"My Last Meal."

00:32:00.749 --> 00:32:04.139
There's like 50 chef and I'm part of them.

00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:12.369
If it has to be my last meal, it would have
to be very, very, very, very, very long to

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:13.369
stop me.

00:32:13.369 --> 00:32:14.369
[laughter]

00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:16.169
So, maybe a year or so.

00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:17.169
[laughter]

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:24.469
And through that, from a ham sandwich to ham
and egg to hot duck to caviar to Dom Perignon

00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:27.659
to roasted squab to--everything is in there.

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:28.670
I think that I like to eat.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:29.670
[laughter]

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.670
Right.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.670
[pause]

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.670
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Anyone else?

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.670
Yes.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.670
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yes, ma'am.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.309
&gt;&gt;female #5: With all the new types of tools
that you can use in the kitchen, is there

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:49.320
certain things that I guess have come out
since when you started cooking till now that

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.480
you really think are great to have in the
kitchen that you recommend?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.480
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: You think about equipment?

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yeah.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480
Like, maybe your favorite hand tool or Peltex.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yeah.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.809
Well, you know you can't beat the rubber spatula.

00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:00.809
[laughter]

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:03.611
I mean, I was an apprentice pre-rubber spatula.

00:33:03.611 --> 00:33:07.140
Rubber spatula and plastic wrap, right.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.140
Very good.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.019
We didn't have it.

00:33:10.019 --> 00:33:11.330
A good vegetable peeler.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.330
You need a good knife.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:16.100
And a good knife is a sharp one, regardless
of the brand.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.719
You have to be able to have an overripe tomato,
run it on top of it and it cut right through

00:33:20.719 --> 00:33:23.080
it and it's probably a good knife.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.480
A good board, you know?

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.480
Solid.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480
A good pot a good knife.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.700
I mean, very basic equipment.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.149
Two or three piece and that's all you need,
frankly.

00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:33.740
We have a pot in France, we call a pot like
that.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.210
And it's called a "l'effet tu."

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.370
L'effet tu meaning do all.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.549
That the name, l'effet tu.

00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:46.139
And when I was a kid, I don't remember my
mother ever cooking anything else but l'effet

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:47.139
tu there.

00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:49.850
It's like a wok for the Chinese basically.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.929
So, yeah.

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.950
You can use and reuse, too.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:59.049
I mean, it's great to have type of kitchen
that have equipment and you need three knife.

00:33:59.049 --> 00:34:00.679
I mean, you need a large knife to chop.

00:34:00.679 --> 00:34:03.710
And you need a utility knife and a small one.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:08.399
That being said, I probably have 300 maybe
at home or more.

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:09.399
[laughter]

00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:10.399
So, no.

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:12.010
Good equipment is important.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.260
And good ingredient is the primary thing.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:20.300
If you have good ingredient, good equipment,
the less you screw it up, the better it is.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:26.440
And that what food is all about--going to
the market, getting a few things.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:33.400
I mean, now we are very big with organic things
and with farmer and all that.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.890
But, of course, in this country it's all really
the same.

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.520
You go one way, people get berserk.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.760
I mean, I have been to restaurant.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.580
They come and they bring you a carrot that
say, that carrot's name is Evan.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.370
It was born with 700--.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.370
[laughter]

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:47.620
Give me a break.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.620
Give me the carrot.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.220
I mean, it can go too far the other way, too.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.740
But it's certainly good.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.650
I mean, my mother, my father, were both organic
farmer.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.660
Of course, the word "organic" did not exist.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.890
But the chemical fertilizer did not exist,
either.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:09.890
And fungicide, insecticide, pesticide did
not exist either for everyone with an organic

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:10.890
farmer.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:16.320
You want, get some cow or horse manure or
chicken manure and place and you do the gardens.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.550
So, it's not that we don't know how to do
it going back to this.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.520
So, and that what's going on now.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.430
So, going back to your question.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.880
The food has been exploding here.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.450
A revolution in the last 30 years.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:32.340
It should be totally amazing.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.540
And I know I've been part of it.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.810
And it seem to be going on and on, so that's
great.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:39.990
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, let me just ask you a
real quick question.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.530
What do you think of sous vide?

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.170
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Sous vide is good.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.750
With sous vide, that's what I use at Howard
Johnson in 1960.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.180
It was called cryovacs at that time.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.460
It was sous vide.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.980
We used to cook the thing this way at low
temperature and so forth.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.260
But if you're talking about--.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.590
Yeah, there is a great deal of things you
can use with that.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.590
Terrific.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:04.890
And but you may be talking about molecular
cuisine or stuff like that, too, more advanced

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.400
like Ferran Adria.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.180
I was with Ferran Adria on actually three
weeks ago.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.720
I went at the Food and Wine Festival in Cancun.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.420
It was the first time they did it.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.320
And Ferran came--some other Spanish chef,
too.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.160
And it is an amazing thing.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.140
I mean, what they do.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.430
It can be tiring, too.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:29.860
I mean, basically it seems especially done
by someone else with not as talented as those

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.160
chef are.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.600
And too badly it end up being, the whole idea
is to stump you with "Wow.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600
What is that?"

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.400
And you bite and it's liquid inside.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400
"Whoa."

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.850
But after a while, it get tiring.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:47.210
But, or then they give you an ice cream cone.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.160
And you bite it and it's mashed turnips or
whatever.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.190
So, your brain is already working throughout
that taste.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.850
It cuts you in half.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.410
And this is--.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:01.920
I had that in China 25 years ago, eating with
the monk, which were eating--.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.920
I had duck.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.920
I had chicken.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.750
I had all of this and it was all soybeans,
done, set in type of cuisine.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.990
And that was amazing, that type of cuisine.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:20.310
But you are actually in town here, Jean Paul
Gaultier, which is a French designer, very

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.770
extreme doing stuff like, I don't know, Madonna
or Lady Gaga or whatever.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.500
I mean, the weirdest stuff.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:33.520
So, you see the model working down the walkway
wearing those enormous, you say, "Oh my God.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.300
Who's going to wear that stuff?"

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.360
And yes, about five or ten years later, it
trickles down to the pret-a-porter, to a certain

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.360
extent.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.090
So, in a sense, the cuisine of Ferran Adria,
that type of extreme, now you get that.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.160
Then, it down trickle down eventually.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.020
Do just like nouvelle cuisine did.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:57.800
Before I came to, when I was in France, work
at the Plaza Athenee in Paris, Maxim, Fouquet,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.020
great restaurant.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.950
We would never, never have served something
on a plate.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:06.610
Even more so, my mother with that small restaurant,
my aunt, they all have full restaurant, for

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:07.610
worker.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.020
I mean, very inexpensive type of restaurant.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.000
Nothing was ever, ever, ever on a plate.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.710
You just bring, if you have a little piece
of fish, you bring it on a platter, too.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:22.230
Even at home, my mother, she would do a roast
whatever, put it in the center of the table.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.500
Then, we had bowl salad.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.690
But never, never set on a plate.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.020
Nouvelle cuisine came in the '70s, over-sized
plates.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.620
Chefs started arranging stuff, too.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.360
And now, you don't have a chef who would serve
anything else, but serving something on a

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.410
plate.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:41.480
So, that's a legacy of nouvelle cuisine as
well as cooking vegetable different way--other

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.970
type of things, of course.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.940
So, it trickled down eventually.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Great answer.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:49.560
Yes.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:58.715
&gt;&gt;male #6: So, what do you think about the
future of French cuisine and also French culinary

00:38:58.715 --> 00:38:59.715
instruction?

00:38:59.715 --> 00:39:00.715
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Ah-hah.

00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:01.715
&gt;&gt;male #6: [inaudible]

00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:02.715
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yeah, that's a good point.

00:39:02.715 --> 00:39:03.715
It's quite different.

00:39:03.715 --> 00:39:04.715
Yet, however, you go to France, people are
really not too aware of this.

00:39:04.715 --> 00:39:06.870
You still have a lot of very good restaurant.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:13.500
Unfortunately for most American, they look
at French cooking in the context of star restaurant.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:19.850
You do have to two star and one, three star
here in the California, which is amazing.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.440
And in New York, we have more.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.940
I mean, there is only 21, I think, 21 three-star
restaurant in France.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:32.950
There's about 80 or so two-star and maybe
400 one-star, with 500, 600 in the whole star

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:33.950
system.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:38.440
But there is 146 stars in restaurants in France,
I believe.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:44.830
But Americans, they are from--especially years
ago--would go to France and eat like in three

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.580
four-, three-star restaurant in a week.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.620
Of course, it's an overload of truffle and
reduction of cream and stuff like this.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.820
That's what that type of restaurant is.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.570
But when I was taking group with BU, Boston
University, we go maybe to one one-star, sometime

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.240
one two-star, but other than that, I take
them to brasserie, bistro, too.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.440
And they say, "Wow.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.610
This is French cooking?"

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:10.210
I say, "This was more Italian like a roast
with the juice, or a puree of potato or whatever."

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.630
Which is basically what people eat.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.910
I mean, I'll go on the road when I'm in France
and I go to like, La Ferme in Auberge, the

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:17.910
farm in.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.900
There is a little book for that.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.800
And more than 60 percent of what you eat there
has to be produced by that farm.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.360
Sometimes, it's 80, 90 percent.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.120
I've been to some farm.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:36.020
I remember one time I was in the Gerar area,
the Northeast part of France near Alsace,

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.230
with my wife and another couple.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.190
And I saw a sign Ferme Auberge, a piece of
wood on the road.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.190
We follow that small road.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.290
Then, at the corner of the road, I saw a house
there.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.640
It was, I said, "It's probably in there."

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.410
So, I saw some chicken coming out, a pig in
the courtyard.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.850
I go in and there was a little girl doing
her homework at the table.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.830
I say, "Is that the farm Auberge?"

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:57.830
She said, "Yes."

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:58.830
I say, "You think we can eat?"

00:40:58.830 --> 00:40:59.990
She said, "Just call my mom."

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:04.250
So, she called her mom who came with her apron
and then her father came.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.650
There was no one.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:06.650
And her father say, "OK.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:07.790
I'm gonna go shave."

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:08.960
I say, "You don't have to shave."

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.660
He say, "I'll go pick up wild mushroom."

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.740
I said, "Better idea."

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.740
[laughter]

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.160
And so, he went to pick up mushroom.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.910
She cooked whatever they cooked that day,
probably cost her six or eight dollars per

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:18.910
person.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.410
And this is the type of food that I like to
eat more.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:27.920
Granted occasionally, I'll eat at PER SE and
all those great restaurant, but this is naturally

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.210
what food memory are made of.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.210
It's not visceral enough.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.210
[pause]

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.210
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Anyone else?

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.210
[pause]

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.210
Yes.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.210
&gt;&gt;female #7: So, I love to cook, but there's
one thing I still hate doing.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.210
I've done much more challenging things, but
I can't stand chopping cilantro.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.210
It sticks to my hands.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:50.760
And I was just wondering if you have any weird
little things like that, that you just hate

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.760
doing.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.830
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: To clean up your hand?

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.700
&gt;&gt;female #7: No, no.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.890
Just like, chopping onions or chopping cilantro
or whatever.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.946
I'm sure you do much more challenging things,
but--.

00:41:59.946 --> 00:42:00.946
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yeah.

00:42:00.946 --> 00:42:01.946
Well, you have to look at that tape there.

00:42:01.946 --> 00:42:03.320
I mean, all of the technique is in there.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:09.500
And all of those technique from, yeah, from
cilantro whatever.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.480
I mean, I'm always washing my hand, washing
the sheer part of my board.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.090
It's almost a conditioned reflex for me.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.330
But when I finish that, my wife come behind
and rewash it anyway.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:22.330
[laughter]

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:27.470
&gt;&gt;male #8: So, is there anything that you
don't like to cook?

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.820
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Not really.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:37.620
I'm not crazy about coconut or marshmallow,
but otherwise I think I eat any kind of cuisine

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.690
from other areas.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.120
Some stuff I like better than others, but
not really.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120
[pause]

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.120
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Yes.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.120
&gt;&gt;female #9: The same thing.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:54.220
Do you have any pet peeves when you dine out
in restaurants?

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.884
Do you have anything that really gets to you?

00:42:56.884 --> 00:42:57.884
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Dining out around here?

00:42:57.884 --> 00:42:58.884
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Or anywhere.

00:42:58.884 --> 00:42:59.884
&gt;&gt;female #9: Anywhere.

00:42:59.884 --> 00:43:00.884
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Anywhere?

00:43:00.884 --> 00:43:01.884
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Any place you went to dine
out.

00:43:01.884 --> 00:43:02.884
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Yeah, it's always great.

00:43:02.884 --> 00:43:03.884
I mean, as I said, where they know you the
best.

00:43:03.884 --> 00:43:07.870
I mean, I know some small little restaurant
where I am.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:13.450
And for me, very often, instead of working,
I talk to a young chef and instead of doing

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:19.000
something extraordinary that no one has seen,
I'm often being the devil's advocate, like

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
at BU.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.330
They say, "Well, what are we going to do today?"

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:25.800
I say, "Well, today, let's do a lobster roll
and a BLT and a hot dog."

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.250
"What are we missing?

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.830
You crazy or what?"

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:29.830
No.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.800
The idea there is yes, you can always do a
better hot dog.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.421
You can always find a better hot dog with
a better mustard, with a better bread, with

00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:42.570
a better way of grating it, with a better
way, so that, or like a lobster roll, like

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:47.900
my friend Jean-Claude, with my oldest friend
that I stay working with me for de Gaulle.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:53.430
And he come to Connecticut and he said, "Let's
go have a lobster roll at The Shack on the

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.430
Boston north border."

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.710
The Shack is there in summer, closed in winter.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:00.600
Well, the guy buy the Philadelphia roll that
we used to have at Howard Johnson, a flat

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.340
roll sticking against one another.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.480
He brown them nicely--butter on each side.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.910
He has fresh lobster cooked.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.420
Cracked pepper, salt on top, butter.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.000
Put that, that's it.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.840
Well, my friend, the professional chef, will
remember.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.140
He say, "Let's go have a lobster roll there."

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.140
And you do that.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.200
Let's go have a roast chicken.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.030
And those guys do hot dog or even hamburger
incredible.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:22.940
That's what you remember.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:28.850
So, for a young chef, often I say, "Work in
depth rather than wanting to create and you

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:33.600
end up with a slice of Roquefort on top of
a bowl of raspberry ice cream."

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600
Wow.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600
[laughter]

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.110
No one has ever thought of it before.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.240
Probably reason why no one has thought of
it before.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240
[laughter]

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:53.230
So, and often unfortunately, it's too much,
the question of if you want of the novelty,

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.880
the--.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.540
It's not necessarily good.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.530
I'm very comfortable with thousand and thousand
of dishes that I've had through my life.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.250
I don't need to create stuff.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.770
And often, what's new for you is very different.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:13.470
Tomorrow, you fly into Dakar and you are in
West Africa and you going to have a ceebu

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:14.470
jen.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.470
You say, "Wow.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:16.470
I never had ceebu jen."

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.740
Well, it's the broken rice that they cook
there with the fish and some hot sauce and

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.280
you hold that in your hand.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.680
Well, yes.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.350
So, it can do the rage for two weeks.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:29.080
I mean, from one chef to the other, they get
berserk because it's new.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080
Fine.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080
There, what they eat every day.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.880
This is their national dish, you know?

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.830
If you go around the world like that, that's
basically the way it works.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:44.820
&gt;&gt;male #10: So, is there any common mistakes
that chefs will make that you'll notice or

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.820
hear?

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:46.820
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Oh, yes.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.820
Yeah.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.820
There is mistake often.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.700
And I say working too much with the, doing
too much with the ingredient.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.700
That's normal.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.320
I probably did that when I was in my 20s,
30s.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.430
Also, you have a plate and add more and they
put a bit of cilantro and they put a bit of

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.510
tarragon, which conflicts with it.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:06.410
And you have that type of carrot and you have
olive oil and you have a bit of sesame oil

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.410
and stuff.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.410
And geez.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.410
You know.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.160
So, you sit down.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.530
And that has happened to be because being
a chef, I go to some food writer conference,

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.210
also because I write about food.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:23.340
And so, because I'm a chef, they ask me where
those thing.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:29.340
And everything is sliced beautiful, five vegetable
and so they ask people, "What is that?

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.340
Is it good?"

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.340
So, I taste it.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.340
"Yeah, it's very good.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.340
What is it?"

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.340
"No idea."

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.550
People don't have any idea.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.970
It's either a breast of chicken or a breast
of turkey.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:39.020
It's white.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.480
It's standard.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.940
It's clean.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.940
And that's what I would tell a chef.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.240
I say, "I'll put something on your eyes.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240
Sit down.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240
I'll give you a plate.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.570
If you tell me, 'That's chicken, there is
mushroom in it and maybe some wine.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:51.660
I think there's a bit of white wine.'

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.470
Then, you're probably far enough in the dish.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.330
The dish is pretty linear and it's pretty
straight-forward and you know what you're

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.450
eating."

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:02.460
And that basically what you want, to recognize
the food.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:07.970
And as you're older like me, after adding
to the plate, you start taking away, taking

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:12.410
away, taking away so that you're left with
one tomato at the right temperature with the

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.410
vestibule, too.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.410
That's it.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.410
And I throw shallot on top, whatever.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.410
That's how it works, usually.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.410
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: Great.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.410
Anyone else?

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.410
OK.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.410
Last question 'cause I'm--.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:21.410
&gt;&gt;male #11: Do you think you're at your tier
in the process of learning about how to cook?

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:30.220
Is there anything that stands out to you as
something that you would've changed in which

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.860
you'd avoid a lot of hassle?

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.290
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Anything that stand out for
me for what?

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:43.210
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: So, during your career, is
there anything that you could change along

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.330
your career?

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.400
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Could change?

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.400
I don't know.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.020
It's a good question.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.050
The point is that I never had a plan.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:56.560
I'm gonna do this and then do this and then,
no.

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.860
Things take over.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:04.041
I worked in Paris and I probably work over
a hundred restaurant in Paris because I work

00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:06.350
like, seven years at the Plaza Athenee, too.

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.270
But my day off, I used to work in a large
organization in Paris called La Associate

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.320
de Cuisine in Paris, the Society of the Chef
of Paris.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.020
And which we should really have in town like
here or New York, where you can go in the

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.020
morning.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.020
You get a job for the day.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.730
People call to say, "I need associate today."

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.430
Or, "I need this, that, too."

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:27.010
Great, great training for me because as you
get there, no matter you work in a restaurant,

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.700
it takes you two day to get used to.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.750
There, it doesn't test.

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.400
After 15, 20 minutes, you have to be cooking.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.450
You're there for the day.

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:36.250
The chefs say, "Go to that department or that
department."

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.250
You go there.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.250
What's on the menu today?

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:39.250
You look.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.250
You say, "OK."

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.250
Start gathering your ingredient.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.250
You start working.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.790
Well, that's very, very good training.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:48.460
And I would advise young chefs to do that,
but basically, you work and you meet friend

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.090
and then you have enough work to do something
else.

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.580
I went at the Plaza Athenee in Paris, at that
time the pastry chef was an old man, about

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.340
my age now.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.780
And he told me, "I work in Chicago when I
was a young man.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.600
You should go to America and so forth and
that."

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.440
And he said, "Well, I have friend and they
can call you to sponsor you if you want."

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.240
So, I had a sponsor in New York.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.400
Yeah, in New York, a French restaurant from
Alsace.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.720
He sponsors me.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:23.900
And at that time, the quota and the rule to
come to another country, you come to America

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.430
have changed a great deal now.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:29.190
But at that time, each country had their own
quota.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.150
And in France, people really never immigrated
that much.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:37.010
So, two months I had a green card and a visa
that I could come.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.010
In two month.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:44.430
But in Italy next door, I think it's about
close to a third of the population immigrated

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.940
from Italy in the 10, 20s, and 30s.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.560
So, cousin coming, they had to wait like five
years, six years.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.110
And now, they changed those thing into something
for all Europe now.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.150
So, it was very good for me to come.

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:59.240
I came on a student boat, actually.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.170
Student who were coming back from Europe.

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:06.720
And I saw two aurora borealis and I finish
in Quebec.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.220
Quebec, I took the train to go to Montreal.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.560
And Montreal, the train to New York.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.630
And I'm there in Grand Central with my suitcase.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.090
That was it.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:19.570
No, those were very good experience.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:25.920
Even when I left from Lyon, I was 17 years
old and I went to Paris.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.250
I had work already in Lyon.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.250
Did my apprenticeship.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.840
I started at 13.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.130
I told my mother, "No, I have a job in Paris.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.130
I have a friend."

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.580
I didn't have a job in Paris.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.580
I didn't have--.

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:37.580
I never been to Paris.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.150
I arrived there with my suitcase, too, there.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.040
So, those are good experience to form someone.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.040
Yeah.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.240
&gt;&gt;Jeff Freburg: All right.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.240
Well, thank you very much.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.240
It was a real pleasure.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.240
&gt;&gt;Jacques Pepin: Thank you.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:50.241
[applause]
