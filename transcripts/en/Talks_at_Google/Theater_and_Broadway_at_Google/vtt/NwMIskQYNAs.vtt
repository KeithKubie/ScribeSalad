00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:42.790
TREKKIE MONSTER: Oh, yes.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.550
ALAN SEALES: And what is
your primary investment?

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.360
TREKKIE MONSTER: Porn.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.568
ALAN SEALES: Good, thank you.

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:47.550
All right, thank you.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.425
All right, everybody.

00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:49.508
Please excuse the puppets.

00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:50.820
They have to be someone else.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.540
And now, human-skin people, feel
free to come up and join me.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.370
Human skin.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.370
Can you guys go down the
line and just introduce

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.990
yourself and what
characters you play?

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.948
DARREN BLUESTONE: Sure.

00:13:04.948 --> 00:13:07.539
I'm Darren Bluestone, and
I play Princeton and Rod.

00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:09.080
DANIELLE THOMAS:
I'm Danielle Thomas,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.605
and I play Gary Coleman.

00:13:10.605 --> 00:13:13.060
Yes, that Gary Coleman.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.400
NICHOLAS KOHN: Nicholas
Kohn, and I play Brian.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.066
SALA IWAMATSU: My
name is Sala Iwamatsu,

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:18.380
and I play Christmas Eve.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.671
VERONICA KUEHN: Veronica Kuehn.

00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:22.510
I play Kate Mosnter
and Lucy the Slut.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.890
JASON JACOBY: I'm Jason Jacoby.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.055
I play Nicky, Trekkie Monster,
and a couple other characters

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:29.206
that are not here today.

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:31.200
JENNIFER BARNHART:
I'm Jennifer Barnhart.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.190
I'm sort of the
puppet utility girl.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.720
I right hand pretty
much everybody.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.200
But I also play a school
teacher, Kate Monster's boss,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.255
and her name is
Mrs. Thistletwat.

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.530
Thank you.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.410
JED RESNICK: I'm Jed Resnick
and I am the ensemble,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.620
and I understudy all
the boys in the show.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.000
And I have two mics.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.930
ALAN SEALES: So congratulations
on reaching 10 years.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.350
The show hit 10 years
back in July, correct?

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.110
Yes.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.730
So what's the run on the
shos-- six years on Broadway

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.360
and now four years off Broadway.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.420
What's the difference between--
what makes on versus off?

00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:11.840
DANIELLE THOMAS: Well,
there's absolutely

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.240
no difference in the show.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.810
It's--

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.610
SALA IWAMATSU: Same set.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.693
DANIELLE THOMAS: Same set.

00:14:15.693 --> 00:14:18.710
Jenn Barnhart, original Broadway
cast member, is here again.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.420
And the three of us closed
it on Broadway, reopened it

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.340
off Broadway, and
we're still here.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.414
So it's the same
cast, same puppets.

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:26.830
NICHOLAS KOHN: The
real difference

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.630
is this the seat numbers.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.010
Difference between Broadway
and off Broadway, 500 seats

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.400
and above is Broadway.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.960
499 and below is off Broadway.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.421
SALA IWAMATSU: We have 498.

00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:36.295
NICHOLAS KOHN: We do.

00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:39.207
And every night, we think
about plugging two more seats

00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:40.329
from there.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:42.370
But yeah, that's pretty
much the main difference.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.330
ALAN SEALES: So in the
very beginning, back

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.730
in the initial
days, it was going

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.260
through-- the show goes through
workshops and picks up steam.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.105
Like, what-- I guess Jenn is
the only original cast member.

00:14:54.105 --> 00:14:56.382
Do you remember that
far back, 10 years ago,

00:14:56.382 --> 00:14:57.840
like when the show
picked up steam?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.423
And when did you
really feel like this

00:14:59.423 --> 00:15:00.835
was going to be something?

00:15:00.835 --> 00:15:02.960
JENNIFER BARNHART: When
the reviews first came out.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.418
I mean-- well, I
had, first of all,

00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:06.670
seen the show in a
reading in the basement

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.770
at the York Theater, even two
years before I was in the show,

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.460
and thought, this is brilliant.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.630
I think one of the things
that makes the show so strong

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.100
is that it took so
long to develop.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.891
It was about 2 and 1/2
years in development

00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:21.820
before we did the
original off-Broadway run.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.120
But when I was doing it, I
thought, this is hilarious.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.869
This is brilliant.

00:15:24.869 --> 00:15:27.230
I hope people get it.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.390
And audiences loved it.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.240
And New York
theater-going audiences,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.700
specifically, adored it.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.159
And it became the thing to see.

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:36.700
So the tourists didn't know who
we were, but New York theater

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.280
people were going, oh my god,
have you seen "Avenue Q?"

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:38.880
You have to see it.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.505
It's brilliant.

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.600
It's brilliant.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.380
And we got a love
letter from Ben Brantley

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.380
in the "New York Times."

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.160
And that was when
we sort of thought,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.030
hey, I think we
got something here.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.980
And shortly thereafter,
we announced

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.595
we were moving
uptown to Broadway.

00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:51.760
So it was pretty great.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.025
ALAN SEALES: So what changed
between the workshops,

00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:57.120
the initial rehearsals
and opening?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.900
JENNIFER BARNHART: Believe it or
not, not a whole heck of a lot.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.900
Some of the strongest
songs in the show

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.230
were the first written.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.200
"Gay" was written very
early on. "Racist"

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.995
was written very early on.

00:16:07.995 --> 00:16:09.230
You know.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:14.304
Having said that, I mean,
once we got it to that stage,

00:16:14.304 --> 00:16:16.720
the original opening night
gift when we transferred uptown

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.540
to Broadway from the book
writer was a collection

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.010
of all of the scenes and
material and song snippets

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.590
that had been cut from the
show, and that was 126 pages.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.484
So once we got it to that place,
then we were off and running.

00:16:30.484 --> 00:16:32.650
But yeah, now that I say
that, I go, yeah, actually,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.858
we did have a lot of changes.

00:16:33.858 --> 00:16:35.346
It just is a blur.

00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:36.970
Because when you're
in previews, you're

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.760
rehearsing during the day and
then doing the show at night.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.460
And then you go in and
say, OK, that didn't work.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.980
We've got a whole bunch
of pages for you to learn.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.190
So they'd throw
new material at us

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.981
and then we'd do it in
the show that night,

00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:48.450
and then the same process
over and over again, so.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.310
ALAN SEALES: OK, so you human
skin actors-- Nick, Danielle,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.410
Sala-- what was it
like getting used

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.720
to interacting with
the puppets directly?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.920
You look at them on
stage, right-- not

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.037
the actors holding them.

00:17:01.037 --> 00:17:02.620
DANIELLE THOMAS:
Well, the funny thing

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.020
is, now it's actually
the complete opposite.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.970
If you ever look
at a person, you're

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.859
like, that's weird
to look at a person.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.730
You're used to looking
at the puppets.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.200
And Kate is my favorite.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.790
Gary and Kate,
we're really close.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.136
I think she kind of likes me.

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.760
She hasn't had a
black man yet, but I'm

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.960
going to change that, really.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.800
What?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.747
Yeah, I mean at first you're
like, uh-- person, puppet?

00:17:26.747 --> 00:17:28.580
But then after a while,
because the puppet--

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.747
we have amazing,
amazing puppeteers.

00:17:30.747 --> 00:17:32.330
They go through a
lot of work to learn

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.259
how to make these
puppets come to life.

00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:34.800
And they are.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.008
They're alive and they're
real, and so you can't help

00:17:37.008 --> 00:17:38.745
but feel for these
inanimate objects.

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:40.170
So you play to the puppets.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.170
And the people, eh.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.804
NICHOLAS KOHN: I
remember initially it

00:17:45.804 --> 00:17:47.470
was a little strange
being in rehearsals

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.420
and talking to a puppet
and having-- I mean,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.878
the puppets are so gorgeous,
and they have such expression.

00:17:51.878 --> 00:17:53.740
It's not that hard
for that long.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.650
But it was a little
bit like, oh, my.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.490
This is a thing
that's in my face.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.990
And it's really,
like, got big guys.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.080
And they're gorgeous, but it
is a different transition,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.850
I think, talking.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.600
SALA IWAMATSU: No, I
thought the opposite.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.050
I thought they
were-- the puppets

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.260
were the best actors
I've ever worked with.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.760
Sorry.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.180
It's almost like
looking at a puppy.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.770
They look at you with
these eyes and there's just

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.960
unconditional love.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.920
There's not judgment.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.492
So when I joined the company,
I came into the company

00:18:23.492 --> 00:18:25.200
and other people were
like, oh, let's see

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.450
if this girl can do it,
whereas the puppets were like,

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.912
oh-- you know, so supportive.

00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:33.364
I have some problems,
but, you know.

00:18:33.364 --> 00:18:34.780
NICHOLAS KOHN: No
judgment, right?

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.032
SALA IWAMATSU: No judgment.

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:38.490
ALAN SEALES: So
for the puppeteers,

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.930
what was it like for you guys?

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.990
Because you're looking
at the live actors,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.860
but everybody is playing
back to what's in your hands.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.860
DARREN BLUESTONE: Yeah.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.810
Yeah, that was a
big change for me

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.740
at first, because I've
never done any puppetry

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.890
before doing "Avenue Q."

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.030
Most of us didn't.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.050
And then through the
audition process,

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.010
you learn how to puppeteer.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.900
And so I went to school
for musical theater,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.350
and generally looking
at someone in the eyes.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.880
And so all of a sudden, you're
looking at them in the eyes

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.770
and they're looking
at your right hand.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.000
And it's disorienting at first,
but then you kind of just

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.520
get it, and it-- because
you can feel the energy.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.270
The puppet and the person
become one entire entity.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.020
And then you can feed
off of their energy.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.519
It doesn't matter if they're
exactly looking in your pupils.

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:26.895
You can still feel for them.

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:27.770
VERONICA KUEHN: Yeah.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.450
I will say, it's really
strange if there's ever

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.410
a moment where we by
accidentally bump into-- there

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.740
will be human contact all
of a sudden by accident.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.670
Like, someone bumped me and
I was like, oh-- so strange.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.510
But yeah.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.320
ALAN SEALES: Do you think
it's weird for the audience

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.930
to be watching the
puppets versus you,

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.514
or do you find that the audience
watches one versus the other?

00:19:50.514 --> 00:19:52.305
DANIELLE THOMAS: I can
answer that question

00:19:52.305 --> 00:19:53.610
as a person who saw the show.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.943
I didn't want to see "Avenue Q."

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.740
Well before I was in it, I had
some friends coming in town.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.317
They wanted to see-- I'm
like, any Broadway show.

00:20:00.317 --> 00:20:01.900
"Avenue Q," the show
with the puppets?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.435
Come on.

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:04.018
We're in New York,
we'll see any show.

00:20:04.018 --> 00:20:05.510
And we went to see
"Avenue Q" and I

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.290
laughed from the first word
on, from "BA in English"

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.379
to all the way through.

00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:12.420
And at first, you're like,
wait, what's going on?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.320
You look at the puppets, you
kind of look at the people.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.400
And it's amazing,
especially when the puppet

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.915
is right beside
the person's face.

00:20:17.915 --> 00:20:20.910
And you see the same expression
on the person and the puppet.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.020
And by "Gay," I
think, for me-- I

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.171
don't even remember
when it switched, but I

00:20:26.171 --> 00:20:27.420
started looking at the puppet.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.753
Maybe every now and again,
you would look at the person,

00:20:29.753 --> 00:20:31.578
but they really do
become one thing.

00:20:31.578 --> 00:20:33.536
So in the beginning,
you're like, I don't know.

00:20:33.536 --> 00:20:36.570
But early on in the
show, it just all melts

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.145
and it's amazing.

00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:40.270
JENNIFER BARNHART: Rick
Lyon, the original designer

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.510
and original
Nicky/Trekkie, the puppets,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.750
had a great metaphor for it.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.416
He said, watching the
first five minutes

00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:46.290
of "Avenue Q" is very
much like watching

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.732
a foreign film with subtitles.

00:20:47.732 --> 00:20:49.190
Because for the
first five minutes,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.105
you're very aware of doing this.

00:20:51.105 --> 00:20:52.730
And then after a
while, it just becomes

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.088
part of the storytelling
and you don't notice it, so.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.004
DANIELLE THOMAS: That's perfect.

00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:57.380
DARREN BLUESTONE: I like that.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.940
ALAN SEALES: So why do you
think the show works so well--

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.560
this is the first
puppeteering show

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.430
that I've seen, or
shows with puppets,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.120
where the puppeteers are in
complete, full view, and part

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.770
of the show.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.974
Why does that work here?

00:21:08.974 --> 00:21:11.140
NICHOLAS KOHN: Well, Jenn
might actually have more--

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.140
JENNIFER BARNHART: Yeah.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.590
The first time I started
doing the show as a puppeteer,

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.715
I remembered asking the
puppeteers on the first day

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:20.714
of rehearsal, by the way,
how are we doing this?

00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:22.400
Are we doing this,
or are we doing this?

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.140
Because as a puppeteer-- because
I have a puppetry background as

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.200
well as an acting background--
I'm used to the puppeteer

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.037
having to be somewhat
neutral, and not being seen.

00:21:31.037 --> 00:21:32.120
And they said, no, no, no.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.703
We want this, because we want
it to be, you know, sort of open

00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:35.550
to interpretation.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.966
Your face is the
subtle expression

00:21:36.966 --> 00:21:38.490
of what's happening
with the puppet.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.080
But since I'm second-handing
somebody, I thought,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.910
well, I can't be upstaging
them and doing crazy stuff

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.410
with my face, because the
person doing the voice is there,

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.710
and they're acting,
and they're doing that.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.270
So I'm just going
to do my thing.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.010
So I was just trying to be
as neutral as I could be.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.882
And when we were still off
Broadway, one of the audience

00:21:54.882 --> 00:21:57.340
members who was a friend of
our stage manager came up to me

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.840
and said, are you having fun?

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.060
And I said, I'm a great time.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:01.560
Why?

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.060
And they said, because
I was so distracted

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.240
by looking at your face.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.390
You didn't seem like
you were emotionally

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.848
connecting with
what was happening.

00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:09.500
I was like, oh.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.300
OK.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.150
I guess I have to up my face
game and become part of it.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.120
So it was definitely
a transition

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.310
from that puppetry world.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.720
But it's so liberating,
because I also

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.780
puppeteer on Sesame
Street, and we end up

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.332
using TV monitors
down on the ground,

00:22:26.332 --> 00:22:28.040
and we're used to
puppeteering like this.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.160
Actually, we're
usually on the floor.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.920
And you've got to tilt your head
sideways to get your head out

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.878
of the shot, and you're
looking at the monitor.

00:22:32.878 --> 00:22:34.550
And this is generally
how we puppeteer.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.660
So being able to do
it from here and not

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.320
having to worry about getting
me out of the shot-- oh,

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.100
it was heaven.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.860
It was wonderful.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.568
But then I had to
learn how to coordinate

00:22:42.568 --> 00:22:45.379
what was happening with
my feet with my hands.

00:22:45.379 --> 00:22:46.920
And that was a whole
other challenge.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.470
Lip syncing in one
rhythm and dancing

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.822
in another, that's a lot.

00:22:49.822 --> 00:22:51.530
ALAN SEALES: So what's
the weirdest thing

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.000
that any of you with
the puppets have

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.520
had to learn to do
with the puppets?

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.144
What was the most challenging?

00:22:57.144 --> 00:23:02.280
DARREN BLUESTONE: Uh, Sex Yeah.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.182
Because-- I mean, that was the
most fun for me to figure out.

00:23:06.182 --> 00:23:07.930
VERONICA KUEHN: It's
really-- I mean,

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.130
it's arm choreography,
essentially.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.500
DARREN BLUESTONE: But
there's so much choreography.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.700
NICHOLAS KOHN: There's
a part in the show where

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.880
they're having sex.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.744
He's not having
sex with a puppet.

00:23:16.744 --> 00:23:19.090
VERONICA KUEHN: Puppet
sex, we should clarify.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:19.660
DARREN BLUESTONE: Oh, yeah.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.540
NICHOLAS KOHN: Very
important distinction.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.780
ALAN SEALES: I think we
should clarify that right now.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.944
DARREN BLUESTONE: I thought that
was understood in the question,

00:23:24.944 --> 00:23:25.510
but apparently not.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.355
ALAN SEALES: Some people
may have not seen it yet.

00:23:27.355 --> 00:23:29.570
SALA IWAMATSU: At one point--
when I first joined the show,

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.910
I was in the ensemble as well.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:34.660
And I had to puppeteer
Trekkie Monster's silhouette

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.840
in a window.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.490
And he is-- can I say it?

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.310
OK.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.700
He's masturbating.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.600
And I had to practice and
practice and practice.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.190
They were like,
it's not believable.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.448
And I was like, I don't
know how to do this.

00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:52.840
I was like, it's so hard.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.280
I mean, it is hard.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.174
But that was my weird moment.

00:23:58.174 --> 00:24:00.423
ALAN SEALES: Only practice
bating until you master it.

00:24:00.423 --> 00:24:03.006
DANIELLE THOMAS: I will say, as
a person acting with a puppet,

00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:06.150
the weirdest thing is getting
the hair out of their eyes

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.340
and they don't even notice.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.080
Anybody else?

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.980
They don't notice that
hair is in their eyes.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.240
ALAN SEALES: Oh, you brush
the hair out of their eyes?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.730
DANIELLE THOMAS: I'm like,
you don't feel that in your--

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.150
VERONICA KUEHN: I'm
constantly doing that to Kate.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.070
I mean, the way that Kate's
hair is, it's always getting--

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.903
DANIELLE THOMAS: Well,
it's usually Trekkie.

00:24:19.903 --> 00:24:20.620
I help him out.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.495
JENNIFER BARNHART: I
actually have a question

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:26.320
for Jason, because as far
as tag-team partnering--

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.680
now, had you puppeteered
prior to the show?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.490
JASON JACOBY: No.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.080
JENNIFER BARNHART: So how
was that process for you?

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.100
JASON JACOBY: That's been a very
interesting process, actually.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.525
Doing two-- I guess
I don't need this.

00:24:38.525 --> 00:24:40.900
I did two regional productions
before joining the company

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.530
here.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:47.034
So that was like my
training to puppeteer.

00:24:47.034 --> 00:24:48.450
And the first
production I did was

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.491
directed by Rick Lyon,
who originated these roles

00:24:50.491 --> 00:24:51.860
and is the puppet designer.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.240
So that was like my real
training as a puppeteer.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.510
And since then, and
now that you're here,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.630
I guess I've done the show--
including swings and whatnot--

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.240
I've done the show with nine
different second handers.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.930
And it's a real-- it's
so much fun, really.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.020
It's kind of exhilarating
having new people,

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.880
because everyone-- even
though it's just a hand,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.930
there's so much more
than just a hand.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:15.715
ALAN SEALES: Is
everybody different?

00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:17.060
The second-hand
people are different?

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.018
JASON JACOBY: Oh, yeah.

00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:21.470
I mean, everything we do,
as you saw in the numbers--

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.500
there's a lot of it that's
very set and choreographed.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.250
But people bring--
people are different,

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.430
and people bring different
energies to the work.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:37.060
And the way that Jenn and I
do a sort of gesture like this

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.010
is different than how me
and others would do it.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.784
And it's kind of exhilarating
to work with different people

00:25:44.784 --> 00:25:46.075
and have that different energy.

00:25:46.075 --> 00:25:49.780
And to do the same
material-- and that

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.160
may look exactly the same,
I guess, from an audience

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.919
standpoint-- but in it,
feels very different.

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:58.460
ALAN SEALES: So do the puppets
themselves ever make mistakes?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.840
NICHOLAS KOHN: Occasionally,
an eye will pop off

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.840
or something like that.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.010
It happened once in Vegas,
and it was the most disturbing

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.690
ever.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.540
The audience is just like
[GASPS] because you really

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.820
kind of fall in love with
these puppets as people,

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.486
and their characters
are so well written

00:26:19.486 --> 00:26:21.595
that, like, all of a
sudden-- oh, this is bad.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.600
DARREN BLUESTONE: Or the rods.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.240
NICHOLAS KOHN: Or the arm.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.980
DARREN BLUESTONE: The rods
will come off sometimes.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.480
DANIELLE THOMAS:
Those are the best.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.370
JENNIFER BARNHART: The Bad Idea
Bear's arm came off one time,

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.140
and Christian, who
was puppeteering it,

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.520
just sort of flung it away.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.956
And then he had his
bear just rub the stump.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.830
DANIELLE THOMAS: Wow.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.454
ALAN SEALES: I want to switch to
the audition process, I guess.

00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:51.210
So most of you-- all of
you except one are new.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.960
So the audition process for
this, how different was it

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.759
from the other shows that
you've auditioned for?

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:57.925
VERONICA KUEHN: Who's going?

00:26:57.925 --> 00:26:58.656
Am I going?

00:26:58.656 --> 00:27:00.030
DARREN BLUESTONE:
Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.670
VERONICA KUEHN: I mean, it
was one of the longer audition

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.130
processes I've
ever been through.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.680
I auditioned for the
first time in 2007,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.750
and then I ended up joining
this company in 2011.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.240
So I think I went in a total
of seven different times,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.479
and had done what they call
puppet camp, which is something

00:27:16.479 --> 00:27:18.520
that they do-- is if you've
been through a couple

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.715
of different callbacks and
the casting office has said,

00:27:20.715 --> 00:27:22.290
oh, they'd probably
be good at this,

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:26.800
they put you through sort of
a week-long puppet boot camp

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.260
to see if you can pick up
some of the basic skills that

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.150
would have to be
really focused on.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.840
So I did that in 2007.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.790
ALAN SEALES: What
are the basic skills?

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.690
VERONICA KUEHN: Your eye focus.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.841
Your neutral-- the positions
that your puppet hands

00:27:40.841 --> 00:27:42.840
should be resting in when
they're not gesturing.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.620
They always have to
come back to a neutral.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.197
Focus.

00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:47.780
DARREN BLUESTONE:
Keeping it straight.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.750
VERONICA KUEHN: The position.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.580
Yeah, the sync.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.790
Oh, there it is.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.250
Jenn taught me how to puppeteer.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.020
And the sync-- the lip
sync that you're working on

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.136
with matching the puppet's
mouth to your mouth.

00:27:58.136 --> 00:28:00.510
JENNIFER BARNHART: Basically,
focus, gravity, and breath.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.065
VERONICA KUEHN: There it is.

00:28:01.065 --> 00:28:02.700
JENNIFER BARNHART: Focus Is
where the puppet's looking.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.400
Gravity has to do with their
posture, where ground is,

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.460
and breath also
includes lip sync,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.840
but also [SIGHING
HEAVILY] a sigh

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.380
like Rob does so beautifully
at the top of "Gay."

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.614
Thank you.

00:28:13.614 --> 00:28:15.030
ALAN SEALES: Do
any of you-- like,

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.250
did you get any
practice puppets?

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.470
Or do you go home and sit
in a mirror with a sock?

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.250
DARREN BLUESTONE: You know,
for the actual audition,

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.430
they give you two
little ping-pong balls

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.020
with little eyes on them.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.840
And then you can
bring those home.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.805
And so I started-- it's like
a little elastic around that.

00:28:30.805 --> 00:28:33.020
And then you just
focus on trying

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.180
to just move your thumb
instead of your whole-- like,

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.890
the top part of your hand,
so that the puppet doesn't

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.100
do this weird thing
with its head.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.400
So you practice that.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.290
And then I actually-- when
I first booked the job,

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.420
I was a vacation swing.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:54.060
And they allowed me to take home
one of the old, old Princetons.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.110
And so I was practicing
with an old Princeton

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.240
at home for the
months leading up

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.530
to going back in
for Princeton Rod

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.316
and finally booking that job.

00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:06.350
ALAN SEALES: How many different
sets of puppets are there?

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.189
You said old Rod--
or old Princeton.

00:29:08.189 --> 00:29:09.730
VERONICA KUEHN:
They've been retired.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.060
DARREN BLUESTONE:
It's very tired, yeah.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.650
NICHOLAS KOHN: There's 44
working puppets in the show,

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.500
and then there's a
bunch of old puppets

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.920
that are used for different
things-- practice, press

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.700
events-- rehearsal,
things like that.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.290
ALAN SEALES: So they
get cosmetic face lifts

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.055
every now and then?

00:29:22.055 --> 00:29:23.105
NICHOLAS KOHN: Yeah,
he comes in-- I'm

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:23.700
sure you know more about that.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.195
ALAN SEALES: New felt?

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:25.528
JENNIFER BARNHART: Actually, no.

00:29:25.528 --> 00:29:27.960
I don't know what his schedule
is for refurbishing them,

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.000
or what--

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.360
VERONICA KUEHN: They
do get refurbished.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:29.980
NICHOLAS KOHN: He
makes them very well.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.910
Rarely do they need
anything, but--

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.285
VERONICA KUEHN:
Well, like Lucy--

00:29:33.285 --> 00:29:36.575
Bible Lucy just got
a new wig recently.

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:37.950
JASON JACOBY: The
Trekkie you saw

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.642
today is new as of a
couple-- a few months ago.

00:29:40.642 --> 00:29:41.683
He's a brand-new Trekkie.

00:29:41.683 --> 00:29:42.370
That was an exciting day for us.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.380
VERONICA KUEHN: Their fur is
fluffier-- you know, things--

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.190
they get worn a lot
from being in the show,

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.880
but every now and then.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.960
JENNIFER BARNHART: But
it's kind of astonishing

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.720
that after 10
years, we're really

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.300
on only third generation of
these puppets, because they are

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.720
made-- and each one of them
takes about 120 man hours.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.120
They're all crafted
by hand, and they

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.980
cost thousands and
thousands of dollars.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.140
JED RESNICK: That's the
genius of Rick Lyon.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.200
JENNIFER BARNHART: Yeah.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.950
ALAN SEALES: So
what's on the inside?

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.600
JENNIFER BARNHART:
Everybody assumes

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.560
that you can make a
puppet for, like, $100.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.997
And it's like no, sorry.

00:30:09.997 --> 00:30:12.330
ALAN SEALES: All you need is
a sock and ping-pong balls.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.237
That's pretty cheap, right.

00:30:15.237 --> 00:30:16.570
So what's on the inside, though?

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.640
You said it's elastic, so
the mouth closes on its own.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.713
Is that neutral?

00:30:20.713 --> 00:30:23.100
JASON JACOBY: No, that
was the ping-pong balls.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.280
VERONICA KUEHN: No,
that's just the practice.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:24.700
ALAN SEALES: Oh,
the ping-pong balls.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.680
DARREN BLUESTONE: That
was the practice thing

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.320
that they gave you
for the audition,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.930
was just ping-pong balls
and an elastic band.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:30.790
ALAN SEALES: So unless
you were there--

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.373
DARREN BLUESTONE:
But an actual puppet

00:30:32.373 --> 00:30:34.692
is made up of so many
different materials.

00:30:34.692 --> 00:30:36.900
JENNIFER BARNHART: Foam and
fleece and rubber gaskets

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.039
inside the mouth for the
palate-- for the hard palate.

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:42.330
So there's a hard palate
that's shaped like a "v," then

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.140
there's a ring that
your thumb fits in.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.015
And there's occasionally
a little bridge,

00:30:46.015 --> 00:30:48.000
sort of like the fret
of a guitar that's

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.800
on the top palate, that helps
anchor your hand in there.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.220
And then there's a brain inside.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.160
I mean it's, architecturally--

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.493
SALA IWAMATSU: We have three
different types of puppets.

00:30:54.493 --> 00:30:55.769
We have some that have rods.

00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:57.310
So that they have
arms that come out,

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.770
and they have rods like how
Rod is so that you can do this.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.537
Then there's the--

00:31:01.537 --> 00:31:02.620
NICHOLAS KOHN: Live hands.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.994
SALA IWAMATSU:
Live-hand puppets.

00:31:03.994 --> 00:31:07.090
And then we have boxes at
one point that come to life.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.175
And that's like a trigger
gun, and they do that.

00:31:09.175 --> 00:31:10.860
DARREN BLUESTONE: Which you
see in "Lion King," and stuff

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.660
like that.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.497
That has a lot of
trigger puppets.

00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:15.372
So boxes are the only
trigger puppets, right,

00:31:15.372 --> 00:31:16.500
that are in our show?

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:16.850
SALA IWAMATSU: I think so.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.600
ALAN SEALES: You can
see the triggers too.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.610
It's all completely out
there, exposed, yeah.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.870
So during the audition
process, was there

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.245
anything-- any mistakes that
you made during the audition

00:31:25.245 --> 00:31:28.524
process that you take with
you to your future auditions--

00:31:28.524 --> 00:31:29.440
if you're auditioning.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.023
I don't want to get
anyone in trouble.

00:31:33.512 --> 00:31:35.970
DARREN BLUESTONE: Well, my
whole experience with "Avenue Q"

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.360
started when I first
saw the show, back when

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.180
I was a sophomore
in high school.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.720
And I remember putting
this awful video

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.190
on YouTube of me
singing "Purpose," which

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.020
is the main song that I guess
Princeton sings in the show.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.360
And I put it on YouTube,
and I got information back

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.090
on Facebook by Jeff Marx, who's
one of the writers of the show.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:00.390
And we started
Facebooking, and we

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.320
were talking throughout
my high school career.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.340
And then we stopped
talking after a while.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.990
And we just lost touch.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.720
And then randomly,
I got the show.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.760
And I hadn't talked
to him in forever.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.210
And I got the show, and
I Facebooked him again,

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.675
and I was like,
just so you know,

00:32:16.675 --> 00:32:18.360
I'm, like, the
lead in your show.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.610
I'm going to be in "Avenue Q."

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:20.670
And he was like, what?

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.430
That's crazy.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.142
And he came back and saw me
and we had this big reunion.

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.600
Because I'd actually
never met him.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.050
We were just Facebooking.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.780
I don't know how
that happened-- how

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.257
that has anything
to do with that.

00:32:32.257 --> 00:32:34.340
ALAN SEALES: That wasn't
my question at all, but--

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.090
DARREN BLUESTONE: But
it was a good story,

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.350
I wanted to tell it.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.830
NICHOLAS KOHN: No,
we've actually-- they've

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.060
actually queued up
that video, Darren.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.963
We're going to watch it.

00:32:39.963 --> 00:32:40.921
DARREN BLUESTONE: Yeah.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.650
ALAN SEALES: Oh, I
wish we had that.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.900
VERONICA KUEHN: High school!

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.715
ALAN SEALES: So let's
talk about racism.

00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:53.764
DANIELLE THOMAS: I'll help.

00:32:53.764 --> 00:32:56.590
Just kidding.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.290
ALAN SEALES: So
obviously the show deals

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.760
with racism and sexuality,
and bringing a lot of issues

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.400
to the surface and then putting
them right there comically

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.600
in people's faces.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.640
I mean, do you think there's
a bigger meaning to the show,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.684
or is it all just for fun?

00:33:10.684 --> 00:33:11.850
DANIELLE THOMAS: Definitely.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.110
NICHOLAS KOHN: There's tons
of-- this show, I think,

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.880
is one of the rare times
it's-- I could say,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.010
this is a perfect musical.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.800
It's written from top to bottom.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.860
And the life lessons
that you learn in life

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.650
are kind of portrayed
on the stage.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.120
And it's stuff that nobody
really talks about sometimes.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.574
And when they come
to the show, I

00:33:31.574 --> 00:33:33.990
think-- sometimes people get
a little offended, especially

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.050
with "Racist."

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.730
And then they laugh despite
themselves, and they're like,

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.330
oh, it's OK.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.064
We're OK.

00:33:40.064 --> 00:33:41.980
Everyone's a little bit
racist, and it's fine.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.320
And I think that's
the joy of the show.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.887
It does put real
life in front of you.

00:33:46.887 --> 00:33:47.470
And then you--

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.220
ALAN SEALES: So you
think people walk out

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.240
of the show with a
greater awareness

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.580
or appreciation for things.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.300
NICHOLAS KOHN: Oh, sure.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.010
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.926
Has the show ever gotten
any blowback-- or you

00:33:54.926 --> 00:33:57.105
got any blowback from anything?

00:33:57.105 --> 00:33:58.980
You remember, I guess,
initially if the songs

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.150
were too offensive?

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.590
People have gotten up and left.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.200
NICHOLAS KOHN: We had a busload
of people that were from

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.827
a church-- came--

00:34:09.827 --> 00:34:12.250
SALA IWAMATSU: Yeah, we
had nones in the audience.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.083
NICHOLAS KOHN: Yeah.

00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:14.515
And they did not
stay for act two.

00:34:14.515 --> 00:34:16.389
DANIELLE THOMAS: Or if we
have children-- I mean,

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.040
you never know.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.741
It's always exciting to see
when we're going to lose them,

00:34:19.741 --> 00:34:21.449
if we're going to
lose-- ah, there we go.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:22.980
If we don't lose
them by "Porn," then,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.313
we're going to say, oh, we'll
get them with [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:28.770
We've had moments where
there'll be kids right, front,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.360
and center.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.045
And we're like, oh,
God, I'm so sorry.

00:34:31.045 --> 00:34:33.170
You're going to have so
many questions for your mom

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.915
when you go home.

00:34:33.915 --> 00:34:36.362
Here it is.

00:34:36.362 --> 00:34:37.820
NICHOLAS KOHN:
Like, two-year-olds.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.719
DANIELLE THOMAS: Yeah.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.520
DARREN BLUESTONE: There was
a woman who left, I think,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.280
two weeks ago.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.920
And our sound guy Josh, was
like, when she left half-way

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.090
through act one, she
was like, this place

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.340
needs to be burned
to the ground.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.370
And walked out.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.830
And he thought it
was hysterical.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.520
He's like, I'll see you there.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.300
ALAN SEALES: So the
death of Gary Coleman--

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.339
the real-life
death-- how did you

00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:03.630
deal with that within the show?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.213
DANIELLE THOMAS: You
know, it's funny.

00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:08.714
I started the show with
the first national tour.

00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:09.630
I did the entire tour.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.626
And we would all make
jokes like-- because he

00:35:11.626 --> 00:35:13.000
had gotten sick
before he passed.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:13.880
And we're like, oh my god, Gary.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.995
Hold on, I need a job.

00:35:14.995 --> 00:35:15.870
You know-- oh my god.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.710
What will happen?

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.460
And then it really happened.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.150
And I was Gary Coleman
the day that he died.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.540
And you would think that I
would be nervous on my job,

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.529
but I was just so
nervous and so afraid.

00:35:26.529 --> 00:35:28.820
And a lot of the producers
and Jeff Whitty, the writer,

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.320
called me.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.380
And he said, well, we've
released a statement,

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.930
and we're going to say something
at the end of the show.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.930
And so I was just talking
to him and telling him

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.750
about how I felt about the show.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.390
And he was like, OK, I'm
not going to write anything.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:42.890
You can just say
what you just said.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:43.964
And I'm like, what?

00:35:43.964 --> 00:35:45.130
And Sala was doing the show.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.510
JENNIFER BARNHART:
And it was beautiful.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.843
DANIELLE THOMAS: And we get
to the theater and I'm like,

00:35:48.843 --> 00:35:49.525
I'm so nervous.

00:35:49.525 --> 00:35:50.220
I'm so scared.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.890
And I'm in the
bathroom crying, trying

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:52.890
to figure out what
I want to say.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.630
And I'm nervous because
as soon as I come out,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.960
I'm going to say, "that's
Gary Coleman-- yes, I am."

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.585
And I'm like, are
they going to boo me?

00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:01.500
And I was shaking so much.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.280
And I come out on the fire
escape and I say, yes, I am.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.610
And the audience applauds.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:06.741
And I'm like, it's OK.

00:36:06.741 --> 00:36:07.240
It's OK.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.323
And so we just say-- which
is honestly the truth--

00:36:09.323 --> 00:36:11.560
Gary's had a really bad deal.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.980
And he never came
to see the show.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.670
We tried to get him
to come see the show.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.170
I understand why he wouldn't,
but I wish that he would have,

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.970
because Gary is depicted
in such a great way

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.370
on the avenue of "Avenue Q."

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:22.060
He has friends.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.920
He has people who have
become his family.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.690
And he has a lot of advice
to give the younger people.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.460
And so we just
said that-- and we

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.990
will continue to honor his
legacy by making people laugh,

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.531
and do what he loved
to do every day.

00:36:32.531 --> 00:36:34.680
So it was kind of weird,
but it ended up being OK.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.920
And so I did that speech
for the week after he died.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.200
And so he still lives.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.295
And I think it's a good--

00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:43.470
NICHOLAS KOHN: He's
also got the most life

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.500
experience in the show.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.810
And no one's had it
harder than Gary Coleman.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.660
So he has probably a lot of
the-- save for the therapist--

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.230
but he has a lot of good advice
for the young kids coming

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.180
to New York, so.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.374
DANIELLE THOMAS: Yeah.

00:36:56.374 --> 00:36:57.790
ALAN SEALES: So
Jennifer, you were

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.200
in the show in its original
six-year run on Broadway,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:00.760
correct?

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.650
And then you left and
then came back, right?

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.800
So what made you come back?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.091
JENNIFER BARNHART: Well, part
of it was-- first of all,

00:37:08.091 --> 00:37:11.290
we didn't know until
closing night on Broadway

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.150
that we weren't really
closing-- that we were just

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.967
moving across the street
to New World stages.

00:37:16.967 --> 00:37:17.800
We didn't know that.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.230
So I'd already
booked another job.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.172
Because I was like,
well, this gig's over.

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.380
It's been a lovely six years.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.660
I better figure out
what the heck is next.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.620
So I already had a gig.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.530
So I was doing that.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:32.830
And in the years since, I've
been exploring other horizons.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.870
I've been doing things
just as a human.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.070
I got to do a season down
at Alabama Shakespeare

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.860
Festival in their spring
rep doing some Shakespeare

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.160
without puppets, which was fun
and challenging and exciting.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.990
And it's nice-- I've
been very fortunate

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.902
to be able to come back and
join the company at times

00:37:48.902 --> 00:37:50.610
when they're either
between cast members,

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.790
or if a cast member books
another job that she can go

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.620
leave town to do that
for a little while,

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.290
or if somebody needs
a medical cover--

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.310
like a medical leave,
that kind of thing.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.740
And so I get to swing back into
the show every now and again.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.170
Actually, every calendar
year since the transfer

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:10.150
I have been there for anywhere
between a couple of weeks

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.390
and a couple of months.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.570
And it's just lovely.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.920
It's like coming home again.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.280
DANIELLE THOMAS: What I
will say about "Avenue Q"

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.890
is because it's so well
written and there's so much

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:22.240
heart in the show, that all of
us who have ever done it before

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:22.970
feel that.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:24.282
It bleeds out throughout.

00:38:24.282 --> 00:38:26.490
Granted, we do say some
things that are inappropriate

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.630
and aren't realized because
it's what we do on stage.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.713
But we also really love
each other and the company

00:38:30.713 --> 00:38:33.930
from top to bottom--
crew, stage managers,

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.250
producers-- it's a family.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.460
And so we are family.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.650
So you go and you come
back for the holidays.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.360
You go and you come back.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:40.670
JENNIFER BARNHART: The reunion.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.461
DANIELLE THOMAS: That's
what "Avenue Q" is.

00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:44.470
It really is a show with heart.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.644
And the people that are
involved, the company that

00:38:46.644 --> 00:38:47.810
are involved, we have heart.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.040
And we are a family,
really, on "Avenue Q."

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.380
It's not even a joke.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.699
It's the honest to God truth.

00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:54.740
NICHOLAS KOHN: It takes
a certain specific weirdo

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.220
to be in this show, but we're
very lovable, happy weirdos.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.812
And we have a good time.

00:39:02.365 --> 00:39:03.990
ALAN SEALES: Now,
Jenn, you go around--

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.144
you teach regional productions
of the show, right?

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:07.310
You teach them the puppetry?

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.180
JENNIFER BARNHART: Yeah, I have
actually started doing that.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.430
I've been going around and
coaching different-- mostly

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.784
university
productions, but I got

00:39:14.784 --> 00:39:16.200
to direct a
production of the show

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.380
for the first time earlier this
year at the Adirondack Theater

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.130
Festival up in Glens
Falls, New York which

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.820
was a whole other experience,
and challenging and fun.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.920
I love working with
new puppeteers,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.700
and watching them--
first of all,

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.640
discover how hard it is,
because everyone that you

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.622
see here is at a level where
they make it look so easy

00:39:37.622 --> 00:39:39.580
that people just assume
that anybody can do it.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.840
But really, it's like
learning a foreign language.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.350
And when people
do that boot camp

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.390
that Veronica was
talking about, by the end

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.541
of one week of working for six
hours a day, if they're lucky,

00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.290
they've learned how
to say, hello, my name

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.530
is, where's the bathroom
in this foreign language.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.170
The vocabulary may not be right.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.730
The conjugation
may not be right.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.920
But at least they're
communicating an idea.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.550
So it is like you're
taking an immersion class.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.770
And I love watching puppeteers
first of all discover

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.990
that, but then discover their
own potential within it.

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.780
And then watch them
translate from,

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.760
what is this foreign
object on my arm to being

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.860
able to make acting
choices through the puppet.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.010
And watching that
open up things in them

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.340
that they wouldn't have been
able to tap, necessarily, just

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.000
as a human.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.417
ALAN SEALES: So the regional
productions or the university

00:40:23.417 --> 00:40:25.250
productions, do they
make their own puppets?

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.027
Or do they license,
or-- how does that work.

00:40:28.027 --> 00:40:30.360
JENNIFER BARNHART: There's a
couple of different things.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.360
The production I
directed, I ended up

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.140
renting a set from
Rick Lyon, who

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.820
has a set that he rents out.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.520
MTI, Musical Theatre
International,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.950
who does the rights
for the show,

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.460
they have their own set of
puppets that somebody built.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.760
And so there's
that set available.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.080
And actually, the one that I
just did-- the one that I just

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.419
coached out at University of
Utah, the costume designer who

00:40:58.419 --> 00:41:00.210
works there-- she's
the costume professor--

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.930
she and I worked together in
Alabama at Alabama Shakespeare

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.530
Festival, and she
knew what I did.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.570
She said, hey, I'm
actually designing puppets.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.329
So the fall semester of this
past academic year, they

00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:13.370
actually put the show on,
but the previous spring

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.010
semester, the costume
designers crafts

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.507
class and costume classic
made these puppets based

00:41:18.507 --> 00:41:20.840
on her designs, and had another
puppeteer friend of mine

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.020
and colleague, a woman by the
name of Honey Goodenough-- that

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.160
is her name, and I
believe she has it

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.730
trademarked because
it's a great name--

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.070
but she went out and helped
them learn how to build them.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.070
So there's a bunch of
different ways to do it.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.960
It's mostly-- and there are
other companies out there.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.600
I think Swazzle Puppet Company
out in California rents sets.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.224
I think it's a little dicey
in terms of rights and designs

00:41:44.224 --> 00:41:44.890
and all of that.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.890
And I honestly can't
speak to the legality

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.250
and logistics and
issues of that.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.880
But I would recommend to anyone
who's considering doing it

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.450
that they might want to
start by contacting Rick Lyon

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.450
and see if his set of
puppets are available,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.200
because they're the
original designs, so.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.230
ALAN SEALES: Very nice.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.313
JENNIFER BARNHART: And
they're very puppeteerable.

00:42:02.313 --> 00:42:05.007
Because you can make
a puppet look good,

00:42:05.007 --> 00:42:07.340
but if you haven't worked out
the inner mechanics of it,

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.830
it won't move very well.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.862
So anyway, just
a plug for people

00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:12.570
who know how to design
and build puppets.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.486
Because it's not easy.

00:42:13.486 --> 00:42:16.540
ALAN SEALES: We've got all
sorts of groups and internal

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.370
interests, so I'm sure there's--
there's some puppeteers here,

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.500
I'm sure.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.370
We've got jugglers clubs
and everything else, so.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.459
Yeah.

00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:26.000
ALAN SEALES: Darren,
congratulations.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.690
This is your off
Broadway debut, right?

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:28.898
DARREN BLUESTONE: It is, yes.

00:42:28.898 --> 00:42:29.620
Thank you.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.530
ALAN SEALES: So I mean, this
kind of goes back a little bit

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.446
to the audition process
we were talking about.

00:42:33.446 --> 00:42:35.350
How long did it
take for you to get

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:37.260
used to sharing the
stage, I guess--

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.350
or not being just
yourself up there,

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.380
of having people not
look at you all the time?

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.255
Does that make sense?

00:42:43.255 --> 00:42:45.546
DARREN BLUESTONE: Like having
the puppet along with me?

00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:46.746
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:46.746 --> 00:42:48.620
DARREN BLUESTONE: Yeah,
that was interesting.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:53.270
But for some reason,
having a puppet next to me

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.140
allowed me to get in my
body a little bit more

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.082
for some reason.

00:42:58.082 --> 00:42:59.040
I don't know, I think--

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.377
ALAN SEALES: While being in his.

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:02.210
DARREN BLUESTONE: While
being in his, right.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:10.510
Because I can look at like this
external piece and visually

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.340
dissect it and
whatever, and figure out

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.680
which way-- which things
kind of look better,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.440
and how to find
some emotion in it.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:26.380
But that allows me to connect
that from this external thing

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.970
into the rest of my
body for some reason.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.240
Because I'm just a
very lanky person.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.820
I have long arms.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.710
My wingspan is longer
than how tall I am.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.550
And so having, I guess,
this all connected allowed

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:46.250
me to not worry about how
much space I was taking up,

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.860
and allow the puppet
to take up the space.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.400
And then that transferred
into the rest of my body.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.150
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.800
So, OK, Veronica--
Kate Monster and Lucy

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.220
the Slut-- how
much fun for you is

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.760
it to be able to play
both the innocent ingenue

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.340
and the sex-crazed sultress?

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.890
VERONICA KUEHN: It's really fun.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.880
I get to use two completely
different facets of my voice.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.860
Both of their voices
are very different.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.240
But it's probably one of
the most challenging parts

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.050
of the show for me.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:21.490
There are several scenes where
I am both voicing Kate and Lucy

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.610
in the same scene
talking to each other,

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:28.160
and then Jenn will be either
puppeting Kate or Lucy.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.870
So I will literally have
conversations with myself.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.815
So that can get a
little challenging.

00:44:34.815 --> 00:44:36.652
It's a little brain
teaser for yourself.

00:44:36.652 --> 00:44:38.360
So if there's ever a
moment where I'm not

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.520
completely focused,
I'll notice that I've

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.930
started to say the wrong thing.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.930
But yeah.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.554
JENNIFER BARNHART:
Keeps me on my toes.

00:44:48.554 --> 00:44:49.920
VERONICA KUEHN: Yeah, me too.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.200
It's really fun, though.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:51.800
It's nice.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.810
It's nice to be able
to switch it up.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.309
ALAN SEALES: So are you more
like Kate or Lucy in real life?

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.350
VERONICA KUEHN: Um,
probably mostly Kate.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.900
She's the heart character.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.490
I think I have a little sass
in me as well, from Lucy,

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.930
but generally, I think Kate.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:12.710
ALAN SEALES: So did you ever
feel slightly silly at first,

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.800
having puppets have sex?

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.860
VERONICA KUEHN: Oh, yeah.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.580
I still feel a little
wonky sometimes.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:27.250
I mean, I don't completely, 100%
confident with my puppeteering

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.160
ever, and I've been doing
it for 2 and 1/2 years now.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.780
I still am always checking,
where is she looking?

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.470
What's going on?

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.080
What's happening?

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.520
I have to be focused
the entire time.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.602
Otherwise, something
will go wrong.

00:45:40.602 --> 00:45:42.270
ALAN SEALES: So
for-- oh, go ahead.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.346
JENNIFER BARNHART: I was
going to say, but to be fair,

00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:43.930
I have to too.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.020
I've been doing this
for a long, long time,

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.237
and I still am checking
and then going, OK, uh,

00:45:49.237 --> 00:45:50.570
am I looking in the right place?

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:51.070
No, I'm not.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.765
Oh, it sank, uh-- so that's
a continuous process.

00:45:53.765 --> 00:45:56.724
VERONICA KUEHN: Well,
that's good to know.

00:45:56.724 --> 00:45:58.140
ALAN SEALES: So
for the two of you

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.723
that do the two-handed
puppets, do you

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:03.930
find it more enjoyable or easier
to have literally somebody

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.850
to lean on, or do you prefer
to have just your own puppet?

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.240
Or what's the
difference for you?

00:46:12.747 --> 00:46:14.580
JASON JACOBY: That's a
really good question.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.650
I mean, being alone with a
puppet gives you more freedom,

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:23.300
certainly, because there's less
that is set and choreographed--

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.490
and that you have to do this
move on this line or something.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:31.185
But there's still freedom
within choreography, obviously.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.440
I don't know if I could
say what I would prefer,

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.900
because it's-- it
actually almost feels

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.950
there's-- specifically
with Trekkie.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.100
Nicky's a little different.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:49.710
I think maybe it's just
because if she's not with me,

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.990
Nicky's hand gets stuffed
and pinned to his side

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.540
so that he looks like
Kate and Princeton,

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.820
or whomever that just
has one hand available.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.530
Trekkie, just the nature of
the sack of fur that he is,

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:02.570
doesn't get that.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:08.090
His arm just hangs limp--
from over-use, I like to say.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.480
But there's actually times--
especially when I first

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.916
started the show, we'd
rehearse and rehearse

00:47:13.916 --> 00:47:15.040
doing regional productions.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.270
And we'd rehearse
for, like, four weeks,

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:21.050
always with this person with me
doing "The Internet's For Porn"

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:22.020
and whatever.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.320
And then I'd come out into
a scene like Lucy's number

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.430
in the cafe and I'm by myself
because the second hander's

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.830
doing Kate Monster
while she's doing Lucy.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.420
And so I'm sitting there
on a bench by myself,

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.850
and it almost feels half
empty because you're

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:43.120
used to another person
bringing this extra life,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.080
and filling in the
rest of this character.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.400
JED RESNICK: And then
you're kind of just there--

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.870
JASON JACOBY:
Solo-- flying solo.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.495
And it almost feels--
at the beginning,

00:47:51.495 --> 00:47:52.965
at least-- feels a little weird.

00:47:52.965 --> 00:47:54.340
There's a moment
of, oh, I can do

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.548
whatever the hell I want now.

00:47:55.548 --> 00:47:57.755
I'm not held down
by the other person.

00:47:57.755 --> 00:48:00.710
But then it's like, oh,
I miss my other person.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.081
I wish my other person
were here to help me.

00:48:03.081 --> 00:48:04.830
JED RESNICK: I will
say, as an understudy,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.707
I've gone on for these
roles hundreds of times

00:48:07.707 --> 00:48:08.290
at this point.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.720
But when I was first going
on for Trekkie Monster,

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.030
it was really, really nice
to have the second person

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:16.399
next to you to calm your nerves
because you're freaking out

00:48:16.399 --> 00:48:18.440
because you haven't done
the role in three months

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.960
or whatever, but also to
push you around the stage

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.410
to make sure you're
going to the right spot.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:27.480
So it was always really
comforting to have

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.560
a person behind you.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.060
ALAN SEALES: How
much rehearsal goes

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.965
into the two-handed puppets?

00:48:31.965 --> 00:48:33.006
JENNIFER BARNHART: A lot.

00:48:33.006 --> 00:48:33.840
A lot, a lot, alot.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.660
ALAN SEALES: More
than the single?

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.884
JENNIFER BARNHART: Well,
I can't say that, per se.

00:48:39.884 --> 00:48:41.550
It's just a different
kind of rehearsal.

00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:46.190
When I came back into
the show-- and having

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:47.710
done this show for
as long as I have,

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:48.710
you'd think that
it's like, oh, well

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:49.500
you don't really need rehearsal.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.250
You just need to pick up and go.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:54.860
But because I'd never worked
with Jason before-- and I've

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.370
worked with probably
about 20 different people

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.520
in that partnership, if I
include vacations and covers

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.700
and understudies and
everything-- and everybody's

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.332
gestural language is so
different that I need

00:49:06.332 --> 00:49:08.790
to-- especially because of what
I do in the show, where I'm

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:11.070
supporting the person
who's doing the voice,

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.330
I'm supporting that performance.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.332
So what's nice is
the best partnerships

00:49:15.332 --> 00:49:17.040
are when I get to have
a little input too

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.920
and we sort of
create it together.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.932
But very often, I just
have to sort of go

00:49:20.932 --> 00:49:22.390
with what the other
person's doing.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.604
So when I start with
the new Nicky/Trekkie,

00:49:25.604 --> 00:49:27.270
if I haven't had a
chance to watch them,

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.440
sometimes I'll say, let me
just step out and watch you.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.356
Or better still, give
me the puppet and let me

00:49:31.356 --> 00:49:33.730
see how you would move as
a human doing this scene so

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.480
that I can observe
your gestural language

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.313
and try to help translate
it into the puppet

00:49:37.313 --> 00:49:40.280
and distill it into its
essence of how I can do that,

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.610
and match it.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.020
So there's a lot of
that kind of rehearsal.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.260
But as for the individual
puppets, especially when people

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.357
are starting to
learn, that's just

00:49:50.357 --> 00:49:51.940
the intensity of all
those three basic

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.620
principles, and
being in a mirror.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.536
And then you have to get
away from the mirror.

00:49:55.536 --> 00:49:58.410
And so it's a heck of a process.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.790
It really is.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.580
ALAN SEALES:
Danielle, why do you

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.922
think the creators of the
show chose your character

00:50:03.922 --> 00:50:05.255
to be Gary Coleman specifically?

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.320
DANIELLE THOMAS: You
don't see the resemblance?

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.250
Well, "Avenue Q" is loosely
based on "Sesame Street."

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:18.560
And on "Sesame
Street," sometimes you

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.020
have celebrity guests who
come on and help the puppets

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.670
teach the children
about life lessons.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:29.780
So of course on "Avenue Q," the
celebrity would be washed up

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.570
and Gary Coleman.

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:35.294
And so it's funny at first, but
eventually, Gary has a point.

00:50:35.294 --> 00:50:36.710
And I believe at
first they wanted

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:39.230
to have-- I believe
in the reading it was

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.610
a white woman that
played-- who read it,

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.690
a friend of one of the creators.

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.360
And I think they may
have wanted to have

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.590
different kind of
celebrities come in and out.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:51.450
But Gary Coleman just stuck
because he's pretty awesome,

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.210
and an awesome character.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:58.600
But it's like having a guest
celebrity help teach these life

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.859
lessons, but not really
the best celebrity status.

00:51:01.859 --> 00:51:03.650
JENNIFER BARNHART: And
that was also-- back

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.070
when this was
originally created,

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.070
the idea was that it would
be a television show.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:09.294
So there would be
different guests

00:51:09.294 --> 00:51:10.460
that came onto each episode.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.960
But I think part
of the reason, too,

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.670
why Gary Coleman specifically
is the show basically

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:17.592
was created-- the
creators said, look.

00:51:17.592 --> 00:51:20.050
When you're a kid and you're
watching children's television

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.235
and "Sesame Street," you
learn that you're special

00:51:22.235 --> 00:51:24.860
and you should dream big and all
of your dreams will come true,

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:25.500
and isn't that wonderful?

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.500
And then you go to
college and you graduate,

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.940
and you're living back
at home with your parents

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:29.660
and you're temping.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.920
And you're going, well, where's
the "Sesame Street" for me now?

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.540
Because I'm sort
of disillusioned

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.840
by the earlier "Sesame
Street" that I had watched.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.980
So you're-- it's a little
sadder but wiser kind of idea.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.950
It's about a bit
of lost innocence.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.980
And I think that Gary,
being a child star,

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.720
and then growing out
of that into, well,

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.960
what happens after that is in
the same track as the people

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.524
who grew up watching
Sesame Street

00:51:53.524 --> 00:51:55.190
and then are faced
with that reality of,

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.320
well, what happens now?

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.820
DANIELLE THOMAS: And that's why
he can teach so many lessons

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.850
to Princeton and everybody
else, because he's

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:03.260
been there and
back, and then some.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.780
And still looks
at it positively.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.840
Sometimes, you know,
Gary has his moments.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.800
But for the most
part, life lesson.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.450
We have a song called
"Schadenfreude," you know.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:15.537
Gary was pretty much
living that, you

00:52:15.537 --> 00:52:17.870
know-- taking pleasure in
other people's pain, you know?

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.459
And we have a purpose.

00:52:19.459 --> 00:52:20.500
So that's pretty much it.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.390
ALAN SEALES: If you could do
one of the puppeted characters,

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:24.100
who would you be?

00:52:27.285 --> 00:52:29.480
DANIELLE THOMAS: Well,
I love Kate Monster

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.730
and I think I'm a little
bit of Lucy on the inside.

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.940
So I think if it was a
puppet-- don't, don't.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.395
Don't do it.

00:52:36.395 --> 00:52:39.280
So if it were, it
would be Kate and Lucy.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.860
But I must be very honest, my
favorite character in this show

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:43.680
is Christmas Eve.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.960
And it is my dream to be
Christmas Evening in one

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.056
of these shows.

00:52:49.056 --> 00:52:51.820
(In Caribbean accent) Because
I think that Christmas Eve has

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.720
a sister from the
West Indies whose

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.920
name is Christmas evening.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.750
And she could come
and teach people

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.170
on "Avenue Q" lessons too.

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.460
JENNIFER BARNHART:
I smell spin-off.

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.710
ALAN SEALES: So I'm going
to ask a few more questions.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.835
If, again, in the audience,
you guys have anything,

00:53:09.835 --> 00:53:12.200
line up at the mics here.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.660
So I don't think there's
a single person that

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.490
goes on stage with
one puppet, correct?

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:21.140
Everybody plays multiple ones.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.330
I guess this is similar to
a swing, or-- puppety swing

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.200
or something--
but how hard is it

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.900
to switch between the
puppet characters?

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.050
And some of you
in the same scene?

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:34.670
DARREN BLUESTONE: I think when
you are learning it at first,

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:36.340
it's difficult to figure out.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.010
But then once you kind
of get it in your body,

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:41.260
the puppets themselves
feel so different.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.540
Like Rod, the way
that he's built,

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.650
he just feels a lot
different than Princeton.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:47.684
So the voices just
come out differently.

00:53:47.684 --> 00:53:48.850
And you just kind of get it.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:54.072
It's like messing up a
regular line for someone else.

00:53:54.072 --> 00:53:56.030
At that point, it would
be like, after doing it

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.910
for a year and a
half, you know, you

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.660
don't really mess
up a lot of lines.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.782
Unless you're me.

00:54:00.782 --> 00:54:01.719
ALAN SEALES: Question.

00:54:01.719 --> 00:54:02.260
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.051
Saw the show twice.

00:54:03.051 --> 00:54:04.750
It was just completely amazing.

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.900
I'm curious about the
evolution of the show.

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.820
This is obviously a
very polished show

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.780
after all this time, but are
their elements that are still

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:15.310
being dropped or things that
just happen spontaneously

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:16.850
that then become
part of the show?

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:18.600
Could you comment a
little bit about that,

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.110
and maybe give us some stories
of things that didn't used to--

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:23.360
SALA IWAMATSU: We have one
line at the end of the show

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.020
that we will switch
out depending

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.880
on what's going on in world
news or politics and things

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.820
like that.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.780
The line used to be,
when it first started,

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.810
was George Bush is only for now.

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:39.330
So obviously, we
had to change that.

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.710
And we've tried other things.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.416
Now you have to come to the
show to see what we [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:44.416 --> 00:54:45.790
DANIELLE THOMAS:
And obviously we

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:47.950
made a few changes
when Gary Coleman died.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:50.130
So we just switched a
couple of lines, but.

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:50.600
VERONICA KUEHN: Yeah, I think--

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.310
NICHOLAS KOHN: And then-- yeah.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:51.690
VERONICA KUEHN: Sorry.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.900
I was going to say,
generally, most things-- I

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.070
mean, there's no major
changes that have been made.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.440
But as new cast
members come in, they

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.830
are pretty great about allowing
your own personal choices

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:06.030
as an actor to change and
shape the scene-- different

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:10.664
beats that you would take
that are pretty flexible.

00:55:10.664 --> 00:55:12.580
JENNIFER BARNHART:
Generally speaking, though,

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:16.980
once the show is opened,
it's technically locked.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.235
And there-- because in
the preview process,

00:55:19.235 --> 00:55:20.360
it's changing all the time.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.818
Once opening night happens,
the show is technically locked.

00:55:22.818 --> 00:55:25.780
So for the first four years
that we were on Broadway,

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.930
the script was pretty
much exactly the same.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:31.610
Then after the Las Vegas company
opened and they made changes

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:33.890
to fit that space
and everything,

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.551
I think the creative team
just said, hey, you know what?

00:55:36.551 --> 00:55:38.550
Now we've had a chance
to revisit this material.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.008
We have some things
we like better.

00:55:40.008 --> 00:55:42.230
So we actually
re-teched the show

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:46.460
and incorporated 53 changes
from the Las Vegas show.

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:51.790
We had new lighting, new
orchestrations, new lines--

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:53.495
but that's rare.

00:55:53.495 --> 00:55:55.870
And from that standpoint, that
doesn't happen very often.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:58.460
But within the confines of
the show, as Veronica said,

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:01.810
there is some play.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:03.880
SALA IWAMATSU: There's
one song called "Mix Tape"

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.210
where Princeton makes
a mix tape for Kate.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.770
And it used to be a cassette.

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.770
But now it's a decade later,
so-- it probably shouldn't even

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:12.440
be a CD anymore.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.690
VERONICA KUEHN: It should be--

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.850
SALA IWAMATSU: It's
a little behind,

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:19.434
but that's the closest
they could get.

00:56:19.434 --> 00:56:21.683
NICHOLAS KOHN: And especially
with long-running shows,

00:56:21.683 --> 00:56:23.460
there's definitely
going to be-- if you're

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.870
in a long-running show, you want
to find new ways to explore,

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:31.700
and find new laughs
and new moments.

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.320
I think it's inevitable with
long-running shows that we have

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.640
to find some way to keep
it fresh and keep it moving

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.440
forward, and--

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.510
VERONICA KUEHN: We
will have rehearsals.

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:43.570
There are consistent
understudy rehearsals,

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.980
but also, our resident
director, John Tartaglia,

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.650
who originated the role
of Princeton and Rod,

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:50.670
will come in to sort
of do a brush-up,

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:52.880
and sort of work
on-- he'll take notes

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.242
at the show the night before.

00:56:54.242 --> 00:56:55.950
And if there's any
scenes that he's like,

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.200
this if falling a little flat.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.880
We're going to have
to work on this,

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.360
just tjuz it up a little
bit-- minor, minor changes,

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.174
mostly about us and acting
choices and stuff like that.

00:57:04.174 --> 00:57:06.090
NICHOLAS KOHN: A lot of
times, it's reminders.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:06.350
JED RESNICK:
VERONICA KUEHN: Yeah.

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:07.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.880
NICHOLAS KOHN: Just
like, remember,

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.100
this is what the scene is about.

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:09.360
VERONICA KUEHN: Right.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.943
Something we talked about a year
ago, let's re-implement that.

00:57:11.943 --> 00:57:13.750
NICHOLAS KOHN: Yeah.

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.760
JASON JACOBY: We usually
have some freedom when

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.259
a new second hander comes in,
or even a second hander that's

00:57:18.259 --> 00:57:23.590
been in for a while, if
things start to feel stale,

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.549
to think, oh, well,
let's try-- we

00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:26.840
could do this little move here.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.370
We could try this little move.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:32.360
And Johnny's been
very generous with me

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.790
about that, especially things
with the double live hands

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:40.500
puppets, because it's all
very set and choreographed.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.770
It's like a game of telephone.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:46.300
It's passed down from
20 Nicky/Trekkies ago,

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:51.770
and it doesn't necessarily fit
what I'm doing with the role.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.400
So Johnny's been very good
about, go look in the mirror

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.470
and go come up with
something else.

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:56.886
And next time I
come see the show,

00:57:56.886 --> 00:57:59.708
I'll let you know if it works
or if you have to go look

00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:01.100
in the mirror and come up
with something else again.

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:02.830
ALAN SEALES: All right,
so final question.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.121
AUDIENCE: Why did the Vegas
show have such a short run?

00:58:05.121 --> 00:58:06.730
Do you guys know?

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.960
NICHOLAS KOHN: There
was a couple reasons.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.380
I think it was initially--
we were selling actually

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:12.300
pretty well in Vegas.

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.980
It was hard for
them to figure out

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.600
how to market our show
in Vegas, specifically

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:21.746
because it was a New York-themed
show and things like that.

00:58:21.746 --> 00:58:23.370
And they had some
very creative things.

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:26.040
But it was one of those things
that-- Vegas is very transient

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.060
and there's a lot of
people coming in and out.

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.390
And most of the shows are
an hour and a half in Vegas.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:31.590
Ours was two hours.

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:33.640
And so we ended
up shortening it.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.820
And the other
thing is, I believe

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.089
Steve Wynn had already
put in play Spamalot

00:58:39.089 --> 00:58:40.130
to come into his theater.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:43.690
And so they had to get that
theater ready for Spamalot.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.870
And so we were there
for about nine months.

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.130
I think-- from what I
understand, we sold very well.

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:52.190
And the local people
in Vegas loved us.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:54.140
And they came to see
it multiple times.

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.600
And I think the theater was-- I
think it was like 1,200 seats.

00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.140
So it was a big
theater, and I'd like

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.349
to think our run in Vegas
was pretty successful, even

00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:05.348
though we were only there
for about nine months.

00:59:05.348 --> 00:59:07.050
I mean, to be honest,
to be an actor

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:11.360
and have a nine-month
job anywhere is amazing.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.990
And then all the perks we
had out there with housing

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:16.370
and-- we were
celebrities in Vegas.

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:19.040
Everywhere we went, we'd have
bottle service everywhere.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.915
And they'd be like, oh,
you're in "Avenue Q."

00:59:20.915 --> 00:59:21.999
Let's bring you over here.

00:59:21.999 --> 00:59:23.373
We want you to
meet these people.

00:59:23.373 --> 00:59:25.200
It was like living the
life of a celebrity.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.346
It was an amazing job.

00:59:28.346 --> 00:59:29.680
But it was a lot of fun.

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.510
And it brought me into
the "Avenue Q" family,

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:35.770
and I've been with it
almost ever since, so.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:39.360
Well, again, thank you guys
very much for coming out.

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:44.680
And that's it.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.540
That's a wrap.

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.080
NICHOLAS KOHN: Thank you.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.680
DANIELLE THOMAS: Thank you.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.530
VERONICA KUEHN:
Thanks for coming.
