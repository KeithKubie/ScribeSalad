00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.040
PETER GABRIEL: Hi there.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.080
INTERVIEWER: Peter
Gabriel, Google.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.966
Google, Peter Gabriel.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:28.070
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.830
INTERVIEWER: So this is another
Talks at Google event

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.330
from Mountain View, and we're
very, very pleased to welcome

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.880
musician, artist, and activist
Peter Gabriel here today.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.630
We are going to have a great
chance to ask some questions

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.080
about the current tour and the
25th anniversary of "So,"

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.530
which is going to be released,
actually, at the end of

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.240
October, on October 22.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.230
And we'll also some chance for
the audience to ask some

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.970
questions as well.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.250
So why don't we get started?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740
You're here on tour.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.760
You're kind of in the
middle of the tour.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.410
And what was the story
behind the tour?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410
How did it come to be?

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.410
PETER GABRIEL: Well, there
were a number of things.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.519
I mean, I've never really done
a retro tour before and was

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.769
pretty resistant.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.680
I know Robert Plant quite well,
and we were sort of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490
chiding each other on who was
going to succumb to the big

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.740
money first.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.060
And anyway, I went to see the
Beach Boys do "Pet Sounds,"

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.020
which I always used to love.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.780
And that convinced me that to
see one of the records that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.950
you enjoy from start to finish
was actually a good thing.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.000
And that coincided with some
nice offers, so that was an

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.920
easy decision.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.560
And I'm actually going to take
a sabbatical year this year

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.360
with my family.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.810
We've got a teacher coming
out with us.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.000
And so it helps underwrite that
sabbatical year as well.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.790
So there were a number
of reasons.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.750
But I decided to bring back
the band that originally

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.490
toured that record, and
so that's been fun.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.820
And we're actually having
a great time.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.520
We do the evening
in three parts.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.229
So the first part is based on
the idea that the process is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.020
often as interesting, if not
more interesting, than the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.920
final product.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.610
So we start off with an
unfinished song, and then we

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.240
do sort of rehearsal mode with
the house lights on.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.520
That's the starter.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.560
Then the main course is a few
songs, more electronic or

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.270
electric versions of things.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.110
And then the last chunk, if you
can get through all that,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.450
you get your dessert, which
is the "So" album.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.450
So that's how it works.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.515
INTERVIEWER: And specifically
about the "So" album, so

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:39.990
you're playing--

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.450
the actual tour is called
Back to Front.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.510
And that seems to be some of the
format you just discussed.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.540
But playing "So," the track
order that you have now, that

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.740
wasn't the original track
order, correct?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.830
PETER GABRIEL: Well, this is an
interesting diversion about

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.470
technology.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.310
Because although I'm a big fan
of vinyl, I was also a great

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.490
fan of the digital world because
suddenly, we could get

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.560
more dynamics in the music.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.450
And there were restrictions
in the vinyl world.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.540
For example, the track "In Your
Eyes," I always wanted to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.730
go at the end of the record,
but it has a

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.830
good bass line there.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.430
To get a fat bass line on a full
vinyl record, you can't

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.490
put it near the end.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.520
You have to have it nearer the
beginning, so it went on the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.680
start of side two, just because
there wasn't enough

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.140
room for the needle to vibrate
as it got close to the center.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.090
So then, when CDs came along, I
was able to take that track

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.860
and put it back on
the end where it

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.590
always should have been.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.690
INTERVIEWER: And on this release
that's coming up,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.680
there's a couple variations,
as I understand it.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.710
There's the CD itself.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.630
You're re-releasing and you've
remastered that.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.040
And that's a third time you've
remastered that.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.647
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah, as long
as people keep buying it,

00:04:02.647 --> 00:04:03.897
we'll remaster it.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.230
INTERVIEWER: And then there's
actually going to be a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.825
comprehensive box set that's
got both CDs, some material

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:14.260
that hasn't been released yet,
and also a DVD with some

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.540
concert footage.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.950
Have you been just
sitting on this?

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.850
This has been in the stores?

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.280
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.529
We'll throw any old
shit in there.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.470
INTERVIEWER: Hey, it
was old, get it in?

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.673
PETER GABRIEL: No, but there
were a couple of things that,

00:04:25.673 --> 00:04:28.576
yeah, we were waiting
for the right day.

00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:32.210
And the right day, you know, you
always get more interested

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.990
in the latest thing.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.815
So we'd sort of forgotten
about it.

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:37.850
But also, we'd shot the film--

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.960
filmed the show 25,
26 years ago.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.870
And Scorsese had been producing,
and he'd got this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.980
wonderful cinematographer
doing it.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.970
And we hadn't realized
quite what we had.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.120
So we went back to the film--

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.380
I mean, tons of film cans
that had to be carefully

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.220
resurrected.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.830
And then we took all the data
of the film and have a much

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.770
better resolution version of
that concept than we had done

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.280
previously.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.510
INTERVIEWER: And the actual
production of "So," and then

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.250
also some of the videos and
documenting that, over what

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.540
time period did that
actually happen?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.380
From when you thought about
the album that you did

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.760
originally to actually getting
it out the door?

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.930
PETER GABRIEL: Sorry,
this latest thing?

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.970
Or the original one.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.470
INTERVIEWER: The original one.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.510
PETER GABRIEL: I think that
just sort of happened as

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.900
things came up.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.130
There wasn't really a brilliant
master plan.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.800
It was when we finish
this, then what else

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.050
do we need to do?

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.510
And we try and film things.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.280
I mean, again, if you have the
opportunity to have two gigs

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.100
in the same place, then it makes
filming a lot easier,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.420
because you can do the set-up,
and all the mistakes you make

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.840
on first day, you can try
and sort out on the

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.250
second day of it.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.710
And we did that in
Greece as well.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.420
INTERVIEWER: So when you're
approaching songwriting, or

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.380
maybe at the time when you were
approaching songwriting

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.380
with regards to "So," did you
have a list of songs and then

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.290
say, OK, right, I'm going to
select these musicians to

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.950
start working with?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.230
Or were you writing and
recording at the same time?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.210
PETER GABRIEL: I'm always
writing lyrics until the day

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.700
it's released, really.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.980
But I'm slow with those.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.280
But yeah, there was
a few ideas.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.310
In fact, I'd forgotten this,
but Manu and Tony said that

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.280
"Sledgehammer" was
an afterthought.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.370
There was a taxi waiting to take
Manu back to Paris and we

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.740
had an hour left, and I think I
said, I've got this new idea

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.750
that maybe we could just
put a demo down on.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.230
And that was it.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.250
I mean, we carried on working on
it, because it felt great.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.690
But it was quite an
afterthought.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.460
INTERVIEWER: And then
"Sledgehammer" also took on a

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.770
life of its own when it came to
the video, which you worked

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.720
with Aardman on, and others.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.030
And my son, straightaway,
he's like, the chickens.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.262
That looks just like "Wallace
and Gromit."

00:07:13.262 --> 00:07:14.046
PETER GABRIEL: The chickens.

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:14.760
Yeah.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.620
INTERVIEWER: How did
that come to be?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.310
PETER GABRIEL: Well, actually,
it was-- yeah, the man who did

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.050
the chickens was the man who
created "Wallace and Gromit."

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.200
And I was working with this
brilliant director, Stephen R.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.030
Johnson, and he brought in the
Quay brothers, who have

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.930
fantastic, sort of dark, East
European-looking animation.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.720
And I saw they've now got a big
thing at MoMA in New York.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.590
And I brought in Aardman
Animation, who were from down

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.920
the road in Bristol.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.720
Stephen and I had a couple of
weeks just bashing through

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.230
ideas, and then we brought
in the others.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.820
And it was a really exciting,
creative brainstorming.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.300
And I mean, that's always been
one of the things I most enjoy

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.040
about what I do, is working
with people from different

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.970
backgrounds, often smarter than
I am, and just cooking

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.930
something up.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.550
So it was a great experience,
but quite painful, too,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.220
because we did everything
in the old-fashioned

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.790
way, frame by frame.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.270
So when you see a sky moving
across my face, that is being

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.770
painted frame by frame, and
the skin gets very raw.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:33.559
And when you're under glass with
a lot of raw fish on day

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.460
one, that's fine.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.310
But day two, it's--

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.900
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.150
At least you put the
blame on the fish.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.770
INTERVIEWER: And that video,
I think, is actually the

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.960
most-played video ever on MTV.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.770
I mean, granted they don't
play quite as many videos

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.150
these days.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.870
But still--

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.256
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:51.256 --> 00:08:52.380
PETER GABRIEL: Do
they play any?

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.580
Yeah.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.040
INTERVIEWER: That's a huge
accomplishment, and I think

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.780
that it also--

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.620
I mean, having been relatively
young at that age, it was so

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.790
different than most anything
that was out there.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.740
And it really set a standard
for also an experience that

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:14.190
was getting you into the mind
of the writer and the artist

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.790
in a different way, I think,
of seeing an entertainment

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.810
value that wasn't just for the
sake of entertainment but also

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.160
telling a story.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.280
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah, I think--

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.470
I mean, what was great about
videos then was that there

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.110
were people that wanted to watch
them, and there was a

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.560
budget, and there
were no rules.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.570
So you could do what the hell
you wanted, and there was no

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.650
one there to say, no, this
is the way we do it.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.940
INTERVIEWER: And when
you approach--

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.430
kind of back to songwriting,
I want to just ask.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.920
I think Mike Rutherford maybe
made the comment once that

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.720
you're a frustrated
drummer over time.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.340
And you started as a
drummer in school.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.540
Do you think you think
more rhythmically

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.425
originally about a song?

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:55.190
Or do you think more
melodically?

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.200
PETER GABRIEL: I think both.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.790
I mean, there are some
things which are

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.570
just based on melody.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.510
But groove is what drove
me into music.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.980
I thought drummers, they seem
to be in command of this

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.990
really loud thing.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.100
And it looks like
a lot of fun.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.560
And that's what I
wanted to be.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.750
I was very enthusiastic.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.500
Not very good.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.300
And it was fine in the early
days of Genesis, because we

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.100
had guys who weren't--

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.130
they were good, solid drummers,
but they weren't

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.110
that creative.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.180
And then when we got Phil,
unfortunately, he was a way

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.530
better drummer than I was.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.140
But I used to still have some
bits of my drum kit on stage,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.365
and I would find my bass
drum full of carpet.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.990
And gradually, these things
were getting reduced.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:56.880
So there was a subtle way of
saying that maybe I wasn't the

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.340
best timekeeper.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.540
However, I worked also--

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.970
I mean, being a major drum fan,
I worked with some of the

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.000
best drummers in the
world, I think.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.020
And one of those is Stewart
Copeland, who is also a lousy

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.270
timekeeper.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:15.370
But he's--

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.800
INTERVIEWER: Just don't tell
that to Stewart Copeland.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.920
PETER GABRIEL: No,
I've told him.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.060
He'll say it himself,
because he races.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.740
But by the energy he puts into
his drumming and the attack on

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.880
it is fantastic.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.450
And he does that brilliantly.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.630
INTERVIEWER: And on the album,
he played hi-hat on--

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.560
PETER GABRIEL: Well,
this is the thing.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.110
I had so many wonderful drummers
I could cut out bits

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.490
and pieces and get a bit of
hi-hat from Stewart, a kick

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:44.260
from Manu, and I mean, whatever
it was, it was just--

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.990
but I'm a bit obsessive, as
you might guess from this.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.555
You know, the groove
has to be right.

00:11:51.555 --> 00:11:55.420
And I think we worked quite hard
trying to find grooves

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.500
that aren't the regular ones
you're hearing on the radio.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.530
INTERVIEWER: And I think with
having this band back on stage

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.680
together, is there some kind
of moments where you look

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.444
around and it's deja vu?

00:12:07.444 --> 00:12:09.990
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:15.470
And we all look exactly the same
as we did 25 years ago.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.470
Well actually, a couple
of the guys do.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.670
I wish I could say that.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:27.640
But it's a bit like family
get-togethers, because you end

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.900
up with the same bunch of folk
doing exactly the same thing

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.490
that you always did, with all
the pleasures and problems

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.730
that went along the
first time.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.300
So it feels very familiar.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.390
But I'm enjoying it a lot.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.100
INTERVIEWER: And as far as the
way in which the songs of

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.880
evolve when you're on tour,
do you try out--

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.010
there's that section that's
defined as, let's play with

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.490
these more.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.930
But you also come back
and rearrange the

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.810
songs a little bit.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.700
Are they the same songs that you
start out at the beginning

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.500
of the tour when you
wind up at the end?

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.860
PETER GABRIEL: Well, we try and
get them right, you know?

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.040
So we are--

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.340
I mean, we're tweaking.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.760
Every sound check, we try and
find a few of the weaknesses

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.700
and nail them.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.040
And we never used to play all
those tracks together, partly

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.810
because two of them were
a bitch to get right.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.410
And we couldn't get
them working.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.690
So I think we're closing
in on them, anyway.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.370
But yeah, you do want
to keep changing it.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.280
However, I keep forgetting--
because we did start off

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.510
rehearsing some other
stuff as well.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:38.000
But now, once we've got things
beginning to feel like a real

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.720
show and working properly, then
when you do change the

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.530
numbers over, then it means also
you've got to reprogram

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.920
the lights and all that stuff.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.410
So I think we will be doing
that and getting some

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.130
flexibility, but gently.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:54.990
INTERVIEWER: And in
a tour like this--

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.620
I know that you've always put
a lot of energy and time to

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.330
make a concert just a full
experience, not just, OK, now

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.550
here's some nice lights and here
are the songs, hopefully

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.100
played the best they can be.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.140
But also the experience of
the songs, in a way.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.260
How much time does go into
actually prepping

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.560
for a tour like this?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.970
PETER GABRIEL: Well,
there's a fair bit.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.530
I mean, I've got some
very smart people.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.720
And in fact, there was an idea,
originally 25, 26 years

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.770
ago, when I was just doing
videos, and I saw the cameras

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.690
on these booms that were being
manually operated.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.710
And I thought the way they
moved was really cool.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.070
So we replaced the cameras
with lights.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.530
And now we've got lights
with little

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.060
cameras on them as well.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.060
But they're still manually
operated.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.190
And I'm working on another show
after this, which will be

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.340
more robotic, I think.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.470
But this one, I'm really
enjoying the sort of manual

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.510
element, which is, I think--

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:58.475
it feels quite futuristic and
retro simultaneously.

00:14:58.475 --> 00:15:00.640
INTERVIEWER: And speaking of
robots, you've always been, I

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.460
guess what in Silicon Valley
speak, would be an early

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.650
adopter of technology, and
released some CD-ROMs, and

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.530
you've been using, back to
drums, the first kind of

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.390
gated, or largely used
gated drum sounds,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.360
and things like that.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.080
Have you just always had a
fascination with technology?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.790
Or how do you use it to
stimulate creativity?

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.940
PETER GABRIEL: Well, my dad was
an inventor, an electrical

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.910
engineer, and designed, with
an Italian, a system--

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.470
it was a TV system called
Dial-a-Program.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:32.170
But in a way, it was home
shopping, electronic

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.100
democracy, entertainment on
demand, but it was 1971 and

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.780
accessed through the rotary
dial of a telephone.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.520
So he, I think, then tried
to sell it, and it was

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.260
a little too early.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:52.140
But I saw him passionate
about what technology

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.510
could do for people.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.360
And so I think that although I
don't have his skills, I have

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.510
his enthusiasm.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.400
So I still love to get involved
with all sorts of

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.120
techie things.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.760
INTERVIEWER: And I think I'll
open up for questions in a

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.290
sec, if people want
to line up.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.010
But around selecting musicians,
because you have

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.040
worked with so many, what's the
process whereby you kind

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.490
of discover or like
to collaborate?

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.430
Because spoiled for choice, you
could bring in all these

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.220
different folks as you develop
new music or go back

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.630
to visit old ones.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.020
It's probably tough to select.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.300
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah,
it's difficult.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:31.000
I mean, I think I like to have
a core, a family around me,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.280
because there's a shorthand.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.360
It's just more efficient.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.830
And if you want to get ideas,
and people know what it is you

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.200
like and what works and
what doesn't work,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.860
I think it's speed.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.940
I think the great giants of the
creative process that are

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.250
hardly ever acknowledged, which
I'm sure applies in your

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.000
world, are boredom
and fatigue.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.970
And they hover over
everything.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.710
And as soon as you get tired or
bored, the thing is dead.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:07.319
So it's trying to keep things
sparkly and crackling long

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:12.170
enough to support life
on their own.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.870
And that's, I think, best
achieved in my case with some

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.599
home team and some new,
exciting, inspiring guests.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:26.349
INTERVIEWER: So as far as
becoming more efficient and

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:32.120
creative, do you think you've
managed that over time?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.030
PETER GABRIEL: I'm not sure.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.350
I'm still terrible at getting
lyrics finished.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.170
I feel I can come up with some
musical ideas I'm happy with

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.460
fairly quickly.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.900
But lyrics, I have to go off,
isolate myself from my family.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.490
And I have a theory, which
probably-- a lot of smart

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.000
people here.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.980
Someone could tell me if there's
any substance in it.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.420
But peripheral visual
stimulation.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.430
In other words, if I
get on a train--

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.570
and I know a lot of other
creative folk who get a lot

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.600
more ideas on a train than they
do sitting at a desk.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.920
And I think that when you're in
a train or in a car, you've

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.670
got stuff coming past you.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.890
And in the old days, when we
were either chasing or being

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.880
chased, and there were a lot of
important things dependent

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.190
on it, like whether we survived
to tomorrow, the body

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.210
had some mechanism for
accelerating and pumping

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:35.060
adrenaline around when you get
this peripheral visual

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.430
acceleration or speed.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.250
So that's what I do
when I get stuck.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.570
I get on a train.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.350
And I've suggested that to quite
a few other folk who've

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.500
had some success with it.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.160
So anyway, that's my
offering for today.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.440
And we do have a sponsorship
from a train company.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.456
INTERVIEWER: I think
Caltrain's about

00:19:00.456 --> 00:19:01.706
to get a lot busier.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.880
AUDIENCE: Can you hear me?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.430
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.680
AUDIENCE: So I was lucky enough
to see your tour in

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.450
1986 when you did this
album the first time.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.870
Greatest tour of
my ever life--

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.630
PETER GABRIEL: Oh, thank you.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.120
AUDIENCE: Show of my life,
I've ever seen.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.180
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.020
And I was really excited when
you mentioned the lights on

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.760
the jib arm.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.740
That's like a visual memory that
stuck with me since then.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.230
PETER GABRIEL: Great.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.870
Well, we don't have--

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.460
I mean, we have one or two
overhead lights, but the

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:33.510
normal sort of proscenium arch
and so on, we've thrown away.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.420
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to ask
a couple of quick questions

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.800
about other things you might
have considered bringing back

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.800
to use again.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.330
The first-- and I'm probably
going to say his name wrong,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.315
but when I saw you, the opening
act was Youssou

00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:49.110
N'Dour, who sang on "In Your
Eyes." And he, of course, came

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.000
out and sang with you.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.560
Were you able to get him
to come out and tour

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.060
with you this time?

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.500
PETER GABRIEL: Sadly, he was--

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.370
they actually created a new
law in Senegal to stop him

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.570
becoming president.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.840
And he's now minister of
culture, because he's

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.540
like god out there.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.550
And so he's not really doing
much music at the moment.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.420
Besides which, he's a great and
celebrated artist in his

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.380
own right now, so the idea of
back-up on my tour, I'm sure--

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.940
PETER GABRIEL: But you know,
he's godfather to my son, and

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.270
I am to one of his, so we're
still very good friends.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.850
But he's an amazing artist.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:29.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.340
And the other is a little bit
more on the technology side,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.930
recreating the sounds.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.820
For example, did you have to
dig out your old Fairlight,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.360
and do the floppy disks
still work?

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.320
Or how do you do that to
recreate all those old sounds.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.230
PETER GABRIEL: I think
actually archiving--

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.460
yeah.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.410
Your history is your future.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.700
Because we were talking with
some of the Pixar folk, and

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.670
they were saying that they
couldn't play back some of the

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.020
files from the original
"Toy Story."

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.650
And it's a real issue, I think,
that there's some

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.530
consciousness of how we can
hold stuff in [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.830
I think they're taking digital
stuff and putting it on film,

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.520
so it's all back to front.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.360
And I mean, maybe some people
here have solved this, but I

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.400
think it's an issue that
needs careful thought.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.530
We did take some
of the sounds.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:27.120
But yeah, some of the floppies
weren't working, and we had

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.860
trouble looking for
DAT players.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.290
But yeah, there are one or two
people who've been smart

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.260
enough to try and hold onto bits
of historical technology

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.200
and try and keep it working so
that desperate people like

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.920
myself can be rescued.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.290
AUDIENCE: Hello, Mr. Gabriel.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.480
I'm a lifelong fan.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.260
And I hope you never stop making
music, and I hope you

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.525
always sing "Wallflower" in
every concert you do.

00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:00.560
PETER GABRIEL: Oh, thank you.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.892
I'm not playing it
tonight, but.

00:22:01.892 --> 00:22:03.660
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.710
Had to try.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.030
My question is a little
bit weird.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:12.340
In "Solsbury Hill," the last
verse is very, you saying

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.540
you're going to go home, and
that kind of closes the story

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.670
nicely and wraps up the song.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.750
PETER GABRIEL: Sorry, which?

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.240
AUDIENCE: "Solsbury."

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.480
PETER GABRIEL: "Solsbury,"
right, yeah.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.540
AUDIENCE: And so I'm wondering,
I'm curious why

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.590
when you sing it live sometimes,
oftentimes I've

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.170
heard you sing it, and the last
verse, you tend to sing

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.600
the original first part of
the verse, you know--

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.290
I'm just so nervous.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.300
I'm going to forget it.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.570
PETER GABRIEL: OK.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.620
AUDIENCE: But I'm just
wondering if it's--

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.300
PETER GABRIEL: Is this,
I screw up the lyrics?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.683
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:22:38.683 --> 00:22:41.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.770
AUDIENCE: Why do you screw up
the last verse of "Solsbury

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:44.458
Hill?"

00:22:44.458 --> 00:22:46.330
PETER GABRIEL: OK.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.780
It's because I screw up lyrics
on a regular basis.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.865
And I used to just read the
lips of the front row.

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:57.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.760
PETER GABRIEL: Which was fine
when they'd learned the

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.020
English version.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.206
And now, of course, we have
prompting screens which are

00:23:06.206 --> 00:23:07.590
for those senior moments.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.420
AUDIENCE: That was it.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:10.750
Thank you very much.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.820
PETER GABRIEL: Thank you.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.685
Of course, you've got to
be able to read them.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, Peter, I'm
a huge lifetime fan.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.020
All throughout my college days,
I had a huge poster of

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.340
you on my wall.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.190
PETER GABRIEL: We were
just good friends.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.290
AUDIENCE: So it's nice
to see you live.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.930
I also attended the '86 concert
and it was the best

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.730
concert of my life also.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:40.260
And I remember you walking
in that circular wheel.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.080
PETER GABRIEL: The hamster
cage, yeah.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.630
AUDIENCE: And just wondering
if there's going to be any

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.165
more things like that
at today's concert.

00:23:46.165 --> 00:23:48.840
PETER GABRIEL: It's pretty
simple, and it's just really

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.495
these old lights on the booms.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.970
This one was more about the
music and less about the

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.480
production.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.670
The next one I'm planning, it's
the other way around.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.680
But right now, that's
the focus.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.160
AUDIENCE: And the other question
I had was a while

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.340
back, Salman Ahmad from Junoon,
he was here at Google,

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.840
and he mentioned that you were
going to be doing a recording

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.320
together and doing maybe
some concerts.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.910
Is that in the plans?

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.085
PETER GABRIEL: He sent me some
stuff, which I'm still hoping

00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:25.290
that we can work on with
some Qawwali things.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:33.480
Because he was doing a fantastic
job singing with

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.710
some of the Qawwali stuff.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:39.240
And so I'm still hoping
something

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.620
will happen with that.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.620
With our record company, because
of the collapse of the

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.950
record business, we have to
get a sign-in from various

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.880
partners before we can proceed,
and we haven't had

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.850
that as yet.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.660
But I'm still hoping that we may
be able to get something

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.510
going there.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.670
He's an interesting musician.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.540
AUDIENCE: And the last question
I have is, will you

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.360
be doing any more world music
concerts and putting on--

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.070
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah,
we still--

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.350
we have our world music
festival, WOMAD.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:14.200
And that has just had its
30th anniversary.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.190
And it's done well, and we've
had it in 80 countries now.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.810
And we'd like to try bringing
it back over here.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.740
We were in--

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.160
I forget, I think '92--

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.770
Golden Gate Parkway, and then
we had a sort of future zone

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.590
area, which was a
techie thing.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.430
Because I'm still in love with
the idea of science and

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:43.500
technology and handmade and
traditional culture.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.740
And I hope we'll be able to
reintroduce that part of it

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.220
into the WOMAD festival.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:56.860
But it's still something that
we're trying to evolve.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.200
AUDIENCE: And I just wanted to
let you know that one of my

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.010
favorite songs from you that
puts shudders through me is a

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.790
that song called "Biko."

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.330
PETER GABRIEL: Oh,
right, yeah.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.990
Well, we'll be finishing
tonight with it.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.130
AUDIENCE: Mr. Gabriel, it is
an honor to have you here.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.120
PETER GABRIEL: Thank
you very much.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.970
AUDIENCE: So we wondered--

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.250
today that cell phones and
cameras are everywhere.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.480
We wondered if there has
been any follow-up

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.360
on the WITNESS project?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.250
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.570
And I think we've had some help
from google.org, and also

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.650
with the YouTube folk,
on getting a

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.650
human rights channel.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.850
Because before, the problem was,
I mean, we tried to do

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.960
our own human rights
destination

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.130
thing called The Hub.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:47.420
And the problem was that it was
doing its job well, which

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.050
was basically to provide more
security, anonymity, and

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:56.170
context around any bit
of video, but we

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.700
didn't have the eyeballs.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.800
And so YouTube clearly has lots
of eyeballs, so along

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.580
with Storyful, we're now
working on that.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.980
And I think we're just
beginning to see the

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.360
transformation that the
mobile phone is going

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.290
to have in our world.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.820
And it's absolutely huge.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.690
I'm really excited.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.450
I mean, you see what's happening
in the Middle East

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:27.090
or any area of protest, that
the young people protesting

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.760
don't feel isolated in a way
that they did before.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.070
National sovereignty, borders,
were very effective in the

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:39.120
past whenever those in power
wanted to shut down protest.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.110
And it doesn't work
in the same way.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.700
I mean, clearly technology can
be used for good or for bad.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:50.440
And it's a cat-and-mouse game,
and at the same time, in

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:56.500
providing for activism, for
health care, for education.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.190
And I mean, I got suckered
into a thing--

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.520
we have this Elders project,
which is former statesmen.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.490
In fact, I'll just lay
out the pitch.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.290
Because the way I see it, if you
have anything bad going on

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.090
in the world and then you can
map it, in the way that

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.370
Ushahidi has done, for instance,
that it will never

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:20.430
be forgotten.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:25.050
And then you can go and sort
of zoom into that and hear

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.380
personal stories and the voices
of those affected.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.820
So it's not being interpreted
by the outside, but they're

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.140
telling their own stories.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.910
And that's where YouTube Witness
and various others,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.440
Global Voices, all come in.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.030
Then you have sort of
campaign-building, and a

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:48.340
viral, is I think, probably the
most effective at that.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.370
If there are 15 million now,
there could be 150 million, or

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:55.010
numbers that politicians
can no longer ignore.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.920
And then the Elders, where
you can have high-level

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.900
interventions, so you go
straight to parliament, or

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.580
presidents, or whoever it is,
but connected to what's

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.900
happening on the ground.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:12.290
Then you start to see this whole
other infrastructure

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:18.470
forming that is based around the
mobile phone that I really

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.260
think can transform the world.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.020
And just from the health care
side, we're seeing some of

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.310
these, like the Tricorder Prize,
a where I think 20

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.645
parameters--

00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:35.660
the tricorder, for those who
didn't watch "Star Trek," was

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.770
the device that you could wave
over someone and it would give

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.170
you everything that was good and
bad about what was going

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:42.740
on in their body.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.720
And we are going to be
completely unable to provide

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.030
high-tech health care
for the world,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.410
except through the mobile.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.400
And there are all these
wonderful things coming along.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.550
But as a scanner, I think the
Tricorder Prize is going to go

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.830
within the next 18 months, two
years, and that can read these

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.490
parameters better.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.715
I mean, we have things
that already--

00:30:07.715 --> 00:30:12.200
I saw this scanner that went
into the blood, looked at the

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.480
cartinoids, gave you reading.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.120
So it could tell you,
you know, two

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.630
doughnuts in, you're [WHISTLE].

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.390
Three days of healthy
eating, and you're

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:21.020
back up to your level.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:27.640
But suddenly, you've then got
competitive feedback and group

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.930
psychology on keeping us well.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.280
And anyway, I go on for a long
time on this stuff because I

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.880
am so excited by it.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:42.780
And I know all of you guys are
working on these things.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.070
And I think it's completely up
to us, whether it's used

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.490
positively or negatively.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:55.340
While I'm on one, data I think
is going to be a huge area.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:01.100
And I know this is potentially
contentious, but I think we

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:06.290
have, or should have, legal
right to own or co-own any

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:09.620
data that we generate
in a digital world.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.140
And that's something that I
hope the Elders will be

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.840
campaigning for along with
a lot of other people.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.500
Because clearly, that has
real commercial value.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:30.180
But when we are allowed to touch
and own or co-own that,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.090
I think that will be a sort of
self-regulating mechanism

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.930
which is fundamental
to the evolution

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.910
of the digital world.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.640
INTERVIEWER: And the Elders,
just for context, is a group

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.040
of senior leaders
and luminaries--

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.810
Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu--

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.650
PETER GABRIEL: Kofi Annan, Mary
Robinson, Ela Bhatt--

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.720
I mean, they're extraordinary
people.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.800
And it was the idea of just
trying to get a group of--

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.880
there's 10 of them at the
moment, but the idea is there

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.760
should be 12--

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.400
we got Mandela to found
it originally.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.820
And they can make
interventions.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.190
But I think our dream,
or my dream--

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.460
I think some of the Elders'
dream, too-- is that when that

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.900
then can be connected to these
movements that grow up from

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.860
the ground, that can give voice
to the voiceless, et

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:22.420
cetera, that it can be part of a
new mechanism for balancing.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.470
AUDIENCE: And I have a--

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.400
PETER GABRIEL: Sorry,
yeah, you didn't

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.650
expect all that shit.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.230
AUDIENCE: I have a message from
a very good, dear friend

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.900
of mine who actually introduced
me to your music,

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.002
that he misses the transparent
bulls and feathers.

00:32:37.002 --> 00:32:38.480
PETER GABRIEL: The feathers?

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.210
I don't remember the feathers.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.400
But the transparent bulls--

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.600
well, I won't take my
trousers off now.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.830
AUDIENCE: Hello, Mr. Gabriel.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:50.470
PETER GABRIEL: Hi.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.990
AUDIENCE: This is the coolest
thing ever, incidentally,

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.300
talking to you like this.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:54.840
PETER GABRIEL: Thank you.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.010
AUDIENCE: Me my friends went
to your '86 concert.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.260
We're all going again tonight.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.650
It'll be a lot of fun.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.740
You talked earlier about
revisiting old stuff.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.810
Any chance we'll hear
from Rael again?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.260
PETER GABRIEL: Well, there was
an illustrator I met in

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.980
Chicago who's sort of working on
something-- and one or two

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.190
people ask about film stuff.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:23.300
And I think if some serious
steam got underway with "Lamb"

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:28.050
as a film project, then I
think that might sort of

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.460
regurgitate some of
the rest of it.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.290
AUDIENCE: Because you have to
know that that was totally

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:33.930
groundbreaking.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.720
It's one of my favorite pieces
of music of all time.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.205
PETER GABRIEL: Thank you.

00:33:37.205 --> 00:33:37.480
Thank you very much.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for doing this.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.020
PETER GABRIEL: OK.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.970
You're welcome.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:40.950
AUDIENCE: I'm a big fan.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.290
PETER GABRIEL: Great.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.370
Thank you.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.920
AUDIENCE: Particularly going
back to Genesis, "Selling

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.850
England by the Pound,"
one of my favorite

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.870
albums of all time.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.570
My question, many, many years
ago, I guess maybe around the

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.760
time of "So," I had a friend who
was writing music, and he

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.040
was a big fan of
yours as well.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.403
And he was all, Peter Gabriel's
playing in town.

00:34:04.403 --> 00:34:06.855
Think I'm going to go to the
concert and see if I can catch

00:34:06.855 --> 00:34:11.179
him afterwards and shoot him a
tape, and maybe he'll hear it

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:11.790
and really like it.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:15.449
And maybe we'll work together.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.940
And I'm all, uh, yeah, I'm not
sure that's going to happen.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.389
But--

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.400
INTERVIEWER: We'll take
the tape right now--

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.270
AUDIENCE: I wondered if--

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:27.690
I wondered, did you
get the tape?

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.699
And if so, what did
you think of it?

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:31.179
PETER GABRIEL: Well--

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.670
AUDIENCE: Seriously,
though, I mean--

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.510
PETER GABRIEL: Well, the entire
"So" album was actually

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.760
a ripoff of that tape.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.480
AUDIENCE: But it's always
made me very curious.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.690
You must get inundated with
this kind of stuff.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:50.060
And I'm curious how much you
get, what you do with it, how

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.330
you deal with it, and if
anything interesting has ever

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.190
come out of these
kind of things.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.760
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah, we still
do get a lot of stuff.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.150
I used to worry a lot about
it, and I'm afraid I

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.570
don't so much now.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:09.470
And there's a lot more than we
could ever listen to, so we've

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.800
got our record company to.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.010
So they do some listening.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:16.200
And we have, I think
Hukwe Zawose was--

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.710
has sadly passed, but he's
an amazing singer.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.140
I think that fell through the
letterbox at one point.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.510
So some things have just come
in out of the blue, but it's

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:32.030
more often through
personal contact.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.295
INTERVIEWER: And I have to
confess, Jerry Marotta, who

00:35:34.295 --> 00:35:37.095
played on "So," drums as
well, I met once--

00:35:37.095 --> 00:35:37.900
I used to play in a band.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.281
I was kind of a drummer, more
of a controlled flailer.

00:35:41.281 --> 00:35:43.590
But I actually gave
him a tape.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.000
PETER GABRIEL: Oh, you did?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.220
INTERVIEWER: And so I'd also
like to have some credit.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.720
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.050
Unfortunately, I wasn't alive
for the '86 show.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:01.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.410
PETER GABRIEL: I was
going to say--

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.740
INTERVIEWER: We won't hold
that against you.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.700
PETER GABRIEL: I was going to
say, that makes two of us.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.845
AUDIENCE: Anyways, I really
enjoy Real World Records and

00:36:10.845 --> 00:36:12.450
the remix contest you did.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.450
And your CD is obviously
amazing.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.620
I'm just curious what advice
you'd give to young producers

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.610
and mixing engineers who are
trying to make it in today's

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:24.000
world, where it seems like
credits aren't really a thing

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.730
in the digital world.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.570
Like you download an MP3, and
you can't look at a liner

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.520
note, right?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.770
PETER GABRIEL: Right.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.240
AUDIENCE: So how do you
feel about that?

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.060
And are you behind, like, the
Grammy petition that's

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.350
currently going on to get
these music services to

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.650
include liner notes,
et cetera?

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.160
PETER GABRIEL: I didn't actually
know about it, but I

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.850
think I would be, because I
think people work their asses

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:42.620
off sometimes.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.570
And there should be a way that
you can drill down and find

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.480
out everything about anything.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.626
So I would support that.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:52.060
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.820
Thanks.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.850
AUDIENCE: Peter, thanks
for coming to Google.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.200
PETER GABRIEL: You're welcome.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.290
AUDIENCE: You discovered a lot
of raw talent, music talent,

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.870
like Nusrat, from the
subcontinent.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:09.600
I wanted to know how you got to
discover all those things,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.400
and are you doing any other
projects with any of the

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.320
subcontinent singers
or musicians?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.930
PETER GABRIEL: Well, I would
never call Nusrat raw.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.380
He was a master, certainly,
when we met him.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:29.640
And for those of you who don't
know him, he's like Pavarotti

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.480
from Pakistan, but in Qawwali.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.850
And it was actually Pete
Townsend from The Who that

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.430
told me about Qawwali.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:37.830
I didn't really know
much about it.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:43.260
When we were, in 1980, trying to
put WOMAD, this world music

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.820
festival, together, he said,
you should check that out.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.220
And the first group we
had in was a group

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.370
called Sabri Brothers.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:57.900
And they were great, but they
introduced us to others.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:03.690
And Nusrat was the
most revered.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.822
And we put him with
Massive Attack.

00:38:07.822 --> 00:38:13.600
There's one little byline here,
but we had a thing where

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.670
we deliberately excluded the
artists' own country or

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:22.350
geographical region from our
record contract, because very

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:25.930
often, artists would survive
selling their records with

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.740
their own cassette tapes.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:32.700
When Massive Attack did "Mustt
Mustt" with Nusrat, I think it

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:37.510
was the biggest single in India
or the subcontinent.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.910
And of course, we didn't benefit
from that at all,

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.670
which did make us think,
scratch our heads.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:48.910
But he was such an amazing
artist to work with, I think

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:52.730
probably the finest singer I've
ever worked with, in that

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.230
he not only had this
passionate voice,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.580
but he could improvise.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:03.530
And it was like composition on
the spot in an extraordinarily

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.740
powerful way.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.540
So yeah.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:12.590
With WOMAD, we have a lot of
artists from the subcontinent,

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:16.250
and I think we'll still
continue doing that.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.780
I'm not sure what there
is right now.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.220
INTERVIEWER: I think we've got
time for one more question.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.975
PETER GABRIEL: I'm happy to
do two, as we've got two.

00:39:24.975 --> 00:39:26.225
INTERVIEWER: OK.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.650
I guess my anecdote of
superfanhood is my LPs in my

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.710
bag here that I retain, two of
which are both your works.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.910
Every other one I've
gotten rid of.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.810
And I've had them since
I was a kid.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:43.990
I was at your '86 show.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.120
And I'm here to express my
gratitude for your grace and

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.300
humanity with how you've used
your celebrity status over the

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:57.300
years, and for the decades of
positive introspection that

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.770
your poetry has helped
me with.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.580
So thank you for being here.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.534
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:40:01.534 --> 00:40:02.488
Thank you.

00:40:02.488 --> 00:40:09.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.020
AUDIENCE: It seems like after
that question, we should

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:11.810
probably just close it.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.260
But since you're here and you've
been so gracious, I was

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.190
wondering if you could talk
about "In Your Eyes" and what

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.860
that song means,
and writing it.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.820
It's one of my favorite
songs, but I'd like to

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.490
hear more about it.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.130
PETER GABRIEL: Well, I guess
it was a love song.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:31.630
But what I was interested in,
too, was I had a place in

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.290
Senegal for a while, and I was
fascinated that in Africa you

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:41.900
could have love songs that could
be interpreted two ways.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:47.460
So it could be human physical
love, or it could be spiritual

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.760
love for God.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:56.340
And in my world, the church
thing and the physical,

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.170
romantic thing were
miles apart.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.090
So that was a starting point
for trying to sort of

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.765
integrate some of the
lyrical ideas.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:13.450
And then I think it was
immortalized when John Cusack

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:20.830
held up the boombox, which was
later, I think, repeated with

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.980
"Shock the Monkey,"
playing on--

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.940
now here's, I'm going to--

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.190
"South Park," thank you.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.210
If I can travel as a
group, then we can

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.460
share bits of my memory.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.780
AUDIENCE: Well, great,
thank you very much.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.030
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.790
And I was going to talk about
Youssou, too, because I think

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.400
he's this sort of divine
intervention at the end.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.640
Because his voice is just
straight out of heaven.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.850
AUDIENCE: So really, then,
it's about both?

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.960
It's about love of a
person and of God.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.230
PETER GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.450
I think it's just--

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.810
yeah.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.250
Just outpouring of love.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.356
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:42:01.356 --> 00:42:02.100
Well, thank you.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.050
Thanks a lot for coming.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.660
PETER GABRIEL: Sure.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.010
Thank you.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.840
INTERVIEWER: And I guess the
final question is, you're

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.020
going to be taking, at the end
of the concert tour, a year.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.700
And then do you have anything
that you can reveal, as far as

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.400
plans beyond that
or what's next?

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.970
PETER GABRIEL: Well, there still
is this quite a lot of

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.630
stuff in the writing can, and
there are a few projects that

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.740
I think I'll get back to
work in September.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:31.710
So I guess we'll
know more then.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.220
We're trying to get--

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.650
there's a thing called
Gabble, which is

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.930
sort of like a visual--

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.760
we're trying to do a visual
language for the net where it

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.990
turns words into pictures.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:49.445
And we're just starting
with that.

00:42:49.445 --> 00:42:51.780
And I'm sure I'll be hustling
for help later

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.660
on, so don't worry.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.670
INTERVIEWER: Have a wonderful
show tonight.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.810
Have a great rest of the tour
and a great sabbatical.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.760
And thanks so much for
coming by Google.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.742
PETER GABRIEL: Thanks.
