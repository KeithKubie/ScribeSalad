themselves but after using this for one
 

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.600
themselves but after using this for one
week you know one of the quotes they

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:15.610
week you know one of the quotes they
 

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.930
week you know one of the quotes they
said was you know one of the statistics

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:18.940
said was you know one of the statistics
 

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.540

that they really look at is that first
touch time statistic and they said you

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.280
touch time statistic and they said you
 

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.860
touch time statistic and they said you
know when this feature came through

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:25.870
know when this feature came through
 

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.590
know when this feature came through
their first touch time statistic for the

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600
their first touch time statistic for the
 

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.750
their first touch time statistic for the
initial week I was implemented was still

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760
initial week I was implemented was still
 

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.180

within their KPI which is less than 24

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:33.190
within their KPI which is less than 24
 

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.910
within their KPI which is less than 24
hours so they were able to handle I

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:35.920
hours so they were able to handle I
 

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.370
hours so they were able to handle I
guess all of their existing volume of

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:38.380
guess all of their existing volume of
 

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.170

a whole bunch of tools that are guys use
 

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.750
a whole bunch of tools that are guys use
to actually try and make some sense of

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760

if we jump to the developer console so

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960
if we jump to the developer console so
 

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.560

highlights which is really good to see
it gives you a quick sort of idea of

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120
it gives you a quick sort of idea of
 

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.500
it gives you a quick sort of idea of
what's going on with the app but the

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:00.510
what's going on with the app but the
 

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.960
what's going on with the app but the
thing that's more important for our guys

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:02.970
thing that's more important for our guys
 

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.060
thing that's more important for our guys
is the benchmarks because you know it

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.070
is the benchmarks because you know it
 

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.090
is the benchmarks because you know it
really just goes to show you which areas

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100
really just goes to show you which areas
 

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.160
really just goes to show you which areas
of your app you know I guess they're not

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.170
of your app you know I guess they're not
 

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.090
of your app you know I guess they're not
doing so favorably and as you can see

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:13.100
doing so favorably and as you can see
 

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.490
doing so favorably and as you can see
here stability is obviously you know one

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500
here stability is obviously you know one
 

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.630
here stability is obviously you know one
of the biggest factors and I guess the

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640
of the biggest factors and I guess the
 

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.370
of the biggest factors and I guess the
stats that the guy shared clearly shows

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380
stats that the guy shared clearly shows
 

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.580
stats that the guy shared clearly shows
that so I mean stability is one thing

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:22.590
that so I mean stability is one thing
 

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.110
that so I mean stability is one thing
but it's you know it's hard to figure

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120
but it's you know it's hard to figure
 

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.460
but it's you know it's hard to figure
out what it is exactly i mean you can

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:25.470
out what it is exactly i mean you can
 

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.930
out what it is exactly i mean you can
look at crash reports and various other

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940
look at crash reports and various other
 

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.690
look at crash reports and various other
things but this tool really allows you

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700
things but this tool really allows you
 

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.210
things but this tool really allows you
to drill down you know quite easily so

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220
to drill down you know quite easily so
 

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.780
to drill down you know quite easily so
we can look at obviously you know click

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:35.790
we can look at obviously you know click
 

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:40.460
we can look at obviously you know click
on stability and see and see the various

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:40.470
on stability and see and see the various
 

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.890
on stability and see and see the various
reviews that come through so there's a

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900
reviews that come through so there's a
 

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.690
reviews that come through so there's a
number of different reviews i think one

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700
number of different reviews i think one
 

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.550
number of different reviews i think one
of the things that I really like is the

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:46.560
of the things that I really like is the
 

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.340
of the things that I really like is the
fact that you can you never see filter

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.350
fact that you can you never see filter
 

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.080
fact that you can you never see filter
these and once again one of the go tues

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.090
these and once again one of the go tues
 

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.030
these and once again one of the go tues
is to look at the one star sort of

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.040
is to look at the one star sort of
 

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.940
is to look at the one star sort of
ratings so if you look here most of it

00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:58.950
ratings so if you look here most of it
 

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.780
ratings so if you look here most of it
will be based around various various

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:02.790
will be based around various various
 

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.730
will be based around various various
crash issues you can see our guys are

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740
crash issues you can see our guys are
 

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.750
crash issues you can see our guys are
actually replying to all of these

reviews so 17th of may I think that was
 

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.960
reviews so 17th of may I think that was
yesterday they're just going through and

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:11.970
yesterday they're just going through and
 

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.580
yesterday they're just going through and
they're responding to all of these so

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:13.590
they're responding to all of these so
 

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.770
they're responding to all of these so
most of these reviews are okay the thing

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:15.780
most of these reviews are okay the thing
 

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.250
most of these reviews are okay the thing
is buggy and that's that can only tell

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260
is buggy and that's that can only tell
 

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.410
is buggy and that's that can only tell
you so much so one of the other areas

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:21.420
you so much so one of the other areas
 

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.450
you so much so one of the other areas
that's really interesting is the topics

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460
that's really interesting is the topics
 

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.970
that's really interesting is the topics
that people are talking about and I know

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980
that people are talking about and I know
 

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.180
that people are talking about and I know
that with star skater in particular when

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.190
that with star skater in particular when
 

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.890
that with star skater in particular when
we released it one of the key issues

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900
we released it one of the key issues
 

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.630
we released it one of the key issues
that we had was around the controls and

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640
that we had was around the controls and
 

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.430
that we had was around the controls and
so you can see here that actually

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440
so you can see here that actually
 

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.350
so you can see here that actually
controls is the number one factor that's

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360
controls is the number one factor that's
 

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.690
controls is the number one factor that's
affecting our ratings so once again you

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:42.720
can jump in and
can have a look at control issues as

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:42.730
can have a look at control issues as
 

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.570
can have a look at control issues as
well so the filter that I put on is

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:45.580
well so the filter that I put on is
 

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.399
well so the filter that I put on is
already there the one star you can go

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:47.409
already there the one star you can go
 

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:48.570
already there the one star you can go
through and have a look at all of the

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:48.580
through and have a look at all of the
 

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.389
through and have a look at all of the
different issues that people are having

00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399
different issues that people are having
 

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:53.820
different issues that people are having
with controls and you know sometimes

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:53.830
with controls and you know sometimes
 

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.710
with controls and you know sometimes
people just say okay that control suck

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720
people just say okay that control suck
 

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.749
people just say okay that control suck
but other times you'll find some really

00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:57.759
but other times you'll find some really
 

00:26:57.759 --> 00:26:59.580
but other times you'll find some really
useful information in here as well and

00:26:59.580 --> 00:26:59.590
useful information in here as well and
 

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.249
useful information in here as well and
and it really allows our guys to hone in

00:27:02.249 --> 00:27:02.259
and it really allows our guys to hone in
 

00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:04.049
and it really allows our guys to hone in
on I guess the key things that are going

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:04.059
on I guess the key things that are going
 

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:06.779
on I guess the key things that are going
to impact on improving the reviews so

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:06.789
to impact on improving the reviews so
 

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:08.970
to impact on improving the reviews so
once again out we have internal tools

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:08.980
once again out we have internal tools
 

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.599
once again out we have internal tools
for this but you know these tools in the

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:12.609
for this but you know these tools in the
 

00:27:12.609 --> 00:27:13.950
for this but you know these tools in the
developer console just save us so much

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960
developer console just save us so much
 

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.109
developer console just save us so much
time and particularly for our larger

00:27:16.109 --> 00:27:16.119
time and particularly for our larger
 

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:17.430
time and particularly for our larger
games are there so many reviews it's

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440
games are there so many reviews it's
 

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.440
games are there so many reviews it's
really hard you know we don't have the

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:19.450
really hard you know we don't have the
 

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.379
really hard you know we don't have the
the I guess of machine learning to to

00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:22.389
the I guess of machine learning to to
 

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:24.119
the I guess of machine learning to to
process all of that information and give

00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:24.129
process all of that information and give
 

00:27:24.129 --> 00:27:26.549
process all of that information and give
us the key insights so it's a really

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559
us the key insights so it's a really
 

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:29.639
us the key insights so it's a really
good tool and and I think you know we'll

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:29.649
good tool and and I think you know we'll
 

00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:31.109
good tool and and I think you know we'll
see over the coming months how it just

00:27:31.109 --> 00:27:31.119
see over the coming months how it just
 

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:34.129
see over the coming months how it just
helps us reach our target at 4.5 stars

00:27:34.129 --> 00:27:34.139
helps us reach our target at 4.5 stars
 

00:27:34.139 --> 00:27:36.840
helps us reach our target at 4.5 stars
so okay the last tool that I wanted to

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:36.850
so okay the last tool that I wanted to
 

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:43.320
so okay the last tool that I wanted to
show you is the pre-launch report and we

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:43.330
show you is the pre-launch report and we
 

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.849
show you is the pre-launch report and we
have an internal QA team at half brick

00:27:44.849 --> 00:27:44.859
have an internal QA team at half brick
 

00:27:44.859 --> 00:27:46.649
have an internal QA team at half brick
and the way they work is they wait until

00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:46.659
and the way they work is they wait until
 

00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:49.349
and the way they work is they wait until
I guess a builder's been submitted or

00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:49.359
I guess a builder's been submitted or
 

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:52.289
I guess a builder's been submitted or
uploaded before they start testing and

00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:52.299
uploaded before they start testing and
 

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:54.149
uploaded before they start testing and
one of the first things that they do is

00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159
one of the first things that they do is
 

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:56.909
one of the first things that they do is
a smoke test and so we can't cover like

00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919
a smoke test and so we can't cover like
 

00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.759
a smoke test and so we can't cover like
10 devices you know within a within a

00:27:59.759 --> 00:27:59.769
10 devices you know within a within a
 

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:02.039
10 devices you know within a within a
short amount of time so this has been

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:02.049
short amount of time so this has been
 

00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:04.289
short amount of time so this has been
really really helpful for us so you can

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:04.299
really really helpful for us so you can
 

00:28:04.299 --> 00:28:05.970
really really helpful for us so you can
see here the latest build that they

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:05.980
see here the latest build that they
 

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.979
see here the latest build that they
uploaded of star skater had a problem on

00:28:10.979 --> 00:28:10.989
uploaded of star skater had a problem on
 

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.289
uploaded of star skater had a problem on
the you know Nexus 5 with Android

00:28:13.289 --> 00:28:13.299
the you know Nexus 5 with Android
 

00:28:13.299 --> 00:28:16.379
the you know Nexus 5 with Android
version 5.1 so Nexus 5 with Android

00:28:16.379 --> 00:28:16.389
version 5.1 so Nexus 5 with Android
 

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:19.499
version 5.1 so Nexus 5 with Android
version 4.2 was fine but obviously you

00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:19.509
version 4.2 was fine but obviously you
 

00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:21.539
version 4.2 was fine but obviously you
know the problem was with 5.1 so this

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:21.549
know the problem was with 5.1 so this
 

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:23.729
know the problem was with 5.1 so this
saves a lot of time our guys don't even

00:28:23.729 --> 00:28:23.739
saves a lot of time our guys don't even
 

00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:26.460
saves a lot of time our guys don't even
have to start queuing until they get a

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:26.470
have to start queuing until they get a
 

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.940
have to start queuing until they get a
bill that sort of passes you know passes

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:29.950
bill that sort of passes you know passes
 

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.659
bill that sort of passes you know passes
some of the key tests on these devices

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:32.669
some of the key tests on these devices
 

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:34.950
some of the key tests on these devices
so similarly similarly with the

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960
so similarly similarly with the
 

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.909
so similarly similarly with the
screenshots one of the other tools that

00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919
screenshots one of the other tools that
 

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:42.659
screenshots one of the other tools that
we really invested a lot into was how to

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:42.669
we really invested a lot into was how to
 

00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:44.279
we really invested a lot into was how to
go about supporting all the different

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:44.289
go about supporting all the different
 

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:46.680
go about supporting all the different
aspect ratios and form factors of

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:46.690
aspect ratios and form factors of
 

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.659
aspect ratios and form factors of
devices so might switch to another app

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:48.669
devices so might switch to another app
 

00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:52.010
devices so might switch to another app
here

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020
 
 

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.970
 
let's look at dan the Man which is still

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980
let's look at dan the Man which is still
 

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:02.210
let's look at dan the Man which is still
in soft launch so quickly jump to the

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220
in soft launch so quickly jump to the
 

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.730
in soft launch so quickly jump to the
pre-launch report so crashes no crashes

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:05.740
pre-launch report so crashes no crashes
 

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.350
pre-launch report so crashes no crashes
which is really good screenshots so we

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360
which is really good screenshots so we
 

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.270
which is really good screenshots so we
can have a look and see the various

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:12.280
can have a look and see the various
 

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.530
can have a look and see the various
screenshots and the different form

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:13.540
screenshots and the different form
 

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.520
screenshots and the different form
factors so you know obviously this is

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:17.530
factors so you know obviously this is
 

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.810
factors so you know obviously this is
something that you can mess up quite

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:18.820
something that you can mess up quite
 

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.970
something that you can mess up quite
easily I don't think we currently

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:20.980
easily I don't think we currently
 

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.120
easily I don't think we currently
support languages other than english at

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.130
support languages other than english at
 

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.370
support languages other than english at
this point so we're not really getting a

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.380
this point so we're not really getting a
 

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.110
this point so we're not really getting a
good read on that but we can see okay we

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120
good read on that but we can see okay we
 

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.030
good read on that but we can see okay we
can you know all the aspect ratios look

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.040
can you know all the aspect ratios look
 

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.710
can you know all the aspect ratios look
pretty good all the different form

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720
pretty good all the different form
 

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.750
pretty good all the different form
factors look pretty good so once again

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760
factors look pretty good so once again
 

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.909
factors look pretty good so once again
this sort of saves a lot of time and we

00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919
this sort of saves a lot of time and we
 

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:37.350
this sort of saves a lot of time and we
did build these tools internally but

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360
did build these tools internally but
 

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.500
did build these tools internally but
they're not integrated into I guess

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:40.510
they're not integrated into I guess
 

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.600
they're not integrated into I guess
everything around the developer console

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:42.610
everything around the developer console
 

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.909
everything around the developer console
so you know it's not as efficient for us

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919
so you know it's not as efficient for us
 

00:29:44.919 --> 00:29:50.010
so you know it's not as efficient for us
to use so the last thing and this one is

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.020
to use so the last thing and this one is
 

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.270
to use so the last thing and this one is
I guess really important for me because

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:54.280
I guess really important for me because
 

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.430
I guess really important for me because
we have our issues in the past with the

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440
we have our issues in the past with the
 

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.100
we have our issues in the past with the
security for some of our apps and and

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.110
security for some of our apps and and
 

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.200
security for some of our apps and and
typically these are some of our older

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.210
typically these are some of our older
 

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.750
typically these are some of our older
legacy apps which we released the last

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760
legacy apps which we released the last
 

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.909
legacy apps which we released the last
update months and months ago and now to

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919
update months and months ago and now to
 

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:07.289
update months and months ago and now to
come back and actually fix those

00:30:07.289 --> 00:30:07.299
come back and actually fix those
 

00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:09.870
come back and actually fix those
security issues is a real nightmare

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880
security issues is a real nightmare
 

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.220
security issues is a real nightmare
because you know the code base has

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:11.230
because you know the code base has
 

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.720
because you know the code base has
changed so much and you have to get the

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:12.730
changed so much and you have to get the
 

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.030
changed so much and you have to get the
thing rebuilding again so being able to

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:15.040
thing rebuilding again so being able to
 

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.000
thing rebuilding again so being able to
upload and get I guess a security scan

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.010
upload and get I guess a security scan
 

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.620
upload and get I guess a security scan
to say everything's okay is great

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:19.630
to say everything's okay is great
 

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.330
to say everything's okay is great
because you know if there is something

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:21.340
because you know if there is something
 

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.340
because you know if there is something
wrong you can fix it then and there and

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:23.350
wrong you can fix it then and there and
 

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.780
wrong you can fix it then and there and
not have to come back to it you know

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:24.790
not have to come back to it you know
 

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.090
not have to come back to it you know
months down the months down the road so

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.100
months down the months down the road so
 

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.890
