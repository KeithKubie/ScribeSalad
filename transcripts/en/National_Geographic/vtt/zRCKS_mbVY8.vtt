00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.840
- I was in Lagos,
Nigeria in 2014

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.341 align:start size:81% position:19%
when I heard about
five young men

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.809
in the north of the country

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.579 line:0%
who faced the death penalty
for committing gay acts.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.151 align:start position:0% line:0%
They were in the Sharia Law
controlled part of the country.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.385 line:0%
So I went up to see them.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:21.020
Fortunately by the
time I got up there,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.288
their case had been dismissed

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:24.290
and they were out of prison,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.859
but they were homeless
and they were very afraid

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.694 align:start size:84% position:16%
and meeting them was
really difficult.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.228
Eventually I convinced
them that it was safe

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:33.232
and they came to my hotel
to meet me and I you know,

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.467
heard each of their stories

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.903
and that's where
I met young Buje.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.274
So I was deeply moved by
these stories of survival

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.808
and that's when I started;

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.779 align:start size:97% position:3%
I left northern Nigeria and
started Where Love Is Illegal.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:50.616 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I documented these stories
of survival of you know,

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:51.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
people who had
survived persecution

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:52.886
from around the world,

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.586 align:start size:84% position:16%
people who have
survived imprisonment

00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:56.522
and violent attack,
and attempted murder,

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.791
and rape, people who
had been ostracized

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.226
by their family members,

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.460
who've fled their countries,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.030 align:start size:88% position:13%
who've done all they
can to hide who they are

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.300
because they were not considered

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.902
by their community as normal.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.770
I told the stories of
77 different people

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.441
from 16 different nationalities.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.209
Many of the people
I'd met were afraid

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.546
to have their stories told.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.779
This is Sally.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:24.116
She's afraid to show her
face because in Syria,

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:27.153
the so-called Islamic State

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.622 align:start size:84% position:16%
are hunting down gay
and trans people.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:33.259
They want her dead because
she identifies as a woman.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.762 align:start size:97% position:3%
The Islamic State don't
want you to hear her story.

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:39.365
And this J and Q from Uganda.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.366
They're hiding their faces

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.434
because they are
a lesbian couple

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.036
and they fear their community.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:47.973 align:start size:97% position:3%
Their community doesn't want
you to hear their story.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.809
And this is Yves from Cameroon,

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:51.377
and Yves is hiding
his face because

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.981
that country arrests more
gay men just for being gay

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
than any other country
in the continent.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.519 align:start size:97% position:3%
Those arresting and torturing
the gay men of Cameroon

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.389 align:start size:81% position:19%
do not want you
to hear his story.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.958
But the reason that
these people are here

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.226
on the screen behind me,

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.361
is that they want
their story heard.

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.230
And they shared it
because they hoped

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.166 align:start size:97% position:3%
that by doing so that their
situation might change

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:17.636
for themselves and
for people like them.

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:21.140
But for some of course,
a photo poses a risk.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.076
For some if they are identified,

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.411 align:start size:84% position:16%
they could face
further persecution

00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.815
or they could even be killed.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.151
But many of them wanted
to share their stories

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I was really
desperate to tell them.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.454
But the only way that was
going to be possible was

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:38.358 size:78% position:39%
if it was done
on their terms.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.161 align:start size:88% position:13%
When I met the young
men in northern Nigeria,

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.763
at the time I was Lagos, Nigeria

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.965
and I was shooting a story
for National Geographic,

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.102
and I was using a
large format camera

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.703
and a Polaroid type film.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.471 align:start size:97% position:3%
For those who are not familiar
with a large format camera

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.675
it's a big camera (chuckles),

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.844
and it has bellows at the
front and a glass plate

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:00.379 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you have to put
your head under a hood

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.683
to see everything upside
down around the wrong way.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.019 size:81% position:41%
It's not an easy process

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.919 align:start size:97% position:3%
but you know I was
photographing these portraits

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.087
with this Polaroid film

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I wanted to continue
it with this work.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.926
Initially, I thought I'd
continue with this work

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.361
because I'd you know,

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.296 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was an aesthetic decision;
I liked the look of it.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.098
But it actually took on a,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:22.368
I think an even more
important purpose.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.236 align:start size:94% position:6%
I gave each of the people
that I photographed

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.372 align:start size:84% position:16%
the option to
destroy the picture

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:30.109 align:start size:88% position:13%
if they felt that it
somehow endangered them.

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.712 align:start size:81% position:19%
So and I think
that that promise,

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.513
you know to hand
over the picture

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.415
and let them take
it and destroy it,

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:39.552
was a real aid in
building trust.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.353
But I didn't have
to destroy many

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.022 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that is that
because from the outset,

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:46.125
I adopted a new way of working.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.695 align:start size:94% position:6%
These photographs were
going to be a collaboration.

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:52.198
Initially that was a you know,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.735
it was the terms
of the agreement

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:59.772 align:start size:84% position:16%
was that I had to make
it, do it this way.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.607
But,

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.176 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's a very different
way of working

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.211 align:start position:0%
because usually as photographers
we like to control every,

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.412 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know we're kind of
control freaks,

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.081 align:start size:88% position:13%
we like to control every
aspect of the shoot.

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:11.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
But here I was
handing over control

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.752
to the subjects themselves

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.620 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I was allowing
them to choose

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.189
what they would wear,
how they would pose,

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.325
and how they would
express themselves.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.559
And of course,

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:24.163
how much of their face
they wanted to show.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:27.066
I also wanted them to
tell their own stories

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.600
and in their own words,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.504
so I asked each of them to
write their own testimony

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.772
which would accompany
their photographs,

00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:37.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
and when we share their
testimonies on the website,

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.146
we always quote
them absolutely, directly.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.249
And here for many of
them for the first time

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.519
they had control over
how they were seen

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.888
and how they were heard.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.690
But of course,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.291
handing over control meant

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:55.928
that there were sometimes
some unexpected results.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.963
I'll tell you the story about

00:04:57.963 --> 00:04:59.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
a young transgender
woman, Jessie.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:04.404 align:start size:94% position:6%
She lives in a Palestinian
refugee camp in Lebanon

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.439 align:start size:81% position:19%
and her young life
has been this,

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.542
one of extreme hardship.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.246
She's been bullied and
thrown out of school,

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.648
she has been raped
and most shockingly,

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.917
her brother and father,

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:20.119
in order to protect
the family honor,

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.290
have on several occasions
attempted to murder her.

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:30.596
Her story was this list
of horrendous abuses

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:33.566 align:start size:94% position:6%
and instinctively I wanted
to make a photograph

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.535
that reflected that story.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.769
But she didn't.

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:39.605
So,

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.207
we start the session

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.876
and I find a corner of a
room with some nice light

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.644 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I set up my
camera on the tripod

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.679
and you know, it's
this big camera,

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.982
and I wind up the bellows and
I put the lens on the front

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience chuckles)
and I have my,

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:55.321 align:start size:84% position:16%
my cassette film,
my shutter, my cape,

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:59.158
and I asked her to
come into the frame.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.526 align:start size:97% position:3%
And she covers her face
below these large dark eyes

00:06:01.526 --> 00:06:03.796 align:start size:88% position:13%
with a scarf in order
to protect her identity,

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.397
and she starts posing.

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:06.966
And she pushes out her buttock

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:08.734
and she tilts up her head,

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:13.372 align:start size:88% position:13%
and starts to seduce the
camera with her eyes.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.174
And I look through the frame

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:18.177 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I think, this is not
photograph I planned to take.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience laughs)
But,

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.981
but she is beautiful
in front of the camera

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.150
and strong, and empowered,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.685
and I had to remind myself

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.787 align:start size:94% position:6%
that you know I was having
to give over control,

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:33.192
I was to let her, allow
her to portray herself

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:34.693
as she would like.

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:37.430 align:start size:94% position:6%
So despite this photograph
not matching her story,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.332 align:start size:84% position:16%
I decided to take
the pictures anyway.

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:42.201
And afterwards we were talking

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.102
about her story some more

00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:46.571
and she continued to
explain the situation

00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:47.873
with her family and you know,

00:06:47.873 --> 00:06:51.310
she's daily at grave
risk of being murdered

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.113
by her own flesh and blood.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:56.415
And you know I listened
to her and I said look,

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.650
I understand that you
identify as a woman

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.554 align:start size:84% position:16%
but given the threats
that you face,

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:04.122 align:start size:94% position:6%
wouldn't it just be better
to pretend to be a boy?

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:05.357
And she looked up at me in shock

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:06.625
and she said, "I
was born this way

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.827
and I will die this way."

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:11.564 align:start size:84% position:16%
And in that moment,
I understood.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:16.469 align:start size:94% position:6%
Her gender identity is
fundamental to who she is.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.305 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've never had my
identity challenged.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.707
She's threatened everyday

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:24.744
because of how she
presents herself.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:25.877
With that statement,

00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:28.981
I understood Jessie's courage

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.482
and her strength,

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:33.085
and her photograph was perfect.

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:35.254
This is her story.

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.989
She sees herself

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:37.824
as a

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:41.427 align:start size:84% position:16%
beautiful young woman,
a sexy young woman,

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:44.897
and that is who she
wants you to see.

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:48.234
What happened to her,
is not who she is.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.236 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I have this
belief and that is

00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:53.272
that storytelling is fundamental

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.406
to the human experience;

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:55.841 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's how we communicate
with each other

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.578 align:start size:97% position:3%
and is even how we
communicate with ourselves.

00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:00.879
But of course the
types of stories

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.915
that we tell are
really important,

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.383 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there are
stories that connect

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:07.386 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there are
stories that divide.

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.121
And I think, you know
I have also this belief

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.289
that you know,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
to look for difference
in each other

00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:16.095
is a natural human instinct,

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:18.663 align:start size:81% position:19%
and that sometimes
for some of us

00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:21.066
in order to feel like we belong,

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:24.737
we sometimes also feel
this need to exclude.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.807
So I've been trying to
tell what I'm calling

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:29.642 align:start size:94% position:6%
authentic personal
stories which are stories

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:31.477 align:start size:84% position:16%
that come just as
much from the people

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:34.080
I'm photographing as
they do for myself

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.914
where their point of view,

00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:38.150
their voice, and their vision,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.420 align:start size:97% position:3%
is included in the
construction of the picture.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.689
So and I have this belief also

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.824 align:start size:84% position:16%
that these authentic
personal stories

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:47.659 align:start size:94% position:6%
have great power to
break down these barriers

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:50.729 align:start size:88% position:13%
that divide us; barriers
of race and religion,

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:54.599
and nationality, and
gender, and sexuality,

00:08:54.599 --> 00:08:57.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I really hope that
they help us to see

00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:59.237
the person and not just a label.

00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:01.040
And it's my hope that
in seeing the person

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.210 align:start size:84% position:16%
we can see you know,
what connects us.

00:09:05.677 --> 00:09:07.879
So I believe that we need
more stories that connect,

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
but this work actually
is a testament

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:14.854
to the destructive power of
the other kind of stories.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:18.524
Divisive stories allow
the casual discrimination

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.393
of LGBT people and
divisive stories

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:24.563
also allow for their
rape and their torture,

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:25.965
and their murder.

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:29.034
So what happens
when all there is

00:09:29.034 --> 00:09:31.136
is the voice of hate?

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:34.139
Bigotry thrives where
those discriminated

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:35.541
against are silenced,

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.176 align:start size:84% position:16%
where they are
disallowed the right

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.610
to tell their own stories,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.647
and this is repeated
time and time again

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:45.184
throughout history, with
every human rights issue.

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:48.153
Where Love is Illegal is made
to interrupt the narrative

00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:51.423
that to be LGBT is
an attack on society,

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:54.125
against nature, or
an insult to God.

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.962
It is made to amplify
the voices of survivors

00:09:56.962 --> 00:09:58.797
of discrimination,

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:00.833
and allow them to have
their stories heard,

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
stories that I
believe can connect

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:07.573
and stories that I believe
can help us to empathize.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.042 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I spent a year documenting
these stories of survival

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.677
and the next important
step was to make sure

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:13.178
that they were heard.

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:15.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
I wanted to reach the
widest audience possible

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.449 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I want that
audience to feel like

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:20.553
they could do more than
just read the story,

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:23.823
but they could be in
some way involved.

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:28.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I created some
social media accounts,

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.195
then I created a website,

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:32.497
and I started sharing
these stories online.

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:34.633 align:start size:84% position:16%
But then I also
invited other people

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:37.169
from the LGBT community
to share their own story,

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
so it wasn't just
about my photographs

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.705
or the stories that I recorded,

00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:42.841
but people from around the world

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.409
were able to use you know,

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:46.979
this platform that I'd created.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.015 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we started
getting stories from

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:51.550
coming from all over the place;

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.552
from Italy, from Israel,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.554
from Iran,

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.591
Venezuela, Australia,

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:02.695
United States, Jordan,

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:03.763
South Africa,

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:06.631
Kuwait,

00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:08.166
South Korea,

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.436
and many many other places.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.441 align:start size:88% position:13%
And the goal was to
create this global voice

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:19.078
of people who refused to
be silenced by bigotry.

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.746
Now these voices
I'm proud to say

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:25.216
you know have now reached
millions around the world.

00:11:25.216 --> 00:11:27.219
So many of the people that I met

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.219
while doing this work,

00:11:28.219 --> 00:11:31.189
spoke of how alone they felt.

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.258 align:start size:88% position:13%
How they grew up in
societies that told them

00:11:33.258 --> 00:11:36.128
that who they are is wrong.

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:39.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
And in these environments
where all one hears

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.432
is the voice of intolerance,

00:11:40.432 --> 00:11:42.368
many sadly believed it.

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:44.836
But as bandwidths
continue to grow

00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:46.304
and technology spreads,

00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:50.609 align:start size:94% position:6%
so does the voice of
these once hidden stories.

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.711
Social media,

00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:55.648
remarkably allows
people to connect,

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.285
in some cases, feel less alone.

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.553
And in this context,

00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:03.288 align:start size:81% position:19%
it really is
a remarkable tool

00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:06.291
because it's allowing
people who otherwise

00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:08.027
would struggle to be heard,

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:11.396 align:start size:81% position:19%
to have a platform
to have their,

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:12.398
to be heard.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:15.967
So in the first three months

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:19.605 align:start size:84% position:16%
we had 100,000
followers on Instagram

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.106
and the support was
really overwhelming,

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:24.275
and as a National Geographic
contributing photographer,

00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:26.712
I was able to post on
the National Geographic

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.680
Instagram site.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.148 align:start size:84% position:16%
So you know for
this picture alone,

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:32.751
we had 240,000 people like it.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.921
You know and given that
our goal was to amplify

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.724 align:start size:94% position:6%
the voices of those people
silenced by bigotry,

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:42.461
social media was really
giving us a helping hand.

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:44.129
But it wasn't just a,

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:47.065
you know online that we
were creating this work,

00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:51.303
we and sorry, it wasn't
just my photographs,

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:53.305
it was photographs
from other people

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.973
sharing their stories too.

00:12:54.973 --> 00:12:58.977
For as an example is CJ
who is here from the U.S.

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:02.047
CJ is from a Christian family.

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:04.550
She lives in a very
conservative area.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.521
CJ was drugged and gang
raped by four young men.

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:12.157 align:start size:84% position:16%
She was semi-conscious
during the rape

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:15.661
and remembers one of
them telling her that

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start size:94% position:6%
he was saving her from
burning eternally in hell.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.536
CJ is a lesbian.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:27.173
CJ told us that
you know she was,

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:31.877 align:start size:94% position:6%
it was very liberating
for her to share her story

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:35.247 align:start size:88% position:13%
but she also talked
about how she still felt

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.082
a deep level of shame.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start size:84% position:16%
We were flooded with
comments of love

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.087
and support for CJ,

00:13:43.087 --> 00:13:45.090
and many people including myself

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.491
and the volunteers at
Where Love Is Illegal,

00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:49.628
were deeply moved by her story.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:54.232 align:start size:97% position:3%
Again, social media was
allowing people to connect.

00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:56.301
But the impact is
not just online

00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:58.270
and we've been having
this work you know,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.173 align:start size:84% position:16%
going to traditional
media and into

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.711
exhibitions in many
different countries.

00:14:06.878 --> 00:14:08.146
And this is just a you know,

00:14:08.146 --> 00:14:09.981
the many different
ways and platforms

00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:12.651 align:start size:88% position:13%
that we are able to
have these voices heard,

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:15.654
including things like
doing talks like this.

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:17.856
But as I said earlier,

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:20.859
raising awareness is not enough.

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.260
So,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.595
with some volunteers,

00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:25.531 align:start size:97% position:3%
I created this
organization Witness Change

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.866
which is a 501(c)(3)

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:31.103 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you know, some
volunteers came forth,

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:34.540 align:start size:97% position:3%
some of them are here
tonight which is very nice,

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.107
and

00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:38.410
impact became a major driver

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.811
in the work that we do,

00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:41.079
and we keep asking ourselves

00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:44.148
where is the change
in what we're doing?

00:14:44.148 --> 00:14:45.717
How are we making a difference?

00:14:45.717 --> 00:14:46.985
And we wanted to make sure

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:48.654
that we were getting the
work in front of people

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:50.054
who could really
make a difference

00:14:50.054 --> 00:14:53.559
and giving them avenues
to make change happen.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.994
So, and that's what
we've been doing.

00:14:55.994 --> 00:14:58.830 align:start size:84% position:16%
So in every country
where I worked,

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.733 align:start size:88% position:13%
I would collaborate with
a small organization,

00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:02.967
grass roots organization,

00:15:02.967 --> 00:15:04.970
or a couple of people
who are working with

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.504
the LGBT community,

00:15:06.504 --> 00:15:08.506
and we thought okay if we
can help to support them,

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:11.209
some of them who are
very poorly resourced,

00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:12.844 align:start size:84% position:16%
that would be
making a difference.

00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:14.246
So we raise some money

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.381 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we supported an
organization in South Africa

00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:18.950
who are helping LGBT refugees,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.286
and we raised some money

00:15:21.286 --> 00:15:25.090 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we helped an
organization in Uganda

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are tackling
homophobic attitudes,

00:15:27.058 --> 00:15:28.894
and when the two young guys

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:30.829
who helped me in
northern Nigeria,

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.431
when they reached
out to me and said,

00:15:33.431 --> 00:15:36.234
"There's four young men
who have been arrested

00:15:36.234 --> 00:15:37.669
for committing gay acts

00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:39.004
and they are in prison,

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:41.140
and we don't have bail.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.075 align:start size:84% position:16%
We can't afford legal
representation."

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:47.779
So we turned to social
media and we posted this.

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:50.783
And within 24 hours
we raised the money

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.284
to get the bail,

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.419 align:start size:94% position:6%
and enough money to get
them legal representation.

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:55.653
So we got them out of prison

00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:59.525
and their lawyers got
the charges dropped.

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.092
So,

00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:02.194
you know Where Love Is Illegal

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.829
has not by any stretch,

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:05.964
changed the world
for LGBT people,

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:07.966
but for these four young men,

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:11.070 align:start size:84% position:16%
it really made a
world of difference.
