Joe:<i> My goal with this project</i>

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:05.905
<i> was to make five or ten
really beautiful pictures.</i>

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:09.376
<i>Essentially, giving a voice to
these animals, a visual voice.</i>

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.778
<i> And it was this
 picture right here</i>

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:15.615
<i>that I think, gets at the
essence of this migration.</i>

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.116
<i> She is on the move.</i>

Arthur: Yellowstone was created
144 years ago.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.227
And it was created, originally

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.564
<i>to protect these incredible
 geological wonders.</i>

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:36.302
<i>The geysers, the canyons,
the waterfalls, the hotsprings.</i>

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.072
But, since then we've
come to value Yellowstone

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:44.611
just as much for its
incredible ecology.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.046
<i> These large mammals,
 in particular</i>

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.515
<i> that roam wildly
 across the landscape.</i>

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.452
<i>They're now virtually synonymous
with the word, "Yellowstone".</i>

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:57.690
But, at the same time, a look
back at these ancient sites

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.226
in the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:04.930
suggests another
important untold story.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.700
And that's what we're here to
talk to you about tonight.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.871
Joe:<i> This right here is a
 drawing of an elk</i>

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.674
<i> made thousands of years
 ago by Native Americans</i>

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:17.043
at a site called Legend Rock

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:19.145
south of the town of
Cody, Wyoming.

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.147 line:0%
There's over 300
petroglyphs at this site.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:25.417 line:0%
And most of which are
the hoofed animals.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.988
The pronghorn, the elk,
the deer, the moose, the sheep.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.257
<i> And some of the tribes</i>

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.193
<i>didn't call it "Yellowstone",
 after the rocks.</i>

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:36.162
<i> They actually called it
 "Elk River"</i>

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.830
<i>after these hoofed animals.</i>

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.999
<i> They knew something
 that has taken us</i>

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.567
<i>a long time to figure out.</i>

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.536
<i>And it's these animals that</i>

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:48.374
<i>Arthur and I have been focusing
 on for about a decade.</i>

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.810
For me, this journey started
on the great plains

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780
in South Dakota where I grew up.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.782
<i> And it was those
 geese right there</i>

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.751
<i> that really piqued my
 interest in migration.</i>

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.053
Fast forward to my early 20s

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:04.256
there's a pronghorn migration
that had just been mapped.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:06.125
<i>There were over 400 pronghorn</i>

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.960
<i>that were moving about 100 miles</i>

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.730
<i>from the Upper Green River Basin
into Grand Teton National Park.</i>

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.232
<i>So of course, I was interested.</i>

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.200
I got on my computer
and Googled it.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.769
You know, pronghorn migration.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.237
I wanted to see what
it looked like.

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.140
Well, it hadn't
been photographed.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.142
So, I thought,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.779
"Wow, this is-- this might be
my chance to be a photographer.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.914
Or at least to act like
a photographer."

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:32.452
And I applied for a grant so I
could follow this migration.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.721
Make the first
photographs of it.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.824
And I was awarded $3,000
bucks and I was set. So...

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:40.626
( audience laughter )

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:43.262
So, for two years I lived
in the back of my pick up.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.733
<i>And my goal was to show the
beauty of this migration.</i>

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.402
<i>Show people what it looked like.</i>

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:51.971
<i> What it was like to be
 a migrating animal.</i>

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.140
<i> I started to get some of
 the first photographs</i>

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.642
<i> of pronghorn migration,
 showing them in places</i>

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:59.546
<i>where they can't see far,
where they can't run fast.</i>

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.814
<i> This picture right here,
 is from mid-January</i>

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.616
<i> and they were stopped
 by deep snow.</i>

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:07.953
And it was around this
time that I realized that

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:11.123
"Wow, if I'm there,
the pronghorn aren't.

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:13.726
And I need to start
using camera traps."

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.962
<i> And it was a way
 for me to document it</i>

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.764
<i> without disturbing them.</i>

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.298
<i> This migration corridor</i>

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:22.268
<i>there's evidence they've been
doing this for 6,000 years.</i>

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.537
<i>And I had to figure out exactly
the trails that they were using.</i>

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:27.039
<i>You know, down to a couple feet.</i>

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.742
<i> So, that was backpacking
 hundreds of miles</i>

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.311
<i>trying to figure out where I
was gonna put my camera traps.</i>

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.380
So, I spent most of my time

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.949
putting cameras at river
crossings and deep snow.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:37.750
That type of thing.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.319
<i> This is a pronghorn buck
 that didn't make it.</i>

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.688
<i> For me, migration
 equals wildness.</i>

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:44.857
<i> And I think this
 photograph gets at that.</i>

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.459
<i> My goal with this
 project was to make</i>

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.463
<i> five or ten really
 beautiful pictures.</i>

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:53.932
<i>Essentially, giving a voice to
these animals, a visual voice.</i>

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.467
<i> And over the course
 of those two years</i>

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.670
<i>I felt like I got that done.</i>

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.639
<i> And it was this
 picture right here</i>

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.373
<i> that really opened
 that up for me.</i>

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:04.143
<i> The shadow on the rock,
 the passing storm.</i>

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:07.580
<i>That entire two years was worth
this single moment in time.</i>

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.215
She is on the move.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.653
And so, during that two
years, I was realizing that

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.788
<i>we're having an impact and
this needs to be documented.</i>

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.024
<i>So, the housing developments,</i>

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.326
<i> the fences that are
 associated with them.</i>

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.961
<i> They'd burn up energy,</i>

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.563
<i>every time they have to cross
 something like a fence.</i>

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:25.931
<i>And some of them don't make it.</i>

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.834
<i>This fence has been retrofitted,
since that picture was made.</i>

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.905
<i>This is a famous place called
 Trapper's Point in 2008.</i>

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.808
And this is the most
dangerous place

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.110
along this pronghorn
migration corridor.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.279
<i> There's over a hundred
 collisions every year.</i>

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.515
<i>It's a dangerous place for
both, people and for wildlife.</i>

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:47.753
<i> But in 2012, the Wyoming
Department of Transportation</i>

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.889
<i>completed the first pronghorn
 wildlife overpass.</i>

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.691
<i> This group of
 pronghorn right here</i>

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.461
<i> is the first group
 to cross it in 2012.</i>

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.397
<i>You can see 120 pronghorn...</i>

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:03.136
( audience applause )

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.572
<i> And then you can see,
one Mule Deer right there</i>

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.140
<i>that thinks it's a pronghorn.</i>
( laughs )

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.175
( audience laughter )

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.778
And I'd like to think that
I had some small part

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:14.813
in getting that done.

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:18.017
And that's really when
I started to believe

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.353
in the power of
conservation photography.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.422
<i>And luckily, out of the blue,
I get a call from Hall Sawyer</i>

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:25.257
<i> who is a researcher.</i>

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:26.759
Who is the first guy to study

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.962
the pronghorn migration
corridor in the late 90s.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.363
And he called me up and said

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:34.366
<i>"Joe, I just made a discovery
 on these Mule Deer.</i>

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.702 line:0%
<i> I collared a small
 group of Mule Deer."</i>

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:39.372 line:0%
<i>He thought they were resident
 deer and to his surprise</i>

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.508
<i> they actually moved a
 150 miles to the north.</i>

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.243
Essentially linking
Southern Wyoming

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.611
to the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem.

00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:47.980
This is an incredible discovery.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.681
He said, "Why don't you come
back and photograph it?"

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:51.550
So I said, "Well, sure. The..."

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.418
( audience laughter )

00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:56.255
And the thing I realized
with these deer

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:59.258
is that the pronghorn was
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:02.061
There was so much more potential
in this world of migration.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.064
<i>Of course, it's longer than
 the pronghorn corridor.</i>

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:08.834
<i>So of course, they're crossing
highways, over 100 fences.</i>

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:10.937
<i>And some of them don't make it.</i>

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.104
<i>So, during that whole time</i>

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:16.042
I kept hearing about this guy
doing elk migration work

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.378
and studying elk and wolf
interaction up in Cody.

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:22.648
I heard that even the game
wardens in the Cody office

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.450
were calling him
the "Elk hippie".

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.953
( audience laughter )

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:30.389
<i> And out of the blue, he
 called me and he said</i>

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.358
"Hey Joe, do you want to do a
project on elk migration?"

00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:35.294
And it brought us to right here.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.364
( audience laughter )

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:41.133
Arthur: So, I'm sure most
of you know this.

00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:43.736
But, it doesn't take much in
Wyoming to get called a hippie.

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.105
( audience laughter )

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.741 line:0%
<i> I had never seen a
 wolf or an elk.</i>

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.908 line:0%
<i>When I started this work I--</i>

00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:52.444 line:0%
<i> actually took me a
 long time to admit that.</i>

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:55.381 line:0%
<i>'Cause, you know, showing up
in Cody, Wyoming and saying</i>

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:56.883 line:0%
<i> "I'm here to help with
 your wolves and elk</i>

00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:00.753 line:0%
but I've never seen them"
is... not a good thing.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:01.521
( audience laughter )

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:03.889
You tell them that
after you get the job.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:04.523
( audience laughter )

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.425
<i> And so,
one of the things I learned</i>

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.527
<i> is why these
 animals migrate.</i>

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.296
<i>This is a very important thing.</i>

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:13.198
Why do they migrate,
is to get fresh green grass.

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:16.869
Grass is hard to digest,
you want the fresh green stuff.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:19.504
And it stays green longer,
up in the high mountains.

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.508
And so, this is the
only chart you will see

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.476
in this entire talk.

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:26.612
But, it's a very important one.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:29.014 line:0%
<i>And what you're seeing on
 the bottom on the X-axis</i>

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:31.150 line:0%
<i> is the number of
 days those animals are</i>

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.185 line:0%
<i> off of the peak green.</i>

00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:36.055
<i> And so, as you go to the
left, they get to be fatter.</i>

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.624
<i> And there's a lot of
 fat involved here.</i>

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.359
<i>We're going from ten percent</i>

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:43.128
<i> all the way up to
 20 percent body fat.</i>

00:07:43.128 --> 00:07:44.396
One of the first things
to notice is

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.132
if they're resident and blue

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.201
if they don't migrate,
they don't get as fat.

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:51.970
If they're migratory,
they get fat.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.173
<i> And so,
 what does that fat mean?</i>

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:57.610
<i> It means calves,
 it means productivity.</i>

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.512
<i> This is what allows
 the wolf to recover</i>

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:01.680
<i>in the Greater Yellowstone.</i>

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.783
<i> This is what sustains
 that creature.</i>

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:08.821
<i> Allows us to sustain...
Recovery of grizzly bears.</i>

00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:12.758
<i>Wildlife watching and tourism,
these migratory ungulates</i>

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:16.929
<i>by sustaining all of this are
a huge part of that economy.</i>

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:19.398
<i>There is an enormous economy</i>

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.134
<i>for the communities outside
 the Greater Yellowstone.</i>

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.169
<i> When these animals are
 out there of hunting</i>

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.739
whether it be for
meat or for trophies.

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:29.141
And that feeds enormously

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:32.544
in tens and tens of
millions of dollars annually

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:34.212
into these communities.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:37.116
<i> So these migrations
 are really important.</i>

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:40.786
<i> And so, these barriers
that Joe introduced you to</i>

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.054
like these fences.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.822
These are things that

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:47.793
constrain the ability of these
animals to gain that fat.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.197
And so that made me
want to know about it.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.465
My equivalent of wanting
to Google the pronghorn

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:58.003
and not finding pictures,
was wanting to see a map of it.

00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:01.774
<i>And there wasn't one that
used the new technologies.</i>

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:06.344
<i>And so, my part of this work
was to set about doing that.</i>

00:09:06.611 --> 00:09:09.582
And so, we want to
show you the Cody herd

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.618
<i> and take you on that
 journey that we took</i>

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:16.322
<i> to understand and
 document this migration.</i>

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:19.725
<i> This is a population
 of about 6,000 elk.</i>

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.895
<i>When there is enormous groups,
 out on the foothills</i>

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.930
<i> and often on these
 private lands.</i>

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.033
<i>And these private lands are
managed for many different uses</i>

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:30.169
<i> as well as adjacent
 public lands.</i>

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.405
<i>And so, there are some conflicts
 here for these wildlife.</i>

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:37.843
<i>Whether it be, a risk of disease
that they pose to livestock</i>

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:41.213
<i>or developments like residential
 and energy developments</i>

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:44.050
<i>that impact the habitats of
 these wintering animals.</i>

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.820
Joe:<i> So, as we move from the
ranches up into the mountains</i>

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.488
<i>twelve thousand feet peaks</i>

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.891
<i> and these elk are going
 over the top of them.</i>

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:55.260
<i> So, my job is to show
 what that looks like.</i>

00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:58.063
<i>And so, here's one of our
 first flights, actually.</i>

00:09:58.063 --> 00:09:59.298
<i>This is from a helicopter</i>

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:03.669
<i> just showing how truly
 incredible these elk are</i>

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.204
<i> these mountain elk.</i>

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:08.573
Arthur:<i> This is at 11,500 feet</i>

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:11.310
<i> and you can see the lead
 cow in this group of 12</i>

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.279
<i>is trying to figure out where
 they took a wrong turn.</i>

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.048
( audience laughter )

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:18.717
Joe:<i> So, right here in the
middle, there's eight elk.</i>

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:21.320
<i> That just gives you
 an idea of the scale</i>

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.622
<i>of some of the mountains that
 these elk are going up.</i>

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:27.393
<i>So, my job is to get a camera
within two feet of those elk.</i>

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:30.096
<i> So here, we're gonna
 walk on that same path</i>

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:32.731
<i>and try to figure out where
 these trails really are.</i>

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:35.267
<i>As you can see in this video</i>

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:39.805
<i>there's actually a cut in the
rock that these elk have cut</i>

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.075
<i>over the thousands of years,
they've been on this trail.</i>

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.679
Arthur:<i> I work on these animals
 with these collars</i>

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.614
<i> from a distance...</i>

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:49.815
<i> ...a lot of the time,</i>

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:52.251
<i> and one of the things
 I wanted to do</i>

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:57.289
<i> just experience the
 same migration myself.</i>

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.024
<i>And so, that's what we did.</i>

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.528
Joe:<i> So, showing these elk on
these high mountain passes.</i>

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:05.931
<i> The only problem is,
 there's a lot of bears</i>

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.000
<i> on these high mountain
 passes as well.</i>

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.402
<i> So, a lot of my work
 was repairing cameras</i>

00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:13.605
<i>that were pushed down and
 demolished by bear cubs,</i>

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:14.740
<i> like these guys.</i>

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.776
<i> So, here's Arthur and
 I at that last spot.</i>

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:20.212
<i> elk calf that's only a
 couple of weeks old</i>

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:21.747
<i> and then she shows up.</i>

00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:27.385
( audience laughter )

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.453
( bear growling )

00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:29.989
Joe:<i> That's not a good thing.</i>

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.493
<i> But, with months of work</i>

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:36.361
<i> and years of work
 on this project</i>

00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:40.532
<i>I started to get some video
footage that actually captured</i>

00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:43.168
<i>you know, the numbers that
 these elk are moving in.</i>

00:11:43.168 --> 00:11:45.003
<i> I mean,
these are hundreds of elk</i>

00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:46.972
<i>moving over one pass together.</i>

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:49.074
<i>This is almost 12,000 feet.</i>

00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:52.311
So, as we move from
the mountain passes

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.612
down to the river crossing.

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.781
The south fork of
the Shoshone river.

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.983
It's a place I spent
a lot of time at.

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:00.586
This is a river that's raging
with snowmelt.

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:02.021
<i> Super cold water.</i>

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:06.692
( music )

00:12:42.494 --> 00:12:45.064
Arthur: So, the next part
of this migration,

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:46.565
the challenge is to get up

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:51.536
into the high country where
these elk spend the summer.

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:54.173
<i> And it's very distant
 and hard to get to</i>

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:57.642
<i> and so you cannot do
 this without people</i>

00:12:57.642 --> 00:13:00.179
<i> who know this
 landscape intimately</i>

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:03.381
<i> and have been in it
 since they were kids.</i>

00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:08.186
<i>This is the place where the
snow and the rain and the sun</i>

00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:12.323
<i>come together to make the grass
 that feeds this creature</i>

00:13:12.323 --> 00:13:14.292
<i>and feeds all this abundance.</i>

00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:15.794
<i>And so that's what we encounter</i>

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:18.296
<i>and spend time with up in
 that high country,</i>

00:13:18.296 --> 00:13:21.200
<i>is these great big summering
 groups of elk.</i>

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.437
What I set out to do in
the course of this work

00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:28.540
was to create this map,
a fuller picture

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.343
<i> of the elk migrations of
 the Greater Yellowstone.</i>

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.512
<i> And I want to show
 you a completed</i>

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:35.080
<i>product from that effort.</i>

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.583
<i>All these herds, making that
movement from winter ranges</i>

00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:42.755
<i>in outlying areas of the system
 up into the heart of it.</i>

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:48.594
So what I see here is the veins
and arteries of this landscape.

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:51.697
What you can imagine as you
think of these animals

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:55.300
moving in and out and in and
back out, year after year

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.236
is the pulse of this landscape.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.075
So, for me as a photographer,
how do you show that pulse

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:06.712
or that heartbeat of a
system in a photograph?

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:09.581
<i>I found this spot early in 2014.</i>

00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:12.417
<i> This like, ten foot by
 ten foot chunk of dirt</i>

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:13.652
<i> I knew all the elk
 cross through.</i>

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:19.591
And I worked it hard in
2014 and went back in 2015

00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:22.862
and was gifted with
an amazing picture.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:26.698
<i>And that one picture took
 375 miles on horseback</i>

00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:29.435
<i>two hundred and forty days that
that camera was out there.</i>

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:32.638
<i>And I got one split second,
 this picture right here</i>

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:35.140
that I think gets at the
essence of this migration.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.578
That calf is learning the
migration for the first time.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.146
It's only a couple
of weeks old and

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:42.681
I feel like this
picture is worth

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.450
this entire project for me.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.351
Yeah. So.

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:47.987
( audience applause )
