My name is Abhi and I just completed
the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.550
For a really long time I've been really
interested in medicine and its

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.000
intersection with technology, and that's
kind of always been my motivation to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.420
learn computer science. But after I
actually completed my undergrad

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
artificial intelligence course, I just
realized I was really interested in a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.050
lot of these problems. The Nanodegree
program actually allowed me to match a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.180
lot of the theory that I learned in
school with implementation. There are

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.420
very few places that you're gonna find
where there's so much support to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.640
actually help you grow as an individual
and to help you make the right career move.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.840
The Capstone Project was phenomenal,
predominantly because we actually got to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.100
use ROS. Being able to get exposure to
understanding ROS and all of its

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.739
capabilities was really exciting. In
addition to that, our team was

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.379
distributed across the globe. We had
someone from Germany, someone from

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.480
Singapore, someone from London, from the
East Coast and myself. I think what was

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.500
really fun for me was I was definitely
the junior-most individual on the team.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.180
Everyone on the team either had a Master's
or a PhD. But it was great because I had a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.299
huge opportunity to learn from them and
to just be able to bond with them and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.600
understand what their backgrounds were
as well.  It was really cool to just see that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750
so many people are trying to transition
into this industry after having years

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.590
and years of experience in another
industry, and that's a lot of motivation

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.369
for myself to be able to surround myself
with some really incredible, talented

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.150
engineers as well. There's just so many
different things I would love to work on,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.020
but I think the Nanodegree has really
helped me to realize that a lot of the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.110
things that I imagined as a kid can
start to become reality.
