BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.030
interesting developer community.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.100
has asked this question.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.820
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.801
answer show.

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.510
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.510
JENNY MURPHY: Hi everyone.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.970
Welcome to this week's session
of the Google+

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.830
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.000
Today, we're going to be
pretending that we're on Mars,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.900
and we're going to use the
opportunity to explore sharing

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.750
from Android applications.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.580
And before we dig into that
though, let me introduce

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.430
myself and those around
me, my co-hosts.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.380
I'm Jennifer Murphy.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.150
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer on the Google+

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.330
platform, which means I help you
build cool stuff with our

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.100
APIs, plug-ins, and
other things.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.240
And joining me today is Julia.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.770
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.410
I am Julia Ferraioli.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.030
I am a Developer Advocate
working mostly on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.800
mobile these days.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.690
And from behind the scenes until
this moment, Chirag is

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.990
also joining us.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.163
CHIRAG SHAH: I'm also
most a Developer

00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:13.810
Programs Engineer on mobile.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.290
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks, Chirag.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.190
You'll see his involvement
in a few minutes.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.170
So without further ado, what do
you have to show us, Julia?

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.020
JULIA FERRAIOLI: So with all
of the information going on

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.430
about Curiosity--

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460
and I'm not talking about the
one that killed the cat.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.780
I'm talking about the one
on Mars right now.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.520
We thought it would be neat to
build an application that let

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.960
Curiosity share to its other
rover friends from its

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.210
application to Google+.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.430
So we built an app that
lets it do that.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.300
We thought we'd let it
do a couple things.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.600
The first is simply sharing text
and some links to cool

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.520
images or Google+ pages.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.260
And the second is how it can
actually direct those

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.139
particular share Intents,
as we call

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.380
them, to Google+ itself.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.340
And the third is to let it
actually take pictures and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.563
share those pictures
into Google+.

00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:19.266
JENNY MURPHY: Sounds
really cool.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.160
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Yeah.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.490
OK, so should we look
at some of the code

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.280
that lets this happen?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.700
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.660
We love code here.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.390
JULIA FERRAIOLI: I know.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.470
OK, so the first thing
that you'll see on

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.930
my code screen here--

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.600
this is [? emac's ?], is this
import statement for importing

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.290
the ShareCompat class from the
Android support library.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.200
This is called ShareCompat.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.800
This lets you easily build
share Intents within your

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.310
application with pictures, text,
and additionally, to, in

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.500
Google+, have attribution back
to your application when the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.410
item is posted.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.760
So it's pretty cool.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.810
So here you'll see a standard
Android activity.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.440
We call it Curiosity activity.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.850
And down here, we have a one
particular function that

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.020
basically shares an image
from Curiosity.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.790
We have a couple of arrays of
strings in our resources files

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.510
that have links to images and
some fun pre-specified

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.250
comments that you'll see
a little bit later.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.940
So the first thing we're going
to do just to mix it up a

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.230
little bit is to select
a comment and

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.990
image at random here.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.120
So you can see that nice random
number generator.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.075
And then we're simply going to
use the intent builder inside

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:56.570
of ShareCompat to build
out our intent.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.290
So this is where we're
constructing our share intent.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.850
And we're simply going to take
that random comment and image

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.480
in the previous lines
and set the text to

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.330
that particular comment.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.500
So that will open up the share
dialogue with the text

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.220
pre-filled as you set it.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.960
Once we set the text type, in
here it's just plain text, and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.870
grab the intent from the share
intent builder, we can fire

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.610
off the intent.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.810
And we thought we'd
show you what that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.800
looks like in our app.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.955
So Chirag is going
to show you.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.640
And as you can see, the
application picker popped up.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.580
He selected Google+, and was
able to share an image that

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.490
popped up in the
bottom as well.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.000
OK, so the next thing we're
going to do is show you how

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.030
you can effectively direct the
share intent to a particular

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.980
application.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.670
In our case, we're going to
open up the Google+ app to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.220
handle the intent.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.700
So for that, we're just going
to share the Google+ page.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.770
So we're going to build the
same sort of share intent

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.240
using the intent builder
in ShareCompat.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.310
We're going to get a
string that says--

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.560
it talks about sharing
the Google+ page, the

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.590
NASA Google+ page.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.760
And then we're going to add in
this line down here, called

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.240
setPackage.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.790
And all we're doing is setting
it to the Google+ application

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.580
package on the Android phone.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.820
And this allows the share intent
to be directed towards

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.670
the Google+ app.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.360
So again, we're going
to start the intent.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.150
We're going to fire it off
and show you what that

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.400
looks like as well.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.750
So instead of going to the
application picker, the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.270
Google+ share dialogue opened
up with the text and link

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.310
pre-specified there.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.130
Now, you can also see that there
is a nice preview of the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.980
link included in the post.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.470
There's a little picture as
well as a description.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.760
And that is drawn out of the
link and into the post and

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.810
attached in a rich fashion.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.060
So once he sends it
off, it will be

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.930
shared into the stream.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.100
Now, if you're looking at my
stream or my posts, you'll see

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.300
that it also tells you that each
post came from Curiosity,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.750
I believe V1 and V2.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.190
OK, so the last thing--

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.050
I mean, we need to let Curiosity
take some pictures

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.690
and send them across to its
rover friends, right?

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.300
So we will take a photo.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.220
We'll let Curiosity take
a photo and share it.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.700
So here you see this method,
takeAndSharePhoto.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:52.370
We're simply going to let the
app use the camera on my phone

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.750
to take the photo.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.530
So we're going to open up
a camera intent here.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.870
We're going to tell it where
to store the file after it

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.240
takes the photo.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.310
And then instead of saying
startActivity, we're actually

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.980
going to use startActivity for
result so we can get the data

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.800
back from the camera.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.540
OK.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.880
So how do we actually construct
the intent?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.820
Well, if everything goes OK--

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.750
so Curiosity didn't cancel out
of the image or anything--

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.770
we're going to go ahead
and find the

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.180
file that was created.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.500
And then we're going to
essentially get the path to

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.600
the file and use it in
the share intent.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.100
We're also going to get a couple
comments to pre-fill

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.350
some text as well.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.080
So then, when we construct the
share intent, again, we're

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.040
going to use the same
intent builder.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.680
But you'll see a couple
extra things here.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.570
In addition to setting the text,
we're also going to set

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.920
the stream.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.680
And here it is.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.270
We're going to parse out the URI
to the file that we took.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.700
And we're going to set the type,
instead of being text

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.760
plain, we're going to set
it as an image jpeg.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.370
Now, you could capture other
types of media, such as

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.090
videos, and just set the type
appropriately, and that would

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.220
be shared into Google+
as well.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.350
So we're going to start it off
the same as we did before,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.250
setting the package and
starting the activity.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.850
Additionally, it's
good practice to

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.240
clean up after yourself.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.010
So we're going to delete
the temp file as well.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.090
If something should go wrong,
we're going to just let them

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.970
know that we had some trouble
connecting to Earth.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.630
And we'll try again
another time.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.070
So Chirag, do you want to show
us what that looks like?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.020
JENNY MURPHY: That's a beautiful
simulated martian

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.300
landscape we have there.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.985
Where did we gather
all that stuff?

00:09:57.985 --> 00:10:00.820
JULIA FERRAIOLI: It was a
combination of skill and

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.620
whatever was in the
cubes around us.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.360
JENNY MURPHY: I think I
recognize the sand from one of

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.640
the cafes nearby.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.040
JULIA FERRAIOLI: I think it's
completely plausible.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.990
JENNY MURPHY: I wonder
if they'll miss it.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.540
Hopefully not.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.160
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
Very life like.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.410
Mars like.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.250
So you can see the image
that Chirag captured--

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:27.010
or Curiosity, rather, captured
of the Martian landscape.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:32.840
And once he clicks OK or the
check mark, it will be added

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.400
to the post.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.360
And you can see a preview
attached to the post.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.500
So once he shares it, it'll be
shared in that nice rich

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.100
fashion that you see photos
being shared on Google+ today,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.750
nice and large, integrate
altogether, all around

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.330
experience.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:56.430
So that's how to share text,
links, and media from your

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.410
Android application.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.590
We think that Curiosity is going
to have a really good

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.210
time with this.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.850
JENNY MURPHY: Some pretty
cool stuff.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.840
So thanks a lot to Chirag for
filling in the role of

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.390
Curiosity on there.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.180
That was pretty cool.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.900
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Yes.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.800
How often can you say
you acted the

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.580
part of a Mars rover?

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.130
JENNY MURPHY: That's
very true.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.840
So does Curiosity actually
run Android OS?

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.800
JULIA FERRAIOLI: I don't know.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.670
I don't think so.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.280
But hopefully, maybe
in the future.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.730
JENNY MURPHY: It would
be pretty cool.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.690
Maybe a future rover will
be green to match.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.430
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Little Androids
hopping around.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.560
JENNY MURPHY: That would
be pretty cool.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.990
So this is an Office Hours show,
so all of you out there

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.240
who are watching in the live
stream, feel free to ask us

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.880
questions, either on the
YouTube live stream--

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.150
Everyone, you may have noticed
we just had a short blip.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.590
But we're back.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.860
And we're going to repeat the
questions in case they didn't

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.500
make it to your screens.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.690
So if you have any questions,
please feel free to ask them

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.090
either on the YouTube live
stream as a question, comment,

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.790
or on the Google+ event.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.660
So if you have something
in mind, please ask.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.230
So starting with Nicolette.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.710
Nicolette asks about all
the Google messaging

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.880
services on her phone.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.370
She has Google Voice, Google
Talk, Google+ Messenger.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.700
She likes them a lot.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.420
But she's a little confused
about so many of them, and she

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.660
wants them merged.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.160
This is a great question
or comment.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.580
And on this show, we usually
focus on the Google+ platform,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.330
which means building software
and applications that use

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.650
Google+ APIs and tools.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.330
So this isn't something we're a
great expert in, but we can

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.680
tell you how to get in touch
with the right experts.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.770
There's a send feedback tool
that you can access on

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.400
plus.google.com.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.560
You can also access it in your
mobile Google+ application.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.350
And that automatically routes
your feedback, like this, to

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.910
the right team so that the
right people can see it.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.930
I'll be sharing a link to
instructions on how to send

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.134
feedback in the show notes.

00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:01.565
So grabbing the next question.

00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:05.330
Oh yes, thanks very much
for that feedback.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.620
So Gerwin has a question.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.560
Gerwin heard about Google
Play services.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.600
It was announced at Google I/O.
It seems really cool.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.030
What is it, and when did
he start using it?

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.220
JULIA FERRAIOLI: So Google Play
services, which we did

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.330
announce at I/O, is
still coming soon.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.260
We're really excited to
get it out to you.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And as soon as is it's available
for you to start

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.130
developing with, we will
absolutely let you know.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.690
However, what we've presented
today was ShareCompat.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.740
That's available for you to
use basically right now.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.300
So I'd recommend going out,
getting the Support Library,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.050
and start developing and
incorporating that part into

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.556
your apps in the meanwhile.

00:13:49.556 --> 00:13:50.580
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.660
So keep an eye on our blog
and on our Google+ page.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.000
Whenever we announce something,
it shows up in both

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.270
those places.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.460
And you will know right when
everyone else does.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.280
Probably right when we do.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.975
So I'm going to poke around
for some more questions.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:15.540
And I don't actually see any
other questions out.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.020
development with
Google+ today.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.950
So thanks a lot to all of you
who asked questions, and

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.874
thanks for tuning in.

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:22.850
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Thanks.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.140
JENNY MURPHY: We're pretty much
wrapping it up for this

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.946
week's session of the Google+
platform Office Hours.

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:29.190
So remember, we have
them every week

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.510
with a different topic.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.005
And we love to field
your questions.

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:34.350
So always, always have them
ready and in mind.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.090
Thanks a lot.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.130
Bye, everyone.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.380
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Bye.
