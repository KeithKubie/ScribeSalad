00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.750
In figuring out which line should be in the final file,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.860
first we'll look at the lines that are the same in both versions.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.120
Line B is in both, so it should be on the final list.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.150
It may have been there at the beginning of the day and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.360
neither of them removed it.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.280
Or possibly both Jake and Rachel added it independently.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.900
Either way, we definitely want it.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.960
The same thing is true for D.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.020
Now let's look at some that are different.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.360
Rachel's file contains A, but Jake's file doesn't.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.560
There are a few different ways that this could have happened.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.330
Maybe the original file didn't contain A and Rachel added it.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.189
In that case, we do want A in the final version, but

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.230
it's also possible that the original line did contain A and Jake deleted it.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.990
In that case, the final version shouldn't contain A.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.780
It might seem like it would be safest to just include A since you can always

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.630
delete it later.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.515
But remember that these letters could be representing code, so

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.840
re-adding a deleted line could cause a bug.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.350
So, without anymore information, we can't really tell whether A should be in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.260
the final version or not, so we mark it as unknown.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.210
We can see that the same reasoning applies to C and the opposite is true for E.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.160
It's in Jake's file but

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.860
not Rachel's, meaning that either he added it or Rachel deleted it.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.209
Since we can't tell these apart,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.690
we don't know whether we should include it or not.
