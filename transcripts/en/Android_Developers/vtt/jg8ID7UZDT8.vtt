00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.180
&gt;&gt; MEIER: My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And today on the App Clinic we'll
be examining Shopping Lists.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Whoo-hoo.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.099
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You got to love that intro.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.529
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.429
Each week on the App Clinic we take a look
at apps within a particular category and we

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.480
give them a technical review.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Our focus we'll on helping developers
build better apps.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.840
So we're interspersing our commentary with
some technical advice including some code

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.840
snippets.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we hope that those of you
who are watching as well as the developers

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.789
whose apps we're reviewing will hope, you
know, learn a few tips and tricks and the

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.679
best practices creating apps that'll delight
your users.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.239
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We're all about the delight here.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.239
So this week...

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.239
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.239
&gt;&gt; MEIER:...like I said we'll looking each
Shopping Apps.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.379
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: To be more specific apps that
help you shop by letting you write list of

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.420
things to shop for.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.420
So, Shopping List Apps.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Basically, yeah.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.559
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So there's four apps on the patient
list today, they are Out of Milk, Grocery

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.850
iQ, Zoum Task and some French thing that we
don't know how to pronounce but we're going

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.850
to call it...

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We'll keep it Prixing.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...Prixing.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it could be Prixing, we're going
to go with Prixing.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.800
It's--if there are any French language speakers
watching, please let producer Lewis know,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.159
so he can correct us live on air.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.159
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or just...

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.159
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Because we do like to be corrected.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or just mock us in the YouTube
comments.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360
That's happens...

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, that's...

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...all the time.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's pretty much standard practice.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
So we don't need to tell...

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: By the way...

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...anyone that.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...if the--if the dude that thinks
we work for Apple is back, say hey and we,

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.030
you know, I was thinking about like how could
we prove that we're working for Google.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.030
No way.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's hard.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.959
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean we're in front of a green
screen here...

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:35.959
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It could be anyone.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:36.959
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it could be anywhere, yeah.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.959
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We could be in Cupertino right now.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:38.959
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:39.959
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We're not.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:40.959
But I guess we...

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:41.959
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: With just a little camera punched
into Andy's old office.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:42.959
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That will be something.

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.109
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Like this is-this is where--this
where the spy cam was, no.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's worth a shot.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's not an insinuation by
the way.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.470
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.219
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And of course, I'm speaking only
of a hypothetical version of some company

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.090
that has no relation in the company in reality.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.090
Moving right along.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.090
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's move on.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.689
So we're going to take a quick lightning round
view of some of the apps that's we're going

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:05.689
to be looking at today.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.880
So we're going through them really quickly
now and then dig a little bit deeper later.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.260
So the first of those apps Grocery iQ, I think
it'd best be described as your ultimate grocery

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.220
companion it's got integration with coupons,
loyalty cards, it let you share sync lists

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.940
between your friends and your family.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.700
It has a lot of really convenient ways to
input items into your list including things

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.050
like bar code, order complete, favorite, all
of that good stuff.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.400
So this is one of my favorites I'm looking
for to digging a little deeper into this one.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Out of Milk, is less of a shopping
app and more of a list management app that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.820
happens to mention shopping as a possible
application.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.720
And its visual design is lush it has an op-animated
background on the opening screen; it has a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.760
little skeuomorphic touches here and there.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.930
And it has a crisp and responsive UI.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.940
Now, it separates list into three different
categories: shopping, pantry, and to-do.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.120
And as far as we could tell the idea behind
the app is to stock your pantry list with

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.900
the items that you used and then move them
to your shopping list when you run out.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.150
And that's sounds like a great idea but as
we'll see there are a few hitches in the execution.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: How smooth are these transitions,
it's wonderful.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.800
So, Prixing, like, Grocery iQ is a full service
shopping companion.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.550
It's got coupons, offers from nearby stores
and keeps hold of all of your loyalty cards

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.800
and even offers price comparison which is
I think the only--one of these particular

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.390
apps which does that.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.580
It's also entirely in French which is either
a huge bonus or a serious drawback depending

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.580
on your perspective.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.230
So we'll go in to a little bit more detail
on that later as well.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And finally Zoum Tasks, which
I think I'm saying correctly I have no idea.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.350
You know time again--time and again, we've
looked at apps that had promising functionality

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.560
but then found that they cut corners on polish
it's like the developers ran out of rent money

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.680
and had to ship.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.660
But Zoum Tasks is the opposite of that.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.490
This app does almost nothing functionality-wise
but the polish is actually above average.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.560
In fact it's so good and so simple that Zoum
feels less like an app and more like a resume

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.490
from somebody who wants to create apps for
a living.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.500
But if you look at it in that light Zoum has
some cool features.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.000
We're going to take a particular look at one
later on, the data validation animation which

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.580
I think is really cool.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.120
But before we do that let's talk about today's
prescriptions.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.090
And before we do that, I want to [INDISTINCT]
a big shout out at to the folks you mentioned

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.310
that our audio was in reverse so we had the
person on the left coming from the right audio

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.310
channel.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.310
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Wait I thought, YouTube wasn't
even in stereo for us?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Currently it is.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Rock on.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So we've been messing with people's
heads hopefully that's being fixed now.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
Thank you for letting us know.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is going to be great, this
is--and it's like total stereo separation.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.160
So it's sort of like the 60's sounds like
a Beatles Record.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is always our...

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...goal.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160
So...

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I'm over here and Ringo's
over there.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So let's have--let's have a look
at the prescriptions.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.830
I'm going to put them behind us because this
is going to be up on screen for a little while.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, we're looking a shopping list
apps and I think really the acid test here

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.070
comes down to one simple question.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.010
How is this better for me than a piece of
paper and a pen?

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.150
Because a piece of paper fits in my pocket,
you got them all over the house; load time

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.639
for a piece of paper is zero, there's no latency.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There really isn't it.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.650
You type it's there, you don't even have to
do anything neatly.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.020
You can just scribble something in your handwriting
do it times two, whatever.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.460
And it automatically makes sense.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Spouses never get mad if you're
looking at a piece of paper and instead of

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.560
typing your phone.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly which is, you know, particularly
important when you're in a shopping center

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.030
if you do happen to be holding your phone
up for whatever reason, grocery store seem

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.670
to be built within faraday cages.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.120
It's a little unexpected but it means that
if got an app which depends on an internet

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.800
connection it's really not going to be that
useful for you.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well I could say in this about
any app, you know, whether in a grocery store

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.120
or not...

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's true.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...there are going to be dead
zones.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.270
So no matter how great your carrier is I don't
care.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.440
So you've got to work with outer connection
and you've got to do it seamlessly.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.280
Now also--speaking of wives and spouses I
want to be able to share my list, you know,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.010
I have things that I need my wife to go pickup
when she's...

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: True.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...shopping she has things for
me--sometimes we go shopping together.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.530
So I want to be able to--for her to see my
list items, I want to see her list items and

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.300
when I pick something else up, I want to make
sure that it gets checked off on both of our

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.099
devices so we don't end up with duplication.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.550
And that--I think that's a really important
point.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.750
And we want to make that as simple as possible.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.700
So if we are sharing lists send authenticating
ourselves so we can back things up on a Cloud

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.380
which--even without sharing I want this stuff
to leave on the Cloud so that it just works.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And I never lost things.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.060
I want that authentication flow to be as simple
as possible.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.550
I don't want have to go through four pages
and three redirects just to be able to login

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.009
into this--into this app.

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hey, I don't even want to type
in my email address.

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:07.919
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.490
When we talked about this before, you know,
every click that you have to make to be able

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.639
to get to what you want to do is an opportunity
for a user to go [MAKES NOISE] to hell with

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.050
this and hit the home screen button and get
out of your app.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.230
If we're going to count clicks like key strokes
as clicks as well then it's not going to get

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.590
too far into your email address before they're
like that to hell with this.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.150
I personally never run an app if it asks me
to type in my email address.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.690
My email address is on the phone but there's
other things that you can do to save people

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.690
time, too.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean the shopping apps are
the kind of thing where most people buy the

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.390
same thing.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Give me some auto complete, I
look at my contacts, remember...

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Favorites--things I have bought
beforehand.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, let me add those things
again.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.460
Yeah, like you said bar codes kind of--let
me just take a picture.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.410
Maybe you don't even need to write it down
just take a photo of whatever I want, that's

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.410
enough to [INDISTINCT] me.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Get final location and microphone
permissions.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:06.539
So that if I'm in my bedroom sobbing and I'm
all alone, it will remind me to buy beer.

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:07.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It looks like you need whiskey.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.590
Yeah.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That would be a useful feature.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.073
Um, I'm not sure if any of the apps we looked
at today offer that but I guess we want to

00:08:13.073 --> 00:08:14.073
find out.

00:08:14.073 --> 00:08:15.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I might be going a little far
there but, you know, you know.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.020
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, it's good to--it's good to
set lofty goals.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.100
Okay.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.660
So those are the prescriptions we have.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.280
Let's see how our apps measured up.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.470
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.330
So yeah, lets all--let's dig into each of
those.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.600
And so the first app that we wanted to take
a look at is actually, uh, Out of Milk.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which I think we could take a look
at.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600
So this is--this is the...

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So...

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...the Google play listing.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly and I just have
one thing to say about this.

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:48.320
Which is I think that the basic design of
the logo is good, it's fun, it gets the point

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.050
across but that little to do list on their
feature graphic is probably twice as big as

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:59.770
it needs to be and their logos half as big,
you know, so they should really be rejiggered

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.770
some.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.870
But let's not spend too much time on that.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.740
Let's bring up the app on our giant fake phone.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, why isn't the giant fake phone
coming up?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What?

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very disappointing.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What happened?

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.981
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm not sure, try unplugging it
and re-plugging it back in.

00:09:14.981 --> 00:09:17.200
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That always works.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: The big reveal for the giant phone.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.459
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:23.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's interesting.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:34.360
I'm seeing no lights on the on the giant phone
controller so I'm going to duck out of sight

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.360
to try and figure out why that is.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean...

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Have you got the--have you got that...

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...did this thing just get too...

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...hot, do you think?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360
Because it seems like it always fails on it
sooner or later.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, here it is.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: oh.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Is it coming up?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360
All nice.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360
Now try unplugging it...

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: it's a...

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...and re plugging it back in.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it's coming.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.040
Oh, giant fake phone.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.220
Well, this is really good time to remind our
audience that we are doing this live and that

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.170
is why we have an excuse for this sort of
nonsense.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.070
But since we're doing it live we'd be happy
to take your feedback, uh, I'm pretty sure

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.330
Lewis is watching the YouTube comment stream
and I think he's also taking a look at our

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.330
G+ page.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.920
So if you want to get in touch with us and
give some questions, comments, anything you'd

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.360
like us to talk about that we're not already
talking about, we'll see if we can squeeze

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360
you in.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.260
&gt;&gt; But we have been told that Ian, you're
a little loud.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.730
So we probably have to fix that on the [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That always happens.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.730
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.970
So we're going to try to make Ian a little
but quieter.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.520
And I'm also going to try and restart yCast
real quick because...

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Good Lord really?

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, I think that's the only way
we're going to get that video up.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Maybe so.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.720
&gt;&gt; Video stream on pause for a moment and
then you will come back.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720
So we will be...

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720
&gt;&gt; Go and try it live viewers.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We will be paused.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But do bear with us.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:00.380
Don't all run away and we will be back in
just one brief moment.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.140
Okay.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.530
&gt;&gt; Steady it goes.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.090
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, we're still staying online.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.310
Can't we ask those who are staying online?

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.310
I think we're back now.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.310
So thank you for patience.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.310
Those people who were still around.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:16.310
Frustratingly, we still don't seem to have
any actual video.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we had it there for a second.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.050
It was working great and now--oh.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, hey.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's there.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Just when we were about to give
up for old time.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: In deed.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.050
Okay.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Thank you for your patience everyone.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.830
We--and the system is broadcasting.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.380
&gt;&gt; They were like, yes.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.380
All right.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.279
We're going to do this Baby Weatherman style.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.519
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But...

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.769
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:43.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It just happened.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.360
If you're still watching, the reason we're
looking confused is Reto tripped over a cable.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Just the monitor it's okay.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.310
Nothing is wrong.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.209
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Just the monitor, yeah.

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.209
Okay.

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:56.209
So are we're still going?

00:11:56.209 --> 00:11:57.209
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:57.209 --> 00:11:58.209
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Cool.

00:11:58.209 --> 00:11:59.209
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We're just wasting time.

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:00.209
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:02.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But in other ways, behaving entirely
as expected.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, Thank God we had an excellent
rehearsal.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes, that's right.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.149
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But a fold rust rehearsal for
this session.

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:10.149
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:11.149
Nothing went wrong.

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:14.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's exactly why everything
is better.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:19.579
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I really feel the preparation in
a way which has really come together here.

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:20.579
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:22.090
I think the human element is better.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.610
It's the technology that let us down.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.610
You know why?

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.160
Computers can't rehearse.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.770
Oh, right.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.770
Perfect.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.770
So i'll you...

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:31.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...into quite now.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Wait until you want to drive
Out of Milk so I can be Mr. Weatherman?

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, I would love to.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, one thing that we did in
rehearsal actually that I--we can't see the--you

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560
see what I did there?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560
I'm going to call it rehearsal.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.830
So one thing we did earlier that we won't
be able to reproduce is the entry experience

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.000
in Out of Milk is a...

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.620
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...significant amount of time
that goes through a--I think nine or ten page

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.160
tutorial which--it would have been nice to
be able to skip.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.980
Now the other thing that Out of Milk does,
it is--it ask for me to sign it--oh, there

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.980
we go.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980
Yeah.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So it's this thing.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So there's no obvious way to get
past this other than scrolling through the

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.980
whole thing.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.980
Exactly.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.980
And then it asks me to sign in.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.390
Now it gives me the ability to sign in with
Google and with Facebook.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.589
A couple of issues there.

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:21.670
First, I would like to sign in with whoever,
honest--honestly.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.880
But I realized that, you know, standards being
what they are or not.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.020
That's not necessarily possible.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.209
So it's great that we have Google and Facebook
as options.

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:36.910
The only problem is if I try to sign in with
Google it takes me a webpage or WebView which

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.460
I think we don't have because we're in one
of those Faraday cages.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.850
And you could buy groceries, yeah.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's incredible.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The problem is...

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Here we are.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now there we go.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:54.670
The problem is now I've got to fill this out
and unless I completely trust this app I shouldn't.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, this is something a lot
of people don't know but I think tech savvy

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:04.510
people know this is that on a phone going
through this flow isn't going to add to your

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.170
security at all because the app developer
can actually read directly out of that WebView.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:19.230
This is OF flow was created for web apps that
run in standard's compliant browsers not in

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.180
a WebView that sits inside another application.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:28.801
So with the WebView or I--I'm sorry, with
the web app on your desktop, the question

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.040
is do you trust your browser.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: With this sort of thing the question
is do you trust the random app creator that

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.370
put this together.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.959
Personally, sorry Milk guys, but I don't.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:39.959
So...

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:42.149
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's nothing personal, he trusts
no one.

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:46.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So we'll talk a little later
about how to make that easier but let's remember

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.529
that this is not the way to go if you want
your users to stay engaged.

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:51.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Definitely.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now...

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.247
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So let's start--so what we've got
here out on the front page is, again, sort

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:59.810
of this dashboard pattern, how that you can
see, it's--it seems like an odd fit for this

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.810
app.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, it's kind of cool because
you get this, you know, little like moving

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.530
background behind there.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.530
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, it's nice.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So it's pretty but it's a complete
waste of space and it's a waste of my time.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.709
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: If I want to categorize my list
that's great, but I'm not really sure that

00:15:14.709 --> 00:15:18.480
these three categories are the way that I
would do it.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.080
Even if it were I think I'd prefer to swipe
between them or have some other way of choosing

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.019
them rather than the dashboard, even though
the...

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:26.019
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's...

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:27.019
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...dashboard is pretty.

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.019
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And as you can see us we're going
through each of this list.

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:30.709
They look identical, they just have a different
heading, and so I really just want to be able

00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:33.579
to click this and choose between those different
lists.

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:36.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They do behave a little differently
but that's...

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.060
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS:...not actually a plus.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.060
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:45.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So for instance let's check out
the shopping list if you want to add an item.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.760
You type in the name of the item or you speak
it because it's got the microphone icon there,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760
that's nice.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760
Yeah.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What happens if I add an item
from the pantry list though?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:05.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: If I go to the pantry I'm automatically
given a list of suggestions to add which is

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.160
really nice and I can still tap them in which
is a good step but it does show me all of

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.350
these things and it's really nice to have...

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...that same functionality in both
parts of the app.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.660
I mean you feel like you know what was just
going through these guys mind if they're thinking,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:23.050
"Oh, we've got this functionality for the
pantry" and so we'll split that off from the

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.420
shopping list that has this different functionality
but it turns out that, that functionality

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.810
is useful everywhere.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:36.410
Now the other thing that I kind of wish this
app did differently is when it comes to checking

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.410
of item.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.269
I mean what are the two things that you always
do with list apps?

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:43.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, things when you check them
off the stuff.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:50.410
If--and this is I think probably just a rule
of thumb that we can say for certain, but

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.410
no.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.209
Roman Nurik should probably weigh in on this,
but here's what I think.

00:16:55.209 --> 00:17:03.269
If the two most common behaviors in your entire
app can't be accomplished without a double

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:07.260
tapping or long pressing, there's something
wrong with your UI design.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.859
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, how am I going to check out
an item there?

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:10.959
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, yeah.

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:13.239
I click the item and I can click done so that
works.

00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:14.239
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:17:14.239 --> 00:17:18.269
So if you--if you just single click you're
going to see that toolbar come up and that's

00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:19.269
great.

00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:22.579
At least it's discoverable but why isn't there
a check boxes next to the item?

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:23.579
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.549
And in fact if I long press which is in particularly
discoverable it does the--it does the done

00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:31.919
but what I really expect this to do is when
I long press to get a contextual action bar,

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:35.710
something that should let me multi select
the items and do many of the things here.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.649
So bulk move, bulk delete, bulk copy this
sort of things.

00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:39.649
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:42.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All part of the contextual action
bar will be really nice to use the button.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.289
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, we talked a lot about apps
where it seems like the developer ran out

00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:50.919
of time and to me this is the--this is the
evidence.

00:17:50.919 --> 00:17:51.919
I...

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:55.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's almost the to do list of stuff
that we need to figure out how it works in

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.539
the--in the UI properly.

00:17:56.539 --> 00:17:57.539
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:03.480
There's a gargantuan list of features that
obviously exist in the bowels of the app but

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.120
there's no UI to launch them and there was
very little thought given to how these things

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120
fit together.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.679
So it's just this jumble of different things
that you might want to do, you know, sharing

00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:23.130
versus settings versus history, all of these
things could be done in way that makes them

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.309
task focused.

00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:25.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:28.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And discoverable but instead
they're sitting on this gargantuan menu bar

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.900
that's almost unusual.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.269
And so that's probably the biggest piece of
advice that I would have for the--for the

00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:39.909
people behind Out of Milk is think more about
the typical user work flow.

00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:43.850
One of the most common things that they were
going to--going to want to do make it as simple

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.860
as possible.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.220
You don't want to have to think about, "Well,
how do I move something from my" like you

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220
can see this.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.570
Every time I want to change something I'm
clicking a three or four different places

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.820
because I don't want to have to hit back because
that implies that I'm undoing something.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.889
I just want to change my navigational location.

00:18:58.889 --> 00:19:01.740
So I want to click here and then choose watch
list but I don't and I have to go back.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.119
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And then click pantry, it's already
two clicks.

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:07.919
And so how do I get my chicken broth here?

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:09.059
How do I get that into my shopping list?

00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:10.059
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well...

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:11.059
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So...

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:12.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And there's no app affordance
on this thing that looks a lot like an action

00:19:12.809 --> 00:19:13.860
bar but isn't and...

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.379
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS:...again, I mean we say this a
lot but, you know, go nuts with your custom

00:19:18.379 --> 00:19:25.241
design but if you make a design that looks
like a built in Android feature either make

00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:30.450
it work exactly like it or rethink your design
because otherwise you're just going to confuse

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.450
people.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.420
So really I think the suggestions I would
have here is to simplifying navigation, simplify

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.299
your workflow, optimize the app for whatever
the most typical or desirable workflow.

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:45.789
So it should be really easy to add things
to your shopping list using all the order

00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:48.619
complete magic which is in pantry.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:51.059
When you bought things it should move into
your pantry because you bought them so now

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:55.259
they're in your pantry and then from there
you should be able to click--do a single click

00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:56.929
which then moves it back into your shopping
list.

00:19:56.929 --> 00:20:01.049
Then--so then you'll have an app which continues
to grow and become more and more useful the

00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:03.640
more you use it without having to do a lot
of pre-population.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.850
No one is going sit down and put everything
that they currently have in their pantry into

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.289
this--into this app to make their life potentially
easier in the future.

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:13.869
It needs to build on its self.

00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:14.869
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:16.720
Well, I think we've probably spent enough
time talking...

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ... about the particular things
that Out of Milk made have done right or wrong.

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:28.109
Why don't we talk a little bit about some
of the technical things that they might be

00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:30.539
able to do to make this app a little better
friendlier?

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:31.539
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:34.239
I may have seem to have lost my click app,
I just had it.

00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:36.549
Oh, I probably put it down somewhere while
fixing things.

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:38.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's over here, yeah.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.450
Yes.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.400
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So one of the things which this
app does which a lot of these apps do or at

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.950
least one of the key things is functionality
sharing list since so the way that you do

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.200
that is you, you know, choose someone you
want to share with, sends him an email, says

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.769
hey, you know, this is being shared, you can
follow a link to it.

00:20:56.769 --> 00:21:03.639
Now, what would be really neat is if you could
take that one step further and actually have

00:21:03.639 --> 00:21:06.619
that link automatically open up your app.

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:11.149
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly, it doesn't even have
to emails, any web link...

00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:12.149
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:14.649
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...that I want to have do something
in my app, right?

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:15.649
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:18.279
So if you, you know, browsing the website
associated with this or someone, you know,

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:21.039
if your wife tweets you a link because that's
just how she rolls.

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.039
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:23.039
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You want that old to work and so
you can...

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You got your bitly link or whatever?

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, precisely right.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So what you want to do is you can
actually intercept any URL that's click within

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:33.489
an application by registering an intent filter
against the activity that you want to react

00:21:33.489 --> 00:21:34.489
to it.

00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:38.859
And so what happens then is whenever that
URL is clicked within a WebView browser, text

00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:44.200
tube, anything really--it's going to launch
any view intent and the URL associated with

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.100
that click action is going to be included
as a .parameter.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.480
So, you can create an intent filter like this
one and that's--you can see here that specifying

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.529
the host, the protocol type, the schema I
should say and the path.

00:21:57.529 --> 00:22:01.399
This is really important, so here we're going
to say we're going to intercept links for

00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:03.220
my website, but not everything.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:08.409
I still want people to be able to view my
website on the device, but if they click on

00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:12.409
a shared shopping list then that's something
that my app can handle and so you can do something

00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:18.799
really clever with this and that's--you can
have your actual website redirect to Google

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:23.489
Play or to a please download my app type link
so if the app is installed, you can view the

00:22:23.489 --> 00:22:26.980
shared L's right away but if isn't then you
can encourage people to install the app.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So if the app installed then
it will just eat that link because it fit

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.439
that particular form of my website.

00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:34.439
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:22:34.439 --> 00:22:35.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or the apps website...

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:36.439
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:39.739
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS:...but if the app is not installed
then it's going to cruise right passed and

00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:44.100
into the web browser or whatever you have
set up to handled generic links.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Precisely.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.100
Precisely.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.340
The effect, the users going to be prompted
with the opportunity that either use your

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:54.129
app to launch to fulfill that link or to view
in the browsers so the options is still there

00:22:54.129 --> 00:22:58.759
and this is on the YouTube does or something
that the Google Maps does also trying to create

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:00.250
that magical experience.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now I have to--I have to admit
the first thing that came in to my head when

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:12.630
I heard you talking about this is what if
I just intercept my Google Play link?

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, that's interesting so why
would you want to do that?

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:20.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, maybe I don't want to set
up--maybe I don't want to set up a server.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.779
I don't want to set up a redirect, maybe I
don't have the ability to do that.

00:23:23.779 --> 00:23:28.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, see that would be the challenge
because you are wanting to intercept a link

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.019
using an app that isn't installed.

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:31.019
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:23:31.019 --> 00:23:32.139
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So let me know why.

00:23:32.139 --> 00:23:35.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But that's the whole point, the
right if the--if the app is not installed,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.149
let me go to Google Play...

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:38.149
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:40.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...if it is installed.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.179
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So if someone trusts to follow a
link to your app...

00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:44.179
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:23:44.179 --> 00:23:47.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...on the process when your app
is installed, you wanted to open your app

00:23:47.169 --> 00:23:48.169
instead of your web.

00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:50.739
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I'm not saying me but if
a friend of mine asks.

00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:52.349
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Of course, a guy you know.

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:53.779
Yeah, I guess you can do that.

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:56.779
I'm not entirely what the used case would
be for but yeah, you can do that.

00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:58.239
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I--we actually have had that.

00:23:58.239 --> 00:23:59.519
That question goes through text support.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:01.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There you go, so yeah...

00:24:01.729 --> 00:24:02.729
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:02.729 --> 00:24:04.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...I guess that's interesting.

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:08.959
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So probably better to put a redirect
in because you want to have some control...

00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:09.959
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:11.009
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...over what you're doing...

00:24:11.009 --> 00:24:12.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:15.129
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and I--and you definitely
don't want to be in the position where users

00:24:15.129 --> 00:24:19.489
can't get to your play link to update or to
see reviews or whatever or...

00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:20.489
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:24:20.489 --> 00:24:23.889
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you know, God forbid you messed
it up and end up hijacking play for everybody

00:24:23.889 --> 00:24:24.889
so...

00:24:24.889 --> 00:24:26.869
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that's enough to [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I bring it up as a counter

00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:27.869
example...

00:24:27.869 --> 00:24:28.869
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:30.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...but there's some really interesting
things you can do with this.

00:24:30.139 --> 00:24:31.389
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Totally.

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:37.080
So let's--let's have a look, one of the--I
think there was another technical tip--but

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.080
you wanted to provide that if I'm not mistaken.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well actually, you know I was
thinking about how much I hate typing in my

00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:47.489
email address and there hasn't really been
a wonderful way here for to fix that.

00:24:47.489 --> 00:24:48.489
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:24:48.489 --> 00:24:53.019
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But we just recently released
something called Google Play Services and

00:24:53.019 --> 00:24:57.799
it turns out that the Google Play Services
API which is an extra in the Android SDK just

00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:02.500
like billing or licensing and these other
things you can add on.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:10.220
Has a way to register and, you know, essentially
federate accounts without having to write

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:18.340
a bunch of code without having to deal with
aloft and importantly without having to requests

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.359
extra permissions.

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:20.359
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:25.989
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So what I--what you want to do
is same thing I did which is check out this

00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:31.450
link, it's the Google Developers link, that's
were the Google Play Services live because

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:37.970
a Google API is not an Android API, but it's
a really nice add on and you're more or less

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:44.559
guaranteed to have it on the system if you
have for your above and a recent version of

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:45.559
market.

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:49.249
Now it's not exactly that easy but it's really
close...

00:25:49.249 --> 00:25:50.249
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:51.249
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...this is a backwards compatible
library.

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:55.529
You don't have to be update the phone, there's
no OTA involved as long as you read the documentation,

00:25:55.529 --> 00:25:57.409
you'll understand how to use it.

00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:58.639
So what can you with this?

00:25:58.639 --> 00:26:01.210
Well, let's take a look at this code.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:08.429
First thing you often want to do is get the
users account so that you can figure out who

00:26:08.429 --> 00:26:09.559
this user is.

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:10.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:17.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So Google Play Services has a
nice convenience method to help you do that.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.359
This works back to Froyo.

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:23.649
Now we did add a convenience--a similar convenience
method to the framework in ICS, this backwards

00:26:23.649 --> 00:26:31.349
compatible so you just launch this intent
and it will launch the picker dialogue for

00:26:31.349 --> 00:26:37.229
accounts and you can say which type of accounts
you want in this case .com.google is the name

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:42.679
of the account and that will bring you back
a string that in fact I think it's on the

00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:48.789
next slide we'll use that string in a--on
activity result.

00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:53.340
The string will be an identifier for the account
now, you'll probably notice immediately that

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.869
the identifier for Google accounts is actually
your Gmail address but you can't count on

00:26:57.869 --> 00:26:58.909
that.

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:03.830
That's not at all required and it very well
may change in the future.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:09.599
So, what you really want is an ID that you
can associate with this user to tell you two

00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:16.859
things first, they are who they can say they
are in the sense that it's really them saying

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:24.730
"Sure, use my account" and second you have
some sort of ID that you can use to federate,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.419
you know, you have--you have an ID to where
you can store in your database that's not

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:33.320
going to change and every time you see that
ID come from an Android device, you know "Oh,

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.440
yeah that's--this key in my database."

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:43.029
So the way you do that in this example is
use the user profile API now, this is actually...

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:44.029
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:47.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I think it's an open ID left
over actually.

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:48.929
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:27:48.929 --> 00:27:51.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But you don't need know anything
about an open ID to use it.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:56.820
All you do is specify the OWA of scope which
I actually had to do a little digging for...

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...so I made sure and put it
in this slide, I--it's, you know, OWA of:

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.639
blah, blah, blah, blah, and then ended up
with user.profile.

00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:11.179
Now, once you've got the scope you send it
to Google Core or--all right, I'm sorry, Google

00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:16.779
Play Services and it will try to require you
a token.

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:20.429
There's two things that can happen at this
point you either get a token or you get a

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:26.549
response back that says "Sorry, you can't
have a token, but here's why and here's the

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:27.549
way to fix it."

00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:31.070
Because usually the reason you don't have
a token is because the user hasn't actually

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.480
authorized you to look at their information,
so if you launch that intent, what you'll

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:41.109
get is a very nice little dialogue that essential
says "This app wants to look at your basic

00:28:41.109 --> 00:28:44.120
profile data, do you want to allow them?"

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.279
And as long as the user clicks there and says
yes" then you'll get a token back that you

00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:54.090
can use to make web service calls to this
API.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:59.440
Now, if you like me the first time you get
in to a calling web services, it feels a little

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440
tricky...

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...fortunately with this API,
it couldn't be easier.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.269
Let's take a look at the next piece of code.

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:18.769
All you do is get a URL connection and set
up the particular URL with the token that

00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:21.210
you were given, so that's all you need to
do.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.649
It's a one call thing and the response that
you get back will actually contain the users

00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:37.759
profile data, it's a JSON format and we can
take a look at that right now.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:41.980
So this is an example of what you get back
if you query my profile data for instance,

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:48.110
you get my name or at least what I told Google
my name is.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.729
And you've got a date of birth, but no year...

00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:51.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:29:51.729 --> 00:29:54.109
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...no email address, no way to
contact me.

00:29:54.109 --> 00:29:57.629
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So all the people have their year
of birth sort of tied to their email address

00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:01.349
so it could be tricky if you get that access.

00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:06.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's quite possible or it could
just be the year of a very pleasant scotch

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440
that you drink once.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's quite possible.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.119
The important thing here is you're getting
enough information to be able to identify

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:19.220
this person when they come back so there's
some--you get the first name and last name

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.179
so you can actually refer to them by name,
people love that...

00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:23.179
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:30:23.179 --> 00:30:27.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...but more importantly you get
an ID, this is actually their Google+ ID which

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:34.029
is tied to that user and won't change the
way an email address might.

00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:35.029
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:37.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or we can do the way a name byte
in fact.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.470
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.879
Absolutely, that's really nice.

00:30:39.879 --> 00:30:44.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So don't make your users type
an email addresses and passwords anymore,

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.999
this is a click-through interface that does
the exact same thing and unlike the WebView

00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:51.059
that we saw earlier it's secure.

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.759
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Actually secure, which is a nice
touch.

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:54.759
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:55.759
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:30:55.759 --> 00:30:56.759
So...

00:30:56.759 --> 00:30:57.759
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let's move on.

00:30:57.759 --> 00:30:58.759
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...let's move on.

00:30:58.759 --> 00:31:00.549
Let's have a look at the next app that we
wanted to check out is a Grocery IQ.

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:03.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Look my head is an IQ.

00:31:03.659 --> 00:31:07.029
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's got to be a first time for
everything.

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:10.039
Let's take a look.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:13.850
It's--so this is--so this is an app that I
quite like, Grocery IQs probably my favorite

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.119
of the apps that we looked at today.

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:18.989
And you can tell that the developers behind
this app have really spent a lot of time and

00:31:18.989 --> 00:31:23.479
effort trying to create something that is
fully featured as possible.

00:31:23.479 --> 00:31:25.749
You've got all those--the obvious sorts of
stuff that you like.

00:31:25.749 --> 00:31:30.659
So you can see here it's got all the complete--which
is nice and fast and rich.

00:31:30.659 --> 00:31:31.730
And it actually goes a step further.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.909
And you can see here once you've ordered--once
you've added these things in, it automatically

00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:39.729
character--categorize system for you as well
which is a really nice tip.

00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:42.649
You can see all of the sort of obvious things
are right there.

00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:46.320
You've got the checkbox and extra things as
well so you can just add things to your list

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.379
really easily, check them off really easily.

00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:52.219
And so it's got that cool functionality of
what is this app for?

00:31:52.219 --> 00:31:53.450
How does this make my life easier?

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:57.940
It's really obvious right off the bat, which
is nice.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.259
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:32:00.259 --> 00:32:06.799
So, one thing that I really love about this
app is the way that it knows everything already.

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:07.799
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:08.799
Absolutely.

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:12.679
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And unfortunately we can't show
this but it actually does have pictures that

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:14.749
would actually be sitting right along here.

00:32:14.749 --> 00:32:15.749
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:32:15.749 --> 00:32:16.749
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That'll...

00:32:16.749 --> 00:32:17.749
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, it's really handy, ain't it?

00:32:17.749 --> 00:32:18.749
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...that'll show you a little
bottle of whiskey for instance.

00:32:18.749 --> 00:32:19.749
Because...

00:32:19.749 --> 00:32:20.749
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Just in case you don't know.

00:32:20.749 --> 00:32:21.749
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...just in case--well, yeah,
in case you forgot.

00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:24.399
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, and this can be really useful
because it seems kind of obvious.

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:25.700
I'm so glad that there's a list.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.109
So I know what it looks like.

00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:30.679
Except that maybe someone else added it just
to the list and you don't know what it looks

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:31.679
like.

00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:34.559
And so having a picture right there from something
someone else added is really useful.

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:39.330
And this is a really good example of an app
which is trying to one up paper.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:43.249
So what paper is just whatever you write down
here, you get to know what category it's in

00:32:43.249 --> 00:32:47.210
which means you know what aisle it's in and
you can then sort by aisle so you can make

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.809
sure that your shopping trip is actually optimized
using the trolley itself and the problem.

00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:52.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:52.809 --> 00:32:59.919
It's amazing how the presence of these Cloud
databases just contains the most mundane app

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:02.350
into something really magical.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.719
I don't think there's a worldwide database.

00:33:04.719 --> 00:33:06.009
And I certainly couldn't find a lot...

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:07.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:09.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...of my favorite things in this
particular app.

00:33:09.139 --> 00:33:14.609
But, I can see that if I'm in the right location,
it's really, really handy because not only

00:33:14.609 --> 00:33:19.849
does it know the sorts of things that might
be available, it also knows what they cost

00:33:19.849 --> 00:33:21.570
and can compute the tax for me.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:25.050
So it can do a lot of mundane tasks without
me even thinking about it.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.050
I love that.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.549
And I think that's what this app does really,
really well is it has thought about its workflow.

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:33.220
And so the first time I use it, it's instantly
useful.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.309
And it's already adding things to my list
which I wouldn't have thought of.

00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:41.159
So, all of the data that pulls down from the
web around the products that I'm adding is

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:42.309
instantly useful.

00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:46.139
Pictures, cost, categories, all of those things
are great.

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:48.360
And what I really like is that they've gone
that extra step.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.549
So, by default, it's just going to go to your
grocery store.

00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:53.499
But you can actually add your own shops.

00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:57.200
And so there's a whole foods in a safe way
near my place that I shop at.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.789
You can then add the aisles that they have
and reorder them.

00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:00.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:04.629
I found that by pressing [INDISTINCT] I have
a little...

00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:05.629
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:06.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...trouble on there.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:12.570
But what was disappointing is once I started
looking at a list that has, you know just

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.669
two options, any store or groceries where
I'm thinking, "Wow.

00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:19.290
It would be nice to add another store to this,
then I didn't know how."

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It seems like they missed a golden
opportunity here to make the app flow even

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.280
more magical by...

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's good.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...looking at this and saying,
"Well, if a user sees an incomplete list,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.470
what are they going to want to do?"

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:34.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Add something to it.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So why put that anywhere else?

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Why put that functionality somewhere
else?

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So it would be nice to see this
working the same way that the account manager

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.420
works.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.720
So you can choose between your account so
you can one add one if it's not there.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.340
And it helps you to understand the functionality
that this app provides.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.110
And there's a lot of it and so I'm trying
to put that front and center and easy to sort

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.030
of expand your use of the app, is I think
a really--a real benefit.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It does a lot of clever things like
when you have checked out, so once you've

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.120
finished removing everything from the list,
add that to your history making it easier

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:09.520
for you to then add things back the future
lists, adding favorites is really simple.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.660
But, this is something that you actually pointed
out to me Ian, is the favorites handling could

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.660
be a little sensible.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: If that's a word.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love that word.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.660
Let's use it.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a pretty good word.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sensible.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680
Yeah.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.930
Well, like you pointed out, the favorites
tab here already has a star on it.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Why don't I just see that star
in the list here?

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.980
And in fact, if you look at that list, then
there may be a golden opportunity here because

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:37.800
we have this current server on the side here,
which are kind of meaningless in an Android

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800
world, at least...

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...from today.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think it makes sense if you're
on an OS where--there you're guaranteed to

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:48.500
get a right to left sliding animation when
you move from a list item to a detail.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But that's not what Android does.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:51.790
It has a zoom animation.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:53.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And...

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But you can do like a funky kind
of vortex zoom icon on the right that...

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.660
But we wouldn't do that because we're not
insane.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.030
Particularly because--and this is the important
thing is that the animation between activities

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.030
isn't guaranteed.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:09.000
It can be changed by OEMs by different platform
versions, and so you don't want to make any

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.720
assumptions as to what screen animation is
going to happen when you click something on

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720
the screen.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You really don't.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.490
So, what we have just trained users to think
in Android is that if you click on a list

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.079
item, it will take you to the details for
that list item.

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.079
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Precisely.

00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:26.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That is just an expected behavior.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.080
So there's no point in putting a chevron here,
but you could certainly fill that space with

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.080
something else; a star.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Like a start maybe.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And there's a checkbox on the
other side.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.420
If you wanted to you could even go nuts.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:42.370
It's a little bit small but, you know, you
can usually get away with one or two things

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.800
on the right-hand side...

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...that has nothing to do with
the details for that list item.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because it makes your user's
life easier.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:57.300
And of course there's always the idea of putting
a little tear off corner to bring up a contextual

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.790
item list or to long press for contextual
items.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.410
So I think, you know, that would be a nice
thinking will be, you know a really simple

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.860
replace the carrots with stars and then just
add that favorites flow, you know directly

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.170
into the user experience.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:15.120
The other couple things that I wanted to highlight
real quick is at the top here, we have coupons--we've

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.760
got coupons, we've got loyalty card integration.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.681
It's basically everything that you could want
in.

00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:23.961
And it's really an app that's really spent
a lot of time thinking about what is it that

00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:28.620
you want a replacement shopping list piece
of paper to do to really enrich that experience

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.470
and make it something that you can justify
using instead of just writing it down.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And like you said, it really
builds on itself.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.010
It's useful the moment it loads.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:40.740
And as I want more functionality, it's relatively
easy to find.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.780
So, even though the design of this app is
fairly dated and you can tell that the buttons

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:50.220
that come from the Froyo Era and the tab bar
hasn't really been used in a while.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:56.390
And we can probably do a view pager and some
other nice things, it doesn't matter.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:03.100
The core design, the flow of the application
has been really well thought out to make it

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.120
easy for users to get the most out of it.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:12.760
Although I did need to point out and this
is just for that one dude that was on our

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.230
YouTube page earlier, "This is a menu button
of shame.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.270
Shame.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.310
Shame."

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:26.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a--but really what it is, is
just a really obvious example of the fact

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.250
that this is an app which people spend a lot
of time and effort making it really great

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.990
probably hasn't been updated from that design
perspective since the initial designs when

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.990
this app came out.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.500
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And so that's--the big piece of
feedback we would have for Grocery IQ, love

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.610
the app.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.700
Let's maybe take the opportunity now that
the Halo things has been out for awhile, we

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.480
have the design sites so you no longer have
to play the guessing game of what the Android

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.560
guy is going to do next.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Great.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.560
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's up there.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560
It's being pretty standard.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And that's definitely a style in
a design that we're going to be sticking with

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:56.350
for awhile.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:01.070
So now I think it's a great opportunity to
maybe think about a tablet app, think about

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.070
doing a redesign.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:07.490
And in fact, Roman, Nick and Adam are going
to be performing a design maker about on Grocery

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:08.490
IQ next Tuesday.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.220
So it will be interesting to see what they
come up with.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And stay tuned by the way.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:19.300
We don't have a time yet for this but some
time in the next couple of weeks, we are going

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.360
to do an interview with the design team and
they are going to explain the whole menu button

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.360
issue.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.730
And we are going to get set straight, so...

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, yeah.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.910
That should be interesting.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.290
Stay tuned for that.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.290
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:33.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, there's a couple of specific
technical implementation of details which

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:35.310
I wanted to cover as well.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:40.070
So these are things that Grocery IQ does well--well,
could do better.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.070
And again...

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.170
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...I think in both of the cases
here, its stuff which is probably postdates

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.170
when this app was built.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.590
So hopefully it's stuff that we can point
out to the developers and they can implement

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.590
as well...

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...to make the app that little bit
neater.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.819
So the first is around the way that the app
sends updates.

00:39:55.819 --> 00:39:56.819
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:39:56.819 --> 00:40:01.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So right now, there's a menu option
that you can select to say how often you wanted

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.760
to pull the servers to check to see whether
you...

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.100
Did you say pull off the servers?

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.050
And you've seen the problem right there, right?

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.559
Hey, 1985 called they want their data update
method back.

00:40:12.559 --> 00:40:18.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So--and the bad news is the highest
number you can set is five minutes which kind

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.010
of makes sense because I want my shopping
list to be bang up-to-date, but I really don't

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.740
know that I want my phone firing up the cell
network and transfer a data back and forth

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.000
between the server if [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
There's got to be a better way.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There has to be.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
And in fact, there is a better way.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.870
And that's Google Cloud Messaging.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:39.860
And that's what I'm going to attempt to display
on the screen behind me.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:44.710
So you start off with your app that's running
on each of the user's phones.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.710
So that's what we're looking at here.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.490
Now, what you need to do first is register
the phone with the Google Cloud Messaging

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.510
server.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:41:00.190
And that's going to uniquely identify this
device will temporarily use or run it with

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.190
Google.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.920
That's then going to send a message back up
to the device.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.420
And stop pointing because clearly I'm bad
at this.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.140
Weather presenter, not in my future.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:16.390
But what you now have on each of the devices
is a unique address which you can then use

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:20.120
from your server via Google Cloud Messaging
to talk to that particular app.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:25.830
So, the next thing you need to do is actually
send that down to your server.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:31.580
And now what your server has hopefully is
a hash of the username or user identifier

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.770
that has logged in to that particular phone
and that phone combined.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.980
And now you have an address that you can send
messages using.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.220
So, you're basically all set to go.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:47.530
So what happens now is a user using that tablet
at home makes a change to a shopping list.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:48.781
You send that down to your server.

00:41:48.781 --> 00:41:50.620
Your server goes, "Oh, okay.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.620
Yup.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.620
Updated the lists.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:57.840
Now, I need everyone to who has access to
this shared list to see what the changes are."

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:05.210
So it is now going to send a message to the
Google Cloud Messaging to each of those apps

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.160
using the addresses which you've got registered
with it.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.780
Google Cloud Messaging is then going to send
that to each of the devices which are going

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:16.210
to get pinged using temp receiver and they're
going to go, "Oh, okay.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:21.220
Look, I have changes to this," so they then
have the option to ping the server and ask

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.830
for those specific updates, or if it's small
enough change, you can actually package it

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.560
in the payload of the message that you're
going to send.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.110
Look, Ian's in the cloud.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.110
So that's basically how it works.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.030
And so you don't ever have to do polling.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.860
You're basically just updating the server
and the server is directly transmitting that

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.970
information to each of the devices which need
to be updated.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yay.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.570
Okay.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.590
So that's a--that's a great tip and something
that you should really check into because

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.150
that really didn't cost you anything.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.460
It's entirely cost-free.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.460
But it does...

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...save your device--your user's
this device has a lot of battery life and

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.550
actually means that the latency between changes
is reduced as well so it's kind of win-win.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.680
Now, of course, this isn't magic.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.090
I mean it's not like we're, you know, we don't
have a way to just phone up that device there's

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:18.840
still is polling involved but the important
thing is that all of the messages are set

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.350
in one batch instead of each app making its
own network connection and possibly screwing

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:30.920
up the network connection using not only bandwidth
but battery and CPU time as well.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.920
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920
Okay.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.990
So there's another tip as well which I wanted
to point out and that is about how to share

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.990
those contact with.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.990
So at the moment...

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...you hit--share this list and
it will pop up a dialogue asking for an email

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:44.410
address.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:45.410
Which is reasonable.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.810
But I don't memorize email addresses anymore.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:47.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know why?

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I don't memorize anything.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:50.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, I don't know this email.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.850
I don't because it's all in my Gmail.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:52.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:53.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Or my Google+.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:54.850
And all that sync to my phone.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:58.480
So everyway I have to contact with someone
is already in my phone.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.970
So I kind of resent having to type something
that already exists.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, rather than asking users to
copy and paste email addresses, you can use

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:06.410
the contact picker.

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:09.970
So they can choose the contact from the existing
contact list.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.060
And the way that works is actually pretty
straight forward.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.560
You start by creating an intent again.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: A lot of things tend to work with
intents and this time the action is pick and

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:24.710
the data that you want to pick from is contacts
or to put it more specifically, it's slightly

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.960
less clearly be ContactsContract-ContentProvider.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.930
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love it.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:30.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All at one time.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, these things are actually
just made to become tongue twisters ideally.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.210
And we love the alliteration here in Androids
so there'll be a lot of A words as much as

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.220
we can anyway.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.880
So you send out that intent, start an activity
for results.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.901
So, that's going then open up contacts picker,
users going to click on something and it's

00:44:46.901 --> 00:44:49.790
going to send you back a URI.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:54.470
And what this massive screen full of code
does is actually pretty straight forward.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.090
We get a URI to a particular contact back
from the contact picker.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:04.670
We're going to extract idea by using query
on a--on a content provider, once we have

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:09.350
that we're going to use that ID then make
another query this time on the database for

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.550
the Content Provider which contains the email
addresses.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:15.280
So it's basically going to say "We have this
ID, what is this associated email?"

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.960
And that's what you see here is that that
last part of actually pulling out the email

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.520
address from the query result of that course.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.500
So once you've done that you've got the email
address, it's good font then just pop that

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.030
into the edit text make the user can confirm
it, modify it necessary before it go on and

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.340
send of the email.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.020
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Cool.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So it's a fairly straight forward
process and I think something which really

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.110
makes life a lot easier and in fact you can...

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.171
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...possibly even go a step further
here which is--well, you have the email address

00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:49.720
and if you are logging people in using their
email address is then maybe you don't need

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.190
to send them an email if they already had
an account maybe you can just send a notification

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:54.190
direct to the point.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:55.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.190
Maybe you could do both.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Maybe you could do both.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600
Exactly.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So let's have a look.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.390
So let's move on to the--to the next app which
was Zoum tools.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.790
So Zoum Task has a gorgeous feature graphic.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:11.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:16.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And really nice design and honestly
it does almost nothing.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:20.401
It's a--I mean it's a bare bones task.

00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:21.401
I mean it doesn't seem...

00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:22.401
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a beautiful looking app...

00:46:22.401 --> 00:46:23.401
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It...

00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:25.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...which has all of the marketing
stuff down perfectly.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.360
It's really an example of exactly what you
should do to make sure that your app is likely

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.619
to be downloaded.

00:46:30.619 --> 00:46:31.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:38.180
Yeah, absolutely the--there's a ton of stuff
that we could talk about starting with where

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.190
they got that check mark.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.150
I don't think we should even show that.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Probably not.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:47.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm going to end up in a sweatshop
in South East Asia somewhere.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:55.650
But what I did want to point out is what happens
when you fill out a form incorrectly and you...

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:56.650
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:00.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Obviously you never want to punish
your user for doing something but there are

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.630
certain cases where you have to do data validation.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:07.110
You know that there's probably something wrong
when you've tried to add a task without name

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.110
for instance.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:09.210
Well, that's the example they chose.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.210
So why don't I hit okay here.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:14.210
But I haven't put in a task title and if you'd
see that.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:15.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's wiggling.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.210
It's wiggling...

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it's [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's [INDISTINCT] I love it its

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.890
going "No, no, no."

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:27.190
So it's a universal signal that you got something
wrong in this particular piece of UI.

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Pay attention to this bit.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:32.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right, but it doesn't give you
a toast that says, "Please do not press that

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.300
button again."

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.810
It doesn't give you a dialogue that says,
"You screwed up.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:38.470
Press okay to accept this and move on with
your life."

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:42.070
Instead it just gives you a little nudge to
say that something...

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Maybe...

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...a little off here.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...we'll get this.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:47.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This isn't the only way you could
do it.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.110
I mean you could turn the field red; you could
put an exclamation point next to it.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:58.580
The point is that you want your data validation
to be A, unintrusive and B, specific.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And people should not have to
read your text in order to figure out what

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.870
they did wrong.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.550
This is beautiful because I could use this
even if I didn't speak English.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:10.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:15.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love this feature and I really
like the way that they've implemented this

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.680
particular little shake.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.880
It's buttery, it's nice and it just gets the
job done.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.200
And that's--I think kind of the resounding
theme for this app is that it's designed really

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200
well.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:33.480
It's simple, it's got those nice little bits
of polish but almost ironically or certainly

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.430
different from a usual expectations.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.350
The polish is the functionality isn't.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:42.030
Now, in fairness we are comparing it in a
category up against apps that are design to

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:46.160
optimize the shopping experience rather than
specifically to do list which is really more

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.160
an example of.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:53.540
But even still if you look at an apps like
Tasks from Tasks team they kind of do a neater

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.540
job.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.870
Apart from anything else it doesn't synchronize
to a service any where.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:01.430
So if it's--the only place that I can get
to it is on my device and if my device gets

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.430
flashed, this is gone forever.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:03.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.170
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And that's kind of a--it kind of
sucks.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:06.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.170
That's gets old.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.170
Okay.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.550
So, I don't think we're going to talk about
Zoum Task anymore and we are just about out

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:17.250
of time if we were going by real world time
as oppose to the fake time that we use when

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.720
we screw stuff up in the middle of the show.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.912
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Around that time it doesn't count.

00:49:20.912 --> 00:49:21.912
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, it does not.

00:49:21.912 --> 00:49:22.912
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And so let's have a look.

00:49:22.912 --> 00:49:26.750
So one of the--I think the last app that we
wanted to look at was Prixing or Pri depending

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:29.040
on how you choose to miss pronounce a French
word.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.770
And I think about this app, the defining feature
of this app is that it is entirely in French.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.330
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is fine.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:41.940
There's certainly no problem with that except
that we don't speak French.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:42.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.940
So it's...

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That makes [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...difficult for us to...

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...on for us to fairly sort of evaluate
it.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.360
And so we won't really go in too much detail.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.330
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I will say that I wanted to use
it.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:51.330
Because...

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:52.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a beautiful looking app.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...it's looking really, really
pretty.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.540
They've used pictures every other of it makes
sense.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.950
They just--there isn't any boring text.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:59.960
It's laid out like a magazine.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:01.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I really, really like it.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:02.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It makes you want to go shopping.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:10.990
To the only concern hat I have is as I tap
on some of these beautiful pictures it's taking

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.330
me to WebViews.

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.630
It's taking me out of the app, so I do question.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:20.400
Any app that launches a WebView makes me think
well maybe this app isn't actually all that

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.400
functional.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, it gets [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know what; it takes me out

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.870
to the Internet.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:27.170
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...to why am I having to go to the
browser at all, WebView to do that functionality.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.170
Again it's hard to be...

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:30.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...entirely fair without knowing
exactly what we're pressing.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.730
It may say click here to view this on a web
page but...

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:35.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That is--that's quite true.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.030
That might be right.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:41.320
This particular style of picture might be
the universal I'm a web page picture in...

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...certain French speaking areas
of the world.

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.660
We have no idea.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, so then it looks like a really
fully featured app.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.620
Certainly the reviews that it gets on Google
Play a very, very encouraging.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.030
It's a beautiful looking app.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:56.570
It's got things like coupons and, you know,
loyalty cards and all this sorts of stuff

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.690
that we saw in Grocery IQ.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:58.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:02.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And Out Of Milk but unfortunately
we can't really review it because we don't

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:03.210
speak the language.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.480
Now that does actually bring up two kind of
important points.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And one is that I should kind of
be able to use an app like this without being

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.720
able to speak the language which is written
in.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Possibly, yeah.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.270
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, it maybe stretch but here
I wasn't able to get very far at all before

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.680
just going--doing--know what to do.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I can't believe you don't even
have like French speaking friends though.

00:51:22.369 --> 00:51:23.369
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I probably--well...

00:51:23.369 --> 00:51:24.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean...

00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:25.369
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes, it's a shame there's no French
[INDISTINCT]

00:51:25.369 --> 00:51:26.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You're not even American.

00:51:26.369 --> 00:51:29.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...in the Android team.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.390
That would be...

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:32.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:33.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Anyway.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But since--so that maybe it's [INDISTINCT].

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:35.480
So--and this goes for people running English
language apps as well.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:41.590
See what happens when you translate all of
your apps into gibberish and see whether it's

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:42.590
usable.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:43.590
I think it's...

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:44.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's a fantastic idea.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:45.812
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's kind of a really good way
to see how does the phone work?

00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:46.812
What are the...

00:51:46.812 --> 00:51:47.812
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: UX fuzz testing basically.

00:51:47.812 --> 00:51:48.812
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:51:48.812 --> 00:51:51.370
Yeah it's like well, if you put this in front
of someone and they don't know what the words

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:52.500
are, can they still figure it out?

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.460
Does--what are the buttons they're pressing
by default?

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:59.010
Because whatever flow they're doing instinctively
you want to be the right flow.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:03.060
And so you want the words to just back up
what they intuitively feel that they should

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.060
be doing.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.339
And the other two of course is maybe consider
an English translation.

00:52:06.339 --> 00:52:07.339
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:52:07.339 --> 00:52:08.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There's a lot of English speakers.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:14.320
And it's probably one of the--of if not the
largest market in terms of your Android consumers

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.740
are going to be English speakers.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: English.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.130
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So considering investing in that
translation particularly because Prixing has

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.890
been around for awhile.

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:21.890
Really popular.

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.560
A great way to grow your user base.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.300
Unless the apps is only used for in France
or French speaking places.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.781
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: In which case it makes a lot

00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:34.140
of sense to go ahead and just take it out
of the English speaking market.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:39.610
Because remember anytime that you have your
app presented to people who aren't going to

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:44.470
be able to use it whether it's because their
phone isn't high tech enough or they don't

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:50.150
have the right API level or in this case they
don't have--they don't speak the language

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:51.620
that you do.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.800
You're going to get at least some people who
are frustrated and give you bad reviews because

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.410
of that and you don't deserve that.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:00.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, you want to make sure that you
are--you know we encouraged people to build

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:04.630
apps which is usable by as many different
people and many different devices as possible.

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.680
If you choose not to that's fine.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:11.940
But, you know, don't encourage negative feedback
by offering it to people who aren't going

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.940
to be able to use it.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.940
Cool.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.119
Well, I think that gets us to the end of our
app list.

00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:18.119
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:53:18.119 --> 00:53:21.541
Let's take a look at some of the specific
prescriptions that we have for this app.

00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:26.010
So these are the things that we would love
people to do to take the apps to the next

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.010
level.

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely, I can't wait.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.180
Before we do though it occurs to me that we
haven't check in with producer Louise in awhile.

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.070
Hey producer Louise, how's the YouTube stream
going?

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.830
&gt;&gt; YouTube stream is going very well.

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.480
There are questions going around Grocery IQ
being available in central Europe.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.030
It appears that it is not.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:42.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.570
&gt;&gt; So their concerns about geographical availability.

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:45.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:46.980
&gt;&gt; People are very excited to see the code
samples.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.570
They are encouraged to use the Cloud in terms
of publishing their apps.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:52.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's good.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:53.600
&gt;&gt; So that's very good.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.060
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Good to hear.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.820
&gt;&gt; They're also--some of influence feedback
for talking about how you would get prices

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.700
for items from different stores and put them
into the app.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Excellent.

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:07.390
&gt;&gt; It's probably unusual that people would
do that and shop around but for those who

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:10.640
want to--like to Google and add that to apps
like Grocery IQ.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think that's a great idea although
that's sounds like--no, I'm sorry did we mic

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:15.710
Producer Lewis?

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:16.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, but...

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.710
&gt;&gt; That's what--I was speaking loudly toward
Reto.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:18.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I hope so...

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:19.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I can say that just...

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:20.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...yes.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:21.710
He...

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's feedback coming through.

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.710
Well, just in case.

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.940
So, the question--the last question was just
around collecting information from different

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.500
store, pricing information, things like that.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:37.280
Absolutely but I think this seems like one
of those things were there's a business opportunity.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.280
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.300
I mean I could go around to a bunch of stores
and collect price information but what would

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.640
be even more interesting is if I sent a dozen
guys around with, you know, back pack cameras

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.410
or something and they collected price information
for me and then I'll put that in the Cloud

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.410
and monetized it in some way.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.410
So, something to think about.

00:54:54.410 --> 00:55:00.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And I think its interesting challenge,
when you're looking at price comparison especially

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.040
for it to be really useful with an app.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.130
You want to be able to pull in a real time
feed of process for all the different competitive

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:11.650
supermarkets--strictly we're talking about
groceries and I'm sure there APIs exist but

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:15.280
probably not in a way that will allow you
to do exactly that because...

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's no saver system for groceries.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.630
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's probably not what the groceries
store want you to do.

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:21.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Have all the same list and know
exactly which shop to go to.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.380
It's...

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:27.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'll tell you--let me give you
an real world example though because--you

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:31.540
know, as we've discussed on the story the
whole point of going to college and working

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:35.670
for Google is that I don't have to count pennies
on my grocery bill.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:37.350
So, I don't.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:43.010
I don't care how much my beer costs, unless
is it at one place that sells the 99.95 beer

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:44.010
for 17.95...

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's seems...

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...those guys ripped me off man.

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:51.890
But I tell you what do I count, calories...

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's true.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So--yeah, after working for Google
for three years and 30 pounds heavier than

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.810
I was when I was when I started.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:03.550
I love to get my calories down, that's something
that I would love to see budgeted in the shopping

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:04.550
app...

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:05.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and it has just so happens
that at least in the United States, the FDA

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:14.550
the government has a database of many different
foods and their nutritional information.

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.730
And you can see apps that do this, there's
a--I think the weighting's apps does it.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.430
There's a several fitness apps that do it...

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...but it would be great if that
could be in the shopping app too.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:25.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Again, because this is really going
back to what we were saying, you know, it's

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.570
really about trying to add as much functionalities
as you can which you--we have to go to other

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:33.810
places and the beauty of this is you have
to create a shopping list.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.990
And what were really talking about here is
incentivizing you to do that shopping list

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:38.110
in this app.

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:41.560
By saying if you write it down here once,
then suddenly we will be able to give you

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.490
recipe IDs--ideas based on the things that
you bought.

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:48.880
We'll be able to tell you the Calorie intake
of the things which were in this list.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:54.700
We can keep track if your international pre-buying
a budget over time to see whether it's trending

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.260
up or trending down.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.240
These are the sorts of things which I think
can really add benefit.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But tell us--let's get specific...

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let go ahead and take...

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.601
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...let's have a look...

00:57:02.601 --> 00:57:03.601
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...yeah.

00:57:03.601 --> 00:57:06.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...we'll step out of the way of
the Out of Milk and again I think we mentioned

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.590
this before would be--wouldn't been useful
to copy this text somewhere we could actual

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.550
read it, but we'll let you guys read it and
give--I guess overall thoughts.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right, well I can almost read
it because I have a better...

00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:16.789
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT].

00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:17.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...eyes than you...

00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:18.789
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Excellent.

00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:19.789
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and then so yeah...

00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:21.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, so I have better glasses but
the good folks in me Google Drive team kick

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.040
them off my face in soccer this week so, I
had to revert...

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, you don't even know what
that cost me, to set that up.

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:30.270
Okay.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:36.340
So for out of milk, there's several designed
things we would like to be seen but I--the

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:41.440
functionality seems really nice and we just
like it to be easier to get to you so how

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:47.180
about the contacts picker, how about letting
me sign in with my account without having

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.500
to put in my email address.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.640
Let's go on then.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.180
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, the next app was a Grocery IQ
and we really like this app.

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:00.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Why did we put this behind [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, we can put it in front certainly.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.600
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, there we go.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.600
Okay.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.600
Great.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.600
All right.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.170
So, you know, what I can't actually read it,
I lied.

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT] the thing about Grocery
IQ, I think really what it comes down to,

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.060
apart from this specific things that we've
got there.

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, look at us.

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT] oh, I see, so we can
actually read.

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:18.970
It's a nice touch.

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:19.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, that's cool.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It feels with [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, wow.

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:23.420
Thanks for this Chrome book Luis.

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So shinny.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I can't believe how useful it
is.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:27.770
Okay.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:31.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Really, I think that the key thing
for me for Grocery IQ is, you know, you got

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:37.100
great designers they created a really great
work flow, user flow, for an earlier time

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.320
in the Android Ecosystem.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.430
I'd love, love, love to see this app.

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:44.951
With the same functionality just--and the
same design as frankly but just making it

00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:47.850
consistent what we currently expect to see
in Android.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:51.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it just needs to be updated
and it needs to use Google Could Messaging

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.700
instead of polling, that's really important.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:58.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And then as we said with the
other apps, a little bit tighter integration

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:02.650
in terms of contacts, URLs, and account management
would be really welcomed.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.270
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Basically one of the things we're
talking about had been relatively recently

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:11.310
added to Android and so I think it literally
is a case for this app for something which

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.880
has been designed--has done really, really
well...

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:17.119
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...has the functionality it needs
and now it just needs to have those occasional

00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:20.240
refreshers to take advantage with the new
features with Android...

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Great.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...platform has.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Move along.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.240
So, Zoum Task.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Keep going.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Keep going tracking buddy.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a--its beautiful, its wonderful
to see someone who's putting so much thought

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.820
and effort into the designs side.

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:36.020
Definitely an inspiration for people in terms
of what you should you be doing on your Google

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.690
Play listing in terms on your icon design
and creates something really compelling...

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:39.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:42.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...just need to follow through now
and see some more functionality added into

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:43.670
the app.

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Do you know what's going to happen
now?

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:46.021
&gt;&gt; MEIER: What's going to happen?

00:59:46.021 --> 00:59:48.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Roman's going to pick this one
for Android design and action and he's going

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:51.940
to prove us wrong he's just tell us how everything
should be different.

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:55.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Happily I've looked into the future
and I happen to know which of the two apps

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.600
that Roman would be reviewing so, it won't
be Zoum Task.

00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.930
And that's it.

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because now I think about it
Zoum Task didn't have any gradients anywhere

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:03.720
so Roman wouldn't care...

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's true.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Roman really loves it.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720
He probably does.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.640
And the last app we looked at was Prixing.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.330
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And Prixing the main problem
for us is that we just don't speak this language.

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:17.530
I don't know why we reviewed it, not speaking
the language.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We love a challenge.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we just wanted to--just sort
of flaunt our ignorance.

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:27.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: In it--if like we need to flaunt
it its clearly obvious to anyone who cares

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880
to look.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.200
It actually was the highest scored app, both
on the Trailer page and Moderator because

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.259
people really wanted us to look at it.

01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:35.259
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

01:00:35.259 --> 01:00:38.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which implies there a lot French
speakers watching the show so bonjour.

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.210
And that's about it as far as I can go in
French.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:44.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that's only because it's
also a network protocol.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280
So, we will...

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...maybe get some French speakers

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840
out here to...

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely, or maybe...

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...to help us out.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:50.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...or maybe get some...

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The entire graphics team is French
basically.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly, you shouldn't be too much
of a stretch.

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:54.590
Perfect, so...

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:55.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:58.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That was each of the apps you wanted
us to look at and we're basically up to an

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:01.380
hour, so that's all for today's App Clinic.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.110
Roman and Nick and Adam will be performing
a design make over of some of today's apps,

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:09.550
in particular they can look at Grocery IQ,
and Out of Milk which is great, there two

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:10.550
of our favorites.

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.770
That will be on Android design in action on
Tuesday.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:18.030
And we will also be checking in on the patients
which we looked at today and in the previous

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.810
weeks over the next few weeks to see how they're
coming along.

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:26.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Great, now make sure visit our
Trello page to nominate the apps and the categories

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.390
you like to see us review.

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:33.090
We have decided to move away from Moderator
because Trello is way more hip, we threw Moderator

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.490
on the ground, not a part of their system.

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:43.390
Next week we'll be looking at Trello to see
if anyone has nominated Halloween themed apps.

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:45.849
Reto was convinced that such a thing existed...

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:47.829
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a big holiday, there's pumpkins
on everyone's porch.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.670
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I believed that there was no
such thing.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:53.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I may have been proven wrong in
an instance.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, next week it's going to be
trick or treat.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.550
Were going to--were going to review what ever
we feel like.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:07.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly, if you are satisfied with
Ian proving me wrong then by all means, don't

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:11.470
nominate any further apps if you would like
to see me proven right, please, please...

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:16.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, absolutely if you have a
candy scanner, if you have a where's the best

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:19.920
house in the neighborhood for loot, if you
have a...

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Wait...

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...something that automatically
locates home made pop corn bowls and UNICEF

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:28.710
pennies, go ahead nominate that stuff, we
want to see it.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:29.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm sure it exists.

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:31.450
I refuse to believe that they don't.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:34.890
I think people were just boo guarding the
good Halloween apps, because they don't want

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:39.030
other people--if everyone has an app that
tells you where the best place to get candies,

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:41.500
then there are no best places to get candy.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, the incredible's quote, nice.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.810
Well, will see next week we're going to try
it out, see what happens...

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: See what we get.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...in our special Halloween episode,
where I think I'll be going as a doctor.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Outstanding.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.160
I don't know how you come up with these things.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.619
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-uh, I'm cleaver that way.

01:02:58.619 --> 01:03:01.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Thanks for joining us, my name Reto
Meier.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And this was the App Clinic.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Take care.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:04.549
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Thanks for watching.
