00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
we're going to be talking about kissing

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290
we're going to be talking about kissing
 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.730
we're going to be talking about kissing
numbers which is perhaps less exciting

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740
numbers which is perhaps less exciting
 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.710
numbers which is perhaps less exciting
than it sounds it sounds like we're

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
than it sounds it sounds like we're
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.240
than it sounds it sounds like we're
taking the name of the channel a bit too

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250
taking the name of the channel a bit too
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.870
taking the name of the channel a bit too
far

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
far
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.759
far
kissing numbers is it's actually about

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
kissing numbers is it's actually about
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.400
kissing numbers is it's actually about
how many spheres we can fit around a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
how many spheres we can fit around a
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.259
how many spheres we can fit around a
central sphere it comes from billiards

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
central sphere it comes from billiards
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.260
central sphere it comes from billiards
so when two billiards make contact they

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
so when two billiards make contact they
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.870
so when two billiards make contact they
kiss and this actually was the source of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
kiss and this actually was the source of
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.929
kiss and this actually was the source of
a disagreement between two

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939
a disagreement between two
 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.759
a disagreement between two
mathematicians a guy called Isaac Newton

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
mathematicians a guy called Isaac Newton
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.870
mathematicians a guy called Isaac Newton
I don't know if you've heard of him and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
I don't know if you've heard of him and
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089
I don't know if you've heard of him and
a guy called David Gregory and they

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
a guy called David Gregory and they
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980
a guy called David Gregory and they
disagreed how many Spears you could fit

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
disagreed how many Spears you could fit
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590
disagreed how many Spears you could fit
around a central sphere so David Gregory

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
around a central sphere so David Gregory
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.389
around a central sphere so David Gregory
went to Isaac Newton because he's the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
went to Isaac Newton because he's the
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.220
went to Isaac Newton because he's the
he's the guy right they were talking

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
he's the guy right they were talking
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.930
he's the guy right they were talking
about planets and how they move around

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
about planets and how they move around
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.240
about planets and how they move around
and then they went off topic and Newton

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
and then they went off topic and Newton
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.940
and then they went off topic and Newton
said you can fit 12 spheres around a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
said you can fit 12 spheres around a
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250
said you can fit 12 spheres around a
central sphere David Gregory thought no

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
central sphere David Gregory thought no
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.979
central sphere David Gregory thought no
actually I think possibly you might be

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
actually I think possibly you might be
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.709
actually I think possibly you might be
able to fit 13 fit one more in if you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
able to fit 13 fit one more in if you
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330
able to fit 13 fit one more in if you
look at the traditional hexagonal

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
look at the traditional hexagonal
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.459
look at the traditional hexagonal
packing this would be twelve spheres

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
packing this would be twelve spheres
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.049
packing this would be twelve spheres
around the central sphere so you got the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
around the central sphere so you got the
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360
around the central sphere so you got the
central sphere here you got six going

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
central sphere here you got six going
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279
central sphere here you got six going
around the equator you would have three

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
around the equator you would have three
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.920
around the equator you would have three
at the top and three below it which

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
at the top and three below it which
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.539
at the top and three below it which
means you have twelve spheres fitting

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
means you have twelve spheres fitting
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130
means you have twelve spheres fitting
around the central sphere and if you

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
around the central sphere and if you
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.120
around the central sphere and if you
extend that forever

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
extend that forever
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.250
extend that forever
that's the hexagonal packing and that's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
that's the hexagonal packing and that's
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899
that's the hexagonal packing and that's
rigid as well it doesn't seem possible

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
rigid as well it doesn't seem possible
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390
rigid as well it doesn't seem possible
that you can fit in any extra spheres

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
that you can fit in any extra spheres
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399
that you can fit in any extra spheres
into that structure well actually that's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
into that structure well actually that's
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620
into that structure well actually that's
not the only way our fitting spheres

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
not the only way our fitting spheres
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929
not the only way our fitting spheres
around the central sphere another

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
around the central sphere another
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.179
around the central sphere another
possibility would be something more like

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
possibility would be something more like
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.840
possibility would be something more like
the spots on a football I said I was

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
the spots on a football I said I was
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.060
the spots on a football I said I was
going to hope it I had it there it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
going to hope it I had it there it
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.910
going to hope it I had it there it
wasn't so imagine we put the spheres

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920
wasn't so imagine we put the spheres
 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.230
wasn't so imagine we put the spheres
exactly where the spots are on this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
exactly where the spots are on this
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730
exactly where the spots are on this
football so there'd be one at the top

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
football so there'd be one at the top
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.640
football so there'd be one at the top
would be one at the bottom and then we'd

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
would be one at the bottom and then we'd
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190
would be one at the bottom and then we'd
have a row of five around the top and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
have a row of five around the top and
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800
have a row of five around the top and
another row of five round here at the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
another row of five round here at the
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.649
another row of five round here at the
bottom so I've got a prop here so it's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
bottom so I've got a prop here so it's
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840
bottom so I've got a prop here so it's
made out of bouncing balls and cocktail

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
made out of bouncing balls and cocktail
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480
made out of bouncing balls and cocktail
sticks kind of like the football I was

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
sticks kind of like the football I was
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.950
sticks kind of like the football I was
trying to fit spheres around the central

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
trying to fit spheres around the central
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469
trying to fit spheres around the central
sphere but can you see if I do that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
sphere but can you see if I do that
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.539
sphere but can you see if I do that
there were massive gaps I don't even I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
there were massive gaps I don't even I
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999
there were massive gaps I don't even I
can turn it over find any other massive

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
can turn it over find any other massive
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.300
can turn it over find any other massive
gaps no could see another massive gap

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
gaps no could see another massive gap
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.580
gaps no could see another massive gap
here perhaps if we bunch up these

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
here perhaps if we bunch up these
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950
here perhaps if we bunch up these
spheres these gaps will be big enough to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
spheres these gaps will be big enough to
 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930
spheres these gaps will be big enough to
fit in at an extra one so that was the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
fit in at an extra one so that was the
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.280
fit in at an extra one so that was the
problem so let's see who was correct

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
problem so let's see who was correct
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.619
problem so let's see who was correct
you can think Newton all right let's

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629
you can think Newton all right let's
 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.050
you can think Newton all right let's
have a look so it's not obvious what is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
have a look so it's not obvious what is
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.849
have a look so it's not obvious what is
the correct answer let me show you why

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859
the correct answer let me show you why
 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.240
the correct answer let me show you why
you might think it's 13 imagine I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
you might think it's 13 imagine I
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.020
you might think it's 13 imagine I
contained this prop I've made in another

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
contained this prop I've made in another
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.960
contained this prop I've made in another
sphere so if these had radius 1 then the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
sphere so if these had radius 1 then the
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580
sphere so if these had radius 1 then the
big sphere that's going to contain it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
big sphere that's going to contain it
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800
big sphere that's going to contain it
would have a radius of 3 and fact I'll

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
would have a radius of 3 and fact I'll
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.830
would have a radius of 3 and fact I'll
draw it out five six something like that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
draw it out five six something like that
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.379
draw it out five six something like that
right these are Spears so imagine they

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389
right these are Spears so imagine they
 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.030
right these are Spears so imagine they
are spheres now we're going to contain

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
are spheres now we're going to contain
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.209
are spheres now we're going to contain
this in a larger sphere now imagine we

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219
this in a larger sphere now imagine we
 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.000
this in a larger sphere now imagine we
put a light right in the middle of this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
put a light right in the middle of this
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740
put a light right in the middle of this
sphere so we're going to shine a light

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
sphere so we're going to shine a light
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.929
sphere so we're going to shine a light
and we're going to cast a shadow on the

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939
and we're going to cast a shadow on the
 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.069
and we're going to cast a shadow on the
inside of the surface of the big sphere

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079
inside of the surface of the big sphere
 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.409
inside of the surface of the big sphere
like this so if you do the calculations

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419
like this so if you do the calculations
 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.750
like this so if you do the calculations
and if you look at the area that these

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760
and if you look at the area that these
 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.149
and if you look at the area that these
shadows cast there is enough space on

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159
shadows cast there is enough space on
 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.119
shadows cast there is enough space on
the inside of this massive sphere to fit

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129
the inside of this massive sphere to fit
 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.569
the inside of this massive sphere to fit
14 shadows and nearly 15 actually not

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579
14 shadows and nearly 15 actually not
 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.270
14 shadows and nearly 15 actually not
quite enough for 15 but definitely 14 so

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
quite enough for 15 but definitely 14 so
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.729
quite enough for 15 but definitely 14 so
it seems like you should be able to fit

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
it seems like you should be able to fit
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.879
it seems like you should be able to fit
13 perhaps that argument would work if

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889
13 perhaps that argument would work if
 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.530
13 perhaps that argument would work if
we're talking about circles fitting

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
we're talking about circles fitting
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080
we're talking about circles fitting
circles within a one big circle and you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
circles within a one big circle and you
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.759
circles within a one big circle and you
looked at the shadows then you would get

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
looked at the shadows then you would get
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.280
looked at the shadows then you would get
six shadows and you can fit six circles

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
six shadows and you can fit six circles
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.289
six shadows and you can fit six circles
around the central circle so it seems

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
around the central circle so it seems
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.509
around the central circle so it seems
like this argument suggests that you can

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
like this argument suggests that you can
 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.170
like this argument suggests that you can
fit thirteen spheres maybe even 14 but

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
fit thirteen spheres maybe even 14 but
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.719
fit thirteen spheres maybe even 14 but
it was difficult to proof so if we want

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729
it was difficult to proof so if we want
 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.460
it was difficult to proof so if we want
to do it with two dimensions it's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
to do it with two dimensions it's
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.439
to do it with two dimensions it's
actually not that difficult to show that

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449
actually not that difficult to show that
 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.689
actually not that difficult to show that
the kissing number is six and you might

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699
the kissing number is six and you might
 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.770
the kissing number is six and you might
be able to see you then if they weren't

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
be able to see you then if they weren't
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.229
be able to see you then if they weren't
any closer they would overlap so it's

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239
any closer they would overlap so it's
 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.210
any closer they would overlap so it's
not too hard to show that six is the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
not too hard to show that six is the
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.920
not too hard to show that six is the
maximum number of circles you can fit

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
maximum number of circles you can fit
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.750
maximum number of circles you can fit
round here another way of saying that is

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
round here another way of saying that is
 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.149
round here another way of saying that is
if you look at the kissing points here

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159
if you look at the kissing points here
 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.289
if you look at the kissing points here
like this they make an angle of 60

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299
like this they make an angle of 60
 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.300
like this they make an angle of 60
degrees and that's true on a sphere as

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310
degrees and that's true on a sphere as
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.309
degrees and that's true on a sphere as
well the two kissing points will make an

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
well the two kissing points will make an
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.759
well the two kissing points will make an
angle of at least 60 degrees let me just

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769
angle of at least 60 degrees let me just
 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.110
angle of at least 60 degrees let me just
draw out a sphere to show you the sort

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120
draw out a sphere to show you the sort
 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.610
draw out a sphere to show you the sort
of thing I mean by that and this have a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
of thing I mean by that and this have a
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.469
of thing I mean by that and this have a
point on the surface let's call that

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479
point on the surface let's call that
 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.689

point X well give it a coordinate so in
 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.280
point X well give it a coordinate so in
three-dimensional space it would have

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290
three-dimensional space it would have
 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.390
three-dimensional space it would have

let's have another kissing point on the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
let's have another kissing point on the
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.379
let's have another kissing point on the

things I can tell you about these points

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639
things I can tell you about these points
 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.490
things I can tell you about these points
that are on this sphere if this is a

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500

on then I can tell you with a bit of

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389
on then I can tell you with a bit of
 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.429
on then I can tell you with a bit of
Pythagoras but if I use the coordinates

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439
Pythagoras but if I use the coordinates
 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.820
Pythagoras but if I use the coordinates
x1 squared plus x2 squared because x3

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830
x1 squared plus x2 squared because x3
 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.300
x1 squared plus x2 squared because x3
squared is equal to the radius squared

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310
squared is equal to the radius squared
 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.309
squared is equal to the radius squared
the radius is 1 so I can say that's

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319
the radius is 1 so I can say that's
 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.439
the radius is 1 so I can say that's
equal to 1 so that's going to be true

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449
equal to 1 so that's going to be true
 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.420
equal to 1 so that's going to be true
the other thing I wanted to point out is

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430
the other thing I wanted to point out is
 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.140
the other thing I wanted to point out is
the angle between these kissing points

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
the angle between these kissing points
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.230
the angle between these kissing points
is going to be at least 60 degrees now

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240
is going to be at least 60 degrees now
 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.869
is going to be at least 60 degrees now
there's a formula for working out the

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879
there's a formula for working out the
 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.360
there's a formula for working out the
angle using the coordinates based on the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370
angle using the coordinates based on the
 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.730
angle using the coordinates based on the
cosine of an angle so let's say the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740
cosine of an angle so let's say the
 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.769
cosine of an angle so let's say the
angle is Theta that's a traditional

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779
angle is Theta that's a traditional
 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.600
angle is Theta that's a traditional
symbol to use so we're going to look at

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610
symbol to use so we're going to look at
 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.420
symbol to use so we're going to look at
the cosine of that angle theta and the

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430
the cosine of that angle theta and the
 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.899
the cosine of that angle theta and the
formula for that using coordinates is X

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909
formula for that using coordinates is X
 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.709
formula for that using coordinates is X

want this angle to be greater than 60

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189
want this angle to be greater than 60
 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.300
want this angle to be greater than 60
degrees that means that this cosine is

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310
degrees that means that this cosine is
 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.209
degrees that means that this cosine is
less than 1/2 and we've got these two

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219
less than 1/2 and we've got these two
 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.670

work out how many kissing points we have
on the sphere so you can do that I've

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.089

seen a more modern proof of this by a

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460
seen a more modern proof of this by a
 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.450
seen a more modern proof of this by a
mathematician called Oleg mucin and he

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460
mathematician called Oleg mucin and he
 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.610
mathematician called Oleg mucin and he
showed that you can have a little

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620
showed that you can have a little
 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.860

I'll just go call it s for no reason he
showed that this thing is always greater

squared and less than 13 times the
 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.809
squared and less than 13 times the
kissing number which is enough to prove

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:07.819
kissing number which is enough to prove
 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.939
kissing number which is enough to prove
the kissing number has to be less than

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949
the kissing number has to be less than
 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.709
the kissing number has to be less than
13 the kissing number must be less than

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719
13 the kissing number must be less than
 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.499
13 the kissing number must be less than
13 so you can prove that is true but we

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509
13 so you can prove that is true but we
 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.300
13 so you can prove that is true but we
already know an example where the

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310
already know an example where the
 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.850
already know an example where the
kissing number is 12 so that's it

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860
kissing number is 12 so that's it
 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.249
kissing number is 12 so that's it
so the kissing number is 12 that must be

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259
so the kissing number is 12 that must be
 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.899
so the kissing number is 12 that must be
the maximum number that you can fit

the maximum number that you can fit
 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.480
the maximum number that you can fit
around a central sphere so guess who was

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490
around a central sphere so guess who was
 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.829

sphere and we're just going to extend
these formulas we already found for

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590
these formulas we already found for
 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.800
these formulas we already found for
three dimensions in four dimensions a

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810
three dimensions in four dimensions a
 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.589
three dimensions in four dimensions a
point that is on the surface would have

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599
point that is on the surface would have
 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.629
point that is on the surface would have
a first coordinate squared plus the

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639
a first coordinate squared plus the
 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.939
a first coordinate squared plus the
second coordinate squared plus the third

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949
second coordinate squared plus the third
 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.040
second coordinate squared plus the third
coordinate squared plus the fourth

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050
coordinate squared plus the fourth
 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.409
coordinate squared plus the fourth
coordinate squared would equal to the

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419
coordinate squared would equal to the
 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.749
coordinate squared would equal to the
radius squared which let's say it's

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759
radius squared which let's say it's
 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.119
radius squared which let's say it's
radius 1 would be 1 so I would just rely

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:37.129
radius 1 would be 1 so I would just rely
 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:38.829
radius 1 would be 1 so I would just rely
on what those formulas mean cuz I just

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:38.839
on what those formulas mean cuz I just
 

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:41.170
on what those formulas mean cuz I just
can't picture what a four-dimensional

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:41.180
can't picture what a four-dimensional
 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.899
can't picture what a four-dimensional
sphere would look like so but he had the

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:43.909
sphere would look like so but he had the
 

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:45.909
sphere would look like so but he had the
same argument so using these kind of

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919
same argument so using these kind of
 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.769
same argument so using these kind of
formulas went through the same kind of

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:47.779
formulas went through the same kind of
 

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:49.390
formulas went through the same kind of
argument and worked out the kissing

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400
argument and worked out the kissing
 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.029
argument and worked out the kissing
number for four-dimensional spheres had

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039
number for four-dimensional spheres had
 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.540
number for four-dimensional spheres had
to be less than 25 strictly less than 25

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:55.550
to be less than 25 strictly less than 25
 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.719
to be less than 25 strictly less than 25
and he already knew there was an example

00:07:58.719 --> 00:07:58.729
and he already knew there was an example
 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.570
and he already knew there was an example
of 24 so there is a structure that has a

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:01.580
of 24 so there is a structure that has a
 

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.119
of 24 so there is a structure that has a
kissing number of 24 it's called the 24

00:08:04.119 --> 00:08:04.129
kissing number of 24 it's called the 24
 

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:06.610
kissing number of 24 it's called the 24
cell it's in the 4 dimensional space

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620
cell it's in the 4 dimensional space
 

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.010
cell it's in the 4 dimensional space
but we already know one that has 24 so

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.020
but we already know one that has 24 so
 

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.610
but we already know one that has 24 so
that's it

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:09.620
that's it
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.040
that's it
so the kissing number in dimension 4 is

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.050
so the kissing number in dimension 4 is
 

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.950
so the kissing number in dimension 4 is
24 for higher dimensions

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960
24 for higher dimensions
 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.800
24 for higher dimensions
5 6 7 we don't know we don't know what

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:17.810
5 6 7 we don't know we don't know what
 

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.050
5 6 7 we don't know we don't know what
the kissing numbers are but bizarrely we

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.060
the kissing numbers are but bizarrely we
 

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.990
the kissing numbers are but bizarrely we
do know the answer in dimensions 8 and

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000
do know the answer in dimensions 8 and
 

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.219
do know the answer in dimensions 8 and
dimensions 24 so in dimension 8 so

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:27.229
dimensions 24 so in dimension 8 so
 

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:29.529
dimensions 24 so in dimension 8 so
imagine eight dimensional spheres the

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:29.539
imagine eight dimensional spheres the
 

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:32.709
imagine eight dimensional spheres the
kissing number is 240 so you would have

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719
kissing number is 240 so you would have
 

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:35.529
kissing number is 240 so you would have
240 spheres around a central sphere and

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:35.539
240 spheres around a central sphere and
 

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.709
240 spheres around a central sphere and
in dimension 24 the kissing number is

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719
in dimension 24 the kissing number is
 

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.670
in dimension 24 the kissing number is
190 6500 imagine all those spheres

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680
190 6500 imagine all those spheres
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.069
190 6500 imagine all those spheres
around a central sphere and we know the

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:45.079
around a central sphere and we know the
 

00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:46.600
around a central sphere and we know the
kissing numbers in those particular

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:46.610
kissing numbers in those particular
 

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.329
kissing numbers in those particular
dimensions because we have structures

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:49.339
dimensions because we have structures
 

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:52.300
dimensions because we have structures
that are particularly regular which

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.310
that are particularly regular which
 

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.590
that are particularly regular which
makes it easier to prove

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600
makes it easier to prove
 

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.920
makes it easier to prove
what the kissing number is now those are

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:56.930
what the kissing number is now those are
 

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.439
what the kissing number is now those are
regular structures there is no reason to

00:08:59.439 --> 00:08:59.449
regular structures there is no reason to
 

00:08:59.449 --> 00:09:01.689
regular structures there is no reason to
believe that in higher dimensions that

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:01.699
believe that in higher dimensions that
 

00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:03.730
believe that in higher dimensions that
the maximum kissing number is going to

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.740
the maximum kissing number is going to
 

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.710
the maximum kissing number is going to
be with a regular structure it's

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720
be with a regular structure it's
 

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.879
be with a regular structure it's
probably going to be an irregular

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:06.889
probably going to be an irregular
 

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:09.069
probably going to be an irregular
structure in fact I can give you an

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079
structure in fact I can give you an
 

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:10.660
structure in fact I can give you an
example of that because in dimension

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:10.670
example of that because in dimension
 

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.269
example of that because in dimension
nine we've shown that all the regular

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279
nine we've shown that all the regular
 

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:15.730
nine we've shown that all the regular
structures have a kissing number that is

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:15.740
structures have a kissing number that is
 

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.689
structures have a kissing number that is
less than 272 but we have an example of

00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:19.699
less than 272 but we have an example of
 

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:22.030
less than 272 but we have an example of
an irregular structure which has a

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.040
an irregular structure which has a
 

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.120
an irregular structure which has a
kissing number of 306 so it's higher

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.130
kissing number of 306 so it's higher
 

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.400
kissing number of 306 so it's higher
than all the regular structures so why

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.410
than all the regular structures so why
 

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.160
than all the regular structures so why
are 8 and 24 special in this when we

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.170
are 8 and 24 special in this when we
 

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.780
are 8 and 24 special in this when we
have these regular structures in

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:31.790
have these regular structures in
 

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.749
have these regular structures in
dimensions 8 and in dimension 24 the

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:34.759
dimensions 8 and in dimension 24 the
 

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:37.059
dimensions 8 and in dimension 24 the
gaps start to get bigger and then they

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:37.069
gaps start to get bigger and then they
 

00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:40.030
gaps start to get bigger and then they
get so big that you can fit in extra

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040
get so big that you can fit in extra
 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.730
get so big that you can fit in extra
spheres into the gaps and that's true at

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:42.740
spheres into the gaps and that's true at
 

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.420
spheres into the gaps and that's true at
dimension 8 it's true at dimension 24 so

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:46.430
dimension 8 it's true at dimension 24 so
 

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.600
dimension 8 it's true at dimension 24 so
just because of that property we can

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:49.610
just because of that property we can
 

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.329
just because of that property we can
really pack in those spheres in those

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:52.339
really pack in those spheres in those
 

00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:55.240
