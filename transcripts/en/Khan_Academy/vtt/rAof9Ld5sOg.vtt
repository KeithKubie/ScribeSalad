00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.790
Welcome to the presentation
on derivatives.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.290
I think you're going to find
that this is when math starts

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.530
to become a lot more fun than
it was just a few topics ago.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.990
Well let's get started
with our derivatives.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.150
I know it sounds
very complicated.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.560
Well, in general, if I have a
straight line-- let me see if I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.990
can draw a straight line
properly-- if I had a straight

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.020
line-- that's my coordinate
axes, which aren't straight--

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.120
this is a straight line.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.630
But when I have a straight line
like that, and I ask you to

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.150
find the slope-- I think you
already know how to do this--

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.540
it's just the change in y
divided by the change in x.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
If I wanted to find the slope--
really I mean the slope is the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.140
same, because it is a straight
line, the slope is the same

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.040
across the whole line, but if I
want to find the slope at any

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.840
point in this line, what I
would do is I would pick a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.000
point x-- say I'd
pick this point.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.280
We'd pick a different color--
I'd take this point, I'd pick

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.840
this point-- it's pretty
arbitrary, I could pick any two

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.990
points, and I would figure out
what the change in y is-- this

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.860
is the change in y, delta y,
that's just another way of

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.860
saying change in y-- and
this is the change in x.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.920
delta x.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.140
And we figured out that the
slope is defined really as

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.250
change in y divided
by change in x.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.640
And another way of saying that
is delta-- it's that triangle--

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.180
delta y divided by delta x.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.660
Very straightforward.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.100
Now what happens, though,
if we're not dealing

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.860
with a straight line?

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.780
Let me see if I have
space to draw that.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.920
Another coordinate axes.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.780
Still pretty messy, but I
think you'll get the point.

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:02.960
Now let's say, instead of just
a regular line like this, this

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.690
follows the standard
y equals mx plus b.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.640
Let's just say I had the
curve y equals x squared.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.150
Let me draw it in a
different color.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.940
So y equals x squared looks
something like this.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.320
It's a curve, you're probably
pretty familiar with it by now.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.650
And what I'm going to
ask you is, what is the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.180
slope of this curve?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.440
And think about that.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.930
What does it mean to take
the slope of a curve now?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.150
Well, in this line, the slope
was the same throughout

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.400
the whole line.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.780
But if you look at this
curve, doesn't the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.960
slope change, right?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.560
Here it's almost flat, and it
gets steeper steeper steeper

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.865
steeper steeper until
gets pretty steep.

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:41.000
And if you go really far out,
it gets extremely steep.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.630
So you're probably saying,
well, how do you figure out

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.910
the slope of a curve whose
slope keeps changing?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.170
Well there is no slope
for the entire curve.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.900
For a line, there is a slope
for the entire line, because

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.250
the slope never changes.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.380
But what we could try to
do is figure out what the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.720
slope is at a given point.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.540
And the slope at a given point
would be the same as the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.890
slope of a tangent line.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.260
For example-- let me pick a
green-- the slope at this point

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.970
right here would be the same
as the slope of this line.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.180
Right?

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.550
Because this line
is tangent to it.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.350
So it just touches that curve,
and at that exact point, they

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.820
would have-- this blue curve, y
equals x squared, would have

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.650
the same slope as
this green line.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.050
But if we go to a point back
here, even though this is a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.940
really badly drawn graph,
the slope would be

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.700
something like this.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.015
The tangent slope.

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:42.520
The slope would be a negative
slope, and here it's a positive

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.940
slope, but if we took a
point here, the slope would

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.630
be even more positive.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.030
So how are we going
to figure this out?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.900
How are we going to figure out
what the slope is at any point

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.850
along the curve y
equals x squared?

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.590
That's where the derivative
comes into use, and now for the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.290
first time you'll actually see
why a limit is actually

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.010
a useful concept.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.130
So let me try to
redraw the curve.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.750
OK, I'll draw my axes, that's
the y-axis-- I'll just do it in

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.630
the first quadrant-- and this
is-- I really have to find a

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.470
better tool to do my-- this is
x coordinate, and then let

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.620
me draw my curve in yellow.

00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:37.790
So y equals x squared looks
something like this.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.520
I'm really concentrating
to draw this at

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.700
least decently good.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.800
OK.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.890
So let's say we want to find
the slope at this point.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.040
Let's call this point a.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.070
At this point, x equals a.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.845
And of course this is f of a.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.190
So what we could try to do
is, we could try to find

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.410
the slope of a secant line.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.920
A line between-- we take
another point, say, somewhat

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.550
close, to this point on the
graph, let's say here, and if

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.530
we could figure out the slope
of this line, it would be a

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.000
bit of an approximation of
the slope of the curve

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.090
exactly at this point.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.740
So let me draw
that secant line.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.100
Something like that.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.690
Secant line looks
something like that.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:56.050
And let's say that this point
right here is a plus h, where

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.860
this distance is just h, this
is a plus h, we're just going

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.160
h away from a, and then
this point right here

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.060
is f of a plus h.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.103
My pen is malfunctioning.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.550
So this would be an
approximation for what the

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.220
slope is at this point.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.980
And the closer that h gets,
the closer this point gets to

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.390
this point, the better our
approximation is going to be,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.520
all the way to the point that
if we could actually get the

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.140
slope where h equals 0, that
would actually be the slope,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.050
the instantaneous slope, at
that point in the curve.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.440
But how can we figure out what
the slope is when h equals 0?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.670
So right now, we're saying that
the slope between these two

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.900
points, it would be the
change in y, so what's

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.040
the change in y?

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.170
It's this, so that this point
right here is-- the x

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.710
coordinate is-- my thing just
keeps messing up-- the x

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:11.330
coordinate is a plus h, and the
y coordinate is f of a plus h.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:22.050
And this point right here, the
coordinate is a and f of a.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.370
So if we just use the standard
slope formula, like before, we

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.610
would say change in
y over change in x.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.100
Well, what's the change in y?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:37.680
It's f of a plus h-- this
y coordinate minus this y

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:46.850
coordinate-- minus f of
a over the change in x.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.010
Well that change in x is this
x coordinate, a plus h, minus

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.720
this x coordinate, minus a.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.480
And of course this a
and this a cancel out.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.490
So it's f of a plus h,
minus f of a, all over h.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.400
This is just the slope
of this secant line.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.810
And if we want to get the slope
of the tangent line, we would

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.980
just have to find what happens
as h gets smaller and

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.780
smaller and smaller.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.470
And I think you know
where I'm going.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.840
Really, we just want to, if we
want to find the slope of this

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.140
tangent line, we just have
to find the limit of this

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:28.780
value as h approaches 0.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.700
And then, as h approaches 0,
this secant line is going to

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.710
get closer and closer to the
slope of the tangent line.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.590
And then we'll know the exact
slope at the instantaneous

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.900
point along the curve.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.150
And actually, it turns out
that this is the definition

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.800
of the derivative.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.780
And the derivative is nothing
more than the slope of a

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.010
curve at an exact point.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.310
And this is super useful,
because for the first time,

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.570
everything we've talked
about to this point is

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.560
the slope of a line.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.050
But now we can take any
continuous curve, or most

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.800
continuous curves, and find
the slope of that curve

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.340
at an exact point.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.940
So now that I've given you the
definition of what a derivative

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.690
is, and maybe hopefully a
little bit of intuition, in the

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.070
next presentation I'm going to
use this definition to actually

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.040
apply it to some functions,
like x squared and others, and

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.930
give you some more problems.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.070
I'll see you in the
next presentation
