wedding day out there so how does it go
together<00:02:03.440><c> well</c><00:02:04.340><c> it's</c><00:02:04.760><c> it's</c><00:02:05.330><c> so</c><00:02:05.630><c> that</c><00:02:05.780><c> to</c><00:02:06.410><c> get</c>

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 align:start position:0%
together well it's it's so that to get
 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
together well it's it's so that to get
white<00:02:06.920><c> light</c><00:02:07.250><c> you</c><00:02:07.520><c> really</c><00:02:07.820><c> need</c><00:02:08.000><c> to</c><00:02:08.119><c> combine</c>

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 align:start position:0%
white light you really need to combine
 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
white light you really need to combine
at<00:02:09.590><c> least</c><00:02:09.830><c> three</c><00:02:10.190><c> different</c><00:02:10.430><c> colors</c><00:02:10.910><c> so</c>

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
at least three different colors so
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.410 align:start position:0%
at least three different colors so
typically<00:02:11.780><c> you</c><00:02:11.930><c> do</c><00:02:12.560><c> mix</c><00:02:12.860><c> red</c><00:02:13.280><c> and</c><00:02:13.310><c> green</c><00:02:14.150><c> and</c>

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 align:start position:0%
typically you do mix red and green and
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.380 align:start position:0%
typically you do mix red and green and
blue<00:02:15.160><c> and</c><00:02:16.160><c> this</c><00:02:16.370><c> is</c><00:02:16.550><c> well</c><00:02:16.850><c> known</c><00:02:17.120><c> this</c><00:02:17.330><c> is</c>

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 align:start position:0%
blue and this is well known this is
 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.950 align:start position:0%
blue and this is well known this is
actually<00:02:17.870><c> known</c><00:02:18.080><c> since</c><00:02:18.440><c> Isaac</c><00:02:18.980><c> Newton</c><00:02:19.400><c> in</c>

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
actually known since Isaac Newton in
 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
actually known since Isaac Newton in
1671<00:02:21.940><c> but</c><00:02:22.940><c> it</c><00:02:23.750><c> was</c><00:02:24.050><c> so</c><00:02:24.530><c> the</c><00:02:24.920><c> red</c><00:02:25.400><c> and</c><00:02:25.610><c> the</c><00:02:25.670><c> green</c>

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 align:start position:0%
1671 but it was so the red and the green
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.670 align:start position:0%
1671 but it was so the red and the green
LEDs<00:02:26.510><c> have</c><00:02:26.780><c> been</c><00:02:26.900><c> around</c><00:02:27.140><c> for</c><00:02:27.290><c> a</c><00:02:27.470><c> long</c><00:02:27.620><c> time</c>

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
LEDs have been around for a long time
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250 align:start position:0%
LEDs have been around for a long time
but<00:02:28.220><c> the</c><00:02:29.090><c> blue</c><00:02:29.300><c> one</c><00:02:29.510><c> has</c><00:02:29.660><c> really</c><00:02:29.960><c> been</c><00:02:30.080><c> missing</c>

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 align:start position:0%
but the blue one has really been missing
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.670 align:start position:0%
but the blue one has really been missing
and<00:02:30.680><c> so</c><00:02:31.340><c> now</c><00:02:31.600><c> these</c><00:02:32.600><c> laureates</c><00:02:33.170><c> have</c><00:02:33.380><c> have</c>

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
and so now these laureates have have
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.770 align:start position:0%
and so now these laureates have have
made<00:02:34.430><c> the</c><00:02:34.580><c> inventions</c><00:02:35.180><c> that</c><00:02:35.300><c> made</c><00:02:35.660><c> it</c>

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 align:start position:0%
made the inventions that made it
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.550 align:start position:0%
made the inventions that made it
possible<00:02:35.810><c> to</c><00:02:36.350><c> make</c><00:02:36.680><c> efficient</c><00:02:37.580><c> blue</c><00:02:38.260><c> LEDs</c><00:02:39.260><c> and</c>

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
possible to make efficient blue LEDs and
 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.949 align:start position:0%
possible to make efficient blue LEDs and
so<00:02:40.250><c> now</c><00:02:40.459><c> we</c><00:02:40.520><c> have</c><00:02:40.670><c> that</c><00:02:41.060><c> and</c><00:02:41.330><c> we</c><00:02:41.420><c> can</c><00:02:41.570><c> mix</c><00:02:41.810><c> it</c>

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 align:start position:0%
so now we have that and we can mix it
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.660 align:start position:0%
so now we have that and we can mix it
with<00:02:42.140><c> the</c><00:02:42.230><c> red</c><00:02:42.410><c> and</c><00:02:42.620><c> the</c><00:02:42.680><c> green</c><00:02:42.890><c> and</c><00:02:43.220><c> that</c>

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
with the red and the green and that
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.260 align:start position:0%
with the red and the green and that
provides<00:02:44.090><c> white</c><00:02:44.360><c> light</c><00:02:44.780><c> sources</c><00:02:45.290><c> so</c><00:02:46.220><c> what</c><00:02:46.940><c> did</c>

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
provides white light sources so what did
 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.810 align:start position:0%
provides white light sources so what did
they<00:02:47.480><c> do</c><00:02:47.900><c> that</c><00:02:48.170><c> the</c><00:02:48.440><c> others</c><00:02:48.709><c> failed</c><00:02:49.100><c> to</c><00:02:49.610><c> make</c>

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 align:start position:0%
they do that the others failed to make
 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.940 align:start position:0%
they do that the others failed to make
yeah<00:02:50.360><c> so</c><00:02:50.540><c> this</c><00:02:50.930><c> is</c><00:02:51.080><c> very</c><00:02:51.230><c> interesting</c><00:02:51.590><c> because</c>

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is very interesting because
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is very interesting because
there's<00:02:52.520><c> also</c><00:02:53.060><c> what's</c><00:02:53.390><c> fascinating</c><00:02:53.600><c> is</c><00:02:54.110><c> that</c>

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 align:start position:0%
there's also what's fascinating is that
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.460 align:start position:0%
there's also what's fascinating is that
that<00:02:54.890><c> a</c><00:02:55.370><c> lot</c><00:02:55.820><c> of</c><00:02:55.970><c> big</c><00:02:56.239><c> companies</c><00:02:56.450><c> really</c><00:02:57.020><c> try</c>

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 align:start position:0%
that a lot of big companies really try
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
that a lot of big companies really try
to<00:02:57.500><c> do</c><00:02:57.920><c> this</c><00:02:58.130><c> and</c><00:02:58.340><c> they</c><00:02:58.700><c> failed</c><00:02:59.410><c> but</c><00:03:00.410><c> these</c>

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 align:start position:0%
to do this and they failed but these
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.250 align:start position:0%
to do this and they failed but these
guys<00:03:00.950><c> persisted</c><00:03:01.880><c> and</c><00:03:02.120><c> they</c><00:03:02.300><c> tried</c><00:03:02.750><c> and</c><00:03:02.780><c> try</c><00:03:03.200><c> it</c>

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 align:start position:0%
guys persisted and they tried and try it
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
guys persisted and they tried and try it
again<00:03:03.380><c> and</c><00:03:03.860><c> eventually</c><00:03:04.430><c> they</c><00:03:05.030><c> actually</c>

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 align:start position:0%
again and eventually they actually
 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.930 align:start position:0%
again and eventually they actually
succeeded<00:03:06.080><c> and</c><00:03:06.320><c> you</c><00:03:07.100><c> can</c><00:03:07.250><c> say</c><00:03:07.430><c> there's</c><00:03:07.670><c> two</c>

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 align:start position:0%
succeeded and you can say there's two
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690 align:start position:0%
succeeded and you can say there's two
two<00:03:08.360><c> major</c><00:03:08.600><c> things</c><00:03:08.750><c> they</c><00:03:09.260><c> did</c><00:03:09.530><c> one</c><00:03:10.220><c> was</c><00:03:10.459><c> just</c>

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 align:start position:0%
two major things they did one was just
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
two major things they did one was just
to<00:03:10.850><c> grow</c><00:03:11.150><c> a</c><00:03:11.570><c> sufficiently</c><00:03:12.440><c> good</c><00:03:12.560><c> material</c>

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 align:start position:0%
to grow a sufficiently good material
 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.509 align:start position:0%
to grow a sufficiently good material
this<00:03:14.570><c> is</c><00:03:14.720><c> this</c><00:03:15.350><c> is</c><00:03:15.470><c> called</c><00:03:15.680><c> gallium</c><00:03:16.040><c> nitride</c>

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 align:start position:0%
this is this is called gallium nitride
 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.570 align:start position:0%
this is this is called gallium nitride
and<00:03:17.140><c> that</c><00:03:18.140><c> was</c><00:03:18.320><c> very</c><00:03:18.530><c> hard</c><00:03:18.830><c> to</c><00:03:18.920><c> grow</c><00:03:19.220><c> and</c><00:03:19.550><c> to</c>

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 align:start position:0%
and that was very hard to grow and to
 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.210 align:start position:0%
and that was very hard to grow and to
get<00:03:20.239><c> a</c><00:03:20.269><c> good</c><00:03:20.450><c> material</c><00:03:21.019><c> and</c><00:03:21.230><c> they</c><00:03:21.680><c> managed</c><00:03:22.100><c> to</c>

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 align:start position:0%
get a good material and they managed to
 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
get a good material and they managed to
do<00:03:22.430><c> that</c><00:03:22.459><c> and</c><00:03:23.000><c> the</c><00:03:23.420><c> second</c><00:03:23.810><c> part</c><00:03:24.019><c> was</c><00:03:24.350><c> to</c><00:03:24.560><c> dope</c>

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 align:start position:0%
do that and the second part was to dope
 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.259 align:start position:0%
do that and the second part was to dope
it<00:03:25.540><c> in</c><00:03:26.540><c> the</c><00:03:26.780><c> right</c><00:03:26.959><c> way</c><00:03:27.019><c> in</c><00:03:28.269><c> semiconductors</c>

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 align:start position:0%
it in the right way in semiconductors
 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.009 align:start position:0%
it in the right way in semiconductors
like<00:03:29.450><c> this</c><00:03:29.690><c> you</c><00:03:29.959><c> you</c><00:03:30.530><c> dope</c><00:03:30.860><c> both</c><00:03:32.019><c> electrons</c>

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 align:start position:0%
like this you you dope both electrons
 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
like this you you dope both electrons
and<00:03:33.500><c> holes</c><00:03:34.340><c> and</c><00:03:34.730><c> it</c><00:03:35.360><c> was</c><00:03:35.540><c> the</c><00:03:35.660><c> whole</c><00:03:35.840><c> doping</c>

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 align:start position:0%
and holes and it was the whole doping
 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
and holes and it was the whole doping
which<00:03:36.470><c> was</c><00:03:36.650><c> very</c><00:03:36.860><c> difficult</c><00:03:37.600><c> but</c><00:03:38.600><c> they</c>

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
which was very difficult but they
 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
which was very difficult but they
succeeded<00:03:39.200><c> in</c><00:03:39.440><c> doing</c><00:03:39.590><c> that</c><00:03:39.860><c> too</c><00:03:40.130><c> so</c><00:03:41.000><c> and</c><00:03:41.840><c> and</c>

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
succeeded in doing that too so and and
 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
succeeded in doing that too so and and
it<00:03:42.230><c> was</c><00:03:42.410><c> really</c><00:03:42.620><c> an</c><00:03:43.070><c> effort</c><00:03:43.459><c> that</c><00:03:43.850><c> we're</c><00:03:44.239><c> all</c>

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
in one electron you get one particle of

in one electron you get one particle of

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 align:start position:0%

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
that goal so it will be hard to find
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.570 align:start position:0%
that goal so it will be hard to find
something<00:04:45.370><c> that</c><00:04:45.520><c> will</c><00:04:46.030><c> be</c><00:04:46.210><c> better</c><00:04:47.160><c> so</c><00:04:48.160><c> we</c><00:04:48.430><c> will</c>

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 align:start position:0%
something that will be better so we will
 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.070 align:start position:0%
something that will be better so we will
be<00:04:49.389><c> left</c><00:04:49.600><c> with</c><00:04:49.930><c> this</c><00:04:50.139><c> now</c><00:04:50.650><c> for</c><00:04:51.300><c> ever</c><00:04:52.300><c> I</c><00:04:52.630><c> think</c>

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
be left with this now for ever I think
 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
be left with this now for ever I think
so<00:04:53.229><c> they</c><00:04:53.470><c> will</c><00:04:53.620><c> of</c><00:04:53.800><c> course</c><00:04:53.979><c> improved</c><00:04:54.490><c> over</c><00:04:54.940><c> the</c>

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 align:start position:0%
so they will of course improved over the
 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.170 align:start position:0%
so they will of course improved over the
years<00:04:55.120><c> and</c><00:04:55.720><c> and</c><00:04:55.960><c> become</c><00:04:56.320><c> a</c><00:04:56.350><c> little</c><00:04:56.680><c> bit</c><00:04:56.800><c> better</c>

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
years and and become a little bit better
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.690 align:start position:0%
years and and become a little bit better
but<00:04:58.180><c> it</c><00:04:59.050><c> will</c><00:04:59.410><c> you</c><00:04:59.919><c> will</c><00:05:00.070><c> not</c><00:05:00.190><c> get</c><00:05:00.460><c> anything</c>

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 align:start position:0%
but it will you will not get anything
 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 align:start position:0%
that will be you know ten times better
 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.610 align:start position:0%
