00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.910
MALE SPEAKER: OK,
hi, everyone.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.590
Today, I'm going to talk about
the Spatial Data Access Tool,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.600
enable visualization and access
of geospatial data

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.530
using OGC services
and Google Earth.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.750
[INAUDIBLE], I'm a postdoctoral
researcher

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.880
associate from Oak Ridge
National Lab.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.020
And I'm working together with
[INAUDIBLE], Bob, Bruce, and

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.450
Tammy on this work.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.140
Before I start, let me ask
a couple of questions.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.270
Do you spend quite some time on
finding the data that can

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.820
be used in your research using
Google or some other tools?

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.550
If you find some data, do you
want to see the data, instead

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.580
of just the reading some
words about it?

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.400
If the data is actually what you
need, do you want to get

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.720
the data in a form that can be
used quickly and directly in

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.150
your research with only
minimum processing?

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.840
The Spatial Data Access Tool I'm
going to introduce today

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.680
will help you to solve
those problems.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.190
It makes it easier for you to
find, visualize, and access

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.170
biogeochemical and ecological
data that is useful in

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.670
environmental research.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
This work is funded by ORNL DAAC
and the MAST-DC projects.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.930
Let me first give a
brief introduction

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.600
to those two projects.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.420
The ORNL DAAC, the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.620
Distributed Active Archive
Center, is a NASA-sponsored

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.530
source for biogeochemical and
ecological data and models

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.210
useful in environmental
research.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.130
It is a crucial link for the
validation of biogeochemical

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.290
inferences from remotely
sensed data.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.150
The data kept in the ORNL DAAC
mainly fall into three

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.460
categories, the field campaign
data, land validation data,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.550
and the related regional
and global data.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.730
There are over 800 data sets and
about 220,000 data files.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.640
And the total volume is
about 1.1 terabytes.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.800
The data files are stored in
various formats, including

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.650
ASCII, binary, metacdf,
and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.040
The Modeling and Synthesis
Thematic Data Center, the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.560
MAST-DC, provides data
management support for the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.200
North American Carbon
Program project.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.500
Its goal is to provide data in
the formats, resolutions, and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.490
the projections based on
users' requirements.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.280
There are many carbon
cycling models

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.610
involved in the NACP project.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.170
So the data archived in MAST-DC
includes model inputs

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930
and outputs data.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.080
It also includes some
observations data like forest

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.460
and crop inventory,
tower fluxes.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.970
There's some other related
data like climate and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.330
[INAUDIBLE] data archived.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.800
Data centers is, especially
for those handling Earth

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.830
science data, are facing
challenges.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.740
The rapidly increasing archiving
rate of geospatial

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.790
data is only one issue.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.340
A bigger one is that
geospatial data is

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.060
heterogeneous in many aspects,
including data format and

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.210
metadata standard.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.270
The rapidly growing user

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.840
community is another challenge.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.010
Users are getting more
requirements on

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.850
the data they need.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.840
And they expect more customized
the data than just

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.290
the raw data.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.630
And nowadays, different data
centers are using different

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.250
mechanisms to publish and
deliver data to users.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.050
And this introduces extra
burdens to users if they need

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.210
to access data from
multiple centers.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.770
So this situation is getting
more critical.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.270
With the Earth science,
researchers are getting more

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.378
complex and expanding across
more disciplines.

00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:12.780
Data users need to find and
visualize data efficiently.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.870
They need to access diverse data
in ready-for-use formats

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.600
and also in a standard way.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.050
So the data centers need to take
new solutions to solve

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.665
those problems and certify
the data users.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:33.770
The ORNL DAAC and the MAST-DC
have tapped into the benefits

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.020
offered by Open Geospatial
Consortium standards,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.910
Web-enabled GIS tools, and the
Virtual Globe technology to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.260
accomplish this goal.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.826
So what is OGC?

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:50.295
OGC is special name for Open
Geospatial Consortium.

00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:54.040
It is nonprofit, international,
voluntary

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.550
consensus standards organization
that is leading

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.060
to the development of standards
for geospatial and

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.005
location-based services.

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:07.850
The OGC standards cover almost
all aspects of geospatial

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.600
information, including the
representation, management,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.360
processing, and application.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.080
The OGC standards we are using,
the WMS and WCS, fall

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.480
into the category of geospatial
information

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.665
management.

00:05:22.665 --> 00:05:27.400
The OGC Web Coverage Service,
WCS, defines a standard

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.250
interface that enables
customizable access to

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.990
geospatial coverage data.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.050
A coverage means a phenomenon
that covers a geographic area,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.620
such as satellite images
and the digital

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.310
elevation model data.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.120
The OGC Web Map Service, the
WMS, defines a standard

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.070
interface that enables the
visualization of geospatial

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.335
data and this including both
the coverage and features.

00:05:56.335 --> 00:06:01.270
This standardization of the data
visualization and access

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.360
promotes the geospatial
information interoperability,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.855
which benefits both the data
centers and the data users.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.075
Based on MapServer, we developed
and deployed the OGC

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:19.370
WCS and WMS servers.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.400
The ORNL WCS server is
compatible with OGC WCS

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.940
standard version 1.0.0.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.230
It provides the features for
customized geospatial coverage

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.210
data access, like spatial,
temporal, [? fan ?]

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.920
subsetting, reprojection,
resampling, and reformatting.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.790
Popular data formats are
supported, including GeoTIF,

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.720
ARC/Infor, ASCII [INAUDIBLE],
netCDF, and

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.220
ITF and IRDIS Imagine.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.000
The ORNL WMS server is
compatible with OGC WMS

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.610
standard version 1.1.1 besides
those features

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.530
provided in WCS server.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.630
It also supports both automatic
and the manual color

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.320
scheme definition.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.565
It can render images in PNG,
JPEG, and GIF formats.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.650
The ORNL WCS and WMS servers are
mainly machine oriented.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.660
In order to bring the benefits
of those servers to the end

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.760
users, we developed the Spatial
Data Access Tool.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.600
And the URL is listed here.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.750
The SDAT tool is a Web
application that enable users

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.200
to find, visualize, and access
geospatial data in user

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.870
specified temporal, spatial,
expanded resolution, format,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.690
and projection.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:55.430
It provides a WMS-driven
interactive map widget for

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.500
data visualization and
WCS-based options for

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.930
customizable data access.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.770
Within Spatial Data Access
Tool, geospatial data is

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.940
organized in two levels, the
data set level and the data

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.840
file level.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.120
As of today, there are 65 data
sets available through the

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.730
ORNL OGC servers and the Spatial
Data Access Tool.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.890
Those data sets fall into a
couple of major categories,

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.800
including land cover,
elevation, soil,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.590
climate, and ecoregion.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.340
The main page of the Spatial
Data Access Tool, as shown on

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.350
the left image, provides a list
of all the available data

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.730
sets, their preview images, a
keyword search box, and the

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.040
links to metadata pages and KMZ
files, which I will talk

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.890
about later.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.550
Following the links provided
from the main page, users can

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:59.060
get to another page listing all
the files contained in the

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.660
specific data set along with
some brief file level metadata

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.910
information.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.100
The file-level interface
provides rich file-level

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.880
metadata information on the top
of the page, for example,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.750
the projection definition in
OGC, a well-known text format.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.720
In the middle of this page
is an OpenLayers-based

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.930
interactive map widget.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.490
Within this map widget, users
can pan, zoom in, or zoom out

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.820
on the map.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.140
It also supports on the
fly map reprojection.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.210
If a user select a different
projection from the list, the

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:46.016
map will be displayed in that
particular projection as shown

00:09:46.016 --> 00:09:48.060
on this image.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.260
On the bottom of the page are
those WCS-based options for

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.190
customizable coverage
data sets.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.350
The Spatial Data Access
Tool is Web-based.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.450
It brings data visualization
and access functions from

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.680
local computers to the
worldwide web.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.540
The emerging virtual globe
technology, like Google Earth,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.440
uses a virtual WART on top
of the worldwide web.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.880
We can call that the
web-wide WART.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.950
It brings users a new and a
higher level platform and many

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.750
more benefits for
geospatial data

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.390
visualization and the delivery.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.100
We sensed this great opportunity
and used the ASCII

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.530
WMS to KML converter to prepare
a KMZ file for each

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.090
data set for users
to visualize the

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.000
data in Google Earth.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.890
Following the visualize in
Google Earth links, users can

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.790
access to those KMZ files from
the Spatial Data Access Tool

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.470
all the maps and corresponding
legend images displayed in

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.180
Google Earth's dynamically
created at

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.780
the ORNL WMS server.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.030
A new map will be reshaped and
displayed in Google Earth

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.900
every time the user
touches the globe.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.240
In the next couple of slides,
I will introduce those

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.790
benefits that users can get
from using Google Earth.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.260
Google Earth provides rich and
valuable background maps, such

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.870
as high resolution satellite
images, roads,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.640
landmarks, and borders.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.860
The value of scientific data
increases the more you can

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.410
link it to information that the
user is already familiar

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.600
with and can see their
importance.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.820
So we should take this
opportunity to present our

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.780
geospatial data in a way that
users can easily tie to other

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.900
data sources.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.850
For example, on this screen, we
overlay the national land

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.620
coverage data, which is
available through the Spatial

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.650
Data Access Tool, with those
rich information provide

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.540
within Google Earth around
the Bay area.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.390
The red color represents the
developed urban area.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.730
And the brown color, which is
near the top right corner of

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.130
this image, represents
the crop lands.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.830
So in this manner, users can
easily have a sense of those

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.780
different land types that
run on the Bay area.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.000
Google Earth also provides
powerful address and

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.100
keywords-based locating
capability.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.070
Say what if the user want to
see a data near Yosemite?

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.960
It is easy to locate the
Yosemite National Park within

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.260
Google Earth.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.690
And Google Earth provides
excellent data visualization

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.360
capability.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.090
It is globe-based and simulates
the real Earth.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.420
Users can visualize the data
from arbitrary angle of view.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.770
It can even virtually fly
within Google Earth.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.080
It supports three-dimensional
objects and a

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.330
terrain surface elevation.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.270
And this image shows how the
Google Earth overlays the

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.690
national land cover data onto
the terrain base in the

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.940
Yosemite National Park.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.400
Within Google Earth, users can
overlay any map from any data

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.360
set for inter-comparison.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.430
Let's compare the land cover
patterns in the Three Gorges

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.300
Dam area in China between
2001 and 2007.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.760
The Three Gorges Dam, as marked
by the red balloon on

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.940
this image, is the world's
largest hydroelectric dam.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.210
The first map shows the land
cover map for 2001.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:40.560
And the second image shows the
land cover map for 2007.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.160
By comparing those two images,
we can see the increase of

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.560
water area and the reduce
of crop lands.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.320
And the [INAUDIBLE]
savannas were

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.580
replaced by mixed forests.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.350
From those changes, we can think
that the Three Gorges

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.330
Dam does have impact
on the environment.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.800
And there was residency
relocation activity.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.110
One may not be able to do
accurate analysis within

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.710
Google Earth.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.180
But a good visualization tool
like Google Earth is critical

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.200
for the generating of scientific
hypothesis and

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.380
questions that one can
go on to test.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.630
It is part of getting
an intuitive

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.498
grasp of the problem.

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:30.130
It is super convenient to run
time-series animation within

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.640
Google Earth.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.790
And this video shows the monthly
one degree resolution

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:41.870
CO2 flux from 1998 to 2006
displayed within Google Earth.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.190
And this data was simulated by
the simple biosphere model

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.570
version three.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.120
Negative values, as denoted by
the blue colors, represent

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.190
carbon uptake into
the ecosystem.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.150
And the positive values, as
denoted by the red colors,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.010
represent the carbon released
from the ecosystem.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.110
You can see the blue color
region moves to the north

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.780
during summer and moves to the
south during winter, which is

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.080
a reflection of the seasonal
cycle of the CO2 flux.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.905
Since version 5, the information
window of Google

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:26.280
Earth supports JavaScript
and iFrame.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.680
This means we can put rich and
well-formatted descriptive

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.940
information about the data
layer into Google Earth.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.620
We can even embed the Spatial
Data Access Tool inside Google

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.990
Earth so that users can
visualize the data in Google

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.510
Earth and access the data
through the Spatial Data

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.880
Access Tool without leaving
Google Earth.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.390
And this video shows how users
can launch and use the Spatial

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.115
Data Access Tool from
within Google Earth.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.900
From the information window,
users can see the rich,

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.660
file-level metadata
information.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:11.020
You can preview the map of the
data and use some tools to

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.800
select an area and zoom into
that particular area.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.330
You can use some other tools to
select a region for spatial

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:25.220
subsetting and then go ahead
to change the spatial

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:32.850
resolution or manually set the
region for spatial subsetting.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:38.435
You can do something else, like
select a particular data

00:16:38.435 --> 00:16:43.210
format from a list of all
available data formats and

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:49.010
then go ahead to access
this customized data.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.180
This integration of Spatial Data
Access Tool and Google

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.140
Earth provides users more
convenience for the data

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.480
visualization and access.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.440
And here comes the summary
and future work.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.440
The ORNL DAAC and MAST-DC
are rich sources for

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.280
biogeochemical and ecological
data useful in

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.940
environmental research.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.410
The ORNL OGC servers and the
Spatial Data Access Tool

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.069
provide efficient and
customizable visualization and

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:28.310
access to geospatial data
in a standard way.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.960
Google Earth serves as a new
platform and brings many more

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.240
benefits for geospatial data
visualization and delivery.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.920
I hope the ORNL OGC servers,
especially with access to

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.700
Google Earth, provides positive
answers to those

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.870
questions I raised before
this presentation.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.020
In the future, we are going
to incorporate more OGC

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.390
standards, such as the Web
Feature Service, WFS, which

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.460
enables the customizable
access to

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.900
geospatial feature data.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.080
Thank you.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.070
Any questions?

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.021
[APPLAUSE]
