00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.960
Hi.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.510
My name is Baris Ozaydini.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.960
I'm the founder
and CEO of FitWell.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.850
FitWell is a mobile
coaching app that

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.430
simplifies being fit
and healthy by offering

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.690
the experience of a personal
trainer, a nutritionist,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.530
and a life coach, all together.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.940
So the goal of the
Lean process was

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.270
to create a minimum viable
product and a prototype.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.180
By minimum viable product,
I mean the core product

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.180
with the key features that
we can quickly roll out,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.700
without the fancy stuff
or bells and whistles,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.650
that will give us core input
from the early adopters,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.230
so that we can start
learning from it.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.350
First step of the process
was to get a good team

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.730
from multidisciplinary areas.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.570
First, a designer, a UX
expert, a Lean advisor,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.790
a project manager, and a
product manager all together.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.620
The reason of getting a
multidisciplinary team

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.820
is simply because you need
different kinds of opinions

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.980
into this process
and you need to be

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.580
able to create a result
from this process,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.070
so you need different
expertise areas in your team.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.440
We started with the core idea
of creating a mobile coach.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.560
And as a team, we discussed
each and every aspect

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.740
of creating a product, starting
from the core paying points,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.960
the customer, the marketplace,
and the key features that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.410
would make the product.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.720
After a while, we came up
with several hypotheses

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.770
about the marketplace, the
product, the need out there,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.340
and our customers.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.850
One of the most important
things about the Lean process

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.960
is to know about your customer.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.030
You have to really define
who you are working for,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.470
who you are trying to
solve the problem for.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.940
We call this the core persona.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.630
So together with the team,
we defined our core persona.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.700
Actually, everybody
had different ideas

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.390
of the core persona,
so we voted which

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.820
one would make the most sense.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.580
After we came up with
the core persona idea,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.630
we said, let's test our
ideas and test our hypothesis

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.950
in the marketplace.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.780
So we booked some
interviews with real people

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.210
and went to the field.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.240
Then we went back
to the war room.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.990
People had a lot of
experience with real people

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.260
and a lot of insights, so we
put them all in the funnel.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.580
We started live
discussion again,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.710
and we came out with the
MVP, with real features

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.620
that would appeal to people.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.190
After defining the MVP
and the key features,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.940
we created a prototype.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.720
It was a non-functional,
but a visual one.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.420
We used the prototype in
real business scenarios

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.400
as well, securing an investment
as well as securing a business

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.110
deal with a important partner.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.770
After having the
MVP and prototype,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.160
developing the product was
pretty straightforward.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.680
In six months, we released
the product in Turkey

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.280
as a beta market.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.120
It took us five days to
become the number one health

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.250
and fitness app in Turkey.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.290
And we're using the
Lean Methodology still,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.470
and we now have 400,000
members in six months.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.820
