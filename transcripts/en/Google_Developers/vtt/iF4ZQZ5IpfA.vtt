00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.269
&gt;&gt; We are smustard.com and we write plug-ins
for a SketchUp. Our motivation really is to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.730
train and help people reduce the repetitive
tasks in 3D modeling and to just simplify

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.430
complex tasks so that SketchUp becomes more
user friendly and more accessible to more

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.110
people.
&gt;&gt; So, how did you come to choose SketchUp?

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.250
Can you tell us a little bit about how you
come to this technical decision?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.070
&gt;&gt; Okay. There are a lot of 3D modelers available
of the increasing levels of difficulty. One

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.659
of the benefits of SketchUp is it's accessible
to a lot of people. It's easy to learn, easy

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:56.320
to use, very powerful for the simplicity that
it gives on the front end. And so, it is actually

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.690
a professional decision originally to use
SketchUp where I work, and from there when

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.829
they released the Ruby API that just to open
the opportunity to customize and enhance SketchUp.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:22.229
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, as a developers, we do evaluate
and to share worse stories and lessons on

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.741
technical challenges. Can you tell us about
one particular or difficult period of development

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:28.741
on it that you faced and how you approach
this difficult challenge?

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:33.080
&gt;&gt; One of the difficulties is that the API
has grown over time. And initially, there

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.880
are a lot of things that we would need to
do to create workarounds for missing parts

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.050
of the API. Since it was originally released,
it has improved significantly and that's helped

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.280
our developers to be able to do more things
with finding the workarounds for the things

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.249
that weren't available at that time was one
of the greater challenges, so.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:02.710
&gt;&gt; So, can you tell me about the top three
or four things that you like about did all

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.840
the things for SketchUp?
&gt;&gt; One of the big improvements and one of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.840
the things I really like is the ability to
use observers which tie directly into the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.540
SketchUp core and report back any changes
in the model, or any changes to settings in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.349
the model so that we can have instant feedback
and then respond to that. One example would

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:35.450
be a plug-in called NightSky which uses the
shadow and time of day settings that are native

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.300
to SketchUp, and uses an observer to query
those and as a user changes the settings or

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.330
the time of day you will change the sky to
reflect the time of day. So, you go from sunrise

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.599
to an afternoon sky to a sunset kind of sky.
So, that's one of the great things enhancements

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.862
that was added to the API was the observers,
so.

00:02:56.862 --> 00:03:03.870
&gt;&gt; And then, what are some things you'd like
to see added to the API?

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.939
&gt;&gt; Support for more objects. Right now there's
no access to the dimension objects in SketchUp

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.141
and so if we could get access to those that
would really open up a whole new field of

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:17.141
development.
&gt;&gt; And then for the last question now, what

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:31.790
do you think is the future of 3D?
&gt;&gt; The future of 3D is just wide open. It's

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:40.330
amazing what SketchUp has done in making 3D
available to a lot of people, a lot of companies

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.530
that might not otherwise afford it. It can
turn small companies into big players because

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.570
it helps even out the field where 3D used
to the domain of very large companies that

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.209
have large I.T. departments. Now, two or three
or four person, architecture or engineering

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:06.420
firm can leverage SketchUp to help them present
to the client the things that they need to

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.040
see and really get their foot in the door
and make headway in their marketing.
