00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.340
Here's a question for you:

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.340
If you shine a light on a coin that’s hanging in mid-air, what do you think its shadow will look like?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.640
Do you think its shadow would have a bright
spot of light right in the middle of it?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.640
Because it would!

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.100
It might seem counterintuitive, and 19th-century physicists thought so too, when they tried this experiment.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.660
But that little spot in the middle of the coin's shadow helps prove one of the most important discoveries ever made in physics:

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.700
Light is a wave.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:38.200
[Theme Music]

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.940
In the 17th and 18th centuries, most physicists thought that light was a particle, because it often behaved like one.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.970
But over the years, some scientists began
to think that it might actually be a wave.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.000
They did experiments to test this idea, and
slowly, evidence started to build.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.240
We now know that light is both a particle and a wave – a strange-sounding concept that we'll explore more later on.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.880
But the point is, light is a wave, and we know this because waves behave in very specific (and sometimes weird) ways.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.240
One of the most important reasons that light acts the way it does is known as Huygens' Principle.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.600
Christian Huygens was a 17th-century Dutch
physicist who believed light acted as a wave.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.300
He came up with a way to predict how a wave will spread out, and we still use his method today.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.680
Huygens’ Principle says that you can predict a wave’s position in the future by analyzing its current position.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.220
All you have to do is think of each point on the wave as the source of its own, tinier wave.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.400
See, Huygens knew that when you multiply the velocity of something by the amount of time it's traveled, you can figure out how far it went.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.040
And he figured that this would also be true
for each individual point on a wave.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.120
Let's say you have a wave that's traveling 10 centimeters per second, and you want to know what the wave will look like after 2 seconds.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.939
To use Huygens' principle, you first draw
a bunch of little points along a wave.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.100
Then, you draw a half-circle around each point, in front of the wave, with a radius equal to the wave's velocity multiplied by time – so, 20 centimeters.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.539
Each of those little half-circles is called
a wavelet.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.980
Finally, you draw a curve that's tangent to each wavelet, meaning that it touches each half circle at exactly one point.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
That line shows the location of the wave after
two seconds!

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.980
So a two-dimensional wave traveling through
empty space will look pretty simple;

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.720
it's basically an expanding circle.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.900
But things get a little more complicated when
a wave hits an obstacle.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.480
For example, let's apply Huygens' principle to a
wave that moves past the edge of a flat object.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.140
When the wave hits the obstacle, part of it
gets blocked.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.180
But the part that isn’t blocked keeps moving past the edge, and it follows Huygens' principle, forming wavelets.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.760
The wavelets from the part of the wave near
the edge will curve behind the edge.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.260
And when you draw a line to connect all the wavelets, you end up with a line that bends around the edge.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.480
In the same way, when a wave moves through a slit that's roughly the same width as its wavelength, it travels past the slit in a circular curve that spreads outward.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.200
When waves are re-shaped by obstacles, that's
called diffraction.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.849
And it's very different from what a stream
of particles would do.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.700
For example, if you rolled a bunch of marbles straight through a doorway, you'd expect them all to hit the far wall directly opposite the doorway.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.900
They wouldn't hit the wall in places to the
right or to the left of the door.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.580
But when waves diffract, they often spread
outward behind obstacles.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.860
Diffraction is one of the reasons there's a bright spot in the middle of the shadow when you shine a light on a round object.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.560
The other reason is interference.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.609
In our lesson on traveling waves, we described
what happens when waves run into each other:

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.360
they interfere in one of two ways.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.940
Waves interfere constructively when the crests of both waves end up in the same spot, and so do their troughs.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.640
The waves essentially combine into one wave that has a larger amplitude – with higher crests and lower troughs – than either of the two waves did before.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.360
But waves interfere DEstructively when one wave's crest run into the other wave's trough, and vice versa.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.540
In that case, the combined wave has a lower
amplitude than either of the waves did before.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.340
With perfectly destructive interference, the waves actually disappear completely; they flatten out.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.260
Together, diffraction and interference help explain the results of the famous double-slit experiment conducted by English physicist Thomas Young in 1801.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.340
Young covered a window so that only a very narrow stream of sunlight passed through a slit into the room.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.820
Then, he positioned a plate with two more tiny slits cut into it, spaced very close together so that the single beam of sunlight passed through them.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.360
Finally, he placed a screen behind the slits.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.860
If light were just a stream of particles, you'd expect to see two bright lines on the screen, behind the two slits.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.340
But that's not what Young saw.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.140
His screen had many lines on it.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.739
There was a bright line in the middle, then
more bright lines above and below it.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.520
This pattern is called a diffraction pattern, and it comes from the diffraction and interference of light waves.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.180
Light waves interfere constructively when
they’re lined up exactly right.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.360
For example, to form that line on the screen between the two slits the waves from each slit travel exactly the same distance.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.580
So they line up, interfere constructively, which increases their amplitude to create a bright spot.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.900
But in other places on the screen, there’s a difference between the distances traveled by each wave.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.480
This is called the path difference.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.340
So light waves will interfere either constructively or destructively, depending on the size of this path difference.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.460
When the waves are an exact number of wavelengths apart, the crests and troughs will line up – creating constructive interference and a bright line.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:08.540
But when the waves are shifted by exactly half a wavelength — or by 1.5 wavelengths, or 2.5, and so on – light rays will interfere DEstructively.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.700
By using trigonometry, you can calculate the
path difference in a slit experiment:

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.800
It’s equal to the distance between the center
of each slit, d,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.840
multiplied by the sine of the angle between the point on the screen and the straight line between the slits and the screen.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.670
Now, since light is a wave, it has the same
properties as other waves.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.650
Intensity, for example, is the energy transported
by the light per unit area, over time.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.400
Essentially, intensity is the brightness of
the light.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.280
As with other waves, intensity is proportional
to the amplitude squared.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.000
So if you double the amplitude of a wave's
peaks, it gets four times as bright.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.680
If you triple the amplitude, it gets nine
times as bright.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.340
When light passes through two slits like in the double-slit experiment, the line in the center will be the most intense.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.020
And the farther the lines get from the center, the less intense, and therefore, the less bright, they'll be.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.600
Like other waves, light also has a frequency
and wavelength.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.920
These determine whether light is visible,
and if so, what its color is.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.860
Light with a higher frequency, and therefore a shorter wavelength, is on the bluer side of the spectrum.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.020
Light with a lower frequency and longer wavelength
is on the redder side of the spectrum.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.500
White light – like from sunlight – is actually
all of the different colors of light combined.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.660
When white light passes through the two slits in the experiment, they interfere in a way that allows you to see this rainbow of colors in the lines on the screen.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.140
But the double-slit experiment isn't the only situation where light creates a diffraction pattern.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.500
Diffraction will happen when light passes
through a single slit, too,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.880
producing a pattern that looks like a series of lines
that get dimmer the farther you get from the center.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.540
The light will be brightest on the part of the
screen that's opposite the middle of the slit.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.400
That bright line is created by the rays that go straight through the slit, perpendicular to the plate.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.099
They have a path difference of zero.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.319
But to reach the other points on the screen, different rays of light travel different distances, depending on their angle going through the slit.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.180
And again, whether the light interferes constructively
or destructively depends on how the rays line up.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.960
For a single slit, the path difference is between the light coming from the very top of the slit and the light coming from the very bottom of the slit.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.460
The path difference is equal to the width of the slit, D, times the sine of the angle between the point on the screen and a line straight from the slit to the screen.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:16.900
If the path difference is one wavelength long, then the path difference between the light from the top of the slit and the light from the center of the slit is only half a wavelength.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.960
The same holds true for the path difference between the light from the center of the slit and the bottom.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:29.960
So a total path difference of a full wavelength means that for each light ray coming through the slit at that angle, there's a corresponding light ray that's shifted by half a wavelength.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:38.320
And remember: when waves of light are shifted by half a wavelength, that means one wave’s crests line up with the other’s trough, causing destructive interference.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.420
So, for a single slit, when the total path
difference is equal to a full wavelength,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.250
you end up with pairs of waves that cancel
each other out and make a dark line.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.900
Now, constructive interference through a single
slit works a little differently.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:58.180
When the path difference between the top and bottom of the slit is equal to 1.5 wavelengths – or 2.5 wavelengths, and so on – there will be a bright line.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:00.649
That’s where the rays interfere constructively.

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:06.699
As with the previous example, this also has to do with the path difference between individual rays passing through the single slit.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.440
Say the light is angled so that the total path difference between the top and bottom of the slit is 1.5 wavelengths.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.500
The rays passing through the middle third and bottom third of the slit will be half a wavelength apart, so they'll cancel each other out.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.060
But that top third won't cancel with anything –
instead, it will reach the screen, creating a bright line.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.580
So, how do diffraction and interference create the
phenomenon we see in the shadow of the coin?

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.920
Diffraction makes the light waves curve around
the coin’s edges.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.880
When these diffracted waves run into each
other, they interfere.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.270
The places where the waves interfere destructively
become shadows.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.880
That's what makes those little ripples spreading
outward from the circular shadow.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.920
But the places where the waves interfere constructively
become bright spots.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.860
That’s why there's a bright spot right in
the middle of the coin's shadow!

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.080
At that point, the waves of light that diffracted around the edges of the coin have all traveled the same distance.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.640
So the crests of different light waves combine, and so do the troughs, forming one wave with a higher amplitude.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.000
And a bright spot.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.790
Today, you learned about the wave theory of
light.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.370
We talked about Huygens' principle,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.810
and described how diffraction and interference
lead to the results of the double-slit experiment.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.380
We also explored the diffraction pattern from
a single slit.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.390
Finally, we explained the diffraction pattern
for a disk.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.760
