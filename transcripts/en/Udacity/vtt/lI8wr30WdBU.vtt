00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.233
As I said before, there are two different dimensions of consciousness. You have

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.710
wakefulness and awareness. So we can be awake, which is exactly what it

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.714
implies. How awake are we, or are we asleep? And then we can be aware, or

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:19.756
alert. This means to what extent are we aware? Of both our external

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:25.218
surroundings and our internal world, meaning how we feel emotionally. Like are

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:30.440
we afraid, excited, or are we aware that we're in physical pain? Such as having

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.856
a headache or perhaps a pulled muscle? And this is also being aware of our

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.419
cognitions, so what it is that we're thinking. Here, let's look at this on a

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:43.306
diagram. We have awareness and wakefulness. We can have minimal consciousness

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:48.390
meaning we're not aware or awake, which would be here. This would be an example

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.994
of a coma. Or we could be fully aware and awake, we'd be up here. So this would

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:57.840
be something like practicing the piano maybe. How about in the middle of the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.495
continuum, so moderate consciousness? Think about this. Have you ever been

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.288
asked a question by a friend, something like, what is the name of that

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:09.710
restaurant we went to for Homer's birthday last month? You know that you know

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.320
the answer to that question, but you just can't bring it to the level of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.905
consciousness that allows you to respond appropriately. Most of us have had

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:20.628
experiences such as this. Whether it's an acquaintance's name that we should

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:23.572
know, we just can't remember it, the name of a restaurant, or even a movie that

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:27.817
we've seen. All of these are examples of something called the tip of the tongue

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:28.979
phenomenon.
