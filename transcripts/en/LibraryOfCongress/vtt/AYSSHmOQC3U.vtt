00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.050
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: She's
known as a writer

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.290
who captures the essential
American character,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.890
not just by chronicling their lives

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.670
but by letting us see
deep into their souls.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.180
We see their hopes and their
disappointments, their flaws,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.620 position:56%
their fears, and we do so amazingly,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.780
on a very highly granular
level, up close.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.490
Elizabeth's novels are
like shimmering necklaces,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.660
each chapter is a bead along
a continuum of related lives.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.510
And somehow she manages to weave
this incredible tapestry of lives,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.770
back into themselves,
in book after book.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.910
They are free of sentimentality,
they are without judgment.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.180
We see the bad and the good in
all, just as we might see the bad

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440
and the good in the
people that we love most.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.660
There are no villains
here, in Elizabeth's work.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.440 position:56%
All are simply human, all have their
reasons, each has an intricate past.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.790 position:56%
She's been called perceptive, deeply
empathetic, astonishingly forceful,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.110
one of America's most graceful
and grace-filled writers.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.230
She was born in Portland, Maine,
daughter of a science professor,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.530
I believe, and an English teacher.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.480
She grew up in Maine
and New Hampshire.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.140
She's been a writer,
she says, all her life,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.640
although she didn't publish her
first book until she was over 40,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.290
giving a lot of people hope here.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.880
She spent her early years
after college as a waitress,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.550
a working woman, a
law school graduate,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.980
witnessing some stark
realities about American life

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.690
and the very apparent
hierarchies of class,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.520
the "haves" and the "have-nots."

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.580
The ambitious and the vanquished,
the willful and the repentant,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.510
the leaders and the followers,
the cogs and the rebels.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.670
Somewhere along the way, because
she was a voracious reader,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.550
she acquired a keen eye
for economical language

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.640
and the lyrical turn of phrase.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.030
A Strout sentence, you all know

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.650
who have read her, can
contain a universe.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.680
She's given us a rich collection
of memorable books, each volume,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.370
another testimonial of her
perspective and her record

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.700
of contemporary American life.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.340
You know them all: "Amy and
Isabelle" was her first,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.780
"Abide with Me," "Olive
Kitteridge," "The Burgess Boys,"

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.710
"My Name is Lucy Barton" and
now "Anything is Possible."

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.080 position:56%
For this she's won a Pulitzer Prize,
the Premio Bancarella among others

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.910
as well as being a finalist for
many other prestigious awards.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.990
Thank you so much for
joining us, Liz.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.490
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Thank you.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.510
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Pleasure
to have you.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.890
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.320
Wonderful to have her with us.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.230
And I want to start by asking a
question that occurred to me just

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.590
in looking at your book
and the dedications

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.750 position:56%
that you made in each of your books.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.450
And "Anything is possible" is
dedicated to your brother John.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.480 position:56%
And "Olive Kitteridge" was dedicated
to your mother, who, you said,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.160
made life magical for you and was
the best story-teller you know.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.460
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.760
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So
let's start there.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.060
I mean, how --

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.360
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.660
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: How
did you learn this?

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.960
And your family, tell us
a little bit about that.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.260
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.560
She's still the best
story-teller I know.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.330
Part of it is her affect.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.020
She's very much from Maine,
and her voice is very dry,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.120
and it doesn't rise or fall,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.370
and so she chooses her words
carefully and methodically.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.950
And she will just go different
places in the same tone of voice.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.870
And then it was just so
fascinating to grow up with that.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.450
And she did make things magical
for me, because as a child,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.500 position:56%
she would always be observing other
people and making remarks about them

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.190
that made me so interested in them.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.550
So it was very, always
interesting to be with my mother.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.590
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: I'm interested
in what you say about the voice,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.770
because the fact that it was always
even and level, and tranquil.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.060
So many of your characters
are passionate and kind

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.010
of off the wall a little bit.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.310
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.610
Right.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And delightfully
so, and wonderfully so.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.850
But the narration itself,
the way that you,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.080
the expanse of life before you

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.540
when you read an Elizabeth Strout
book is very tranquil, actually.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.020
Is this, was this what
affected you about her?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.320
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I
think it probably did.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.650
I mean, her voice is so much
a part of me and I also had,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.360 position:56%
I lived on a dirt road with a number

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.190
of elderly relatives,
my great-aunts.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.010
And they would sit and talk
in a similar kind of voice.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.190
And they would talk about
their husbands' last meals.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.150
That was like their
favorite discussion.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.930
And I can remember, you know,
my, I had an Aunt Olive.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.320
She was the nicest of them
actually, it's interesting.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.620
But anyway.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.920
I remember her saying, "Well,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.710
you know Frank had his mackerel
cooked the way he liked it."

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.400
And you know this was
just what they did.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.630
And so this was the
music I grew up with.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.380
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And
then you went on.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.240
And you tell -- in this
wonderful issue, and I trust some

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.930
of you saw it in the
Washington Post Book World.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.650
It's so wonderful to see Book World
in a standalone section, is it not?

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.080
Thank you.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.480
Well, on the very first page
is this marvelous interview.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.440
And in it, of course, you
talk about your family.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.330
And you talk about your past.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.750
And you talk about the fact that
you came up as a young woman,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.570
not in the ordinary writer's path.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.180
I mean, you didn't do an MFA,
you didn't do, or, you know,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.220
start teaching, or whatever it is.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.390 position:56%
Or go to work at a publishing house.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.320
You went to work as a waitress, I
think, in a textile job as well.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.620
You did a number of things.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.190
Tell us about that
portion of your life.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.490
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.790
It never, it never occurred
to me to get an MFA.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.090
I don't think I even
knew what they were.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.850 position:56%
So, I was just trying to make money.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.150
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.380
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: And so the
first year after I left college,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.550
I worked at the college as a
secretary in the secretarial pool

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.720
in the basement of
the office, you know,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.690
their office, the windowless
basement.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.010
And that alone was
interesting, because, you know,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.060
I went from having
relationships with the professors

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.360
which were like, "Oh,
hi, how are you?"

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.670
To just like, "Oh, here.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.360
Here's what I want typed."

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.160
And it was just very interesting
for me to understand the difference

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.790
between what it meant to be a
college student and what it meant

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.510
to be these secretaries
that I worked alongside of.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.500
And their lives were very rich
and had all sorts of things

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.440
to say to, you know, we all talked.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.810
But yet the professors
did not acknowledge them.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.110
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.130
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: And that was
a little interesting, you know.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.900
My very first ever, first
glimpse of like, mmm, I get it.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.200
I didn't get it.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.670
But, you know.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.670
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And then you
were a waitress for a while.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.970
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: For years.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.270
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: A pub
in England, I think.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.570
Right?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.870
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I
waitressed in every, not every,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.830
but almost every restaurant
in the East Coast.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.200
And I worked in a pub
in England for a year.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.500
Yep. Yep.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.800
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And
tell us about that.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:03.020
Because you, there's probably
no sort of no sort of,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.600
no sharper hierarchy than the
English language in England.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.900
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.200
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And if you
speak it in a certain way,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.730
you immediately categorize
where you've been to school.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.030
What --

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.330
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.630
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Part
of the country you are.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.930
Even though it's a small island.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.230
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: England has many
divisions of course, as we know.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.830
And you said something
about, you know,

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.000
the accents being dividing
and telling about.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.300
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.990
You know, by the end of the year
I began to understand, you know,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.670
began to hear the different
accents in a way that,

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.750
you know, at first I didn't.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.810
And I also began to understand

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.920
that people wondered
what class I came from.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.990
Because there I was working in
a pub, and yet I was American,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.540
so they couldn't really tell.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.650
And that very, in a vague
sense, because I was young,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.720
and you know, sort of stupid.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.420
But you know I was
understanding vaguely

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.380
that they were trying
to figure out who I was.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.680
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.340
Yeah. And, of course, we don't
think we have class in America.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:11.030
Right? But as you very, very, very
well outlined in your essay we do.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.330
And --

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.630
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Tell us about your
feelings about that whole structure.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.950
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
Well, a friend of mine

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.850 position:56%
who has taught working class studies
for many many years, we were talking

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.880
about class, and he said that,
if we don't think of it in terms

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.030
of economic situations,
or educational situations,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.510
but in fact who feels more
powerful or less powerful in terms

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.470
of their life -- that was very
helpful for me to understand that,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.520
you know, there are
so many more people

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.090
in the world now than
when I was born.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.290
I mean, in the country.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.800 position:56%
And so there are, and the technology
has changed and everything,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.570
and so the information is
coming in different ways.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.530
And people are sort of in many ways
becoming narrower, but they're not,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.840
because everybody has
so much stuff in them.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:09.330 position:56%
And yet, there's a tendency, I
think, to become one particular type

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.680
that they may think
of themselves as.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.380
And if they do not feel that
they have power over their lives,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.700
then that reinforces itself
with other voices of the same.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.000
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.810
Right. And you, I'm struck
by the fact that once you say

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.800
that in this essay,
all of your novels come

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.840
into sharp relief somehow.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.070
Because I remember, of
course in "Amy and Isabelle,"

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.930
there was the whole question
of having lost an opportunity.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.230
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.530
Yeah, right.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.830
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Did you know
that you were writing about --

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.130
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: No, I did not.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.620
When I was writing "Amy and
Isabelle," which was my first book,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.490
and it took me years to write.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.000
But I thought that I was writing
about a woman who ended up working

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.580
in the office room of a factory
because she thought she was better

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.880
than the other people
that worked there.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.620
She thought that she
should have been a teacher.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.250
But she got pregnant very early on.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.550
And so she couldn't.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.240
And she always resented that.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.210
And throughout most of the book
she feels that she's superior

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.880
to the women she was working with.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.440
And I didn't even understand
that I was writing about class.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.740
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.770
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Until when
the book was nominated for a prize,

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.380
and the judge said, "There
are some interesting issues

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.730
about class in here."

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.070
And I thought, oh!

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.040
Yeah. And there were.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.340
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.540
Well, you phrased it so
interestingly in this essay,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.970
because you say that you
knew this without knowing.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.270
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.570
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And
I love that phrase:

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.880
to know something without
knowing it.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.180
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.480
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: What
do you mean by that?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.780
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
Well, I think a lot

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.670
of us live knowing
things without knowing it.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.670
And I think what I mean
by that is that we,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.930
our sense of something
is true, and deep,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:08.630
and yet we may lack the language
to therefore consciously know it.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.820
And in this way books help.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.830
I'm going to give a little
plug for literature here.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.220
Because, you know,
because when we read,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.180
if we read about somebody else's
life, it can help us recognize,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.900
oh no, I understand those feelings.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.200
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.500
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Those
are feelings that I've had,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.800
and here they are articulated.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.400
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
You know, perhaps.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.700
So, that's kind of what
I mean by knowing --

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.000
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.300
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
Without knowing.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.600
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.630 position:56%
And, there's, I was reminded
because I scribbled as I was reading

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.900
that essay, that I remember that
that sounded familiar to me.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.830
And I went back to "Olive
Kitteridge," and there's a place

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:46.180
where a character says, "'You
get used to things,' he thinks,

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.990
'without getting used to things.'"
Which is sort of the opposite.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.290
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.680
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: But there's
a, there is that sense,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.340
and I feel it very much in your
writing, that people are sort

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.600 position:56%
of operating on a superficial level.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.580
But there is a deep, deep
human instinct beneath it

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.120
that drives them.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.420
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.720
But that would be most people.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.020
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.320
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: You know.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.620
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.920
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I mean,
that's most of our lives.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.450
I mean, we are walking
around, dealing with things,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:21.030
and yet we have our own internal
things that are privately ours.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.330
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.630
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: And very deep.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.020
Because they belong to us.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.000
They're who we are.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.290
And they can either
get expressed or not.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.300
And that's what interests me.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.190
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well, one very
deep thing I think that many people

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.690
in this room who are your readers,
knew instinctively and immediately

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.490
when they read "Amy and Isabelle"
was that you understood something

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:51.140
about the human condition that was
very connective and very appealing

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:57.670
and somehow spoke truth
in a great way.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.090
Tell us a bit about how "Amy
and Isabelle," let's start

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.890
at the beginning, happened.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.580
And how it came to you, and
why this mother and daughter

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.770
and why this disappointment
of lost opportunity.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.070
How did that come?

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.270
You know, the book -- I understood,
the book started as as short story,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.180
because that's what I
was writing at the time.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.980
And nobody wanted it, naturally.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.430
So, but it kept not going away.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.150
It kept coming back.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.270
And then I finally realized,
"Okay, I'm going to write a novel,"

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.540
and that was, like, so, you
know, exciting and nervewracking.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.490
And so I began with Amy.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.150
I mean, I never write
from beginning to end.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.850
But I thought at first it
would be mostly Amy's story.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.150 position:56%
And then I realized, no, no, no, no.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.570
This is both of their stories.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.520
And that's why's it's
called "Amy and Isabelle,"

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.820
because it's both their stories.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.730
So, and I realized the
mother's story was just

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.080
as important as the
daughter's story.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.910
And toward the beginning
when I wrote the sentence,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.170
"but Isabelle had her own
story," then I realized, oh,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.780
I can do that, I can write that.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.370
And then I can tell that story.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.540
And so, but Isabelle was a little
bit difficult to figure out,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.760
You know, I had to
scratch around to find her.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.580
And I did understand that there
would be that punishment scene,

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.000
where, you know, she
cuts the girl's hair off.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.190
And I did understand that it
would be for a sexual sin.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.960
But other than that
I didn't really know.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.110
So I had to earn my way to that.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.410
And then, once I got there, which
was like years later, I realized,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:39.540
"Oh, now I have to unravel
for another number of years."

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.190
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It sounds
to me that you were,

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.220
almost as you were
learning as you went.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.520
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.820
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.720
And that you -- and
although, you know,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.530
obviously you'd been
writing forever.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.830
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.360
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And
getting turned down,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.790
and rejections at the beginning.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.350
And then, "Olive Kitteridge"
comes along

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.040 position:56%
and you get, win the Pulitzer prize.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.330 position:56%
But I have the feeling that what
you're saying, especially about "Amy

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.800 position:56%
and Isabelle," is that it was a just
kind of discovery as you went along.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.100
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.400
It was. And it always is.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.700
It always is.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.290
I never know what I'm
going to write, exactly.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.050
I have some, you know, sort
of sense, as I had that sense

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.930
about the hair cutting scene.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.170
I thought, "Let's try and
earn our way to that."

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.950
So I have a sense of something.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.060
And then, you know, find out all
sorts of things along the way.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.360
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.290
And how did Olive come to you?

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.340
How did Olive Kitteridge come to
you?What a fabulous character.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.640
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: She came to me

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.010
when I was unloading
the dishwasher one day.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:44.720
And I just, I always, I just saw
this really large woman, you know,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.930
tall, big woman standing
near a picnic table.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.260
And I have never owned
a picnic table,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.540
and my family has never
owned a picnic table.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.790
But I saw her standing
next to a picnic table,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.690
and I could hear her thinking,
"It's high time everyone left."

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.610
And I thought, I better
get that down.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:12.440
So I did. So I got that down, and
then once I wrote that first story,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.940
well, it wasn't the
first story in the --

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.710
it was the story where she
steals her daughter-in-law's bra.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.640
Once I got that story down,
I realized, I'm going,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.790
I understood the form of
the book almost immediately,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.250
which is wonderful, because the
form of the book is everything.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.420 position:56%
And so I understood that I was going
to do this in a series of stories

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.500 position:56%
that had Olive, but then I
realized she's an awful lot to take.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.160
You know, we don't
want her in every page.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.440
A little too much for
me and for the reader.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.010
And so, then I began to realize
she's a part of the community.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.620
Let's look at her from
different angles.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.030
Because what interests me
so much is how, you know,

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.600
when we think we know someone.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.900
And we don't.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.200
We just know this part of them.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.480
And if you live in a town and you
see another part of that person --

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.510
you know, that was
very interesting to me.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.870
And so I began to, you know,
make the town around her.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.170
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.470
You made her a teacher.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.770
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.070
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Like your parents.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.850
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Is there
anything we can draw from that?

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.640
Or you're just familiar
with teaching?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.940
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
I just think was,

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.680
I just was familiar with teaching.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.130
She's a math teacher --
nobody in my family was,

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.920
you know, very good in math.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.880
But I, you know, a seventh grade
math teacher just seemed to be

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.230
who she was as I envisioned
her bulk.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.060
Mm-hmm. Now, speaking of her bulk.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.590
There was a movie made
of "Olive Kitteridge."

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.850
I haven't seen it, I prefer
to stay with the book.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.650
How did, first of all, how
did you feel about the movie?

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I thought
they did a wonderful job.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.670
I really did.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.220
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: She wasn't,
she didn't, from the pictures

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.520
that I've seen of the movie,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.270
this was not the Olive Kitteridge
I had pictured in my mind.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.570
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.870
Well, I think Frances
Mcdormand's a pretty woman.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.170
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: She is.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.280
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: And,
you know, my Olive is not,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.820
doesn't look like Frances.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.610
But I thought Frances did a
wonderful job creating her Olive.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So, you approve.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.210
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I did.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.510
I really did.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.810
Yeah. Very much.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.110
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Did you
have anything to do with it?

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.410
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: No.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:19.710
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: No, no.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.010
Okay.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.310
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I mean, I had,
you know, I had many conversations

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.610
with Frances about Olive.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.790
And then I spoke to the
screen director for, I mean,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.030
the screen writer for, you know,
an hour and a half one day.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.320
And then I spoke to the
director for an hour

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.490 position:56%
and a half one day, and that was it.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.300
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So, you
win the Pulitzer Prize.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.960
You've had this tremendous
trajectory from,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.190
you know, rejection to that.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.170
What happens after you
win the Pulitzer Prize?

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.940
Are you, did you say,
"Well, that's it"?

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.790
And you know "Now I'm going to
write what I want to write"?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.710
Or, do you say, "Oh God, now I have

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.590
to write something
that's better than that"?

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.470
Or, "God, will I ever be able to
write anything like that again?"

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.340
Could you tell us a little
bit about how you felt?

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.640
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: You know,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.530
I was just shredding some
old journals the other day.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.250
And I found a line
that I had written.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.560
And it said, "I won
the Pulitzer Prize,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.510
and this seems to impress people."

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.440
[ Laughter ]

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.750
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Did it
impress your mother?

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.160
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I don't know.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.160
I mean, it think it must have.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.510
How would you know?

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.670
You know, I assume it did.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.970
I really don't know.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.270
Must have.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.590
But that was, that's, it was
funny to come across that,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.890
you know, as my response.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.190
But anyway.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.880
I think I won it late
enough that it, you know,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.540
I have always had a sense of
responsibility to my reader.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.840
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.140
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I think
about my reader as I work.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.150
And it's like we're
involved in dance together.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.910
So, that didn't change.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.600
I have more readers as a
result of winning the prize.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.630
But my level of respect for the
reader and need, my need to,

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.690
you know, hold up my end of
the bargain, hasn't changed.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.990
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.820
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: So, I think,
you know, that was always there.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.120
So it's still there.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Writing
is a lonely business.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.720
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.600
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And reading
is a lonely business.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.800
I mean, basically you've got
to do these things alone.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.100
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.430
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So,
well, who is the writer?

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.910
Or the reader, excuse me,
that you're writing for?

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.210
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.510
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Who is that person?

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.810
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
Well, I make one up.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.390
I make up an ideal reader.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.460
And, you know, I figure
I can make up characters,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.330
I can make up an ideal reader.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:53.330
So I do. And I have, it's not,
it's actually not male or female.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:58.640
But it's a person who
probably needs my book.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.990
And, but they, but they're
asking for, they're patient,

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.410
but they're not too
patient, and they're willing

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.190
to maybe cut me a couple
of little mistakes.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.490
But that's it.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.420
I need to be delivering
to them truthfully.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.580
And they will receive
it on that level.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.380
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.860
Tell us about "Anything
is Possible."

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.160
I love that title.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.800
Number one, where does it come?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:33.100
But number two, it is a sort of
this rich stew of lots of, well,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.240
all your books have lots of people,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.510
and lots of emotions
and points of view.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.490
But "Anything is Possible"
seems to me

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.290
to be the most stew-y
book that you've written.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.030
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: There we go.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.980
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You know,
that there is, the narrative,

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.490
you could almost break off those
chapters and they would be novellas

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.730
of their own or short
stories of their own.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.360
I feel that a little bit
about all of your books.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.270
But never so much as this book.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.800
It is, it's a wonderful creation.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.880
It is sort of a great
view of American humanity.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.420
Tell us about your
writing of this book.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.170
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Well, I really
started the book at the same time

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.340
that I was writing "My
Name is Lucy Barton."

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.470
Because, when I was listening to,
or writing the different scenes

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.780
of the mother and the daughter
talking about the people

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.090
from her past, I became
curious about those people.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.390
And I thought, well, you know,

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.950
what happened to those
pretty Nicely girls?

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.250
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.550
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Oh,
well let's think about that.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.510
And, you know, I would
scribble down some scenes.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.160
And I would think, what
happened to Mississippi Mary?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.080
And so I would scribble
down some scenes.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.570
And then I realized by the
time I was done writing

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.080
"My Name is Lucy Barton,"
I realized, "Oh,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.090
I'm going to have a
book of these people."

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.390
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.830
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: And so,
that's where it came from.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.130
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: That's
what happened.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.430
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.730
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You make
it sound as if as a writer,

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.770
you're constantly having
a dialogue with yourself.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.070
Is that true?

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.460
Is that, are you constantly
sort of --

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.760
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I guess I am.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.060
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.570
Okay. Which leads me to the
next question, which is,

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.950
you're constantly having
a dialogue with yourself.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.630
You're creating this
wonderful cast of characters.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.980
To what extent -- you know,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.670
I think Freud said everything
that you dream is you.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:31.690
So, whatever nasty villain you
have there, or whatever, you know,

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:36.040
fabulous moment, it's all you.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.350
Are these characters all you?

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.980
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
You know, I mean, yes.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.720 position:56%
To a certain extent they have to be.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.330
Because, first of all,
I'm the only person

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.310
that I know, if I even know that.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.340
Which is questionable.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.970
But, you know, so there,
the core emotion.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.550
There has to be a kernel of
something that I understand

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.590
to be true in every person.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.680
Even though I'm not them.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.980
I'm not Pete Barton.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.280
I'm not Tommy, you know.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.380
But I have to understand some
kernel of truth about them,

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.710
from the inside, in order to write.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.740
So, you know, in that sense,
they're all pieces of me.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.040
Yeah.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.340
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.640
Yeah. Well, there are,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.290
there's obviously a rich
trove within Elizabeth Trout.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.080
You said something
in another interview,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.390
I think it was with the Guardian.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:39.480
And you said, "What has
always fascinated me most was,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.690
what does it feel like
to be another person?"

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.990
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And now, you've
just said, that you wanted

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.140
to know what happened to
the pretty Nicely girls.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.940
And that prompted you
to write something else.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:56.410
So, but that sense of empathy,
that, what does it feel

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.710
like to be another person?

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.130
What does it feel like
to be that person

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.100
who is not a very nice person?

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.400
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.000
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Or, that person
who is, you know, is such a softy

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.700
and should have a better spine.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.000
Where does that come from?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.300
And tell us your feelings about it.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.620
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: You know,
I don't know where it came from,

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.950
but I do remember at a very young
age recognizing that I would only,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.820
that all of us would only see
this world through our own eyes.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.720
And that was a little
upsetting for me.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.320
Because I wanted to
know what it would feel

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.170
like to be another person,
even for five minutes.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.980
I just thought, "What does
it feel like to be you know,

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.500
my Aunt Olive talking about
her husband's last meal?"

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.370
And I just would never know.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.430
And so I do remember at a very
young age, wanting to know

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.850
and that's never, ever left me.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.490
And the frustration of
that has never left me.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.250
And that's such a motivating
force behind my work.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.000
Because I want to know what
it's like to be another person.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.570
And I have to accept that we
won't know, but I think, you know,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.410
I remember when I was young,
also, I remember reading in a book

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.060
and I remember thinking,
"Oh, I've had that thought.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.430
You know, I didn't know
anybody else had that thought."

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.470
And I can't even remember
what the thought was.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.020
But I remember the feeling of
reading a book, and recognizing

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.480 position:56%
that somebody else had had a thought

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.450
that seemed private enough I
didn't know somebody else had it.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.730
And I realized, "Oh, you
know, literature can do this."

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.250
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:34.960
Mm-hmm. Your characters all
have a, either they feel they,

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.380
they feel a oneness of character,
or they are flawed in some way.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.910
And we know it, and they know it.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.210 position:56%
You're very interested in character.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:51.290
Last night at the festival gala
for the authors that was held

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:57.620
at the Library of Congress,
David McCullough said, "You know,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.780
there is such a thing as
the American character.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.080
There is such a thing,
and we're taught it.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.280
We don't know we're
learning it, but we all sit

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.600
at our parents' dinner table.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.740
We sit with our own
children at the dinner table,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.050
and that thing is given like a

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.260
black box."

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.170
You're interested in character.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.770
Do you think we have
an American character?

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:26.420
Do you think that there is, do
you think we can hold on to that?

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.720
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I think, yes,

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.320
I do think that we have
an American character.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.170
I think -- that's interesting.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.530
Yeah, we do.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.830
We're Americans.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.130
That means something.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.430
It means many different things.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:42.280 position:56%
But it means something to Americans,
that it means something --

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.650
so I do think that we
have American characters.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:50.370
And I don't know if
we can hold onto it.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.420
I don't know, I mean, I just don't
know the way the world is shifting

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.270 position:56%
how much, that's the answer to that.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.570
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: The big question.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.870
It's the big question.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.790
Tell us a little bit
about how you work.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.100
Are you disciplined?

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.700
Do you write as the muse hits you?

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.380
Or you sit down every day and pound
some words out and see how it goes?

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.880
How do you write?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:20.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I don't wait
for the muse to show up, you know.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.620
Because it doesn't show
up that frequently.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.800 position:56%
So, I -- it's my job, so I sit down,
I try and sit down, you know, every,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.990 position:56%
I mean, theoretically, I try and sit
down every morning, as soon as I,

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.180
you know, get my husband
out of the house.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.990
And, or else I"ll leave the
house and go [inaudible].

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.460
But, so I try and write every day.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.760
It's my job.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.060
It's just what I do.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.200 position:56%
And so whether I feel like it or not
is not relevant, because people go

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.550
to their jobs whether
they feel like it or not.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.270
So I sit down and I work.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.360
And some days it's good,
and some days it's not.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.910
Just like a lot of jobs.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.050
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So it's a
full eight-hour obligation.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.350
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.100
Only, I think, you know, if
I'm really into something,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.350
then I'm thinking about
it almost all the time.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.250
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Do you
look for distractions?

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.650
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: No.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:11.950
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: No.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.600
Good. Keep writing.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.190
It's time for your questions.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:22.200
So, please think of some
questions and come to the mics here

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.480
and ask Liz Strout
what you'd like to know

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.080
about her work and how she does it.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.900
Step right up, please.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.880
And I will ask one more question,
which is, this sense of work

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.260
that you just described,
this discipline,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.800
did that come from your parents?

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.780
Did that come from yourself?

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.500
Did that come from the law school?

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.800
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Where
did that come from?

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.400
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: It
probably came from my parents.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.700
My parents were very hard workers.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.860
My brother has been
a very hard worker,

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.230
and I have always been
a very hard worker.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.990
It's just what we were
brought up -- to work hard.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.290
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Mm-hmm.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.590
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
That's what we did.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.890
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Are you
working on another book?

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.190
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I am.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.490
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Wonderful.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.790
Is it characters that
we can be told about?

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.090
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
I can't tell you.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.290
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Okay.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.590
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Sorry.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.890
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Okay.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.190
Good enough.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.490
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I
would love to tell you.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.790
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Good enough.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.090
Well, you will eventually.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:20.390
You will eventually.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:21.690
Let's start over here, please.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.990
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is not so much a
question, but just a thank you.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.580
My husband and I, usually when
we go on vacation, we pick a book

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.000
to read together so that
have something to talk about.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.760
Not that we don't have
other things to talk about.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.390
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
No, I understand.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.310
&gt;&gt; But a few years ago we
chose "The Burgess Boys,"

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.080
and we both really liked it.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.220
He's a graduate of Bates
also, so that made him,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.730
you know, want to read it.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.140
But we just had such a good
time, and it's still something --

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.440
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: So glad.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.740
&gt;&gt; That sometimes it will
come up in conversation.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.040
"Oh, that reminds me of that book."

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I'm
so glad to hear that.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.640
&gt;&gt; So it really touched both of us.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.940
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I'm
very glad to hear that.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.700
Thank you so much for
telling me that.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.110
That's wonderful to hear.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.410
Really.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.710
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Next.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.010
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Thank you.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.430
&gt;&gt; I really liked the question
you asked about the title

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:07.280
of "Anything is Possible,"
because I love the book.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.750
Also, really love the title, so --

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.050
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.840
And I never got around
to answering that.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.140
Right. Right.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.440
And the title came
because of the last story.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.520
And really the last sentence,
which I did not write at the last.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.610
I mean, I wrote that
earlier, because I don't write

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.980
from beginning to end, ever.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.050
And so, I had written that
phrase earlier, or that scene,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.350
or played with that scene.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.720
And that phrase "anything is
possible" stayed in my mind.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.820
Because I understood it would
be in that final sentence.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.990
Whatever form that
sentence was, I thought,

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.380
"That's really what this is about."

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.030
And so, that was the
title of the book.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.190
And then, you know, it worried me
a little bit, because I thought,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.650
"Well, it's not a truthful thing."

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.770
But it is, in terms of this book.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.320
Anything is possible
in terms of, you know,

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.260
the moments of grace
that people can receive.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.630
It's not literally true, obviously.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.760
You know, but thank you.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.060
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank you.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.360
Over here, please.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'd be curious to
know if you have a character

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.940
that still haunts you, or
one that's your favorite?

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: I have a number
of characters that are my favorite.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.980
And one of my favorite
characters is in this book,

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:27.070
Charlie Macauley, who
went to Vietnam.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:31.920
I have no idea why this man has
affected me in a particular way.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.010
And so, he's my current
favorite because, you know,

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.800
whatever is most recent
stays with me.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.100
And

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:49.400
yeah. And Abel Blaine,
I love him, and Dottie.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.870
You know, but that's
all in this book.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.440
And I do have, I mean.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.130 position:56%
You know what, I just love them all.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.920
That's the truth.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.260
Anybody I wrote about, I really do.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.590
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: The naughty
ones and the good ones.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.320
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.690
But thank you.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:04.990
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank you.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.650
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I have a question about
Olive Kitteridge, her character.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:12.070
I read the book at a time when we
had recently discovered someone

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.150
in our family had borderline
personality, and it explained

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.660
so much about her behavior.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:22.850
And I wondered if that was some --
and Olive just rang so true to me.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:27.610 position:56%
And I wondered if that was something
that had occurred to you, if,

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.060
as you were writing her, or not?

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.360
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: No.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.660
It hadn't.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.910
But you're not the first
person who's brought that up.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:44.410
I mean, Olive's been diagnosed with
a number of psychiatric issues.

00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:49.630
And one time when I went to
a book club, this woman said

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.590
to me afterwards, "Well, it
was interesting to meet you.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.610 position:56%
I thought we were going to have to
have dinner with a real depressive."

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:02.280
So, I mean, it was an
Olive Kitteridge book club,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.770
but so, you know, whatever.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.680
But, no. But you're
not the first one.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.290
So she's, you know.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.810
I'm glad that she --

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.940
&gt;&gt; I just felt like, I get her!

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:17.510
Olive is so hard to deal with,
but I felt like I get it,

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.710
because you know, working
through that.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.010
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
Right, well, yeah.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.310
Good.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.610
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank you.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:24.910
Next question.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.050
&gt;&gt; "My Name is Lucy Barton"
felt to me like a memoir.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.660
So, I was surprised to
read about your upbringing.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.240
How in the world did
you enter that world?

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.540
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.800
And I meant it be like
a faux memoir.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.050
I mean, I meant this to
be Lucy Barton's memoir.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.150
But, how did I enter
that world when it was

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.240
so different from my childhood?

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:54.610
You know, I understood
her background somehow.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.800
I just began to really
understand it.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.050
And I went to school with a boy
-- I mention this in the essay.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.810
I went to school with a boy who
was from that kind of background.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.890
And every rural town that I've
ever known has had a family

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.490
like Lucy's that's just so poor,

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.730
and so odd that they're
ostracized by everybody.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.790
And there was a family
like that in my hometown.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.010
And this boy never spoke.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.310
He never spoke.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.610
And nobody ever spoke to him.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.020
And one day, the third grade
teacher said to him, "You're,

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.430
you have dirt behind your ears.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.250
Nobody's too poor to
buy a bar of soap."

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.800
And that kid got so red.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.340
And I always remembered that.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.470
And I had a sense of what
his house looked like,

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.110
because I would go
by it every so often.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.060
But anyway, so that's how I did it.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.360
I don't know how I did it.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.340
But I entered into that world
and brought her through.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.640
Thank you.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.940
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank
you for the question.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.240
Next one, please.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.540
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good morning.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.690
My question is, during
the talk you mentioned

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.610
that you shred some
of your journals.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.240
And I was just curious, why would,

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.070
why did you shred your,
some of your journals?

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.590
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout:
Because they're so foolish.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:12.220
They're just, they're
so worth shredding.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.030
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: It's just,
you know, one stream, whatever.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.330
Thank you.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:22.010
But, I mean, because I did.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.310
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank
you for the question.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.610
Over here, please.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:25.910
&gt;&gt; Hi, Elizabeth.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.210
I'm from Maine.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.510
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Oh.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.810
Where?

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.920
&gt;&gt; Portland, and we have
a house in Islesboro now.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.750
One of the things that I think
you really get right, as a Mainer,

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.380
is just the frugality
of all the Mainers.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.330
And I just wanted to, I think
it was in "The Burgess Boys."

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.780
A brother comes home
to visit the sister.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.540
And the house is 50 degrees.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.840
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.140
&gt;&gt; Which is a thing.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.440
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Yeah.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.730
&gt;&gt; And then one of the themes ithat
I see in your books is the person

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.840
in the family who's gotten away --

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.140
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And made it, and then comes back.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.130
In "Lucy Barton," there's
some really vivid scenes.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.830
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.130
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: You know.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.880 position:56%
I think that, and also like Jim
Burgess -- he's made it, supposedly,

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.520
and then he comes back
and stumbles around.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.140
And I think that, it's just
any dichotomy that you can get

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.960
on the page is interesting.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.150
And I did come from
a very small town,

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.870
and I did end up living
in New York City.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.700
So that is a think that I am
familiar with: the change of going

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.080
from an environment like
the kind I grew up in

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.800
and then living in New York.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.900
So that's interesting
to me personally

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.520
because I've experienced it.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.890
But I think that, you know,
sometimes people talk about hose

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.180
that have been trapped at
home, or have stayed at home.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.530
And I don't think of them as
trapped, or staying at home.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.980
I think that's simply the life.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.050
Like, you know, for
example, Susan Burgess.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.340
I always remember this woman in
New York City, she said to me,

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.920
"Why didn't Susan just leave?"

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.340
And it was so interesting to
me that she would ask that,

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.710
because why would Susan leave?

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.220
It's her home.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.880
Why in the world would she leave?

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.410
So, the New York person
didn't understand that,

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.390
and I found that interesting, you
know, for a number of reasons.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.120
But Susan lives her life.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.910
She's not trapped anymore than
anybody is, whether they're living

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.130
in New York, or Shirley
Falls, you see.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.540
So, that's also interesting
to me, you know?

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.810
&gt;&gt; And then the person who
gets away and makes it,

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.170 position:56%
doesn't really get away and make it.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.470
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: No.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.770
Because nobody does.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.330
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: We only have
time for one more question.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.630
So.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:34.990
&gt;&gt; Hi. I love your work.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.530
Thank you for coming here today.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.750
I was wondering, you
spoke to the fact

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.090
that you don't ever write
from beginning to end.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.390
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.360
&gt;&gt; And I was wondering, and
it's kind of a two-parter,

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.270
if you could speak a little
bit about when you know --

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:51.140
how the process comes about of
putting the pieces together,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.280
and whether you know the
end at the beginning,

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.260
or where the end comes
to you, and how you --

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.560
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.210
&gt;&gt; I'm a nonlinear writer,
and I was trying to figure

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.630
out how you get those pieces.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.030
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Right.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.420
You know, I'll write in scenes.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.620
Every day I just create
different scenes.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:12.580
And after a while I'll begin to see
that they'll connect in some way.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.000
And so, whether it's
a story, or a novel,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.820
I will understand the connection
between the scenes that have --

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.470
the scenes have to
have a pulse to them.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.830
They have to be living.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.220
And if they do, then they
will begin to connect.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.460
That's why I never worry
about plot, because that's

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.070
so artificially placed
onto something.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:34.430 position:56%
But if it arrives, you know, from
the work itself, and so I will begin

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.890
to recognize the connection
between things.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.730
And then at some point, I
do have to think, "Okay,

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.010
now where am I going to start?"

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.160
And then I'll start to
pull it together, you know,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.510
with as tight a thread as possible.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.320
And then, the ending.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.800
You know, I will have probably
already written the ending.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.660
And with the last page of
Olive Kitteridge, you know,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.850
I wrote that way before I
wrote the story, that it ended,

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.370
and I just wrote that last
page, and it just came to me,

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:05.210
and I wrote at the top,
"End," question mark.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.520
And thank God I didn't lose it.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.340
Because I easily could have.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.260
You know, I'm really
very messy, as a writer,

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.890
and I could have lost
it, but I didn't.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.910
And so as I was writing
that final story, I thought,

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.740
"Wait a minute, I have
the end of this."

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.040
And I did!

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.340
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you very much.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.640
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Thank
you, thank you.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.440
And, unfortunately --

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:35.550
[ Applause ]

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.100
Speaking of endings,
I just want to say,

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.040
Liz is going to be
signing her books at 11:30.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.030
Please go and meet her
in person, and sign,

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.690
have her books signed for you.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.400
Thank you Liz for coming.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.700
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Thank you.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It's been wonderful.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.560
You're terrific.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.860
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Strout: Thank you.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.990
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
