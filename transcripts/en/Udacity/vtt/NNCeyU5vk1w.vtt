00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.969
&gt;From the documentation, 
we want single choiceMode

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.080
so that the list item only shows 
one selected item at a time.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.020
We can declare this attribute 
on the ListView

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.428
in the fragment_main file.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.620
However, we don't want to specify 
choiceMode in one pane mode.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.406
To have these different code paths,

00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:16.562
we could copy the file 
in the Layout folder

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:19.550
and put it in the Layout-sw600dp folder.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.775
A better solution is to declare a style,

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.810
so we have one layout file 
but different styles.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.304
In the Base styles file 
in the Values folder,

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.111
we declare ForecastListStyle.

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:32.031
We leave it empty because we don't need
to specify choiceMode.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.960
We create a new styles file 
in the values-sw600dp folder.

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:37.217
In the two-pane case,

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.097
the ForecastListStyle 
does include the choiceMode.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.541
The two files have a different 
number of styles.

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:44.647
If it's not declared a higher folder,

00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:46.610
then it will just fall back
to the Base style.
