part of two-part question for Mike

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760
part of two-part question for Mike
 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.870
part of two-part question for Mike
how does flutter relate to Android well

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880
how does flutter relate to Android well
 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.940
how does flutter relate to Android well
let's see we have pretty much the entire

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950
let's see we have pretty much the entire
 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.490
let's see we have pretty much the entire
Android team what do you all think is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500
Android team what do you all think is
 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.170
Android team what do you all think is
the best framework for Android is it

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
the best framework for Android is it
 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.920
the best framework for Android is it
Android yeah so we kind of like our own

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
Android yeah so we kind of like our own
 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.090
Android yeah so we kind of like our own
stuff but the Android has always been

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100
stuff but the Android has always been
 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.250
stuff but the Android has always been
pretty open as our core principle so the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260
pretty open as our core principle so the
 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.920
pretty open as our core principle so the
better answer is use whatever works for

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
better answer is use whatever works for
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.070
better answer is use whatever works for
you we try to make stuff that works for

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080
you we try to make stuff that works for
 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.719
you we try to make stuff that works for
you we hope you like it we hope you use

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729
you we hope you like it we hope you use
 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.850
you we hope you like it we hope you use
it if you do that's great if you find

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860
it if you do that's great if you find
 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.080
it if you do that's great if you find
something that you like better

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090
something that you like better
 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.909
something that you like better
then that gives us something to shoot

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919
then that gives us something to shoot
 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.360
then that gives us something to shoot
for all right we have people at the mics

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
for all right we have people at the mics
 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.550
for all right we have people at the mics
now so why don't we go to a mic over on

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
now so why don't we go to a mic over on
 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:09.720
now so why don't we go to a mic over on
the left there

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730
 
 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.220
 
great question I think one of the things

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230
great question I think one of the things
 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.310
great question I think one of the things
we made clear in the keynote and we are

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320
we made clear in the keynote and we are
 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.550
we made clear in the keynote and we are
trying to say very clearly is we are

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560
trying to say very clearly is we are
 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.800
trying to say very clearly is we are
embracing Kotlin someone can hug max

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810
embracing Kotlin someone can hug max
 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.680
embracing Kotlin someone can hug max
there if you want yeah hug max we're

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690
there if you want yeah hug max we're
 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.050
there if you want yeah hug max we're
bracing Kotlin embrace but we're also

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060
bracing Kotlin embrace but we're also
 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.670
bracing Kotlin embrace but we're also
doubling down simultaneously on our

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680
doubling down simultaneously on our
 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.210
doubling down simultaneously on our
existing languages and we were very open

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220
existing languages and we were very open
 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.200
existing languages and we were very open
about that in the keynote with

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210
about that in the keynote with
 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.110
about that in the keynote with

like to try Kotlin it is quite a

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660
like to try Kotlin it is quite a
 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.570
like to try Kotlin it is quite a
beautiful language and a lot of us here

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580
beautiful language and a lot of us here
 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.220

honest like we're not on those teams so

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360
honest like we're not on those teams so
 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.430
honest like we're not on those teams so
that's why we're kind of looking at each

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440
that's why we're kind of looking at each
 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.040

a control that you should have and you
 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.860
a control that you should have and you
still have that in all these services I

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870
still have that in all these services I
 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.900
still have that in all these services I
think you're asking for those teams to

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910
think you're asking for those teams to
 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.910
think you're asking for those teams to
support the new services they're

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:44.920
support the new services they're
 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.440
support the new services they're
introducing and then not require

those features good is to use those

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:50.920
those features good is to use those

services if they're having a chat of

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860
services if they're having a chat of
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.100
services if they're having a chat of
their own like this I would ask you to

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.110
their own like this I would ask you to
 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.530
their own like this I would ask you to
ask them but we are ensuring that you

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:58.540
ask them but we are ensuring that you
 

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.540
ask them but we are ensuring that you
always have the choice it may not be the

know fine grained choices within but we

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:04.600
know fine grained choices within but we
 

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.670

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.110
 
yeah so I actually did have project

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120
yeah so I actually did have project
 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.990
yeah so I actually did have project
travel as part of my keynote but we can

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000
travel as part of my keynote but we can
 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.510
travel as part of my keynote but we can
have enough time number one number two

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:06.520
have enough time number one number two
 

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.480
have enough time number one number two
is it's a very device manufacturer

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:09.490
is it's a very device manufacturer
 

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.000
is it's a very device manufacturer
focused project and so we thought we

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.010
focused project and so we thought we
 

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.100
focused project and so we thought we
might bore you all a little bit but

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.110
might bore you all a little bit but
 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.730
might bore you all a little bit but
since you've asked I can for you now

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740
since you've asked I can for you now
 

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.050
since you've asked I can for you now
bring up the teleprompter no I'm joking

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.060
bring up the teleprompter no I'm joking
 

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.500
bring up the teleprompter no I'm joking
yeah so project travel actually if you

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:22.510
yeah so project travel actually if you
 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.970
yeah so project travel actually if you
ask a lot of people around here who

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:23.980
ask a lot of people around here who
 

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.500
ask a lot of people around here who
worked on it they'll tell you it was a

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:25.510
worked on it they'll tell you it was a
 

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.690
worked on it they'll tell you it was a
huge amount of work and they're still

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:27.700
huge amount of work and they're still
 

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.639
huge amount of work and they're still
angry at me Rashaad is nodding his head

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:29.649
angry at me Rashaad is nodding his head
 

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:32.940
angry at me Rashaad is nodding his head
he's like so pissed off because the

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:32.950
he's like so pissed off because the
 

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.110
he's like so pissed off because the
amount of work that went into media

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120
amount of work that went into media
 

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.240
amount of work that went into media
framework was huge but basically what we

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.250
framework was huge but basically what we
 

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.190
framework was huge but basically what we
did was we created a foundation layer to

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200
did was we created a foundation layer to
 

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.680
did was we created a foundation layer to
Android a very formal we call vendor

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.690
Android a very formal we call vendor
 

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.610
Android a very formal we call vendor
interface and it's analogous to the

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:44.620
interface and it's analogous to the
 

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.019
interface and it's analogous to the
developer API so today we have a

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:46.029
developer API so today we have a
 

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:48.000
developer API so today we have a
developer API we have CTF tests have

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.010
developer API we have CTF tests have
 

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.829
developer API we have CTF tests have
tested the idea being you write an

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839
tested the idea being you write an
 

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.240
tested the idea being you write an
application that runs on any hardware

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.250
application that runs on any hardware
 

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.310
application that runs on any hardware
we've introduced a new vendor interface

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.320
we've introduced a new vendor interface
 

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.000
we've introduced a new vendor interface
at the bottom

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.010
at the bottom
 

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.829
at the bottom
everything south of the vendor interface

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839
everything south of the vendor interface
 

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.780
everything south of the vendor interface
is Silicon specific and hardware

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:57.790
is Silicon specific and hardware
 

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.319
is Silicon specific and hardware
specific and then we have VTS tests that

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:01.329
specific and then we have VTS tests that
 

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:04.110
specific and then we have VTS tests that
test that vendor interface so the idea

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120
test that vendor interface so the idea
 

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.389
test that vendor interface so the idea
is when the P release comes along

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399
is when the P release comes along
 

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.790
is when the P release comes along
through a device maker you take P and it

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800
through a device maker you take P and it
 

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.680
through a device maker you take P and it
will run on top of your vendor

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:10.690
will run on top of your vendor
 

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.870
will run on top of your vendor
implementation from today's odof ice

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880

that you build SE and the whole reason

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:15.610
that you build SE and the whole reason
 

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.840
that you build SE and the whole reason
for that is we want to make it easier

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:18.850
for that is we want to make it easier
 

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.730
for that is we want to make it easier
and faster for device makers to update

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:20.740
and faster for device makers to update
 

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.699
and faster for device makers to update
devices because if it's faster they'll

00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:23.709
devices because if it's faster they'll
 

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:25.590
devices because if it's faster they'll
get updates that more quickly if it cost

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600
get updates that more quickly if it cost
 

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.900
get updates that more quickly if it cost
less they'll do more updates so that's

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:27.910
less they'll do more updates so that's
 

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.329
less they'll do more updates so that's
the whole premise of it it's a huge huge

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:30.339
the whole premise of it it's a huge huge
 

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:31.580
the whole premise of it it's a huge huge
change with very formal

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:31.590
change with very formal
 

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.980
change with very formal
err I can talk about it more but you

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:33.990
err I can talk about it more but you
 

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.930

Colin like last year somebody grabbed

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.030
Colin like last year somebody grabbed
 

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.090
Colin like last year somebody grabbed
the mic and said hey we have Kotlin and

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100
the mic and said hey we have Kotlin and
 

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.500
the mic and said hey we have Kotlin and
Evan put their hands up and so we gave

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:42.510
Evan put their hands up and so we gave
 

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.980
Evan put their hands up and so we gave
you Kotlin treble you ask we deliver a

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:47.990
you Kotlin treble you ask we deliver a
 

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.400
you Kotlin treble you ask we deliver a
cup not really a 4/4 treble it was

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:52.410
cup not really a 4/4 treble it was
 

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.840
cup not really a 4/4 treble it was
actually the silicon vendors and the

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:53.850
actually the silicon vendors and the
 

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.270
actually the silicon vendors and the
device makers who were asking us I had

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:56.280
device makers who were asking us I had
 

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.430
device makers who were asking us I had
already reduced the cost because today

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440
already reduced the cost because today
 

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.870
already reduced the cost because today
when you build its Android device a lot

00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880
when you build its Android device a lot
 

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.550
when you build its Android device a lot
of the silicon and device specific code

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560
of the silicon and device specific code
 

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.860
of the silicon and device specific code
is intermixed with a framework and the

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:03.870
is intermixed with a framework and the
 

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.330
is intermixed with a framework and the
core OS and then every time we change

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:05.340
core OS and then every time we change
 

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.650
core OS and then every time we change
the operating system they have to rework

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660
the operating system they have to rework
 

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.840
the operating system they have to rework
that code and so you know they asked us

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:08.850
that code and so you know they asked us
 

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.370
that code and so you know they asked us
and if we make it better and so we came

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380
and if we make it better and so we came
 

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.260
and if we make it better and so we came
up with with trouble but yeah it's a

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.270
up with with trouble but yeah it's a
 

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.790
up with with trouble but yeah it's a
huge change probably the biggest we

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800
huge change probably the biggest we
 

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.560
huge change probably the biggest we
architected of Android since it started

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.570
architected of Android since it started
 

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.450
architected of Android since it started
it was an enormous amount of work and

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:17.460
it was an enormous amount of work and
 

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.580
it was an enormous amount of work and
thank you to all my colleagues who hate

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:19.590
thank you to all my colleagues who hate
 

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:25.160
thank you to all my colleagues who hate
me for implementing it so yes so Sudeste

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.170
me for implementing it so yes so Sudeste
 

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.020
me for implementing it so yes so Sudeste
it was a huge amount of work I just want

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.030
it was a huge amount of work I just want
 

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.280
it was a huge amount of work I just want
to make sure you understand there's a

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.290
to make sure you understand there's a
 

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.900
to make sure you understand there's a
lot of engineers at Google we are not

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:29.910
lot of engineers at Google we are not
 

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.210
lot of engineers at Google we are not
here today they're not a oh they have

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220
here today they're not a oh they have
 

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.490
here today they're not a oh they have
been working incredibly hard they had to

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500
been working incredibly hard they had to
 

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.840
been working incredibly hard they had to
go through like millions of lines of

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:35.850
go through like millions of lines of
 

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.060
go through like millions of lines of
code touch lines of code that never seen

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:38.070
code touch lines of code that never seen
 

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.540

before one guy on my team like I think

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:41.550
before one guy on my team like I think
 

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.680
before one guy on my team like I think
almost lost it working on this so you

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.690
almost lost it working on this so you
 

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.330
almost lost it working on this so you
should share them because it's a huge

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:47.340
should share them because it's a huge
 

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.530
should share them because it's a huge
amount of what you'll never seen API

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540
amount of what you'll never seen API
 

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.700
amount of what you'll never seen API
you'll never see tools but is going to

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:49.710
you'll never see tools but is going to
 

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:58.780
you'll never see tools but is going to
make Android better in the future

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:58.790
 
 

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.429
 
we tried to bring any more engineers up

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:01.439
we tried to bring any more engineers up
 

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:03.079
we tried to bring any more engineers up
on stage the producers would have killed

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:03.089
on stage the producers would have killed
 

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:05.210
on stage the producers would have killed
us so there was a follow-up question

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220
us so there was a follow-up question
 

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.499
us so there was a follow-up question
about treble in Twitter on Twitter so I

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:09.509
about treble in Twitter on Twitter so I
 

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:12.650
about treble in Twitter on Twitter so I
was going to ask that one which was the

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660
was going to ask that one which was the
 

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.059
was going to ask that one which was the
dockside the treble on device is

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:14.069
dockside the treble on device is
 

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:15.949
dockside the treble on device is
launched with oh but DP one running with

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959
launched with oh but DP one running with
 

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:18.199
launched with oh but DP one running with
treble on existing devices okay that

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:18.209
treble on existing devices okay that
 

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:19.460
treble on existing devices okay that
wasn't a complete sentence but this is

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:19.470
wasn't a complete sentence but this is
 

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.019
wasn't a complete sentence but this is
Twitter so that question is will devices

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:24.029
Twitter so that question is will devices
 

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.569
Twitter so that question is will devices
that get updated to also get treble

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579
that get updated to also get treble
 

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.999
that get updated to also get treble
right so so one of the challenges of

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:29.009
right so so one of the challenges of
 

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:30.799
right so so one of the challenges of
doing this hugely architecture is that

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:30.809
doing this hugely architecture is that
 

00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:33.139
doing this hugely architecture is that
if we did it sort of blindly we've

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:33.149
if we did it sort of blindly we've
 

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:35.090
if we did it sort of blindly we've
actually slowed down an adoption - oh I

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100
actually slowed down an adoption - oh I
 

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.249
actually slowed down an adoption - oh I
think it'd be a lot of work to do and so

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:37.259
think it'd be a lot of work to do and so
 

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.139
think it'd be a lot of work to do and so
we wanted to try not to slow down the

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:39.149
we wanted to try not to slow down the
 

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:40.549
we wanted to try not to slow down the
short term to speed up in the long term

00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:40.559
short term to speed up in the long term
 

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:43.309
short term to speed up in the long term
so if you have an existing device using

00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:43.319
so if you have an existing device using
 

00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:45.559
so if you have an existing device using
a device maker on N and you want to

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:45.569
a device maker on N and you want to
 

00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:47.660
a device maker on N and you want to
update - oh the travel requirements

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:47.670
update - oh the travel requirements
 

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.600
update - oh the travel requirements
aren't applied to you however if you're

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.610
aren't applied to you however if you're
 

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.919
aren't applied to you however if you're
a new device if you're a device maker

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:51.929
a new device if you're a device maker
 

00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:54.169
a new device if you're a device maker
building a new device then you have to

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:54.179
building a new device then you have to
 

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:56.179
building a new device then you have to
comply to the ole architecture so that's

00:12:56.179 --> 00:12:56.189
comply to the ole architecture so that's
 

00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:58.280
comply to the ole architecture so that's
sort of how it works and then what we

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:58.290
sort of how it works and then what we
 

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.679
sort of how it works and then what we
did just to prove it all out was we

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:00.689
did just to prove it all out was we
 

00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:04.759
did just to prove it all out was we
decided to treat the 2016 pixel as a new

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:04.769
decided to treat the 2016 pixel as a new
 

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:07.639
decided to treat the 2016 pixel as a new
device for oh and so this is fully what

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:07.649
device for oh and so this is fully what
 

00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:09.799
device for oh and so this is fully what
we call treble eyes which means that all

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:09.809
we call treble eyes which means that all
 

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:11.569
we call treble eyes which means that all
of that vendor implementation is is

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579
of that vendor implementation is is
 

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:13.819
of that vendor implementation is is
implemented in a separate process and

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:13.829
implemented in a separate process and
 

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:16.009
implemented in a separate process and
it's built like you would rebuild we

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019
it's built like you would rebuild we
 

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.289
it's built like you would rebuild we
basically rebuilt the system on pixel

00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:18.299
basically rebuilt the system on pixel
 

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:19.699
basically rebuilt the system on pixel
and we did that because we wanted to

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:19.709
and we did that because we wanted to
 

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:22.639
and we did that because we wanted to
prove it and to end so that devices are

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:22.649
prove it and to end so that devices are
 

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.559
prove it and to end so that devices are
coming later in the year new devices I

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:24.569
coming later in the year new devices I
 

00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:26.600
coming later in the year new devices I

should know that battery life and the

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:38.400
should know that battery life and the
 

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.680
should know that battery life and the
reason we don't break it it's because

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:39.690
reason we don't break it it's because

all of you we have to mesh the keeping

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:44.970
all of you we have to mesh the keeping
 

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.910
all of you we have to mesh the keeping
you alive but keeping better like alive

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920
you alive but keeping better like alive
 

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.470

at the same time alright that'll do for

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480
at the same time alright that'll do for
 

00:14:51.480 --> 00:15:11.730
at the same time alright that'll do for
a sample how about over here

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:11.740
 
 

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:18.130
 
um you know that really depends on you

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:18.140
um you know that really depends on you
 

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.720
um you know that really depends on you
know I don't I don't regret the stuff we

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:19.730
know I don't I don't regret the stuff we
 

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.280
know I don't I don't regret the stuff we
did and I think you always make

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.290
did and I think you always make
 

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.230
did and I think you always make
improvements but you know it's you're

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240
improvements but you know it's you're
 

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.580
improvements but you know it's you're
looking for things I would change

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:24.590
looking for things I would change
 

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.230
looking for things I would change
probably the big things is like step

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240
probably the big things is like step
 

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.730
probably the big things is like step
that we did that allow the applications

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:27.740
that we did that allow the applications
 

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.010
that we did that allow the applications
to do too much like a big one for me is

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.020
to do too much like a big one for me is
 

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.600
to do too much like a big one for me is
the Settings provider access allowing

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:31.610
the Settings provider access allowing
 

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.100
the Settings provider access allowing
applications to take change system

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.110
applications to take change system
 

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.810
applications to take change system
settings I wish we had never done that

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:34.820
settings I wish we had never done that
 

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.180
settings I wish we had never done that
and you know just made sure we had clear

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:37.190
and you know just made sure we had clear
 

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.860
and you know just made sure we had clear
controlled api's for them to do things

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:38.870
controlled api's for them to do things
 

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.390
controlled api's for them to do things
so those are the kind of things that

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:40.400
so those are the kind of things that
 

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.460
so those are the kind of things that
they're really hard after the fact once

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:42.470
they're really hard after the fact once
 

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.900
they're really hard after the fact once
applications start doing things to try

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:43.910
applications start doing things to try
 

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.270
applications start doing things to try
to get them back under control and

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:46.280
to get them back under control and
 

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.380
to get them back under control and
they'll talk the main things I think I

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:47.390
they'll talk the main things I think I
 

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.510
they'll talk the main things I think I
wish we just you know click places of

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:49.520
wish we just you know click places of
 

00:15:49.520 --> 00:16:20.500
wish we just you know click places of
wish we've done better apps like

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:20.510
 
 

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.800
 
well I mean that amantha thing is that's

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:23.810
well I mean that amantha thing is that's
 

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.450
well I mean that amantha thing is that's
not really about users that that's about

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:25.460
not really about users that that's about
 

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.100
not really about users that that's about
developers and there's a lot of things

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.110
developers and there's a lot of things
 

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.870
developers and there's a lot of things
that we don't allow applications to do

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880
that we don't allow applications to do
 

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.090
that we don't allow applications to do
because it's better for the overall

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.100
because it's better for the overall
 

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.630
because it's better for the overall
device behavior and actually you know FS

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:34.640
device behavior and actually you know FS
 

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.860
device behavior and actually you know FS
repeats fevers is actually one of the

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:35.870
repeats fevers is actually one of the
 

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.680
repeats fevers is actually one of the
things that some speaking of things we

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:38.690
things that some speaking of things we
 

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.570
things that some speaking of things we
regret doing I think if I had done again

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:40.580
regret doing I think if I had done again
 

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.170
regret doing I think if I had done again
like having that be so easy to make

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:44.180
like having that be so easy to make
 

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.130
like having that be so easy to make
things that you can launch applications

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:45.140
things that you can launch applications
 

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.080
things that you can launch applications
like that was clearly a big mistake that

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.090
like that was clearly a big mistake that
 

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.190
like that was clearly a big mistake that
we made and we didn't really at the time

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:50.200
we made and we didn't really at the time
 

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.900
we made and we didn't really at the time
realize that once it's there and you

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:52.910
realize that once it's there and you
 

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.730
realize that once it's there and you
have like 100 applications on your phone

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:54.740
have like 100 applications on your phone
 

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.250
have like 100 applications on your phone
all listening to this broadcast the kind

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.260
all listening to this broadcast the kind
 

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.510
all listening to this broadcast the kind
of like hell that's going to break loose

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:58.520
of like hell that's going to break loose
 

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.120
of like hell that's going to break loose
on the device when that happens so I

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.130
on the device when that happens so I
 

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.470
on the device when that happens so I
really think that's that's something

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480
really think that's that's something
 

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.140
really think that's that's something
that we need to like to really put

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.150
that we need to like to really put
 

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.660
that we need to like to really put
brakes on and get control back over the

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:07.670
brakes on and get control back over the
 

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.160
brakes on and get control back over the
device and switch the more controlled

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.170
device and switch the more controlled
 

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.550
device and switch the more controlled
things like job scheduler and if I could

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:12.560
things like job scheduler and if I could
 

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.829
things like job scheduler and if I could
add to that on user choice you know we

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839
add to that on user choice you know we
 

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.390
add to that on user choice you know we
announced I hope we announce that we

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400
announced I hope we announce that we
 

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.920
announced I hope we announce that we
have two billion users if not I just

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:17.930
have two billion users if not I just
 

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.210
have two billion users if not I just
announced it

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.220
announced it
 

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.819
announced it
and that's a reasonable fraction of the

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:21.829
and that's a reasonable fraction of the
 

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.110
and that's a reasonable fraction of the
world's population and so we think about

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120
world's population and so we think about
 

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.040
world's population and so we think about
literally everyone when we're designing

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.050
literally everyone when we're designing
 

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.470
literally everyone when we're designing
it and there's a lot of questions and

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480
it and there's a lot of questions and
 

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.030
it and there's a lot of questions and
it's just really hard to put in front of

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.040
it's just really hard to put in front of
 

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.400
it's just really hard to put in front of
users and expect them to make scalable

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.410
users and expect them to make scalable
 

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.350
users and expect them to make scalable
decisions especially when applications

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360
decisions especially when applications
 

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.030
decisions especially when applications
put something in their face that says

put something in their face that says
you know hey just please turn this on

you know hey just please turn this on
it'll make this feature better and it's

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880
it'll make this feature better and it's
 

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.280
it'll make this feature better and it's
not the applications are doing anything

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.290
not the applications are doing anything
 

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.130
not the applications are doing anything
wrong usually as their individual choice

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:45.140
wrong usually as their individual choice
 

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.890

the same thing and the user says well I

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:49.460
the same thing and the user says well I
 

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.080
the same thing and the user says well I
said yes to the first 70 I'll say yes to

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.090
said yes to the first 70 I'll say yes to
 

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.970
said yes to the first 70 I'll say yes to
the next 30 then they end up with an

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:54.980
the next 30 then they end up with an
 

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.760
the next 30 then they end up with an
unusable device so we have to balance

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:56.770
unusable device so we have to balance
 

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.140
unusable device so we have to balance
user choice which you're right that is

00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.150
user choice which you're right that is
 

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.090
user choice which you're right that is
one of our core principles we have to

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:01.100
one of our core principles we have to
 

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.250
one of our core principles we have to
balance that with making devices that

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:03.260
balance that with making devices that
 

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.100
balance that with making devices that
like literally anyone can administer and

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.110
like literally anyone can administer and
 

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.330
like literally anyone can administer and
manage and still have a good experience

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:07.340
manage and still have a good experience
 

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.260
manage and still have a good experience
I can add more to that too because on

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:11.270
I can add more to that too because on
 

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.940
I can add more to that too because on
top of that they're you know there is

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:12.950
top of that they're you know there is
 

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.010
top of that they're you know there is
user choice you can like say I want to

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:15.020
user choice you can like say I want to
 

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.450
user choice you can like say I want to
if you really want to listening things

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:16.460
if you really want to listening things
 

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.610
if you really want to listening things
going on do a foreground service and the

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:18.620
going on do a foreground service and the
 

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.960
going on do a foreground service and the
user knows that you're running all the

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:19.970
user knows that you're running all the
 

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.390
user knows that you're running all the
time now and I think that part of this

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400
time now and I think that part of this
 

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.000
time now and I think that part of this
is actually having the user choice being

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.010
is actually having the user choice being
 

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.310
is actually having the user choice being
like clear to the user you know it's

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320
like clear to the user you know it's
 

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.630
like clear to the user you know it's
like it's clear to the users like oh

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640
like it's clear to the users like oh
 

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.370
like it's clear to the users like oh
this application is like just running it

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:30.380
this application is like just running it
 

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.419
this application is like just running it
all the time because I really care about

00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:32.429
all the time because I really care about
 

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:34.820
all the time because I really care about
so it's okay with me and I will lead to

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:34.830
so it's okay with me and I will lead to
 

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.009
so it's okay with me and I will lead to
do that versus like subtleties about

00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:37.019
do that versus like subtleties about
 

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:39.409
do that versus like subtleties about
like well okay I have this choice to

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419
like well okay I have this choice to
 

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:41.749
like well okay I have this choice to
allow it to run sometimes in the

00:18:41.749 --> 00:18:41.759
allow it to run sometimes in the
 

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:43.249
allow it to run sometimes in the
background but I don't really know what

00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:43.259
background but I don't really know what
 

00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:45.470
background but I don't really know what
that does and I don't realize that when

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480
that does and I don't realize that when
 

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.999
that does and I don't realize that when
I do this a lot with a lot of

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:47.009
I do this a lot with a lot of
 

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:48.560
I do this a lot with a lot of
applications that actually there's a lot

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.570
applications that actually there's a lot
 

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.730
applications that actually there's a lot
of stuff going on the background not

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740
of stuff going on the background not
 

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.029
of stuff going on the background not
aware of so I think it's you know we we

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039
aware of so I think it's you know we we
 

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:55.039
aware of so I think it's you know we we
learned it like with the list foreground

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:55.049
learned it like with the list foreground
 

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:56.629
learned it like with the list foreground
services they're having that UI and

00:18:56.629 --> 00:18:56.639
services they're having that UI and
 

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:58.669
services they're having that UI and
having like these kind of clear lock

00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679
having like these kind of clear lock
 

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.739
having like these kind of clear lock
things you go into like oh I've decided

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:00.749
things you go into like oh I've decided
 

00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:03.109
things you go into like oh I've decided
this so this has a lot of input you know

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:03.119
this so this has a lot of input you know
 

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:04.639
this so this has a lot of input you know
implications of what you do that the

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:04.649
implications of what you do that the
 

00:19:04.649 --> 00:19:06.200
implications of what you do that the
user understands all that stuff together

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.210
user understands all that stuff together
 

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.180
user understands all that stuff together
as that's a good you know they can make

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.190
as that's a good you know they can make
 

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.560
as that's a good you know they can make
that choice between those things but

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:09.570
that choice between those things but
 

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.749
that choice between those things but
having kind of subtle choices about like

00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:11.759
having kind of subtle choices about like
 

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.850
having kind of subtle choices about like
this or that and it's not really clear

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860
this or that and it's not really clear
 

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.440
this or that and it's not really clear
what it means really doesn't leave the

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.450
what it means really doesn't leave the
 

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.909
what it means really doesn't leave the
user with much choice so they don't

00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919
user with much choice so they don't
 

00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:21.950
user with much choice so they don't
really understand I think that finally

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960
really understand I think that finally
 

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.259
really understand I think that finally
that kind of shows another principle

00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:24.269
that kind of shows another principle
 

00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:26.029
that kind of shows another principle
that's coming to the forefront in more

00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039
that's coming to the forefront in more
 

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.680
that's coming to the forefront in more
recent versions of Android which is that

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:27.690
recent versions of Android which is that
 

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.570
recent versions of Android which is that
when the user makes a choice we want to

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580
when the user makes a choice we want to
 

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.940
when the user makes a choice we want to
make sure that their choice to allow the

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:31.950
make sure that their choice to allow the
 

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.230
make sure that their choice to allow the
app to do something we want to make sure

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240
app to do something we want to make sure
 

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.460
app to do something we want to make sure
that that's something that the user can

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:34.470
that that's something that the user can
 

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.109
that that's something that the user can
actually see the effects of and make

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:36.119
actually see the effects of and make
 

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:37.310
actually see the effects of and make
sure that they can kind of audit that

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320
sure that they can kind of audit that
 

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.499
sure that they can kind of audit that
behavior as they use the device so I

00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:39.509
behavior as they use the device so I
 

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:41.629
behavior as they use the device so I
think that if I am said the foreground

00:19:41.629 --> 00:19:41.639
think that if I am said the foreground
 

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.220
think that if I am said the foreground
service notification really does kind of

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.230
service notification really does kind of
 

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.869
service notification really does kind of
provide that visibility when an app is

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:44.879
provide that visibility when an app is
 

00:19:44.879 --> 00:19:48.889
provide that visibility when an app is
running in the background Thanks a

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:48.899
running in the background Thanks a
 

00:19:48.899 --> 00:19:51.080
running in the background Thanks a
little different topic so we'll take one

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:51.090
little different topic so we'll take one
 

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.779
little different topic so we'll take one
from online for Rachel I believe is

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:53.789
from online for Rachel I believe is
 

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:56.539
from online for Rachel I believe is
material design done or do you see it

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:56.549
material design done or do you see it
 

00:19:56.549 --> 00:20:01.100
material design done or do you see it
growing and evolving the work is never

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.110
growing and evolving the work is never
 

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.529
growing and evolving the work is never
done with design and I think that you

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539
done with design and I think that you
 

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.450
done with design and I think that you
probably have a lot of other things

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460
probably have a lot of other things
 

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.190
probably have a lot of other things
other patterns that you would like to

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200
other patterns that you would like to
 

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.399
other patterns that you would like to
see and have supported for your apps so

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:13.409
see and have supported for your apps so
 

00:20:13.409 --> 00:20:16.070
see and have supported for your apps so
the material team they're growing and

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080
the material team they're growing and
 

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.769
the material team they're growing and
they're investing heavily in this space

00:20:18.769 --> 00:20:18.779
they're investing heavily in this space
 

00:20:18.779 --> 00:20:20.869
they're investing heavily in this space
this was an offshoot of Android the

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:20.879
this was an offshoot of Android the
 

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:23.889
this was an offshoot of Android the
material team started out very small in

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:23.899
material team started out very small in
 

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:26.539
material team started out very small in
Android and and then it grew so big that

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:26.549
Android and and then it grew so big that
 

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:28.340
Android and and then it grew so big that
it is a completely different department

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:28.350
it is a completely different department
 

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.019
it is a completely different department
so yeah I don't think they're sitting

00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:30.029
so yeah I don't think they're sitting
 

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:31.279
so yeah I don't think they're sitting
around twiddling their thumbs they're

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:31.289
around twiddling their thumbs they're
 

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:34.039
around twiddling their thumbs they're
definitely doing a lot to evolve the

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:34.049
definitely doing a lot to evolve the
 

00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:38.749
definitely doing a lot to evolve the
language designers design and in

00:20:38.749 --> 00:20:38.759
language designers design and in
 

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.849
language designers design and in
particular they just launched a bunch of

00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:40.859
particular they just launched a bunch of
 

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:41.869
particular they just launched a bunch of
code one of the great things about

00:20:41.869 --> 00:20:41.879
code one of the great things about
 

00:20:41.879 --> 00:20:43.099
code one of the great things about
having a separate department for

00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:43.109
having a separate department for
 

00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:45.109
having a separate department for
material is that they have now the

00:20:45.109 --> 00:20:45.119
material is that they have now the
 

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.490
material is that they have now the
capacity to bring on

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500
capacity to bring on
 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.350
capacity to bring on
more prototypers more software engineers

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360
more prototypers more software engineers
 

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.180
more prototypers more software engineers
so if you go to material yo you'll see

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.190
so if you go to material yo you'll see
 

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.159
so if you go to material yo you'll see
that they've got a bunch of new

00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:51.169
that they've got a bunch of new
 

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:53.539
that they've got a bunch of new
components available for various

00:20:53.539 --> 00:20:53.549
components available for various
 

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:55.490
components available for various
different platforms to make it easier to

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500
different platforms to make it easier to
 

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.620
different platforms to make it easier to
integrate the stuff that has evolved in

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:57.630
integrate the stuff that has evolved in
 

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.940
integrate the stuff that has evolved in
material over the last couple of years

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:58.950
material over the last couple of years
 

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.289
material over the last couple of years
so I think you can look at their work

00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299
so I think you can look at their work
 

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:01.909
so I think you can look at their work
product along a number of different axes

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919
product along a number of different axes
 

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:04.070
product along a number of different axes
and see the material design is alive and

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080
and see the material design is alive and
 

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.909
and see the material design is alive and
well and continuing to evolve and to see

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919
well and continuing to evolve and to see
 

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:10.539
well and continuing to evolve and to see
all that stuff you go to material dot IO

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:10.549
all that stuff you go to material dot IO
 

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:14.110
all that stuff you go to material dot IO
lots of good stuff there resources tools

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120
lots of good stuff there resources tools
 

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:38.600
lots of good stuff there resources tools
good articles thanks about there you

good articles thanks about there you
mean to build to write green files yeah

00:21:43.159 --> 00:21:43.169
mean to build to write green files yeah
 

00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:45.169
mean to build to write green files yeah
yeah we do plan to support it as soon as

00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179
yeah we do plan to support it as soon as
 

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:49.970
yeah we do plan to support it as soon as
it's finished on the grader side Thanks

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:49.980
it's finished on the grader side Thanks
 

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:58.680
it's finished on the grader side Thanks
but here

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.510
 
no I don't think so

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520
no I don't think so
 

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.750
no I don't think so
next so cotton has some kind of a

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760
next so cotton has some kind of a
 

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.870

standard library which is about six

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880
standard library which is about six
 

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.990
standard library which is about six
hundred kilobytes so that's the only

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000
hundred kilobytes so that's the only
 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:54.260
hundred kilobytes so that's the only
thing you need to add

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:54.270

what functions take a long time or

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720
what functions take a long time or
 

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.030
what functions take a long time or
anything like that it's just going to

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:09.040
anything like that it's just going to
 

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.070
anything like that it's just going to
say hey your app was running here and

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.080
say hey your app was running here and
 

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.690
say hey your app was running here and
then it stopped running here

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:12.700
then it stopped running here
 

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.780
then it stopped running here
that's all it knows the CPU profiler in

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:15.790
that's all it knows the CPU profiler in
 

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.610
that's all it knows the CPU profiler in
android studio on the other hand will

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:17.620
android studio on the other hand will
 

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.340
android studio on the other hand will
actually sample the runtime of your

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:20.350
actually sample the runtime of your
 

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.280
actually sample the runtime of your
application and tell you hey you're

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:23.290
application and tell you hey you're
 

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.170
application and tell you hey you're
spending 50 milliseconds in this

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.180
spending 50 milliseconds in this
 

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.030
spending 50 milliseconds in this
function and 4 milliseconds in this

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:27.040
function and 4 milliseconds in this
 

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.400
function and 4 milliseconds in this
function and things like that that means

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:29.410
function and things like that that means
 

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.350
function and things like that that means
that the CPU profiler has higher

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360
that the CPU profiler has higher
 

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.690
that the CPU profiler has higher
overhead which means it can perturb the

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:33.700
overhead which means it can perturb the
 

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.870
overhead which means it can perturb the
results of your performance testing but

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880
results of your performance testing but
 

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.120
results of your performance testing but
it gives you greater visibility into

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.130
it gives you greater visibility into
 

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.000
it gives you greater visibility into
your application so my general

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.010
your application so my general
 

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.090
your application so my general
recommendation would be use systrace to

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:45.100
recommendation would be use systrace to
 

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.340
recommendation would be use systrace to
get a general idea of how your

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:47.350
get a general idea of how your
 

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.020
get a general idea of how your
application runs because you will

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.030
application runs because you will
 

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.550
application runs because you will
probably spot a lot of problems there

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:50.560
probably spot a lot of problems there
 

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.580
probably spot a lot of problems there
once you have some idea of what's taking

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:53.590
once you have some idea of what's taking
 

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.090
once you have some idea of what's taking
too long

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.100
too long
 

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.060
too long
you can use the CPU profiler to get a

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.070
you can use the CPU profiler to get a
 

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.930
you can use the CPU profiler to get a
closer look inside your application

00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940
closer look inside your application
 

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.040
closer look inside your application
great thanks tor did that cover it that

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.050
great thanks tor did that cover it that
 

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:06.030
great thanks tor did that cover it that
sounds good

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.040
sounds good
 

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.150
sounds good
no rebuttal yeah I mean the CPU profiler

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:09.160
no rebuttal yeah I mean the CPU profiler
 

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.460
no rebuttal yeah I mean the CPU profiler
has a low overhead mode until you start

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:11.470
has a low overhead mode until you start
 

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.640
has a low overhead mode until you start
recording actual sampling so you can use

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:14.650
recording actual sampling so you can use
 

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.350
recording actual sampling so you can use
it initially as well but systrace

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360
it initially as well but systrace
 

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.160
it initially as well but systrace
obviously does more whole system tracing

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.170
obviously does more whole system tracing
 

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:24.090
obviously does more whole system tracing
right thanks well I believe we have not

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.100
right thanks well I believe we have not
 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.770
right thanks well I believe we have not
heard much about data binding this week

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:25.780
heard much about data binding this week
 

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.660
heard much about data binding this week
and I wonder if that if that's still a

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:27.670
and I wonder if that if that's still a
 

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.030
and I wonder if that if that's still a
technology which would be continued to

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.040
technology which would be continued to
 

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.930
technology which would be continued to
adopt eat yes actually

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:33.940
adopt eat yes actually
 

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.750
adopt eat yes actually
so with architecture components we

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760
so with architecture components we
 

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.520
so with architecture components we
shipped that sample application that

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:38.530
shipped that sample application that
 

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.210
shipped that sample application that
uses data mining so we're still working

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:42.220
uses data mining so we're still working
 

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:42.780
uses data mining so we're still working
on that

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:42.790
on that
 

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.940
on that
tools are still working on that right

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:44.950
tools are still working on that right
 

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.279
tools are still working on that right
tor yes

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:48.289
tor yes
 

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:50.630
tor yes
no we should we have a lot of other

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640
no we should we have a lot of other
 

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.039
no we should we have a lot of other
things working on two-bit data binding

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:52.049
things working on two-bit data binding
 

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:55.029
things working on two-bit data binding
is one of our responsibilities thank you

00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039
is one of our responsibilities thank you
 

00:24:55.039 --> 00:25:00.200
is one of our responsibilities thank you
thank you yes hi I started writing

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:00.210
thank you yes hi I started writing
 

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.110
thank you yes hi I started writing
Kotlin last week and I felt that it felt

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120
Kotlin last week and I felt that it felt
 

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.150
Kotlin last week and I felt that it felt
oddly familiar and I thought that's

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.160
oddly familiar and I thought that's
 

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.820
oddly familiar and I thought that's
because I spent the last year doing code

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:07.830
because I spent the last year doing code
 

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.310
because I spent the last year doing code
reviews of our iOS developer and Swift

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320
reviews of our iOS developer and Swift
 

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.380
reviews of our iOS developer and Swift
so I was wondering if you could comment

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:12.390
so I was wondering if you could comment
 

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.779
so I was wondering if you could comment
on the relationship between Kotlin and

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:14.789
on the relationship between Kotlin and
 

00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:29.840
on the relationship between Kotlin and
Swift we are independent there is a lot

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:29.850
Swift we are independent there is a lot
 

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.120
Swift we are independent there is a lot
of resemblance I guess because there we

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.130
of resemblance I guess because there we
 

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.340
of resemblance I guess because there we
are aiming for the same task to be to

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.350
are aiming for the same task to be to
 

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.899
are aiming for the same task to be to
make a productive developers

make a productive developers
 

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:40.130
make a productive developers

hello so I personally think that being

00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039
hello so I personally think that being
 

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:24.720
hello so I personally think that being
open and open-source is one of the most

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:24.730
open and open-source is one of the most
 

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.519
open and open-source is one of the most
important powers of Android and one of

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:27.529
important powers of Android and one of
 

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:29.260
important powers of Android and one of
the most important announcements for me

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.270
the most important announcements for me
 

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.100
the most important announcements for me
this week was that the firebase SDKs are

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:33.110
this week was that the firebase SDKs are
 

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.810
this week was that the firebase SDKs are
being open sourced and it

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:34.820
being open sourced and it
 

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.850
being open sourced and it
unfortunately Android SDK is not

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:36.860
unfortunately Android SDK is not
 

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.340
unfortunately Android SDK is not
currently but will follow so the

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:39.350
currently but will follow so the
 

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.620
currently but will follow so the
question is what about Google Play

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:41.630
question is what about Google Play
 

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.080
question is what about Google Play
services is there a plan to because five

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.090
services is there a plan to because five
 

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.299
services is there a plan to because five
days Android SDK and the Play services

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:46.309
days Android SDK and the Play services
 

00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:48.880
days Android SDK and the Play services
are so integrated so firebase can be

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:48.890
are so integrated so firebase can be
 

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.190
are so integrated so firebase can be
open source now but why not Play

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200
open source now but why not Play
 

00:26:51.200 --> 00:27:00.850
open source now but why not Play
services I think the thing about Play

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:00.860
services I think the thing about Play
 

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.519
services I think the thing about Play
services is it's there's lots of stuff

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:03.529
services is it's there's lots of stuff
 

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:05.980
services is it's there's lots of stuff
in there some of it is developer focused

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:05.990
in there some of it is developer focused
 

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.110
in there some of it is developer focused
and some of it is just really extension

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120
and some of it is just really extension
 

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.639
and some of it is just really extension
of applications like Google's own

00:27:09.639 --> 00:27:09.649
of applications like Google's own
 

00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:12.450
of applications like Google's own
applications and so sort of Google

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:12.460
applications and so sort of Google
 

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.159
applications and so sort of Google
policy with their applications as

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:15.169
policy with their applications as
 

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:17.860
policy with their applications as
they're just not open sourced the

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:17.870
they're just not open sourced the
 

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.810
they're just not open sourced the
challenge is there's no easy way in GMS

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:19.820
challenge is there's no easy way in GMS
 

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.519
challenge is there's no easy way in GMS
quarters sort of say hey this is a

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:21.529
quarters sort of say hey this is a
 

00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:23.350
quarters sort of say hey this is a
developer component - this is a

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360
developer component - this is a
 

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.980
developer component - this is a
extension of an app component so yeah

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:26.990
extension of an app component so yeah
 

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.049
extension of an app component so yeah
also we don't have anyone from the GMs

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:29.059
also we don't have anyone from the GMs
 

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:31.539
also we don't have anyone from the GMs
core or the Play services team here so I

00:27:31.539 --> 00:27:31.549
core or the Play services team here so I
 

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:36.460
core or the Play services team here so I
can punt the question we punt the

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:36.470
can punt the question we punt the
 

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.870
can punt the question we punt the
questions to you so if you're going to

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880
questions to you so if you're going to
 

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.950
questions to you so if you're going to
put the question I don't know what to do

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960
put the question I don't know what to do
 

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:45.360
put the question I don't know what to do
with it I'll go into an infinite loop

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:45.370
 
 

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.990
 
moving on moving on all right let me go

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000
moving on moving on all right let me go
 

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.529
moving on moving on all right let me go
to a theoretical thing what's the one

00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:53.539
to a theoretical thing what's the one
 

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:54.909
to a theoretical thing what's the one
piece of advice you would like

00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:54.919
piece of advice you would like
 

00:27:54.919 --> 00:27:58.570
piece of advice you would like
developers to never ever follow when

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:58.580
developers to never ever follow when
 

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:04.149
developers to never ever follow when
making Android apps anybody force

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159
making Android apps anybody force
 

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:06.070
making Android apps anybody force
garbage collection I don't know

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080
garbage collection I don't know
 

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:13.360

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:13.370
 
 

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.160
 
No okay give it another education

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.170
No okay give it another education
 

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:24.700

you hi so we saw the introduction at i/o

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520
you hi so we saw the introduction at i/o
 

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.040
you hi so we saw the introduction at i/o
of a bunch of really great new

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.050
of a bunch of really great new
 

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.130
of a bunch of really great new
performance profiling tools for example

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140
performance profiling tools for example
 

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.100
performance profiling tools for example
for network and for CPU one thing that's

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.110
for network and for CPU one thing that's
 

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.960
for network and for CPU one thing that's
still kind of missing is a good battery

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:38.970
still kind of missing is a good battery
 

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.870
still kind of missing is a good battery
profiler for our applications we do have

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880
profiler for our applications we do have
 

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.000
profiler for our applications we do have
battery stats and battery historian but

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.010
battery stats and battery historian but
 

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.860
battery stats and battery historian but
they're extremely difficult to use and

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:45.870
they're extremely difficult to use and
 

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.870
they're extremely difficult to use and
to interpret the results from and I was

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880
to interpret the results from and I was
 

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.090
to interpret the results from and I was
wondering if battery profiling for our

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100
wondering if battery profiling for our
 

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.410
wondering if battery profiling for our
apps is something that we might be able

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:51.420
apps is something that we might be able
 

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.720
apps is something that we might be able
to look forward to I think yes so if

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:56.730
to look forward to I think yes so if
 

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.840
to look forward to I think yes so if
it's a very good question and the one of

00:28:59.840 --> 00:28:59.850
it's a very good question and the one of
 

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.920
it's a very good question and the one of
the things we talked about was that the

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:00.930
the things we talked about was that the
 

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.960
the things we talked about was that the
battery profiling really has to be based

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:02.970
battery profiling really has to be based
 

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.960
battery profiling really has to be based
on CPU and a network you want to look at

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:05.970
on CPU and a network you want to look at
 

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.970
on CPU and a network you want to look at
those two things as a really important

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980
those two things as a really important
 

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.500
those two things as a really important
input and so we felt like it was

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:09.510
input and so we felt like it was
 

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.480
input and so we felt like it was
important to do CPU and networks first

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.490
important to do CPU and networks first
 

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.000
important to do CPU and networks first
so those are our initial profilers we

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.010
so those are our initial profilers we
 

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.320
so those are our initial profilers we
don't we don't talk about features but I

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:15.330
don't we don't talk about features but I
 

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.670
don't we don't talk about features but I
will say that we get a lot of questions

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:16.680
will say that we get a lot of questions
 

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.910
will say that we get a lot of questions
about battery profiling so so you can

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:19.920
about battery profiling so so you can
 

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.300
about battery profiling so so you can
read that however you want that that's

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:23.310
read that however you want that that's
 

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.130
read that however you want that that's

wasn't battery one of the stats that
we're talking about there I a so we're

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.040
we're talking about there I a so we're
 

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.130
we're talking about there I a so we're
going to start showing a system health

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:38.140
going to start showing a system health
 

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.020

I'm going to put words in Tim's mouth
and say that he wants everyone to care

and say that he wants everyone to care
 

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.320
and say that he wants everyone to care
more about performance as well so some

more about performance as well so some

Kotlin a lot and I'm wondering if you

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:09.990
Kotlin a lot and I'm wondering if you
 

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:11.650
Kotlin a lot and I'm wondering if you
have any future plans to implement

API well as has been said we are also

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780
API well as has been said we are also
 

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.890

committed to Java and just pragmatically

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:30.900
committed to Java and just pragmatically
 

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.680
committed to Java and just pragmatically
the bazillion lines of code that we

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:33.690
the bazillion lines of code that we
 

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.830
the bazillion lines of code that we
already have in Java so I think as much

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:36.840
already have in Java so I think as much
 

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.800
already have in Java so I think as much
as we love it the reality is we're

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:39.810
as we love it the reality is we're
 

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.180
as we love it the reality is we're
probably going to be continuing to

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:41.190
probably going to be continuing to
 

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.720
probably going to be continuing to
produce Java code for the near future at

produce Java code for the near future at
 

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:46.430
produce Java code for the near future at
the point where we're starting to

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440
the point where we're starting to
 

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.410
the point where we're starting to
introduce new features in Kotlin it's

00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:48.420
introduce new features in Kotlin it's
 

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.970
introduce new features in Kotlin it's
going to be something that we make sure

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980
going to be something that we make sure
 

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.340
going to be something that we make sure

something that's going to take us a
 

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.580
something that's going to take us a
while to adopt internally the first

while to adopt internally the first
 

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.080
while to adopt internally the first
thing they'll probably see from us is

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:00.090
thing they'll probably see from us is
 

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.270
thing they'll probably see from us is
that we'll make sure that our java

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280
that we'll make sure that our java
 

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.200
that we'll make sure that our java

this year for some reason

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400
 
 

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.609
 
so what are things that we decided to

00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619
so what are things that we decided to
 

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:54.230
so what are things that we decided to
not talk about that we would talk about

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240
not talk about that we would talk about
 

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.150
not talk about that we would talk about
now yeah everything is it well I mean I

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160
now yeah everything is it well I mean I
 

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.830
now yeah everything is it well I mean I
mean the biggest one is project travel

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:00.840
mean the biggest one is project travel
 

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.300

we talked about the garbage collector

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:12.930
we talked about the garbage collector
 

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.140
we talked about the garbage collector
that it went down from tomorrow coin

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.150
that it went down from tomorrow coin
 

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.700

session and garbage well I'm going to

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:16.710
session and garbage well I'm going to
 

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.589
session and garbage well I'm going to
steal it's under if I mention it how

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599
steal it's under if I mention it how
 

00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:19.220

cool it is
 

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.170
cool it is
how fast it is did you know that we used

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180
how fast it is did you know that we used
 

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.760
how fast it is did you know that we used
to only garbage collect when processes

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:22.770
to only garbage collect when processes
 

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.990
to only garbage collect when processes
were in the background but that of it's

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000
were in the background but that of it's
 

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.370
were in the background but that of it's
so fast we garbage collect in the

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380
so fast we garbage collect in the
 

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:25.849
so fast we garbage collect in the
