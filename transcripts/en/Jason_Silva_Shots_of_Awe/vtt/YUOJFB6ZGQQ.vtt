00:00:00.972 --> 00:00:04.860
[MUSIC]

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.930
So I recently watched a
TED talk by Jaime Wheal

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.865
of the Flow Genome Project.

00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:23.350
And the TED talk was
called, "from Altered States

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.282
to Altered Traits:
Hacking the Flow State."

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:28.740
Now you guys watch,
"Shots of Awe,"

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.781
you know that I'm very
passionate about this idea

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:31.850
of the flow state.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.030
This state of virtuosity
and enhanced performance

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
among artists and musicians
and writers and elite athletes.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660
They go into this zone
where they experience

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.790
this transient, hypofrontality,
this temporary moment where

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.080
the ego dissolves.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.240
You get sort of hyper-focused
in what you're doing.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.410
You drop into Theta states
like meditating monks

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.660
and you're able to achieve
excellence and virtuosity that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.585
exceeds normal human levels and
thresholds for what's possible.

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:03.215
We transcend ourselves
in these moments of flow.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.115
And Jamie Wheal, who co-founded
the Flow Genome Project

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:09.120
with Steven Kotler, talks
about it in this TED talk

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.480
where he says a lot of us
know these flow states,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.170
but our self systems are
like these colanders.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.930
We're like this
colander full of holes.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
And no matter how much
flow we pour into it,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.080
we're always bleeding from
this bucket full of holes.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.610
And so, we achieve these
temporary flow states,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.310
but then Monday, we're
back to where were.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.790
As he says, it's easier
than ever to get high,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.210
it's as hard as it's always
been to stay that way.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.840
But then the idea
of hacking flow

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.130
means what if we transform
this colander into a chalice.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.250
What if we could
render ourselves whole.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.960
Or as Jamie says,
render ourselves holy.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.765
What becomes possible with
just one drop beyond that flow?

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:52.395
What becomes possible
with the rest?

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:54.380
I mean it's a wonderful idea.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.950
Most of us, Jamie
says, are still

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.795
stuck as like, bliss junkies.

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:00.400
You know, we get
stuck on the state

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.670
without raising the stage.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.230
But now, insights into
the neural physiology

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.250
of the brain, the
neurochemistry of the brain.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.800
We can actually hack flow.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.190
We can hack nirvana.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.260
We can experience
design and then

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.990
do some design, our cities
and our social systems

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.715
with positive self reinforcing
feedback loop that teach flow

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:22.620
to make flow an innate,
natural emergence.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.370
This is what becomes possible.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.680
And then, who knows, right?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.540
As Steven Kotler says in the
book, "the Rise of Superman,"

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.633
who knows what becomes possible
when we become super-humans.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.740
And it's just a--
it's an awesome idea.

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:45.220
And it's up to us
to make it happen.
