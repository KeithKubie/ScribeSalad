00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.229
Okay, so we can do A and B.

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.510
So, let's pick another function.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.162
What's your other favorite,
Boolean function of two variables?

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:10.267
&gt;&gt; Well, if we're doing two attributes,
you know, or

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:11.992
is the other really nice one.

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:12.585
&gt;&gt; I like or.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:13.106
So, let's see.

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:17.123
Do you think, now that we've shown that
we can do A and B, could we do A or B?

00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:19.781
&gt;&gt; I feel like we could do A or B.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:23.781
because there's that nice De Morgen's
Law relationship between them but but

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:27.246
let's just, how about this,
can you erase the tags at the bottom?

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.303
&gt;&gt; Like that?

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:31.704
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah but
that's not going to work, is it?

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:34.140
So, so if B and A are both true, so

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.508
the left branch, then the,
the, the leaf should be plus?

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:39.425
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:44.406
And if B is true and
A is false then the tag should be plus.

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:46.169
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:50.900
&gt;&gt; And if B is false, I want to say
false but we don't know because A could

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.050
be true and A or B is true if
either of the two of them are true.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.710
&gt;&gt; Oh okay, so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.486
maybe the mistake here is just trying
to use exactly the same thing.

00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:00.728
So let's just erase it.

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:01.888
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:01.888 --> 00:01:02.945
&gt;&gt; And start from scratch.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:04.709
So what would you do
starting from scratch?

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.602
&gt;&gt; I'd split on B again.

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:10.549
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.862
&gt;&gt; True False or False True.

00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:12.501
&gt;&gt; True False.

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:15.425
&gt;&gt; True False.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:17.505
&gt;&gt; All right, and now if B is true.

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:20.580
We know that A or B is true, so
we can put a plus under the left side.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.684
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:23.146
&gt;&gt; But if B is false.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.063
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:24.980
&gt;&gt; Then we need to split on A.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.360
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.249
&gt;&gt; And if A is true, then we're golden,
we get the Or is true.

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.942
And if A is false, then it is false.

00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:38.007
&gt;&gt; Very good, and
that represents A or B.

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.941
&gt;&gt; That represents the function,
the logical function A or B, yeah.

00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:42.603
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:48.105
What happens if I swap A and
B around, does it still work?

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:52.147
&gt;&gt; I mean, my, my, since they're
collaborative or commutative.

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:55.115
Since they're commutative I want to say
it shouldn't make a difference, but

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.360
let's just double check that.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.044
So if A is true then the output's true.

00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:01.143
If A is false and
B is true then the output's true.

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:05.126
And if A and B are both false,
then the answer's false, yeah, totally.

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.065
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:08.863
And, you know, if I hadn't erased
it you would see that the two trees

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:10.465
actually look very, very much alike.

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:11.546
&gt;&gt; They're sort of mirror each,
of each other.

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:12.417
&gt;&gt; If you just swapped around.

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.800
Yeah the, yeah exactly,
they're mirrors of one another.
