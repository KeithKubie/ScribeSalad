KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:03.270
We are at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.979
I am joined by Michael, the CEO
and co-founder of HomeSwipe.

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.270
Michael, thank you for joining.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.290
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY:
Thank you for having me.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.206
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:12.000
So let's start with
what is HomeSwipe?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.624
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: HomeSwipe is
an apartment renting platform,

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:17.210
and it really helps people
find their apartment

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.660
in a much easier way.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.410
Right now we're just
in New York City,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.740
but we set out with
the goal of taking

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.864
this overwhelming process
and just breaking it down

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.648
into a really simple
step-by-step process.

00:00:25.648 --> 00:00:26.356
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:29.370
And so you're
competing with things

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.790
like Craigslist, or
whatever massive listing,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.064
MLS, things like that.

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:36.980
What's the difference?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.250
What's the difference in the
experience between your app

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.260
and what they're doing?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.760
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: It's really
reimagining the fundamentals

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.734
that go into it,
the inputs, meaning

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.150
our app is very much focused
on taking that large data set

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.770
of apartment rentals
and breaking it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.347
down into bite-sized,
just actionable pieces.

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:52.680
So it looks kind of like Tinder.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.221
You would swipe left to skip
and then swipe right to favorite

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.320
or to chat on it, and
it's really simple,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.367
but that kind of card setup
UI is actually very powerful.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:02.200
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.460
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: You
could take a large data set

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.660
and mull it down into
simple yes/no decisions.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.468
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:07.680
That's pretty cool.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.890
So obviously, you're dealing
with search, probably

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460
a lot of technical challenges
that come along with that.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.880
Any in particular that
stuck out as you kind of go

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.824
through that process?

00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:19.240
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: There's a
lot of technical challenges.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.110
I mean, we've made our
fair share of mistakes.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.985
I'm actually the CEO.

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:24.697
I'm technical, but not
even near as much as my--

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:26.280
KORY JEFFREY: Not
working on the code?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.790
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: Yeah,
exactly, as much as my CTO.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.900
What I've learned from
my CTO, who is young,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.690
is that joins are
very important.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.590
So we thought we'd
get away with MongoDB

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.470
and having that
kind of database,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.447
but we ended up using Postgres.

00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:41.280
And we've rewritten the
backend a few times,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280
and we've made our
fair share of mistakes.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.500
But real estate data
is very verbose,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.390
and a lot of it's
just XML feeds of just

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.240
verbose, verbose, verbose,
verbose data, this legacy data

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.460
that I had no idea that
we'd be putting up with.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.930
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.240
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: So
it's been interesting.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.515
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.880
That's pretty cool.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.672
So you were speaking
today at Founder World.

00:02:00.672 --> 00:02:02.380
What was it that you
were speaking about?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.770
What's the message you
were trying to get across?

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.330
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY:
So I was just

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.795
on a panel about how
important talent is

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:10.777
and really just going up against
rejection and breaking through.

00:02:10.777 --> 00:02:11.610
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.010
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: Because it
was just a bunch of founders.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.179
We were on a panel, and we
were discussing how, really,

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.720
the challenges of
becoming a founder,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.840
and then going
through with that.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.020
My goal was really to deliver
a message of perseverance

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.580
and of pushing through.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.050
Because even if you hear no
100 times, you just need one

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.080
yes to really make that
breakthrough progress.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.140
So it's really that
perseverance that matters.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.950
So you came from New York,
I assume, because you're

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.550
based out of there.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.865
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: Yep.

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.080
So I'm based in New York.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.850
KORY JEFFREY: Still
based in New York.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.700
So what made you come
to Founder World?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.516
Why Founder World?

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:44.800
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: It was
just an incredible opportunity.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.940
And the little
success that I've had

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.070
thus far, the little
opportunities for success

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.979
I've had, have come from just
really interesting environments

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:52.770
like Founder World.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.350
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.490
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY:
Environments where

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.948
there's a huge density of people
that are in the same space

00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:00.585
thinking the same way, and it
just-- it yields opportunity.

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:02.710
Events like Founder World
always yield opportunity.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.543
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:03:03.543 --> 00:03:04.250
Yeah, for sure.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.916
It's been great.

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.350
It's been a great atmosphere.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.587
So as you walk around today,
as you look at the booths,

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:11.795
there's all sorts of different
types of technologies,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:16.774
from robots going around outside
to VR to-- everything's here.

00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:18.190
Is there anything,
other than what

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.974
you're working on that excites
you for the future of tech?

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:24.390
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY:
There's a lot.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.070
It's just everything is so cool.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.580
A lot of people
nowadays, they're

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.330
kind of letting go of
this idea of limits,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.940
and they've started
reimagining what technology

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.070
is to the day to day.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.300
Sort of like Knightscope,
the little robots that

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.150
are running around outside that
people are taking selfies with.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.590
It's incredible to think
that a robot can actually

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.880
replace-- to be a much better
replacement to the security

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.940
guard.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.920
It's kind of wonky, but
it's this crazy enough idea

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.579
that's still attainable.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.120
So it says to me
that a lot of people

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.510
have crazy ideas nowadays, but
they still feel attainable.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.660
They're like, oh, that
could actually happen.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.809
And self-driving cars, it's-- 30
years ago it was just a dream.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.350
Our Back to the
Future Day was funny,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.540
because a lot of the
things that we've

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.555
had that were present
in "Back to the Future,"

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:10.180
we actually have
today or some form of.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.072
KORY JEFFREY: That's right.

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:11.518
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY:
It's incredible.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:11.851
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:12.860
It's pretty cool.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.550
Awesome.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.510
So speaking of technology,
what is your favorite Google

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.196
technology?

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:19.820
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: So, I mean,
there's a lot of amazing things

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.655
that Google does.

00:04:20.655 --> 00:04:22.029
Search is a big
one, because it's

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.150
like the backend of my mind.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.639
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.680
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: And
then Maps is awesome too,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.955
but it's not as accessible
for startups yet.

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:30.330
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.440
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY:
So that'd be very cool

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.080
if Maps was more accessible.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.095
KORY JEFFREY: That's
something we could take back

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.543
to the Maps team?

00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:35.914
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: Absolutely.

00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:36.830
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.430
Michael, it was great
for you to join me,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.140
so thank you very much.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.550
MICHAEL LISOVETSKY: Cool.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.290
Thanks for having me.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.081
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you for joining me.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:45.710
We're at Founder World in
San Francisco, and I'm Kory.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.160
