00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.040
Now that we've done
a series of videos

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.640
on America's interventions
during the Cold War

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.300
in Korea, and Cuba,
and Vietnam, I

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.290
thought it would be fun
just to think a little bit

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.079
about whether there
are any patterns here.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.570
And once again, in all
of these history videos,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.960
you have to take
anything I say--

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380
or really anything anyone
says about history--

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.994
with a grain of salt even
when it comes to the facts.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:25.660
Obviously, the facts
can only be written

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.500
by the people who survive.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.400
Who knows what might have gone
on behind scenes that never

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.184
got documented by
the historians.

00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:34.350
So you have to take everything
with a grain of salt.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.490
And even in this
video, I'll talk about,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.140
maybe, some patterns, or
some themes, that I've seen,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.306
don't take that
as just the truth.

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:44.930
Think about it for yourself, if
it makes sense, it makes sense.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.984
If it doesn't, try
to look into it more,

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.400
and try to come up with your
own themes, or your patterns,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.330
or things that you
can learn from.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.720
So the general pattern
across all of these,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.700
is that before the
US got involved,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.930
and before a communist-leaning
regime got involved,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.230
these were all, in some
ways, subjugated populations.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.310
In Korea, it was
subjugated by the Japanese.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.160
It was a Japanese colony.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.850
In Cuba, it was subjugated
by the Batista government.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.665
And this was a dictatorship,
a corrupt dictatorship,

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:21.790
and it was heavily influenced
by the United States.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.800
You could almost view it
as United States influence,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.370
a United States colony, they had
so much influence with Batista.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.060
And in the case of Vietnam,
it was a French colony.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.340
So you can imagine, in
all of these situations

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.060
the existing rulers
were not that popular.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.680
People were looking for
rulers who could liberate them

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.269
from the messes they
were in inside of that.

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:46.560
On top of that-- and this
comes to the whole discussion

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260
of capitalism versus
communism-- you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.950
can imagine that when
you are colonized,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.320
or when you are in
a corrupt regime,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.240
you do have people
accruing wealth.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.710
So there are people accruing
wealth, some of whom

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.110
will get it without
being that legitimate.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.010
And so these
circles are the size

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.240
of different people's wealth.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.286
So you can imagine, in
Korea under Japanese rule,

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:11.660
maybe there were
a few people who

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.109
were successful by being
legitimate entrepreneurs,

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.650
but there were
probably a whole bunch

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.300
of people who were
successful by just, kind of,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.430
sucking up to the
colonial powers,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.270
in the case of a corrupt
regime, doing things

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.270
that were corrupt
with the regime,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.650
using the regime it to get
undue power in a certain market,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.930
and it's always a combination.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.250
In any of these countries,
there were probably

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.610
some entrepreneurs
and some other people

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.290
who got wealth, maybe,
with good means,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890
and then some other people,
who under these regimes

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.710
got wealth under
questionable means,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.990
maybe because they sucked
up to the corrupt regime.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.627
Or maybe, they even did
outright criminal activity,

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:49.710
which was probably the
case in the Batista regime.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.480
You probably did have
people who were just

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.500
outright criminals doing
very well for themselves.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.690
Same thing in Vietnam.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.220
Some of the Vietnamese
who really were aligned

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.260
with the French, probably
got extra favors,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.590
and so their wealth wasn't
necessarily due to innovation

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.380
or competence, but
really just where

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.810
they fit into the
political order.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
Maybe some other people
did have legitimate wealth.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.270
So you imagine, when any
of these type of situations

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.990
start to emerge from
subjugation-- so you start

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.090
having independence movements
in all of these situations.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.730
You could imagine it's a very
popular notion to run on,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.112
and depending on how true it is.

00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:32.820
But it's a very popular
notion to run on,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.397
to tell people, look, you've
seen all of these people who've

00:03:36.397 --> 00:03:37.980
gotten questionable
wealth, and maybe,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.640
some of these people who got
questionable wealth got it

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.690
by being aligned with our
subjugators, by being,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.039
to some degree,
traitors to our people.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.080
And once again, maybe not
all the people, but you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.050
could see how it's a popular
line for someone coming

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.310
to power when you're
emerging from independent--

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.230
or emerging into independence--
to say, why don't we

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.980
redistribute wealth?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.640
Why don't we take the
wealth from this person

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.750
right here, who got it
in questionable means,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.590
and redistribute it to
the rest of the society?

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.270
Why don't we take it from
this person over here

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.870
and redistribute it to
the rest of society?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.550
Why don't we do that
with this person

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.040
here and redistribute that
wealth to the rest of society?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.570
And if you're looking for
a political ideology that

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.470
seems to fit with this idea of
trying to correct things that

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.910
maybe looked wrong
during the colonial

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.970
or the subjugated rule,
communism seems to fit that.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.720
It's kind of a
redistributing of wealth,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.430
or maybe the state
takes over all wealth,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.922
or maybe it's something in
between where it's socialist,

00:04:38.922 --> 00:04:40.880
where the state is
redistributing wealth fairly

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.050
aggressively, but
you still have,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.140
kind of, the underpinnings
of capitalism.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.230
And so you could imagine
that communism-- especially

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.860
to a population where you have
many, many, many poor people,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.635
the wealth concentrated in a
few people, many of them who

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:59.470
are aligned with the old
regimes-- communism at least

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.810
seems like a popular notion.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.600
And you have people who ride
this nationalistic communistic

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.270
feeling.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.985
In the case of Cuba, you have
people like Fidel Castro.

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:13.900
 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.270
In Vietnam you have
people like Ho Chi Minh.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.910
 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.690
And then Korea is a
little bit different,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.740
because you did have a communist
nationalist independence

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.810
movement, but Kim Il-Sung
wasn't necessarily

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.330
the leader of that movement.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.060
The Soviets actually didn't want
any of those people in charge,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.949
any of the nationalist
communists,

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.240
the leaders of those movements.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.242
They kind of marginalized
them, and installed Kim Il-Sung

00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:40.200
probably because he was
more aligned with them,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.075
but he was communist.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:44.380
 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.760
Now the reality is,
these guys come in

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.280
under these very egalitarian,
equality for all,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.260
let's get retribution
for the wrongs that

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.140
were done to us before,
but probably all of them

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.499
start to not just redistribute
wealth from people

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:59.040
who might have gotten
it in bad ways,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.831
but they're also just
redistributing wealth

00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.560
generally, maybe because it's
just a popular thing to do,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.670
or maybe because these
people didn't give them

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.590
proper support.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.130
So they're getting retribution
on their political enemies,

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.590
as opposed to just kind of
doing it for social good.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.550
So they might do it from people
who have legitimate wealth,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.000
and so those people
aren't too happy about it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.660
And they ride this kind of
communist egalitarian movement

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.939
to install themselves.

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:27.980
And instead of just being
a purely Marxist state,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.830
they want to be more
Marxist-Leninist,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.496
where you have this
Communist Party that

00:06:31.496 --> 00:06:33.320
has this continuous
revolution, which

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.100
is a justification for them
to never hold real elections

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.890
and always stay in power.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.620
So by no means is
this a rationale

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.010
why these people are legitimate.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.700
But what happened in
every one of these cases

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.920
is that the United States was
in the middle of the Cold War,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.750
they feared the
spread of communism.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.440
Communism tended to correlate
with a non-free state.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.966
It doesn't have to be that
way, but every time communism

00:06:57.966 --> 00:06:59.590
was implemented, it
also was these kind

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.855
of authoritarian
rule, no democracy.

00:07:01.855 --> 00:07:03.230
And you could also
imagine, there

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.188
were many capitalists in
the United States, who

00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:07.530
for their own selfish reasons,
were afraid of capitalism

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.946
spreading to the United States,
because maybe their wealth

00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:11.230
would be redistributed.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.605
But regardless of what the
justification, whether it

00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:18.057
was a more noble wanting people
to have freedom of expression,

00:07:18.057 --> 00:07:19.640
freedom to own
property, or whether it

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.056
was the more
selfish, that hey, we

00:07:21.056 --> 00:07:24.170
don't want our own wealth
to be somehow taken away,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.590
or it just might have
been a balance of power

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.570
between the US and
the Soviet Union,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.480
that every time a country
fell to communism it's somehow

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.960
the US losing some
power in the world.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.350
Regardless of the
US's rationale,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.020
they always say, OK,
these guys are communist,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.330
we're going to take the
other side of the equation.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.600
So the US ends up
supporting Syngman Rhee

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.310
in South Korea,
who we know was not

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.060
the best character in the world.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.190
They end up supporting Diem
in South Vietnam, who we also

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.390
know was not
necessarily the most

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.560
savory person in the world.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.120
In the case of Cuba,
the US, at least-- they

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.931
did support Batista
while he was in power,

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:07.930
but we saw in that video
that Kennedy later came

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.890
out and said, you know
Batista was a pretty bad dude,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.723
and it was probably a
big mistake for the US

00:08:11.723 --> 00:08:12.360
to support him.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.776
But the US goes
on the other side,

00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:16.420
and they support the exiles
against Fidel Castro.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.115
And here, the Cuban
exiles they're not-- they

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:23.405
are definitely not in the
category of Syngman Rhee

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:25.880
or Diem, and they
probably favor democracy,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.170
and overall, good people.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.490
But what they probably
did feed Kennedy

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.000
is a story that Fidel
Castro wasn't as popular

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.480
as he actually was.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.480
And he probably was
more popular especially

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.880
after the revolution, because
he had this egalitarian-- people

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.610
were getting over Batista,
anybody but Batista they

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.730
would be happy about.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.780
Fidel Castro was this
charismatic leader

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.884
who was kind of
working for the poor,

00:08:47.884 --> 00:08:50.050
at least it looked like he
was working for the poor.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.230
So at least in the get
go, especially the Kennedy

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.730
administration
might have been fed

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.810
an overly optimistic
view that got

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.241
them involved in the Bay of
Pigs Invasion and all of that.

00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:01.740
But this is just
the general pattern

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.781
that happened every time.

00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:06.500
And every time, it ended
up in either a US defeat

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.680
or a stalemate.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.787
Take whatever lessons
there are from this,

00:09:10.787 --> 00:09:12.745
but it is a kind of an
interesting pattern that

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:15.700
had happened multiple times,
pretty much every engagement

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.980
that we had during the Cold War.
