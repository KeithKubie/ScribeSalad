&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington DC

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.520
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Well good
morning everyone and welcome

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.700
to the Folk Festival, a session
that's devoted to teen readers.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.570
I'm Mark Sweeney, the Associate
Librarian for Library Services

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.900
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.090
We want to thank the Co-Chairman
of the festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.540
and the many book festive sponsors
that have made this event possible

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.630
in 2016, and those that have
supported us over these many years.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.290
You can support the festival
with a gift or donation

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.570
by checking the information in the
festival program or on our app.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.410
We welcome the help in making
this festival a success next year

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.870
and every year.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.300
The festival would not be
possible without our sponsors

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.950
and book lovers like you.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.310
Now if you would please quite
your cell phones, the question

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.320
and answer will follow the author's
presentation and please be aware

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.740
that we're filming the
event for our archive.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.480
Today it's my privilege to
introduce Kwame Alexander,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.750
one of the nation's
most dynamic writers,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.450
who has achieved particular
distinction with books

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.490
that he's written that have
transformed reluctant readers

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.170
into enthusiastic readers.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.200 position:56%
Last year at this festival he talked

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.540
about his best-selling
book Crossover,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.700
for which he won the
Newberry Medal in 2015.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.060
He also told us stories
about the ups and downs

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.090
of his literary career, and the
power of a personal philosophy

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.910
that had say yes at its core.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.270
Just as stereotypes are
attached to librarians,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.180
and I'm sure you know most of
them, there are also stereotypes

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.680
that are pinned to writers.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.810
One is that writers are solitary,
they work alone, you know,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.030
up in the Garrett, and
prefer to be alone.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.780
But as many of you already
know, this doesn't apply

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.890
to Kwame Alexander in
any way, shape or form.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.120
Writing while cooper up in
a Garrett, certainly not.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.660
He talks about writing while
sitting at a table in the middle

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.400
of his favorite Panera Bakery.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.140
Prefer to be alone?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.130
I don't think you can
say that about a person

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.830 position:56%
who in 2016 alone has spoken at over
101 different events in schools,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.320
libraries, conferences and
festivals in 21 states,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.650
the District of Columbia and China.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.570
Passionate, honest and engaging,
Kwame is a marvelous advocate

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.310
for literature and language who has
the unique ability to use poetry

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.100
and prose to connect
with audiences in ways

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.190
that are truly transformative.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.270
I know that because I have
three songs, and it works.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.010
I am sure most of you
who love to read can talk

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.390
about a particular experience,
mostly early in our lives,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.690
that caused us to flip
the switch with respect

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.800 position:56%
to our positive interest in reading.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.060 position:56%
For me as a boy, that experience
was hearing my father's enthusiastic

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.380
quotes and reading aloud from the
passages of Robert Lewis Stevenson.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.140
For many of today's young people,
that kind of switch is provided

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.300
by Kwame Alexander's books.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.210
Following the great success of his
book Crossover, he will tell us

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.470 position:56%
about his latest book titled Booked.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.610
It's described as verse
novel with a 12 year old boy

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.030
as the central character.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.540 position:56%
It deals with such topics as soccer,
girls, friendships and divorce.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.170
I'll note, too, that one of the
main characters is a charismatic

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.690
school librarian.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960
So, very good.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.840
Kwame will be signing copies of
Booked today from 12:30 to 1:30

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.570
and it will be in line
five downstairs.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.750
So please join me in
welcoming Kwame Alexander back

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.550
to the National Book Festival.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:04:03.080
[ Applause ]

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.380
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Hello.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.260
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.560
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Any
third graders out here?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.830
Let me hear you say yeah.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.070
[ Laughter ]

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.570
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Fourth graders?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.170
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
Fifth graders, uh huh?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.770
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Oh.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.070
Okay, okay.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.370
This is good.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.670
What a pleasure.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.190
What an honor to be invited back.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.800
I've been writing books
for 23 years.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.300
I started in Arlington
Virginia and I've always wanted

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.030
to come to this festival.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.470
And so to be coming two years

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.150
in a row is really
something pretty special.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:46.010 position:56%
The times that we're in right now
are certainly challenging and tough.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:54.130
And I thought well, how do I come
up here and begin this presentation

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.270
with you know, sort
of paying respect

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.100
to what's going on in our world.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.430
As artists, we are not
separate, you know,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.610
from what's happening in our world.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.340
We are inspired by it and
sometimes we are saddened by it

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.960
and even that causes inspiration.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.430
And so I thought about
this idea of silence

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.320
and that sometimes
silence is about not trying

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.210
to say the things we
know we need to say.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.750
And silence is also about
running out of things to say.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.470
And I think, you know, I
was in the car with my kid

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.360
and we were listening to
MPR, and she says, you know,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.920
and this is the problem,
which we all love MPR,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.160
but this is the problem
with listening to MPR

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.480
when you've got a third
grader in the car.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.630
Because you know, like a week
later she says dad, you know,

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.740
we're driving to school,
she says slow down.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.040
And I say why?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.340
You're speeding.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.340
And I'm like I'm only
going one mile over.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.000
She says but you might
get stopped by the police.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.440
And so how do you answer that?

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.740
It's tough.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.650
You answer it with silence.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.150
What do you say?

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.360
I was being interviewed at the
International Literacy Association

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.920
in Boston and this kid named, I
believe his name was Jack, or Adam,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.740
Jack or Adam, and he says to me,
we'll call him Jadam [phonetic].

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.390
He says to me, he says Mr., he
interviews me, 12 year old kid,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.440
he's interviewing me and he says
Mr. Alexander my last question.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.840
With all the things
happening in this world,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.420
what can we as kids
do to help you all?

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.650
Why should a kid have
to ask that question?

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.020 position:56%
And how do you answer that question?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.730
And again you find yourself silent.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:55.220
And so this whole notion of
being silent is, it can't work.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.140
We need to figure out what
some of these answers are.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.060
So that our children aren't
put in those situations

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.200
and having to ask those questions.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.540
We've got to speak up.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.760
We've got to find our voice.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.790
And I think you know, children, you
know, how do they find their voice?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.510
And of course it's
through the language,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.810
it's through the literature.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.170
It's through, you know, the books.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.230
That's how they can
find their voice.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:32.610 position:56%
And that's why, you know, so many
of these books are important for us.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.790
You all are probably wondering why
do I have Carl Hiaasen up here?

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.830
Yo, his books are hilarious
for kids,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.950
and they deal with these
amazing environmental issues,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.850
so when we talk about saving the
world and protecting young men

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.130
and sort of the, and
saving the world emotionally

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.130
and intellectually, we also take
about saving the physical world,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.540
and he's dealing with a lot
of environmental issues.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.380
And so, you know, we have to
learn, so from our history

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.840
and from our past, and I
think books are the answer.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.970
Or books are an answer, I
don't know they're the answer,

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.010
but they are definitely an answer.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.190
And I think there's so many
wonderful books out here.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.510
Especially this one.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.240
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.040
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
That was smooth, right?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:30.040
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.690
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: So my
editor, Margaret Raymo is here,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.010
from Houghton Mifflin,
and she's often asked me,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.360
Kwame why are you always, you
know, do you have daddy issues?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.970
Because you're always writing
about your, you're always writing

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.550
about boys and fathers
in your books.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.080
And of course, my father, he comes
at it from another point of view,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:00.950
he says when are you going
to pay me my royalties?

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.660
My father made me read the
encyclopedia growing up,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.710
he made me read Funk and Wagnalls.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.200
You got it from Safeway for free if
you had the reward points, right?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:19.580
And so I really, I think
Booked is not an autobiography

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.460
but it's certainly
like autobiographical.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.350
And I really wanted
to talk about that.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.530
And so I decided to write a book
about a boy who loved soccer.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.580
You're pumped.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.300
The match is tied.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.510
At the end of extra
time, players gather

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.440
at center circle for the coin toss.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.080
You call tails and win.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.270
Real Madrid scores the first goal.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.210
Ours bounces off the left post.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.880
They make the next two in a row.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.180
We make three.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.480
The score is three, three.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.130
Your turn to rev the engine.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.430
Turn on the jets.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.870
Score and you win.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.550
Teammates lock arms
for the final kick.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.680
The crowd roars, screams your name.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.280

Like a greyhound coursing game could
you take are from 12 yards out?

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.190
Winding for the kill.

But right before the winning kick of
your Barcelona debut, your teacher,

Ms. Hardwick, streaks across
the field, in her heels,

and purple polyester dress, yelling
Nicholas Hall, pay attention!

&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: The thing
about daydreaming in class,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.750
is you forget what was happening
just before 90,000 fans started

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.120
cheering you to victory.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.180
So everything blurs when your
best friend whispers from behind.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.550
I think she's talking to you, bro.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.870
And your teacher slams
you with a question

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.610
that makes absolutely no sense.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.890
The expression to nip something

00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:00.060
in the bud is an example
of what, Nicholas?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.890
Uh. To nip it in the butt.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.240
Is an example of how to
get slapped by a girl.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.680
I wanted to write a book
about a boy who loved soccer

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.830
and likes a girl named April.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:23.750
At Ms. Quattlebaum's school of
ballroom dance and etiquette,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.780
the boys must address
the girls as m'lady.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.400
M'lady may I take your coat?

M'lady may I please have this dance?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.130
M'lday, sorry my hands are clammy.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.150
After you learn how to
properly shake hands,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.050
Quattlebaum chooses dance partners.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.290
When she gets to you,
there are two girls left.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.160
April and a girl with
chronic halitosis.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.860
Guess which one you get?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.330
I wanted to write a book
about a boy who loves soccer,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:04.510

unfortunately, is getting bullied.

out of the league for
literally tackling opponents

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.490

Why couldn't your dad be a
musician like Jimmy Leon's dad?

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:04.680
Or better yet, own an
oil company like Kobe's?

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.110
Better yet, why couldn't he be
a cool detective driving a sleek

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.270
silver convertible sports car
like Will Smith in Bad Boys?

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:17.020
Instead your dad's a
linguistics professor.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.380
With chronic verbal mania
as evidence by the fact

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.820
that he actually wrote a
dictionary called Weird

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:29.530
and Wonderful Words with,
get this, foot notes.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.590
Verbal mania, known, a
crazed obsession for words.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.950
Every freaking day I have
to read his dictionary

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.750
which has freaking foot notes.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.470
It's absurd to me.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.360
Kind of like ordering a glass of
chocolate milk and then asking

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.680
for a side of chocolate syrup.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.680
Seriously, who does that?

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.350
In the elementary school

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:59.150
when you intentionally misspelled
heffer, he almost had a cow.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.010
You're the only kid on your block
in the entire freaking world

He calls it the pursuit
of excellence.

You call it Shawshank.

And even though your mother
forbids you to say it,

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.870
the truth is, you hate words.

rap producer but now he only listens

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.050
to elevator music because he
says that hip hop is dead.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:07.640
When I ask him who killed it he
says ringtones and objectification.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.850
Reason number one why he left
the music business at age 29

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.060
to become, get this, a librarian.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.740
Reason number two is the brain
surgery he had two years ago

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.430
that left him with a scar
that runs across his head

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.860
from his left ear to his right.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.280
But he's the coolest
adult in our school

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.200

got a Grammy award

than Brazil has won The World Cup.

about his book club or breaks

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.100

middle of a conversation,

become the things he loves

the character Nick Hall,
the teachers and so forth,

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.620
probably think he's
a reluctant reader.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.640
And just like the teachers
thought I was a reluctant reader.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.850
But by age 11, I had read, my
father made me read Pedagogy

well read, but I was like,

I was reading college text.

I was reluctant,

which is why I am a
little weary of that word,

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.050
it's that I wasn't interested in
the books that were being given.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.520 position:56%
And so I think, we've got to be
careful about how we label children.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.510
Because these labels will
carry through them in life.

Yes.

&gt;&gt; Do you find it easier to write
in verse than to not write in verse?

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.570
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Oh yes, I do
find it easier to write in verse.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:14.070 position:56%
It's certainly a challenge to be
able to say so much in so few words,

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.420
but I've been writing
poetry for so long,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.250
and doing it professionally
for 23 years.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.780
And I started right
here in Arlington,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:26.220
Virginia when I was trying
to court my wife who's here.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.380
And the way I courted her was I
wrote her a poem a day for a year.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:37.230
Yup. And I can embarrass
her with a poem right now.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.220
No, there's too many kids here.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.640

any new books right now?

on any new books right now?

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.510

&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Yes,
I don't really even need

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.650
to say anything about that.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.950
It's just wild.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.570
This is a book called Out of
Wonder, Poems Celebrating Poets

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.180
and it's a collection of poems
and illustrations by Ekua Holmes

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.130
who just won a Caldecott Honor,
and that comes out in March.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:14.950 position:56%
This is a book of poems that I wrote
with some friends to photographs

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.080
of endangered animals
from around the world.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.360

with National Geographic

If you read The Crossover,
you will know

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.020
that there are a lot
of basketball rules.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.360
If you miss enough of life's free
throws you will pay in the end.

The father gives the son these
basketball rules for life.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.250
Well I decided to do a whole
book of basketball rules.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.890
And it comes out on
Valentine's Day as well

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.300
and it's called The Playbook.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.980
So thank you for that question.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.280
Yes?

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:56.430
&gt;&gt; We're from Julius West Middle
School, and we have two questions.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.320
One, are there any
authors who inspired you?

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.910
And two, do you have any
advice for younger writers?

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.210
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
For young writers.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.650
So yes. Nicki Giovanni was
my professor in college

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.470
and she inspired me and
continues to inspire me.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.030
I read a lot Langston Hughes.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.800
And do I have any advice
for students who want

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.100
to write and who are writing?

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.980
And for adults who want to
live and who are living?

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.780
I do.

I believe you have
to say yes to life.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.540
You have to say yes
to what's possible.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.720
And the way you learn what's
possible is by reading

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.450
and exposing yourself to
all the wonderful things

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.210
that are possible for
you in this world.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.820
So say yes.

And I'm going to tell
you something very sad

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.010
but I think it's an important
conversation we have to have.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.370
I can't move your book.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.760
I cannot get kids to
read your books.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.090
And I think, I'm having this
conversation with fellow educators,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.620
this idea of Cadence and
how do we teach students,

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.630
they don't hear their own
voice when they're reading.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.100
We have gotten to such a scripted
reading program in this country

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.870
that we don't teach kids how
to hear themselves and how

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.170
to hear inflections and how

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.300
to hear the things they need
to be hearing in a book.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.600
What are we doing?

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.510
And how do we move forward and
teach kids to hear their voices

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.270
so they can enjoy books like yours?

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.650
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: So I have
never heard that comment before.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.950
&gt;&gt; It is the most

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.250
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Wow,
that is astonishing.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.610
So tell me this, do
you teach high school?

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.910
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's high school.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.700
I'm in grades 10 through
12, and I will say

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.000
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Okay.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.300
&gt;&gt; We have a large
international academy.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.800
About 1,000 of our 3,000 students
at my campus are all coming

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.100
from different countries.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.210 position:56%
144 different languages represented.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.100
That may have something to do with
it, but those aren't just the kids

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.650
that I can't get the
book their hands.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:02.950
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Sure.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.050
&gt;&gt; And it's that, I don't think
the content is interesting,

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.990
I really think they look at your
book and they can't decode it.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.290
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
So here's the thing,

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.920
I don't even know how
to answer that.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.350
But I will say this.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:21.330
What came to mind is, that in my
travels to 177 schools last year,

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:27.920
the comments that I heard from
teachers and librarians, were this.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.540
Because it's poetry, because it has
so much white space, these kids,

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.910
the ones who are avid, the
ones who are not engaged,

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.480
are reading your book and
are doing it in one day.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.890
I just met a kid who came up here

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.700
and said I read your
book in one day.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:47.370
And so, I think, this
is me guessing.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.410
I write for ages 9 to 12.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.910
These are middle grade novels.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:59.570
And so certainly I think that
adults and some older people,

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.850
some older students have enjoyed
the books and been able to connect

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.570
with them, and been able
to resonate with them,

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:10.470
but I think maybe the appeal of
it, it's not there for high school.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.530
Or maybe it needs to be book
talked in a different way.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.120

music today helped.

Folks call me that
because my game's a claim,

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.710
so down right dirty
it will put you to

else called me fresh and sweet,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.980
I'd burn that as a flame,
but I know she's only talking

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.280
about my game, see.

maybe sometimes we've got

to book talk these books in
different ways for different ages

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.830
and just like all of
you all participated,

school students might.

&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Hello.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:24.810
&gt;&gt; Alright, so.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.740
I'm going to right off the
bat, I have never heard

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.940
of these books before in my life.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.750
And as soon as I heard
the description I'm like,

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.410
oh my God I need to buy these books
and put them in my school's library

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:40.120
because there are some kids at
my school who need to read it.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.540
Who need to get this.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:46.050
Because I'm a very avid writer,
reader, artist, musician,

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.650
poet, and I go to school.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.250
And there are five year olds, there
are seven year olds, who are stuck,

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.450
who I see on their
iPhones texting away,

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.430
saying they haven't read
a book in their lives.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.480
There are seven year
olds in my school,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.010
it's a private school,
but who can't read.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.660
And as, I've been reading since
I was three and a half years old,

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.740
I've read the Harry Potter series
when I was like nine, I love books.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.930
I like reading them,
writing them, and the thought

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:23.250 position:56%
that there are people out there who
are unable to connect to the stories

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.490
on the page, it's horrifying.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.190
And

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.490
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: You're right.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.130
And I applaud you.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.400
What grade are you in?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.700
&gt;&gt; Eighth.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.000
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander:
You're in eighth grade?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.300
&gt;&gt; I think.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.600
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: Wow,
that's really impressive.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.900
I applaud you, and I think
we've got to do more of this.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.030
We've got to have, that's why the
book festival is so important.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.010
Because it takes the
words off the page,

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.920
it puts the words on the stage.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.050
It gives parents and
children an opportunity

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.590
to connect around literature.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.510
So thank you so much for that.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.810
[ Applause ]

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.500
&gt;&gt; I'm from Beville Middle School

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.610
and I was wondering
what would you say

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:06.150
to future authors to
inspire them more?

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.450
&gt;&gt; Kwame Alexander: So
we'll end with that.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:08.750
That's a very good point.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.930
What would I say to future
authors to inspire them?

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.400
I would say it took me five years

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.260
to get my novel, The
Crossover published.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.860
It took me 22 rejections.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.350
It took a lot of persistence
and a lot of will.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:30.900
And I think I would encourage
you to believe in yourself.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.090
To believe in your capacity
to create a story or a poem

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.970
or something that's meaningful
and significant to other people.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:48.160
I would also encourage the
adults in the room to remember

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:55.600
that adults don't sort of create
their prejudices and their ideas

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.640
about the world out of a vacuum.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.470
The mind of an adult begins
in the imagination of a child.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.170
And we have to begin to create
literature and expose children

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.270
to literature that's going to
make them into the kinds of people

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.210
that we're going to be proud of
and that are going to represent

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:15.980
and really create the kind of place
we really need and want in America.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.510
So thank you all so much
and have a great day.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.040
