00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.250
One of the problems with the whole idea of
a single Scientific Revolution is that some

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.530
disciplines decided not to join any revolution.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.219
And others just took a long time to get there.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.400
In the case of chemistry—the study of what
stuff is—a real scientific revolution, like

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.169
in the Thomas Kuhn sense, didn’t really
get going until the 1770s.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.919
Until then, mainstream chemistry in Europe
was based on phlogiston theory, which may

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.099
be difficult to wrap your head around because
it is the opposite of how we understand chemical

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.099
reactions today.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:38.280
To shake loose that particular scientific
status quo, it took the power of the Enlightenment,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.520
and one of its most emblematic natural philosophers,
Lavoisier.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.760
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.039
If the 1600s was the century of science in
Europe, centered on London, then the 1700s

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.859
was the century of philosophy, centered on
Paris.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.100
This new philosophy largely consisted of a
movement called the Enlightenment—dated

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.170
by some from 1715, when France’s powerful
“Sun King,” Louis the Fourteenth, died,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.970
to 1789, when the French Revolution started.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.220
The Enlightenment was a shift in ideas about
knowledge, away from traditional sources of

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.870
authority, like the Church, and toward the
kind of scientific rationality described by

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.870
Bacon.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.360
This aspect of the Enlightenment is summed
up by the catchphrase sapere aude, or “dare

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360
to know.”

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.210
This suggested that knowing is something you
should do—a moral good.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.850
This was an “Age of Reason.”

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.840
The Enlightenment was also about social values,
such as individual liberty, the progress of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.530
civilization, and religious tolerance, including
the separation of church and state.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.130
The Enlightenment at times even fed into anti-religious,
specifically anti-Catholic, feelings, setting

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.730
the stage for a later perceived break between
science and religion.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.160
The term “Enlightenment” was coined by
German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.200
and it was used by Voltaire, and later by
Kant.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.670
Thinkers like them—called les philosophes,
or “the philosophers”—met in scientific

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.660
societies, literary salons, and coffeehouses.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.560
The philosophes saw it as their job to discover
the laws of nature—the natural law that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.900
helped guide human behavior.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.480
They dreamed of a “republic of letters,”
a world ruled by rational thought and guided

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.800
by reasoned debate.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.230
So, yes, if you remember episode two: the
philosophes were kinda like the Presocratics.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.990
The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined
the authority of kings and churches and helped

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.800
set the intellectual stage for the soon-to-come
revolutions in the United States, France,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
and Haiti.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.450
But the Enlightenment was also about increasingly
centralized state power and colonization of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.610
non-Europeans, which we talked about two episodes
ago.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.140
Statistics, for example, was developed at
this time to serve the interests of nation-states

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.780
and early corporations.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.390
So we can also call this the Age of Empire…

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.870
Perhaps no object better represents the Enlightenment
than the ambitious book named the Encyclopédie.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.950
Edited by Jean d’Alembert and Denis Diderot
from 1751 to 1777, the twenty-two volume Encyclopédie

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.360
attempted to organize literally all of the
knowledge available to humanity.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360
Basically...

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360
Wikipedia!

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.940
The Encyclopédie physically demonstrated
three big ideas: First, knowledge is cumulative.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.800
Humans add new knowledge to our collective
pool all the time.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.970
Second, knowledge is recordable.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.970
We can transmit knowledge through things like
books.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.370
And third, knowledge is political.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.870
Diderot, like Bacon, believed that knowledge
should be used to alleviate human misery.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.230
Diderot hoped to “change the general way
of thinking” by popularizing recent achievements

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.500
in science and technology and combating superstition.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.990
He wanted to use knowledge to help people
out.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.090
He also thought that all traditional beliefs
should be reexamined “without sparing anyone’s

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.180
sensibilities.”

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.510
But strict censorship by the state made any
explicitly anti-religious articles impossible,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.260
so Diderot had to cleverly slip in critiques
of the church.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.380
For example, in the cross-reference for the
entry on the Eucharist: “see cannibalism.”

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.230
Now, the Encyclopédie systemized knowledge
in a neat way, but it was largely qualitative,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.650
describing things according to values—for
example, what a good ship looks like.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.379
But Enlightenment thinkers increasingly dreamed
of quantification, or describing things in

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.779
numbers—like units of length, mass, heat,
and so on.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.400
But for quantification to work, you have to
have an agreement about how to measure things.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.830
In other words, you have to have standards.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.939
The meter, for example, was defined by a commission
of scientists in France in the 1790s as one

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.479
ten-millionth of the earth’s meridian through
Paris.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.440
The commission included Pierre-Simon Laplace,
who wrote the five-volume

00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:49.700
Celestial Mechanics, starting
in 1799.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.909
This greatly expanded Newton’s work on classical
mechanics, opening up a range of topics to

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.949
the problem-solving power of calculus.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.659
Celestial Mechanics became a sort of Principia - volume two.

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.129
And in order to actually measure the meter,
the commission sent out two guys, Pierre Méchain

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.920
and Jean-Baptiste Delambre, to make measurements.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.460
...I'm not good at French.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.020
This was a time of widespread war in Europe.

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:16.009
Méchain and Delambre struggled against skirmishes,
yellow fever, and imprisonment—but they

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.080
got the job done.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.889
And along with standards, measurement required
new instruments, like the barometer and electrometer,

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.620
as well as new ways of interpreting data,
AKA statistics, which were also pioneered

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.620
by Laplace.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.759
By the end of the eighteenth century, physics
was already well on its way to rationalization,

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.069
quantification, and even standard measurement.

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.659
But what about chemistry?

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.219
In the late 1700s, natural philosophers believed
that chemical reactions occurred thanks to

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:46.479
an ether—a colorless, odorless, “self-repulsive,”
extremely fine, and therefore hard-to-measure

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.569
fluid—called phlogiston.

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.440
According to phlogiston theory, this ether
was released during combustion.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.099
For example, a burning candle was thought
to release phlogiston.

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.379
If you covered that candle with a jar, the
flame would go out, because the air would

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.270
become saturated with phlogiston and couldn’t
absorb any more.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.930
This is exactly the opposite of how we now
understand it: that the flame goes out because

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.069
it’s used up all of the oxygen, which is
necessary for a chemical reaction.

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.150
Likewise, it was thought at the time that,
when plants grew, they absorbed phlogiston

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.380
from the air.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.570
When their wood was burned, it released phlogiston
back into the air.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.080
Or when we ate them, our bodies released phlogiston
through respiration and body heat.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.379
In this system, “phlogisticated air” or
“fixed air” was what we would now call

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:33.099
carbon dioxide.

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.939
Joseph Black isolated fixed air in 1756.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:39.449
“Dephlogisticated air,” on the other hand,
was oxygen.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.599
This system worked pretty well to explain
chemical reactions qualitatively—why they

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.320
seemed to appear a certain way—but no one
could quantify phlogiston.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.379
And minor anomalies in phlogiston theory kept
adding up.

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:56.689
For example, mercury gained weight during
combustion, even though, by releasing phlogiston,

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:57.879
it should have lost weight.

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:03.569
The person who changed chemistry from a qualitative
discipline to a quantitative one was Antoine-Laurent

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:04.569
de Lavoisier.

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.729
A good example of an Enlightenment natural
philosopher, Lavoisier was born to a noble

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.279
family in Paris in 1743.

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:15.349
He studied law but was obsessed with geology
and chemistry.

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.660
Lavoisier also worked on the metric system.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.780
Lavoisier first presented research on chemistry,
in a paper about gypsum, to the French

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.080
Academy of Sciences in 1764.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.900
In 1768, the Academy made Lavoisier a provisional
member.

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:32.909
Two decades later, he would become the founder
of the “new chemistry,” revolutionizing

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:34.439
the entire discipline.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:39.289
ThoughtBubble, show us what this means:
Lavoisier knew phlogiston theory well.

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:41.039
But he began his chemical research with

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.200
the hypothesis that, during combustion, something
is taken out of air rather than put into it.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.020
That hypothesis turned out to be correct,
and that something turned out to be oxygen.

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:57.659
Lavoisier’s tested his hypothesis by accounting
for inputs and outputs in chemical reactions—a

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:01.939
perfect example of the eighteenth-century
quantification of science.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:07.699
And Lavoisier also discovered that the mass
of matter remains the same even when it changes

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.099
form or shape.

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:10.830
Which is very important!

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.490
Working carefully over years, he generated
the first modern list of elements.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:21.460
He named oxygen in 1778, hydrogen in 1783,
and silicon—merely a prediction at that

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.039
point—in 1787.

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:27.520
In fact, Lavoisier and his allies developed
a whole new nomenclature for chemistry, in

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.520
1787.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.649
“Inflammable air” became hydrogen.

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.460
“Sugar of Saturn” became lead acetate.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.969
“Vitriol of Venus”—which had also been
called blue vitriol, bluestone, and Roman

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:40.240
vitriol—became copper sulfate.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.320
Yeah, the new naming system was less fun than
the old one.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.100
But it was more rational:
the terms better described the underlying

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.840
stuff they pointed to.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.360
“Copper sulfate” meant a compound of sulfur
and copper.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.690
Lavoisier published the textbook Elementary
Treatise of Chemistry in 1789, which taught

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.519
only the new chemistry.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.670
In the introduction to his book, Lavoisier
also separated heat and chemical composition.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.920
So water is water whether it’s heated up
to steam or cooled down to ice.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.640
He understood that heating something up doesn’t
always change what it is, fundamentally.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.910
To explain these state changes, Lavoisier
made up a new ether, which he called the

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.910
caloric.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.610
Caloric could penetrate a block of ice, melting
it into water by pushing the ice particles apart.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.980
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.470
Spoiler: caloric is not thought to be a real
thing today.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.839
(Many people wish calories weren’t real,
but, here we are.)

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:35.870
Led by the prominent English chemist Joseph
Priestley, these old-timers kept modifying

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.220
phlogiston theory so that it could rationally
account for chemical reactions without falling

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.550
apart, due to the whole phlogiston-in versus
oxygen-out thing.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.230
Well into the 1780s, many chemists still
believed in phlogiston—which no one had

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.800
actually seen or measured—simply because
it was familiar.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800
What changed their minds?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.790
Well, Lavoisier and his allies published results
that favored their system.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.470
But more importantly, the students who learned
from them could only speak the language

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.810
of the new chemistry.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.279
The phlogiston believers were increasingly
isolated.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:11.680
Thus in a couple of decades, phlogiston moved
from the center of chemistry into exile.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.220
With the new chemistry, Lavoisier brought
the discipline into the system of rational,

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.240
experimental science dreamed up by methodologists
such as Bacon and fleshed out by Newton.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.360
Outside of chemistry, Lavoisier was a noble
with a powerful state job: he worked at the

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.720
hated tax collection agency of the French
kingdom, known for being both secretive and

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720
violent.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.160
He profited from his job there, helping fund
his chemical research.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.170
But the French Revolution broke out in 1789,
and being an aristocratic tax collector was

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.579
not a good look.

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.480
Lavoisier was tried for defrauding the people
of France.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.540
And the judge denied the appeal to save his
life, despite his immense contributions to

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.740
knowledge, declaring that: “The Republic
needs neither scientists nor chemists; the

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.060
course of justice can not be delayed.”

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.620
Lavoisier died by guillotine in 1794.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:03.120
His friend, mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange,
said of Lavoisier’s death: “It took them

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.129
only an instant to cut off his head, but France
may not produce another such head in a century.”

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:13.760
Now, how was Lavoisier so successful at setting
up the new chemistry as a paradigm?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.940
Well, he had a lot of support!

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.790
Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, AKA “Madame
Lavoisier,” was born into a noble family

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.410
in south-central France in 1858.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.660
And she contributed significantly to Antoine’s
work.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.120
She translated his texts into English, and
after Antoine’s death, she published his

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.310
complete papers, securing his legacy in the
field.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.509
Madame Lavoisier eventually remarried another scientist, Count
Rumford, a physicist who had a role in shaping

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:40.779
thermodynamics.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:44.580
But she insisted on keeping Lavoisier’s
name to show her allegiance to the man she

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.480
loved.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.320
Also, Madame Rumford is way less cool.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.759
After the Lavoisiers, a new generation of
thinkers continued to develop their ideas,

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.100
in France and beyond.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.910
Notably, John Dalton observed that the ratio
of elements in reactions were often made up

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:05.000
of small numbers, meaning that chemical elements
are in fact discrete particles, not fluids.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.490
He called these particles chemical atoms—true
indivisible units.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.800
And Joseph Fourier published the Analytical
Theory of Heat in 1822, using calculus to

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.600
describe how heat flows.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.350
Fourier also discovered the greenhouse effect,
or the capture of the sun’s radiation in

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.350
the earth’s atmosphere.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.420
Next time—we’ll classify plants’ sexy
parts, disintegrate a willow tree, and debate

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.069
whether whole species can … go extinct.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.680
Join us for biology before Darwin!

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.920
Crash Course History of science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.360
In Missoula, MT. And it's made possible with the help of all these nice people.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.700
And our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.700
Crash Course is a Complexly production.
