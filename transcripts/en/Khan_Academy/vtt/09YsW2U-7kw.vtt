00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.320
- [Voiceover] So Kim, in the last video

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.820
we started talking about how slavery

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.410
has been an issue in the United States

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.180
really since its founding
with the Revolutionary War.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.750
And we see some images here of slavery.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.250
This was a particularly famous image

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.190
that really kind of
helped spark indignation

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.060
in the North among Abolitionists

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.920
'cause you can see how this
person was beaten or whipped.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.020
- [Voiceover] Yes absolutely.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.530
- [Voiceover] So it's kind of, you know,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.860
and today we all think it's
morally reprehensible thing

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.550
but you go back not too far
in the whole scope of history.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.090
We're going to the early 1800s,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.380
and this was something that was debated.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.490
It was slavery was allowed

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.120
in a large chunk of the United States.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.920
And in the last video, we talked about

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.690
that this issue of slavery
only got exacerbated

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.220
the more territory that was added.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.860
You have the Louisiana Purchase in 1803

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.150
that adds all of this territory.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.750
You start having states getting carved.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.580
Once you get a critical population,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.150
a critical mass of
people in a certain state

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.530
they can apply to be, or
in a certain territory,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.050
they can apply to be a state.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.750
And as each of these states are added,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.550
and they want to get representation,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.490
it's a political issue.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.040
You mentioned how the
North, they didn't like it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.880
on moral grounds and if
it was a slave state.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.580
And they also didn't like
it on economic grounds

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.190
'cause it's hard to compete
economically with slavery.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.990
While the South was afraid
of losing its political power

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.200
if more free states
were to join the Union.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.890
And the Compromise of 1820, you mentioned

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.320
that well that compromise,
Missouri is a slave state.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.980
Maine gets carved out of Massachusetts,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.280
becomes a free state.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.150
But that didn't solve the problem.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.770
That problem only
continues because we only

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.670
add more territory.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.290
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
mean most of the history

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.790
of the 1800s, when it comes to slavery,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.240
is a history of putting off the problem.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.400
Henry Clay becomes this
very famous legislator

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.780
because he's good at compromising.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.320
He's called the "Great Compromiser".

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.390
So, instead of trying to actually solve

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.710
the issue of slavery, which many people

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.990
think of as an unsolvable problem.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.320
They're just saying,
"All right, well how can

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.750
"we put off a conflict over
this a little bit longer?"

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.390
- [Voiceover] And they
just keep doing that.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.660
You know, in 1836 the
territory expands further,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.010
or it starts to I guess.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.590
The expansion is catalyzed further

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.910
by you have the Texas Revolution.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.650
Texas get its independence from Mexico.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.630
Which itself got independence
only a few decades

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.183
before that from Spain.

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:17.300
But so Texas, for a brief amount of time,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.190
is its own independent country.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.450
But then, it joins the US,
it's annexed by the US in 1845.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180
So it's more territory for the US,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.970
and that was slave territory.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.620
- [Voiceover] Right, yeah so again,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.650
this is an area in the South where

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.750
most of the reasons that
slavery existed in the South

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.850
is because it's a very fertile
agricultural region, right?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.940
Where the things that you grow, crops,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.550
are very labor-intensive.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.180
So they figure, how are we going

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.020
to find enough people to grow these crops?

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.080
And the answer is that they've
been importing African slaves

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.420
and forcing them to work.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.950
- [Voiceover] And the annexation of Texas,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.950
there's war disputes with Mexico

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.090
which leads to even, another
conflict with Mexico.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.880
This time with the US and Mexico.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.290
This is the Mexican-American
War from 1846 to 1848.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.150
But in the context of this conversation,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.690
the reason why it helped
bring the slavery issue

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.050
even more to a head, is
that when the US wins it,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.450
it gets even more territory.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.060
It gets all of this area in
the West, right over here.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.280
- [Voiceover] Right, it's more territory.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.620
And it's more sort of Southern territory

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.190
which means that it has a high probability

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.850
of becoming slave states.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.790
- [Voiceover] And so, this map that we

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.680
looked at earlier in the other video,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.120
this is kind of showing
what the US looked like

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.850
as we exit out the Mexican-American War.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.850
We're getting to about 1850.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.783
And so, what happens then?

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:44.980
I mean, is it just one compromise

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.550
after another at this point?

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.440
- [Voiceover] Well, this is
the point where compromise

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.740
begins to break down.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.780
Henry Clay again, is the architect

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.510
of what's called the Compromise of 1850.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.910
As soon as the US goes to war with Mexico,

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.410
people in Congress are wondering,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.030
"All right, if we get this territory

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.040
"that we're trying to get,
what's going to happen?

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.710
"Are they going to be free
states or slave states?"

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.680
And this compromise over
free and slave states

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.950
has been going on for 30 years

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.390
since the Missouri Compromise.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.690
And even longer, if you
take it back to 1776.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.850
So, they're doing exactly the same thing.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.550
They're saying, "All right, well let's try

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.130
"to keep a balance of power

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.250
"between free states and slave states."

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.180
Except, they add in a couple of provises

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.090
that make people really
angry in the 1850s.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.620
- [Voiceover] And who gets angry?

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.680
- [Voiceover] Both I
would say, slaveowners

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.050
and Abolitionists and anti-slavery
activists in the North.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.720
- [Voiceover] So, I guess that's
what makes it a compromise.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.520
A little something to
make everybody angry.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.990
(laughter)

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.150
What made the slave owners angry

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.690
about the Compromise of 1850?

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.950
- [Voiceover] One of the parts
of the Compromise of 1850,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.410
apart from deciding whether
these new territories

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.420
were going to be slave or free

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.190
was a part of the Act,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.740
was called the Fugitive Slave Act.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.750
And the Fugitive Slave
Act said that it was

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.880
a federal offense not

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.310
to help slave owners recover--

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.450
- [Voiceover] So this is
something the Abolitionists angry?

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.050
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.950
- [Voiceover] Or the anti-slavery angry?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.700
- [Voiceover] Yeah, absolutely both.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.920
So for example, if you're
maybe living in Massachusetts,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.450
you're a white middle-class person

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.010
living in Massachusetts, you
don't think slavery is great.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.960
You think it's morally wrong,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.390
but it hasn't really directly
affected your life. Right?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.920
You're hundreds of miles away
from the nearest slave state.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.430
But now, the federal government says

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.320
that if there is a person
who has escaped from slavery

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.430
who has come to your town,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.690
it is a federal offense
for you not to help

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.520
return that person to slavery.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.780
- [Voiceover] So this Fugitive Slave,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.150
this is part of the compromise?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.610
This is part of the Compromise of 1850.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.120
Is that I could be
sitting in Massachusetts,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.780
I could be anti-slavery or I could even be

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.120
ambivalent about it.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.690
But now, I have to be complicit in it.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.250
If there's a slave, I can't.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.120
Or if there's someone who's escapes

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.490
from the South who is a former slave,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.420
I have to actively, I
can't in any way help them.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.640
If I do, I could go to jail.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.280
If I'm a law officer, I
have to capture that person,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.820
and I have to bring them back.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.520
So it's kind of forcing people who are

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.520
already not happy about slavery,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.190
it's kind of bringing it close to them.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.620
They have to partake in it.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.490
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and these are people

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.250
who have very strong
religious convictions.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.580
This is the mid-19th century is a time

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.190
when people feel their
religion very strongly.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.120
And so, there are people in
the North who are Quakers.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.290
Who are otherwise religiously
opposed to slavery.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.650
Who have maybe prayed
for the souls of slaves,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.750
but it's never been their job

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.050
to try to keep someone in slavery before.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.280
So that is really infuriating.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.070
One of the things you get out this

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.590
is a really strong backlash
of Abolitionist sentiment

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.380
in the North.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.680
For example, Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.750
she's the daughter of a
reverend who's against slavery.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.320
She writes the book Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.820
which becomes this smash hit.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.820
- [Voiceover] And when was this roughly?

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.310
- [Voiceover] This was about 1852.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.450
- [Voiceover] OK, so this is
after the Compromise of 1850.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.790
So, people are getting, it
really is coming to a head.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.250
The people in the North, they're having

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.890
to partake in this because
of the Fugitive Slave Act.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.820
You have Harriet Beecher Stowe
writes Uncle Tom's Cabin.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.810
It makes people even more upset

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.380
about the realities of slavery.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.620
- [Voiceover] Right, and in the South,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.320
they've kind of gotten away,
white slave owners in this time

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.020
with people saying, "Ya know,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.820
"slavery's not really my problem.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.850
"I don't like it."

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.480
But now they're seeing
a concentrated attack,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.420
a moral and social attack
against slavery in the North.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.780
And their response is to become even more

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.390
violently in favor of slavery.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.260
They pose the idea that
slavery is not just something

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.490
that we could turn our eyes away from,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.280
but it's necessary.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.650
But it's a positive good.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.420
Slavery is actually going to actually

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.120
make the country better.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.650
If it weren't for slavery, all
of these enslaved Africans,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.600
African-Americans, their lives
would be worse without us.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.300
- [Voiceover] And so, just to be clear

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.430
on the Compromise of 1850.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.560
And there was a bunch of things,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.720
we went into a whole video
on the Compromise of 1850,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.760
all of the different facets of it.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.710
But it's one of its, in
terms of this conversation,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.220
one of its outcomes is because
of the Fugitive Slave Law.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.090
It infuriated many of the
anti-slavery Abolitionists

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.690
in the North.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.820
They became more entrenched
in their positions

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.760
which made the Southerners more entrenched

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.690
in their positions.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.190
The Southerners didn't necessarily,

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.390
they liked the Fugitive
Slave Law, the Southerners.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.160
The Compromise of 1850 sounds like it was,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.210
it was a compromise,
not everyone was happy.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.910
But it sounds like it made

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.550
the anti-slavery folks more unhappy

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.890
than the slavery folks.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.820
- [Voiceover] Yeah absolutely.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.020
So it makes the anti-slavery
folks super unhappy,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.360
but it also means that now
white slave owners in the South,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.380
they feel like there's
a target on their heads.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.790
And so, they're going
to dig in even further

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.380
to make sure that their interests
in slavery are protected.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.730
- [Voiceover] And this gets
us to the election of 1860

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.420
which I guess in some ways was the straw

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.710
that breaks the camel's back,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.910
I guess from a Southern perspective.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.380
And why is that?

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.510
- [Voiceover] Well, during the 1850s,

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.190
you have all of these
political battles over slavery.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.280
In fact, it kind of breaks
the major political party

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.720
of the 1850s, the Whig Party.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.820
So, in 1860, some of these leftover Whigs,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.580
they reorganize as the Republican Party.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.110
And this is the first election
with a Republican Party

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.550
that we know today.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.020
But obviously, in 1860, the things

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.360
that they're interested
in, their goals and aims

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.590
are completely different.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.490
And the Republican Party
is an anti-slavery party.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.710
They're deliberately and
publicly against slavery.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.300
So, they nominate as their

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.710
political candidate for 1860,

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.520
Abraham Lincoln who is
well-known in the country

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.060
for having been an anti-slavery agitator.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.340
He's given many speeches where he has

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.700
made very eloquent
arguments against slavery.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.060
- [Voiceover] He's, we talked
about in the previous video,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.680
he's against it, I guess on moral grounds.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.150
But perhaps even more, his old father

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.280
wasn't able to be a successful farmer

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.450
because he had to compete
with slave owners.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.090
- [Voiceover] Right, so he's
brought up to hate slavery

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.640
because it's a big
business that has harmed

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.940
his own family's economic future.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.260
But, he comes, I think,
to his own conclusion

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.450
that slavery is morally wrong.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.090
What he doesn't think that
he can do as president

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.590
is legally or constitutionally,
get rid of slavery.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.510
He doesn't think that the
Constitution allows it.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:19.260
But, he is seen as enough
of a threat by Southerners

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.300
that in many cases, on the
presidential ballots in 1860,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.110
you couldn't even vote for Abraham Lincoln

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.490
if you wanted to.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.350
He didn't show up on the
ballot in Southern states.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.690
Nonetheless, he still gets
enough electoral votes

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.670
that he's elected.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.760
- [Voiceover] And then
that's what takes us into

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.760
the real meat of, you know,
catalyzes the Civil War.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.560
- [Voiceover] Yeah, stay
tuned, Abraham Lincoln.
