00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099
experienced okay so here's the thing
 

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:02.809
experienced okay so here's the thing
though what's the multiverse wristwatch

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819
though what's the multiverse wristwatch
 

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.119
though what's the multiverse wristwatch
what does Gwen is able to travel from

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:05.129
what does Gwen is able to travel from
 

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:08.209
what does Gwen is able to travel from
the multiverse from multiple to multiple

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:08.219
the multiverse from multiple to multiple
 

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:10.309
the multiverse from multiple to multiple
in any area at all because of a

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319
in any area at all because of a
 

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.739
in any area at all because of a
wristwatch so she could zip out be back

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:12.749
wristwatch so she could zip out be back
 

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:19.159
wristwatch so she could zip out be back
right behind you so it's basically yes

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:19.169
right behind you so it's basically yes
 

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:21.699
right behind you so it's basically yes
but teleport to the different multiples

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:21.709
but teleport to the different multiples
 

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.619
but teleport to the different multiples
she teleports the vias space and time so

00:08:24.619 --> 00:08:24.629
she teleports the vias space and time so
 

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.709
she teleports the vias space and time so
it's she's not she's not she does she's

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:27.719
it's she's not she's not she does she's
 

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:33.110
it's she's not she's not she does she's
not linear in where she was that time no

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120
not linear in where she was that time no
 

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.699
not linear in where she was that time no
it's not time okay so there would be

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:34.709
it's not time okay so there would be
 

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:36.379
it's not time okay so there would be
amazing though because that I was just

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:36.389
amazing though because that I was just
 

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:41.469
amazing though because that I was just
thinking of like doctor spider-gwen

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479
 
 

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:49.790
 
okay I think that the spider sense would

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800
okay I think that the spider sense would
 

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.829
okay I think that the spider sense would
probably kick in before she can really

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839
probably kick in before she can really
 

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.660
probably kick in before she can really
do any damage with that well how far

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:53.670
do any damage with that well how far
 

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.069
do any damage with that well how far
does the spider sense go does it go

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:55.079
does the spider sense go does it go
 

00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:56.809
does the spider sense go does it go
between the motors she appears behind

00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:56.819
between the motors she appears behind
 

00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:59.600
between the motors she appears behind
absurdly at least you know catch it so

00:08:59.600 --> 00:08:59.610
absurdly at least you know catch it so
 

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.100
absurdly at least you know catch it so
she has to be super precise I'm not

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.110
she has to be super precise I'm not
 

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.360
she has to be super precise I'm not
precise that watches

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.370
precise that watches
 

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.860
precise that watches
if she appears like right behind him is

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:03.870
if she appears like right behind him is
 

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.150

something maybe she can get the jump on
 

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.379
something maybe she can get the jump on
yeah I mean it would be an interesting

sometimes all that and like I said he

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540
sometimes all that and like I said he
 

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.869
sometimes all that and like I said he
you know he has Peters intellect and

00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:29.879
you know he has Peters intellect and
 

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.759
you know he has Peters intellect and
spider-man who obviously the Peter

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:31.769
spider-man who obviously the Peter
 

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:33.199

Parker version of spider-man uses his

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:33.209
Parker version of spider-man uses his
 

00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:35.449
Parker version of spider-man uses his
powers to the is the full potential that

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459
powers to the is the full potential that
 

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:37.069
powers to the is the full potential that
he possibly can and then has that within

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079
he possibly can and then has that within

he possibly can and then has that within
him so yeah Ben knows how to use his

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:39.689
him so yeah Ben knows how to use his
 

00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:42.860
him so yeah Ben knows how to use his
powers pretty well okay so here spider

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:42.870
powers pretty well okay so here spider
 

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.559
powers pretty well okay so here spider
powers obviously are the same as spider

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:45.569
powers obviously are the same as spider
 

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:48.499
powers obviously are the same as spider
same with same web shooters um they

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:48.509
same with same web shooters um they
 

00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:51.350
same with same web shooters um they
actually got they were created by Janet

okay and so she made her new ones and

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:57.029
okay and so she made her new ones and
 

00:10:57.029 --> 00:10:59.119
okay and so she made her new ones and
they filter moisture from the air that

00:10:59.119 --> 00:10:59.129
they filter moisture from the air that
 

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:01.100
they filter moisture from the air that
can help create like the adhesiveness

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.110
can help create like the adhesiveness

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.630
 
there's still like a thing that could

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640
there's still like a thing that could
 

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.090
there's still like a thing that could
happen there but yep there's no refills

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100
happen there but yep there's no refills

so if they're going on endurance alone

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140
so if they're going on endurance alone
 

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:43.460
so if they're going on endurance alone
maybe but yes so she's she's basically
