00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.727
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, hello Paige.

00:00:01.727 --> 00:00:02.560
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.116
- [Voiceover] So today
we're gonna tackle this idea

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:08.116
of what is a sentence, as we go into

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.040
this realm of language
that is called syntax.

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:19.623
And syntax is this concept of,
basically grammatical order.

00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:23.822
What this word syntax
literally means in Greek,

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:27.135
is, you know, putting
together and arranging, right,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:30.302
so it just means ordering of language.

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:34.530
- [Voiceover] So that's,
like, what a sentence is.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.363
- [Voiceover] That's what a sentence is,

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:36.521
it's what a sentence is, it's what

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.357
the components of a sentence are.

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:43.890
And we'll go into all of
that in much greater detail,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.685
but in order to do that, first of all

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.875
we have to figure out what
a sentence actually is.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.667
So, the definition that you
and I came up with, Paige,

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.138
is that a sentence is a
grammatically complete idea.

00:00:56.138 --> 00:00:57.805
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:03.295
It's a bunch of words that
say one complete thing.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:04.445
- [Voiceover] So, all sentences have

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:06.787
a noun or pronoun component,
- [Voiceover] Mmm-hmm.

00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:10.954
- [Voiceover] Right, and that's
what we call the subject.

00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:17.864
And then we have the verb
part, which is the predicate.

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:21.587
- [Voiceover] So a sentence has,

00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:24.298
it has to have like, a
thing, or a noun or pronoun.

00:01:24.298 --> 00:01:25.482
- [Voiceover] Sure, that's the subject.

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:27.653
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and
something that it's doing.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.252
- [Voiceover] Sure, that's the predicate.

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:30.331
- [Voiceover] Yeah.
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.154
So let's say that we've got this sentence,

00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:34.571
the great big dog

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:39.833
licked my face.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:47.235
Here is our sentence, what is the subject?

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:49.747
- [Voiceover] Subject
is the great big dog.

00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:52.011
- [Voiceover] Alright, and that means that

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.503
everything that's not the subject

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.134
is part of the predicate, right?

00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:56.149
- [Voiceover] Mmm-hmm.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.845
- [Voiceover] So, licked
my face is the predicate.

00:01:58.845 --> 00:02:01.536
So this is the noun chunk that is

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:04.284
performing the action of the sentence.

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:05.435
- [Voiceover] You got it, yeah.

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.045
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:09.081
So, all sentences have
to have this, right?

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:10.340
- [Voiceover] Yeah, they have to have

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.650
a subject and a predicate,
these two separate parts.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.817
- [Voiceover] So if you said,
if you asked a question like,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.841
Are you named David?

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:21.882
- [Voiceover] Okay,

00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:22.753
- [Voiceover] If you asked that of me,

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:23.586
- [Voiceover] Mmm-hmm,

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:24.647
- [Voiceover] Which, go ahead.

00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:25.691
- [Voiceover] Are you named David?

00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:27.274
- [Voiceover] I am.

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.287
Is this a sentence, it's really short.

00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:31.274
- [Voiceover] It is very short.

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:33.603
But, see, "I" is a pronoun,
- [Voiceover] Okay,

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:35.233
- [Voiceover] So that can be the subject.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.100
- [Voiceover] That's our subject.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.081
- [Voiceover] And, "am" is a verb.

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:40.109
So it has a subject and a predicate.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.855
- [Voiceover] So this is
the noun or pronoun part.

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:46.158
And this is the action
that it is performing.

00:02:46.158 --> 00:02:48.427
Although "am" or "being"
isn't really an action,

00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:51.413
it's more of a linking verb.
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:53.350
- [Voiceover] But it's still a verb.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.234
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:55.205
- [Voiceover] Okay, so this is, this is

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:56.122
the predicate then, for sure.

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:57.141
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.979
- [Voiceover] Okay, so Paige.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.201
Let's say I dropped a muffin.

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.034
- [Voiceover] Right,

00:03:03.034 --> 00:03:06.150
- [Voiceover] And you told
me, pick up that muffin.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.525
- [Voiceover] Uh-huh.

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:09.135
- [Voiceover] That sentence
doesn't seem to have,

00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:11.468
just let me write that down.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.927
That sentence doesn't
seem to have a subject.

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:24.844
I see how all of this is predicate.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.746
- [Voiceover] Right, pick
up is a verb, and then,

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:29.169
- [Voiceover] And then
the muffin is the thing

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.972
that's being picked up,
like that's all one thing.

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:34.906
Where's, what goes in the blue box?

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:36.687
- [Voiceover] I see, so when
we have a sentence like this,

00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:38.997
where I'm telling you to do something,

00:03:38.997 --> 00:03:39.830
- [Voiceover] Mmm-hmm,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:40.945
- [Voiceover] There
doesn't always have to be

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:43.156
a subject said out loud.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.199
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.918
- [Voiceover] This is
like an order, right?

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:47.969
I'm telling you you have
to pick up that muffin.

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.017
- [Voiceover] So this is kinda like

00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:51.434
an invisible, secret subject.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.677
- [Voiceover] Right, the
subject really is you.

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:55.510
- [Voiceover] Okay,

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.078
- [Voiceover] You pick up that muffin,

00:03:57.078 --> 00:03:58.430
but I don't have to say it out loud.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.904
- [Voiceover] Because I know
that you're talking to me.

00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:01.535
Because I can tell 'cause
you're looking at me,

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:03.215
and you're yelling at me about a muffin.

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:04.055
- [Voiceover] Yes, I am.

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:06.009
- [Voiceover] So, a sentence is

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.124
a grammatically complete
idea or expression.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:10.957
- [Voiceover] Mmm-hmm.

00:04:10.957 --> 00:04:13.387
- [Voiceover] And it has to
have a noun or pronoun part,

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.315
which we call the subject,
and it has to have

00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:17.213
a verb and all it's baggage part,

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:19.245
which is what we call the predicate.

00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:24.167
And sometimes that subject
can sort of be implied,

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.445
or invisible, as in the
command. "Pick up that muffin!"

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:28.959
- [Voiceover] Right.
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.496
You can learn anything, David out.

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:32.496
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
