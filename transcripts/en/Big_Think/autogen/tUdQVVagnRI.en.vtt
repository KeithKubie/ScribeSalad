I very often get asked what can you do

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
I very often get asked what can you do
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.520
I very often get asked what can you do
personally and I would wish there were

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
personally and I would wish there were
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.790
personally and I would wish there were
very very simple easy answers

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800
very very simple easy answers
 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.230
very very simple easy answers
unfortunately it turns out the most of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
unfortunately it turns out the most of
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.339
unfortunately it turns out the most of
the things that we are talking about

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349
the things that we are talking about
 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.310
the things that we are talking about
when we talk about global problems

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320
when we talk about global problems
 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.900
when we talk about global problems
global warming as well as many of the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
global warming as well as many of the
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.030
global warming as well as many of the
other problems in the world a much more

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040
other problems in the world a much more
 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.359
other problems in the world a much more
systemic we can't sit down and invent a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
systemic we can't sit down and invent a
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.580
systemic we can't sit down and invent a
vaccine for malaria we can't distribute

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
vaccine for malaria we can't distribute
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920
vaccine for malaria we can't distribute
mosquito nets to avoid malaria and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
mosquito nets to avoid malaria and
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.319
mosquito nets to avoid malaria and
likewise it's very hard for us to make

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
likewise it's very hard for us to make
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.690
likewise it's very hard for us to make
really radical choices that will cut

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
really radical choices that will cut
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430
really radical choices that will cut
back our carbon emissions dramatically

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
back our carbon emissions dramatically
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200
back our carbon emissions dramatically
now this doesn't mean we shouldn't be

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
now this doesn't mean we shouldn't be
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.820
now this doesn't mean we shouldn't be
changing our light bulbs and we

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830
changing our light bulbs and we
 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.650
changing our light bulbs and we
shouldn't be driving a Prius if we can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
shouldn't be driving a Prius if we can
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.780
shouldn't be driving a Prius if we can
but we should recognize that the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790
but we should recognize that the
 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.760
but we should recognize that the
solution is not predominantly with

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
solution is not predominantly with
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.340
solution is not predominantly with
individuals it is with systems and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
individuals it is with systems and
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.250
individuals it is with systems and
societies likewise I think businesses

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
societies likewise I think businesses
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.640
societies likewise I think businesses
need to focus on doing good yes but they

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650
need to focus on doing good yes but they
 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.310
need to focus on doing good yes but they
also need to ask that the fundamental

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
also need to ask that the fundamental
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.530
also need to ask that the fundamental
problem of tackling both sustainable

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540
problem of tackling both sustainable
 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.050
problem of tackling both sustainable
growth and to tackle all the other

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
growth and to tackle all the other
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539
growth and to tackle all the other
problems in the world is this a systemic

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
problems in the world is this a systemic
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.819
problems in the world is this a systemic
issue not just one that any one

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829
issue not just one that any one
 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.330
issue not just one that any one
individual business can take on

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340
 
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.789
 
business is often asked to do good in

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799
business is often asked to do good in
 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.770
business is often asked to do good in
their own to cut back on their carbon

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780
their own to cut back on their carbon
 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.090
their own to cut back on their carbon
emissions and follow up on other

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100
emissions and follow up on other
 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.669
emissions and follow up on other
corporate social responsibilities but

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679
corporate social responsibilities but
 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.240
corporate social responsibilities but
what we have to realize is that it is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
what we have to realize is that it is
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.910
what we have to realize is that it is
systemic issues that drive what actually

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920
systemic issues that drive what actually
 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.459
systemic issues that drive what actually
works in societies where as business of

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469
works in societies where as business of
 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.109
works in societies where as business of
course can cut back in their carbon

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119
course can cut back in their carbon
 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.850
course can cut back in their carbon
emissions that's going to cost them

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860
emissions that's going to cost them
 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.709
emissions that's going to cost them
money and so at the end of the day this

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719
money and so at the end of the day this
 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.599
money and so at the end of the day this
is much more about having a society that

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609
is much more about having a society that
 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.240
is much more about having a society that
sets a price on carbon so that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250
sets a price on carbon so that
 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.770
sets a price on carbon so that
businesses know what they're supposed to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780
businesses know what they're supposed to
 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.319
businesses know what they're supposed to
do just like it's not up to businesses

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329
do just like it's not up to businesses
 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.319
do just like it's not up to businesses
to cure malaria to fix HIV or

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329
to cure malaria to fix HIV or
 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.870
to cure malaria to fix HIV or
malnutrition but businesses can help and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
malnutrition but businesses can help and
 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.089
malnutrition but businesses can help and
so we need to recognize that yes

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099
so we need to recognize that yes
 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.010
so we need to recognize that yes
businesses should be as cost effective

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020
businesses should be as cost effective
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.319
businesses should be as cost effective
when it comes to energy they should

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329
when it comes to energy they should
 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.300
when it comes to energy they should
certainly pick some choices where they

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310
certainly pick some choices where they
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.100
certainly pick some choices where they
say we're going to do good in the world

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110
say we're going to do good in the world
 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.499
say we're going to do good in the world
for instance on malaria or malnutrition

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509
for instance on malaria or malnutrition
 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.990
for instance on malaria or malnutrition
but we should also recognize that at the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000
but we should also recognize that at the
 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.150
but we should also recognize that at the
end of the day this has to be a societal

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160
end of the day this has to be a societal
 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.369
end of the day this has to be a societal
decision and not one that just anyone

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379
decision and not one that just anyone
 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.080
decision and not one that just anyone
business can do

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
 
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 
often the businesses that are most

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
often the businesses that are most
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.740
often the businesses that are most
successful are the ones that are first

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
successful are the ones that are first
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.680
successful are the ones that are first
movers and picking the easy politically

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
movers and picking the easy politically
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.780
movers and picking the easy politically
correct targets often targets that won't

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
correct targets often targets that won't
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.729
correct targets often targets that won't
actually do very much but get a lot of

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739
actually do very much but get a lot of
 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.520
actually do very much but get a lot of
PR so we should be honest if the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530
PR so we should be honest if the
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.830
PR so we should be honest if the
corporate social responsibility there's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
corporate social responsibility there's
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.750
corporate social responsibility there's
really just about PR you should pick

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
really just about PR you should pick
 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.789
really just about PR you should pick
easy targets you should pick targets

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799
easy targets you should pick targets
 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.100
easy targets you should pick targets
that have high visibility in today's

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110
that have high visibility in today's
 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.710
that have high visibility in today's
current discussion but if your goal is

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
current discussion but if your goal is
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.110
current discussion but if your goal is
to actually do good you should be asking

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
to actually do good you should be asking
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240
to actually do good you should be asking
yourself well where do we get the most

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
yourself well where do we get the most
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.270
yourself well where do we get the most
return on social investments on the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
return on social investments on the
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.410
return on social investments on the
money that we're going to be spending

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
money that we're going to be spending
 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.750
money that we're going to be spending
and those are very often much less

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760
and those are very often much less
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.330
and those are very often much less
visible much less interesting but

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340
visible much less interesting but
 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.100
visible much less interesting but
ultimately much more important issues

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
ultimately much more important issues
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.610
ultimately much more important issues
like a persistent malnutrition from

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
like a persistent malnutrition from
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530
like a persistent malnutrition from
micronutrients something you don't ever

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
micronutrients something you don't ever
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.150
micronutrients something you don't ever
hear about but something that actually

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
hear about but something that actually
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.530
hear about but something that actually
affects about half the world's

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
affects about half the world's
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.930
affects about half the world's
population so take your pick do you want

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940
population so take your pick do you want
 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.970
population so take your pick do you want
to be popular in the press or do you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
to be popular in the press or do you
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.000
to be popular in the press or do you
actually want to do good
