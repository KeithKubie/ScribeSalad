00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.520
We are on problem number 22.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.900
And their question is
straightforward enough.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.920
What is the value of
the integer x?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.800
And they tells us
it's an integer.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.490
x is equal to what?

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.270
So the first statement,
x is prime.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.360
Well, there are a lot
of prime integers.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.740
There's actually an infinite
number of them.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.300
So that alone doesn't
tell us what x is.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.570
Two.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.400
Let's see, 31 is less than or
equal to x, which is less than

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.040
or equal to 37.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.330
Well, immediately, this is
useless information because 31

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.330
and 37 are both prime numbers
as far as I can tell, right?

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.750
They're both prime numbers.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.120
So this means that
x could be 31.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.430
It could be 37.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.360
Or let's see, are there any
prime numbers in between?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.780
32, 33, 34, 35.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, there are no prime numbers
in between, but it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.190
could be either 31 or 37, so it
doesn't help us much even

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.620
used in combination.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.740
I mean, this alone is definitely
useless, because

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.550
this is a range of
six numbers.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.030
And even if we know x is prime,
if we use this and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.920
this, all we know is that
x is either 31 or 37, so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.060
the answer is E.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.860
Together, they're not
sufficient, E

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.910
Now, if this was a little bit
different, if this was x is

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.470
greater than 31 and less than or
equal to 37, then we would

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.090
know, oh, x has to be 37.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.590
Or if this wasn't here and this
was there, then we would

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.880
know that x is 31.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.140
But anyway, they
didn't do that.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.790
They gave us the option,
so and the answer is E.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.990
Problem 23.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.710
If P, Q and R are three distinct
points, do line

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.660
segments PQ and PR have
the same length?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.380
So P, Q and R.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.240
They want to know if these two
lines are the same length.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.810
This is line PQ and this
is the line PR.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.680
So are those the same length?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.180
Let's see if we can
figure this out.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.320
Statement one tells us
P is the midpoint of

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.200
line segment QR.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.240
OK, P, midpoint, so I've
already drawn it wrong.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.970
Midpoint of QR.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.830
So let me redraw it, so all
three points actually end up

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.240
being on the same line,
because P is

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.400
the midpoint of QR.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.650
So this is the line.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.860
This is point Q.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.480
This is point R.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.720
So if P is the midpoint, P is
right there, and that tells us

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.820
that this distance is the same
as this distance, which also

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.290
tells us that QP, line segment
QP is equal to PR.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.630
And that's what I think what
they wanted us-- yeah, right.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.020
They want to say does PQ and
PR have same length?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.410
This is PQ So PQ and
PR definitely

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.540
have the same length.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.900
So statement one is
definitely true,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.770
because P is the midpoint.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.980
Let's see about statement two.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.140
I mean, statement one implies
that they have to be on the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.040
same line; otherwise,
P couldn't

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.770
have been the midpoint.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.590
Let's see if statement
two is interesting.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.440
Statement two: Q and R lie in
the same circle with center P.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.520
Interesting.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:49.020
So this is saying a circle with
center P, and Q and R

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.650
both lie on this circle.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.400
So Q could be here.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.320
I'm just picking two
random points.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.550
R could be here.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.280
So we want to know whether
PQ is equal to PR, right?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.530
That was the question.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.790
Well, the definition of a circle
is all points that are

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.760
equal distant from P.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.180
So R has to be the same
distance from P.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.209
It's going to be one radius of
the circle away from P as Q is

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.529
because they're both on the
circle, and they're all equal

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.820
distance from p.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.990
So PR is going to
be equal to PQ.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.510
They're going to be equal
to each other.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.430
So once again, two alone
is sufficient.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.440
So the answer is D, each
statement alone is sufficient.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.310
Problem 24.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.595
The problems are getting a
little bit more interesting.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.430
Is the number x between
0.2 and 0.7?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.320
So if I just write it 0.2 is
less than x, which less than

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.760
0.7, that's what they
want to know.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.350
Statement one tells us that
560x is less than 280.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.500
You know you don't even
have to solve this.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.920
This is a fairly simple
equation.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.290
You can easily solve for x, and
if you can solve for x,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.330
you can answer this question.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.050
So you actually don't have
to go to the trouble.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.090
If you want to, you can then
just divide both sides by 560,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.730
but that takes time,
valuable time.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.356
You're taking the GMAT.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.410
And that is equal
to 1/2, right?

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.820
28/56 is 1/2.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.050
And then you'd say, sure, x is
between the two numbers.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.180
But you didn't have
to do this.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.430
That's a waste of time.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.690
All you have to do say, oh, I
can solve for x, so I can test

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.170
that, whether that's
true or not.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.120
Statement two says 700x
is equal to 280.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.710
Same thing.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.230
You just look at it.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.550
You're like, oh, I could
solve for x.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.830
If I can solve for x, I can tell
you whether x is between

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.710
those two numbers, and
that's the end of it.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.310
And you say, oh, each of these
independently are sufficient

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.800
to answer this question.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.210
But if you wanted to prove it
to yourself and see if this

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.400
question is true or false, you
can just say, well, x is equal

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.790
to 228/700.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:16.820
That is equal to 2.28/7.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.870
That is equal to 0.4.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.710
I just divide the top and the
bottom by 7, and you get 0.4.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.270
So once again, it
is between it.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.300
You answered the question.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.570
But you remember, the question
doesn't have to be

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.800
affirmative.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.360
You just have to figure out if
the data is enough to answer

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.940
the question, and we
didn't have to go

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.370
through this and this.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.690
You could have just looked at
it and said, oh, I can solve

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.440
for x in either way and
then just test it.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.850
Next, problem 25.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.390
If i and j are integers,
is i plus j even?

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.680
So statement number one is
that i is less than 10.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.490
That tells me nothing.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.720
That to me seems kind
of useless.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.750
Statement number two
is i is equal to j.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.040
Well, that's interesting.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.840
So what's i plus j then
going to be equal to?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.570
Well, that's the same thing as--
since i is equal to j,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.010
that's the same thing as j
plus j, which equals 2j.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.990
Or you could say, if you
substitute j for i, or if you

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.700
substitute i for j, that's the
same thing as i plus i, which

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.535
is equal to 2i.

00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:33.330
In either case, you immediately
see that either of

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.040
these numbers are a multiple of
two and therefore have to

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.300
be even, because i and
j are integers.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.290
So statement two alone is
sufficient, and statement one

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.230
is useless.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:53.880
Problem 26.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.780
n plus k is equal to m.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.110
What is the value of k?

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.890
So we could solve for it, if we
could answer this, because

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.350
k is equal to m minus n, and
that would solve our answer.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.390
Let's see if the statements
give us any help.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.750
n is equal to 10.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.470
Well, that'll just tells us that
k is equal to m minus 10.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.080
It still doesn't tell us
what k is, because we

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.800
don't know what m is.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.040
Statement number two.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.750
m plus 10 is equal to n.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.000
This is interesting.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.059
So what does this tell us?

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:43.270
So let's see, if we can figure
out from this statement what m

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.610
minus n is, then we're
in business.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.310
Let's see, let's subtract
n from both sides.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.370
You get m minus n plus
10 is equal to 0.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.850
Subtract 10 from both sides,
you get m minus n is

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.490
equal to minus 10.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.780
Well, we know that k is
equal to m minus n.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.840
m minus n is equal to minus
10, so this is equal to k.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.120
So we solved for k, using just
statement two alone.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.690
Just statement two alone
is sufficient.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.460
And statement one is-- I mean,
it kind of gets us halfway,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.530
but you really don't need it.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.871
Statement two is all you
need, so that is b.

00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:25.840
Let's see if we have
time for one more.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.090
Yeah, sure, why not.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.880
They have drawn a
triangle for us.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.260
I'll draw it quick and dirty.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.660
This is angle x.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.990
This is angle z, and
this is angle y.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.120
And they want to know is this
triangle equilateral, which

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.620
means are all the sides
equal to each other?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.560
So statement one tells us
that x is equal to y.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.720
So we break out a little bit of
our eighth or ninth grade

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.280
geometry here.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.940
So if x is equal to y, if these
angles are equal to each

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.020
other, what that tells us is
that these sides are equal to

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.260
each other, the corresponding
sides are the same.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.280
I could actually redraw this
triangle like this.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.970
Maybe it'll jog those neurons
from ninth grade.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.230
This is x.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.240
This is y, and this is z.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.690
And you could test it out,
if you don't believe me.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.940
And we've gone over this
in the geometry module.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.890
If x and y are equal to each
other, then these sides have

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.980
to be equal to each other.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.120
And you could just try to
imagine drawing a triangle

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.810
that has two base angles equal
to each other and the sides

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.070
are different.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.170
It would be impossible.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.300
The sides would have
to be the same.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.030
This triangle would have to be
at least isosceles and maybe

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.750
equilateral.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.320
Isosceles is two sides
being the same.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.540
But that by itself doesn't
tell us that this is an

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.550
equilateral triangle.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.990
In order for this to be
equilateral, z has to be the

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.590
same as x and y.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.560
They all have to be.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.190
And if they're all going to be
the same, they all add up to

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.210
180, they all have
to be 60 degrees.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.740
So you could have a situation
where x and

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.030
y are both 20 degrees.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.500
This is 20, this is 20, then
they add up to 40.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.450
And then z would have to be 140
in which case, we would

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.420
not have an equilateral
triangle, so one alone is not

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.126
sufficient.

00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:15.180
Let's see was statement
two tells us.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:22.110
Statement two tells us z
is equal to 60 degrees.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.900
So that by itself-- so first
of all, we know if we know

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.820
both of these pieces of
information, we are definitely

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.690
dealing with an equilateral
triangle.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.790
Because think about it.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:39.330
If z is 60, and then we use this
information that these

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.530
two are equal to each other,
what do we know?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.350
If z is 60, then these two added
together have to-- so x

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.060
plus y plus z are going
to be equal to 180.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.560
If z is 60, then x plus y have
to be equal to-- subtract z

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.820
from both sides, or subtract 60
from both sides-- has to be

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.110
equal to 120.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.490
And since these are equal to
each other, x and y both would

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.890
have to be equal to
60 degrees, right?

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.840
So if you use both of this
information, all of the angles

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.880
are going to be 60 degrees
and it's eqilateral.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.340
So we know that definitely
in combination, we

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.810
can figure it out.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.870
But what about just if
z is equal to 60?

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.655
Well, I can easily draw a
triangle that disproves that.

00:12:21.655 --> 00:12:24.950
So if I have a 0-degree angle
here-- in fact, it might be a

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.960
30-60-90 triangle like you
learned in school, so it could

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:34.200
be 60 degrees, 30 degrees,
and 90 degrees.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.760
This could be z.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.980
And this definitely is not
an equilateral triangle.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.860
And so if just by z being 60
degrees, in no way are you

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.720
saying that this is definitely
an equilateral triangle.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.760
You have to have the other
condition that

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.700
x is equal to y.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.440
And so the answer is, let's
see, C, both statements

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.840
together are sufficient, but
neither statement alone is

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.105
sufficient.

00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:01.370
The answer is C.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.200
See you in the next video.
