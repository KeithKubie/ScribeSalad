in the United States you can't watch
this what that made me realize is that

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570
this what that made me realize is that
 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.560
this what that made me realize is that
there's a whole lot of piracy that's

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570
there's a whole lot of piracy that's
 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.020
there's a whole lot of piracy that's
going on as a result of the fact that

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030
going on as a result of the fact that
 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.400
going on as a result of the fact that
you just can't get it I mean I would

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410
you just can't get it I mean I would
 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.190
you just can't get it I mean I would
have been happy to pay I pay netflix for

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200
have been happy to pay I pay netflix for
 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.420
have been happy to pay I pay netflix for
the content I would have been happy to

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430
the content I would have been happy to
 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.210
the content I would have been happy to
pay so it's not as much about you know

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220
pay so it's not as much about you know
 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.420
pay so it's not as much about you know
whether this is right or wrong the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430
whether this is right or wrong the
 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.300
whether this is right or wrong the
problem is that the industry grew up in

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310
problem is that the industry grew up in
 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.770
problem is that the industry grew up in
an era where distribution was very

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780
an era where distribution was very
 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.150
an era where distribution was very
expensive and production was very

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160
expensive and production was very
 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.180
expensive and production was very
expensive and so they they parceled out

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190
expensive and so they they parceled out
 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.849
expensive and so they they parceled out
rights and very carefully rights too you

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859
rights and very carefully rights too you
 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.099
rights and very carefully rights too you
know windows in time you know release

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109
know windows in time you know release
 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.650
know windows in time you know release
windows in various different media and

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660
windows in various different media and
 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.900
windows in various different media and
then also geographic windows and and the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910
then also geographic windows and and the
 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.070
then also geographic windows and and the
rights are all very

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
rights are all very
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.920
rights are all very
convoluted and complicated and we now

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
convoluted and complicated and we now
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.480
convoluted and complicated and we now
live in a world where everything is

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490
live in a world where everything is
 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.540
live in a world where everything is
accessible globally on the internet and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550
accessible globally on the internet and
 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.700
accessible globally on the internet and
they're struggling to adapt to that and

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
they're struggling to adapt to that and
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.230
they're struggling to adapt to that and
they're trying to prevent the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240
they're trying to prevent the
 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.420
they're trying to prevent the
distribution of content across this

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
distribution of content across this
 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.070
distribution of content across this
network because it doesn't conform with

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080
network because it doesn't conform with
 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.689
network because it doesn't conform with
the way they've been licensing content

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699
the way they've been licensing content
 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.300
the way they've been licensing content
over time we think that that they're

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310
over time we think that that they're
 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.890
over time we think that that they're
going to need to ultimately adapt to it

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900
going to need to ultimately adapt to it
 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.869
going to need to ultimately adapt to it
because it doesn't really make sense to

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879
because it doesn't really make sense to
 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.760
because it doesn't really make sense to
criminalize all of your most passionate

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770
criminalize all of your most passionate
 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.499
criminalize all of your most passionate
fans you've got to find a way to serve

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509
fans you've got to find a way to serve
 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.409
fans you've got to find a way to serve
them in the medium that allows for

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419
them in the medium that allows for
 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.179
them in the medium that allows for

00:04:58.179 --> 00:04:58.189
access to this content very
 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.399
access to this content very
inexpensively and I think they can I

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409
inexpensively and I think they can I
 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.889
inexpensively and I think they can I
think you will
