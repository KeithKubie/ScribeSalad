THERE'S A REAL CLASH OF 

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:05.304 align:start position:0% line:91%
CULTURES AND THERE IS A
DISCONNECT BETWEEN PEOPLE

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:06.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO LIVE IN THE BUBBLES --
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:09.008 line:85%
&gt;&gt; OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON AND

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:12.045 size:84% position:42% line:91%
HOLLYWOOD VERSUS THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:12.578 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUBBAS.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.612 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: UH-HUH.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHICH IS THE LAND OF GOD,
GUNS, GRITS AND GRAVY.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:16.949 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS WHERE IT ALL COMES FROM.
&gt;&gt; Jon: I SEE. SO, SO --

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.385 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A BOOK OF RECIPES,
BY THE WAY.

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:22.121 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS, IS THIS ONE
OF THOSE -- NO, I HOPE NOT,

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:22.621 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T
SOUND TASTY.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.489 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AND THERE YOU GO.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.525 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WOULD SOUND TASTY IF YOU
LIVED THERE.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.227 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS THOUGH -- IT
SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS AN IDEA,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.964 line:91%
THERE IS A SENSE OF LIKE, WELL,
PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE COAST

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:35.034 line:91%
ARE NOT REAL, THAT YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE BUBBAS

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.069 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARE REAL AND WE'RE NOT.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.504 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S NOT A
MATTER OF REALITY.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.273 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S A MATTER OF DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.908 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.042 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SURE.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.977 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
EDUCATED AND PEOPLE WHO ARE
SMART.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:51.117 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY
WELL EDUCATED, LET'S SAY THE

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.118 align:start position:0% line:91%
HARVARD FACULTY --
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.886 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BELIEVE THAT THE
PEOPLE WHO LIVE OUT IN THIS

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:56.656 size:78% position:39% line:91%
PART OF THE WORLD WHERE I
LIVE IN FLY-OVER COUNTRY,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.759 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THOSE RED STATES THAT PEOPLE
THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE NUTS.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.060 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT I WANT TO DO-- .

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.529 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY WHO BELIEVE IN

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.898 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVOLUTION, BUT THEN YOU WENT
A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, BUT --
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.436 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHO BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY
THAN THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.071 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BUBBLES.
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.606 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AND HERE'S THE POINT-- .

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.541 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT YOU BELIEVE THAT
THE BUBBAS ARE BETTER THAN

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:16.175 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE BUBBLES.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:16.843 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, DIFFERENT.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, BETTER.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.979 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE BETTER.

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:20.780 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK --

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:21.847 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE
BETTER.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.317 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WROTE A BOOK CALLED "GOD,
GUN, GRITS AND GRAVY."

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.685 size:84% position:42% line:85%
YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE BETTER.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:26.786 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S THE POINT.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.821 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHO WE ARE
TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:29.989 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE BUBBLES.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.558 line:91%
BECAUSE THOSE OF US WITHOUT
LIVE IN BUBBAVILLE WE GET THE

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.260 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE IN THE
BUBBLES BECAUSE ALL THE

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:37.330 size:84% position:42% line:91%
TELEVISION SHOWS AND MOVIES
ARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.197 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUBBLES.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DON'T. NO, YOU DON'T
GET US.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:39.966 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SIX AND A HALF YEARS --
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DON'T GET US.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.167 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE COME TO NEW YORK AND I

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.503 size:88% position:44% line:91%
HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE ATTITUDES AND LIFESTYLES

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.837 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND CULTURE.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.205 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IT'S NOT THAT ONE IS BETTER.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:46.939 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, IT IS.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.641 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF IT IS-- .

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.076 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU BELIEVE ONE IS
BETTER.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE
BUBBAVILLE.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:51.778 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE'S, HERE'S WHAT I
BELIEVE --

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.845 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LET ME TAKE THAT POINT ABOUT
THE -

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:56.449 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THIS FEELS
LIKE IT'S A CONTRIVED -- THERE

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:57.583 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS NO REAL BUBBLEVILLE AND
BUBBAVILLE. THERE'S, THERE'S --

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:02.588 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, I WOULD SAY-- AU
CONTRAIRE, TO QUOTE JOHN KERRY.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.325 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW, YOU REALLY HAVE
LIVED IN NEW YORK.

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.358 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)
