00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.150
So, we just saw what an outsourcing
conversation might look

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.300
like when it includes the entrepreneur,
a designer, and a developer.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:11.230
I want to pull out a couple of parts of
that conversation for us to focus on.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.780
The first is a tendency
towards scope creep.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.620
Scope creep is whenever
the first version of your app

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.840
isn't the minimum viable product.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.730
Scope creep is bad.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.710
It gets in the way of launching and
iterating, which means that you're

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.270
spending a lot more time building
things than building the right things.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.890
As an entrepreneur,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.170
you have to make sure that your
team isn't introducing scope creep.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.310
But you also have to make sure that
you aren't introducing scope creep.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.010
Scope creep affects both time and
budget.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.460
In the consultation we just saw,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.930
Carl did a very good job of
managing the scope creep.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.030
And he was the one who suggested
that we pare down our V1 of the app.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.540
In real life, that job will fall on you.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.390
This idea of scope creep is especially
noticeable in the poll between

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.200
the developer and the designer,
James wanted to spend some time at first

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.230
working on the overview page,
making it gorgeous.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.680
Carl noted that was actually a waste of
time for this minimum viable product.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.390
Another tension you may experience, is a
designer wanting to build things custom

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.720
without thinking about how long it
will actually take to build them.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.810
As an entrepreneur,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.904
you need to be balancing budget with
the time spent by your contractors.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.590
A good rule of thumb is to
launch your minimum viable

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.930
product without anything custom or
fancy if you can avoid it.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170
Once your app has started
getting feedback from customers,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.060
you can make it as fancy and
beautiful as your designer wants.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270
Until then,
stick to the default components.
