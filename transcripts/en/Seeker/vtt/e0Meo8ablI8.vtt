00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.310
A submarine that can dive through Titan’s
methane seas.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.790
A celestial hopper that can harvest frozen
nitrogen as propellant.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.360
These are the types of futuristic spacecraft
that could explore distant worlds for us.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.310
But while they look straight from science
fiction, there’s actually an in-house conceptual

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.530
design team at NASA behind them.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.530
I'm Steve Oleson.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.970
I run the NASA COMPASS team.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.530
COMPASS was begun in 2006 during the Constellation
program.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.830
We put the team together to basically design
lunar landers.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.460
How do you get people down to the surface?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.710
How do you do it efficiently?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.690
While the Constellation program was cancelled
by the Obama Administration, word got out

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.280
about COMPASS’s expertise.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.430
This team can deliver a new spacecraft design
and scope the costs in just two weeks.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.800
And it all starts with a wild idea.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.750
A new technologist will bring their new power
system to us and say, "Here's a reactor.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.160
I want to put it on the moon.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.160
How would I package it?

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160
How would I land it?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.160
How would I operate it?"

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.969
To us, every new environment, every new place
to go requires a new vehicle.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.509
These vehicles, a lot of times, they are spacecraft,
but there's other times, they're rovers and

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:08.509
submarines.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.640
It's always something new, but we do about
16 designs a year.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.869
Our mantra is, "Base it on physics."

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.189
There could be technologies that needed to
be developed.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.930
We try to infuse those into our designs, but
it's still something that is based on physics.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.579
There are so many different spheres of expertise
that go into designing a new spacecraft — like

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.799
propulsion, materials, software — and they’re
all woven in simultaneously during the development

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.049
process.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.859
Imagine something flying through space has
to have obviously a structure to it.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:38.859
It's going to need power.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.829
You may be able to talk to it, right?

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.170
You have the science instruments that gather
data, so you got to send back the data with

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.219
a communication system.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.899
We have to have some kind of radiator, so
the thermal systems keep us at the right temperature,

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.450
so that things don't get too hot, things don't
get too cold.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.000
Of course, propulsion to get us to stop or
start or go wherever we want to go.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.729
Finally, trajectories — so how do we get
to there and get back again?

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.380
Ultimately though, we want to lay this whole
thing out, so we have a computer configuration.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.319
They look really great, and they could be
feasible, but will it cost too much?

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.069
Is this something that's affordable for this
approach?

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.920
We have people on the team to do all those
things.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.930
To get all of these team members to work together,
they really need to think outside the box.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.280
We do need them to know what the box is that
they're trying to get out of, but communication

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.599
is really the key.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.770
I'm like the game show host.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.319
One of my biggest roles is getting new creativity
out of people.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.739
We often combine electric propulsion with
chemical propulsion, which one would think,

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.739
those are at odds with each other.

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.730
But it turns out, chemical propulsion is really
great when you're near a planetary body.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.810
Electric propulsion is fantastic in deep space.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.920
The technologies were already there, but how
do you combine those together in a new way?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.640
That's the creativity.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.549
With all of these emerging discoveries, NASA’s
problem isn’t trying to find places to go,

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.310
it’s figuring out which place to go first.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.310
Titan is a wonderful place.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.200
It has a very thick atmosphere.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.620
Except for the temperature, if I put you on
Titan in a spacesuit, you could put on some

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.650
wings, and you could flap around and fly,
because the gravity is so low, and the atmosphere

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.970
is so dense…. you can splash down in the
sea and become a submarine.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.019
So where do you even start when you have to
conceptualize a submarine to float 1.27 billion

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.829
kilometers away on one of Saturn’s Moon.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.310
The biggest challenge with the submarine was
communications and basic going up and down.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.389
A boat just has to float, so we did ballast
systems.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.590
The other big question was communications.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.209
It turns out that the liquid methane is actually
radio transparent.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.859
Technically, if you have an orbiter above
you, you can sit on the bottom, a kilometer

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.829
deep, and talk through all that liquid methane.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.120
It's those fascinating things to us.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.879
It looks like a regular submarine, but we've
got a lot of different things, because the

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.969
environment, the physics are so different
on that moon.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.389
Compass’s spacecraft designs are based off
of the limited data we have so far of these

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:08.829
worlds, and hopefully they’ll advance our
understanding even further.

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.889
There's Europa with the 20 kilometers of ice
and what could be below in the ocean.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.199
We've designed a tunnel bot that would actually
dig through there using a reactor to melt

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.199
its way through.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.810
For the Venus land-sailing rover, we basically
came up with a design that has a wing that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.720
you would just turn, and you would sail in
the direction you want.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.180
Again, the high temperature electronics are
key to making that thing work.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.660
Venus is a scorching 465 degrees Celsius,
enough to melt most commercial electronics.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.270
To get this land sail to cruise, a team of
scientists are working on new integrated circuits

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.210
that can withstand those high temps.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.890
It's still in the conceptual design phases….You
need to demonstrate the high temperature in

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.550
electronics first, and that's what we're doing
with some demonstrations, working that now.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.620
Once you get those, now you can start to explore.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.280
Because Compass has to dream up the impossible,
it pushes other teams to invent new technologies

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.460
that would power future missions.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.530
And that has major benefits for us here on
Earth.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.669
A lot of things we've done have not flown
yet, because it takes time.

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.130
One of the greatest things that we did was
this thing called Fetch, which basically was

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.319
going to grab an asteroid, and we're talking
something in, roughly, 10 meters diameter,

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.710
actually grab that with this bag and use electric
propulsion to push it back.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.520
This is one of the neatest things I think
we've done, because this is completely out-of-the-box.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.000
Can you actually grab an asteroid and move
it back?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.639
This project was part of Obama's Asteroid
Retrieval Mission, which pledged to send astronauts

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.470
to an asteroid by 2025.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.509
That mission was cancelled by Trump in 2017.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.630
We have a joke here at NASA, that every solar
cycle or 11 years or so, we switch from going

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.910
to Mars to the moon, and that's really what's
happened.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.910
Bush said, "We're going back to the moon."

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.379
Then, of course, Obama came in and said, "We're
going to grab the asteroid, go to that."

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.379
Now, Trump is here.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.390
Instead of grabbing the asteroid now, we're
going to basically send a crew to orbit the

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.390
moon.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.830
The same vehicle that we came up with in 2012
is now the power propulsion element for the

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.830
Gateway.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.800
A lot of things evolved, and a one-week study
evolved into now the power system and propulsion

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.650
system for what the astronauts are going to
ride on.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.919
At the heart of all of these designs, the
COMPASS team enjoys the challenge.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.750
They’re taking futuristic, sci-fi designs
and making them real.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.290
Science fiction has led the way in a lot of
space exploration just with being able to

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.290
think out-of-the-box.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.650
In fact, we have discussions on whether they're
a Star Wars fan or a Star Trek fan, right?

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.770
We all love those genres.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.240
We grew up on them.Seeing science fiction
in the movies, reading the books, gives you

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.889
that mindset that anything is possible, and
that there are new worlds out there.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:51.880
The COMPASS team is developing new concepts,
so the public can get a better window on all

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.699
these things, see these new, fascinating things
and maybe get a little better understanding

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.680
of maybe how unique we are or how unique we
aren't.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.370
