00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.995
Let's look at a more complicated case of powers of powers. Here, I don't just

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:10.774
have one base, I have two I'm multiplying 4 cubed and 3 squared. And this

00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:15.514
quantity will be raised to the 4th power. If I want to simplify this problem and

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:20.123
in particular the exponents, I would need to rewrite this. First, I write 4

00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:24.560
cubed times 3 squared four times, that would be this. Notice that I have

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.980
multiplication between every single term, so this is really just a product of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.583
factors, and I don't need to list the parenthesis. We can rearrange the product

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:37.459
of our factors and I can group the 4 cubes together and the 3 squared's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:41.892
together. If I expanded all this out I would have 12 4s and 8 3s. So I know my

00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:46.001
final answer is 4 to the 12th times 3 to the 8th. So I know my final answer

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:50.259
would be 4 to the 12th and 3 to the 8th. Again, I don't want to have to list all

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:54.588
these factors out when I'm doing this work. There must be a shorter way. If I

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:59.052
look at how these exponents changed, what did I really do? Well it turns out

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:03.392
that I distributed this exponent of four to each of the factors 4 cubed and 3

00:01:03.392 --> 00:01:08.311
squared. So I have 4 to the 3rd raised to the 4th power and 3 squared raised to

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.704
the 4th power. Now we just apply the rule that we learned before. When we raise

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:17.263
a power to a power, we multiply the exponents together. So I get 4 to the 12th

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:19.242
and 3 to the 8th. Pretty neat.
