[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:13.100
JASON SILVA: So
for human beings,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.740
existential angst
stems from the fact

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.100
that we are
creatures of meaning.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.070
We are creatures of purpose.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.710
We are creatures of myth.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.410
We want to feel like
there is a destiny to our

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.595
like there is reason
why we're here.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:32.530
And we've tried to address
this existential itch,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.280
this agitation, through the
creation of beautiful stories,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.190
beautiful myths.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.640
We've created narrative threads,
religions, systems of thought

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.104
that have placed the body
mind in a larger context

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.270
that have made us feel like
we are part of something

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.870
greater than ourselves.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.230
This is hugely important.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.790
But what are we?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.535
Well, ultimately, when
you break it down,

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:56.800
when you shatter the myths,
what are we left with?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.960
And I read a great quote
recently that said,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.160
that actually,
"we are dead stars

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.180
looking back at ourselves."

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.340
And when you consider,
we look upon the heavens,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.770
we have the Hubble Space
Telescope blasting new tunnels

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.720
between the mind,
and the other--

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.205
as Ross Andersen says
-- and we back right,

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.686
and we are the remnants
of those stars that died.

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:19.560
The periodic table of
the elements, all of it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.960
was manufactured in
the furnaces of stars.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.040
So we are dead stars
looking back at ourselves.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.850
I mean, this idea
is just astonishing.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.930
We are poetry.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.695
We are cosmic poetry.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.330
And if that's not
enough of a story

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
to help you get
up in the morning,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.860
then I don't what it is.
