( intro music )

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.543 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.281
Wow...

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.883
Welcome everyone.
It's great to be here.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:21.354 line:0%
Now, there's one thing
that we know for sure

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.390 line:0%
that nature is good for us.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.893
<i> We've known this
 for millennia.</i>

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:30.096
<i> 2000 years ago Daoist monks
 wrote about</i>

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.598
<i> the healing powers of
 working in greenhouses</i>

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:34.400
<i> and tending gardens.</i>

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.403
<i> And in 1984 E. O. Wilson</i>

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.573
<i> wrote about
 our deep, primal need</i>

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.909
<i> to affiliate with nature
 in the natural world,</i>

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.279
<i> and coined the term
 "Biophilia".</i>

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:50.683
This concept of biophilia
is becoming ever more urgent

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:54.987
as we consume the
biodiversity around us,

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.822
and separate ourselves

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:59.225
more and more
from the natural world.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.728
As of 2010,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.431
we have officially become
an urban species.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.201
<i> More of us live in cities
 than don't.</i>

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.504
<i> And that is a trend that is
 continuing and accelerating.</i>

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:15.040
<i> It has progressively
 drawn us inside,</i>

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.176
<i> away from the natural world.</i>

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:21.046
<i> And now the average
 North American and European</i>

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:24.684
<i> spends 90 percent
 of their time indoors.</i>

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.653
That remaining 10 percent,
well...

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.356
<i> five of that is spent in a car</i>

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.758
( audience laughter )

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.892
<i> if not more.</i>

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.928
<i> I hear some commuters
 laughing in the audience.</i>

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:38.064
<i> This is...
 this is an environment</i>

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.300
<i> very different from
 our ancestral origins.</i>

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.035
And it's a relatively
modern thing.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.404
So, how has this radical shift

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:49.275
in lifestyle affected
our minds and body?

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.078
Well, there are
a slew of studies

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.280
chronicling the
modern ailments

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.048
that go along with
the separation

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.416
from the natural world.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:02:01.387
And there are...
physical as well as mental

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.755
<i> and some of these include</i>

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.724
<i> spreading epidemic of myopia.</i>

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.260
<i> If you don't get enough
 sunlight on your eyeballs</i>

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.829
<i> they grow longer
 and we get myopia.</i>

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.833
<i> We have rising levels
 of obesity and diabetes,</i>

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.935
<i> cardiovascular diseases
 correlated with</i>

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.737
<i> a lack of nature exposure,</i>

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.906
<i> and all sorts of
 behavioral disorders.</i>

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.975
<i> Depression is rampant.</i>

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:27.613
So, what is going on
and how can nature help?

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:30.283
Well, nature is...

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.186
nature is a
complicated therapy.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.556
<i> It's not only rich in visuals,</i>

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.859
<i> it's multi-sensorial.</i>

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.063
<i> You have incredible sounds
 and tastes</i>

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:49.402
<i>and textures, interrelationships
 and processes...</i>

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:53.506
It's...
it's a complex therapy.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.375
How do you figure out
what's doing what?

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:58.944
Well, you can
start to look at it

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:01.881
by breaking it into
its component parts.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.149
And, let's say visuals.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.453
Now,
I'm a marine biologist and

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:12.124
<i> I've spent many, many hours
 studying this crazy fish,</i>

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:14.994
<i> the Giant Ocean Sunfish
 and other large animals.</i>

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.796
<i> And I love being immersed
 in nature.</i>

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:21.167
<i> I find it completely
 exhilarating and rejuvenating.</i>

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.769
<i> But what I find
 particularly interesting,</i>

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.008
<i> as well, is that just
 looking at nature imagery</i>

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:33.112
<i> does something powerful
 to our brains and bodies.</i>

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.514
There's something going on
there, we're not in nature

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:38.785
we're looking at it.
So, what's that mechanism?

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:42.989
Well, Roger... Robert Ulrich

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.291
was the first
to really formally

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.560
write about this and
publish a scientific study

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.330
in 1984 in<i> Science</i> ,
in the journal<i> Science</i> .

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.566
And he found
that recovering patients from

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.369
<i> gall-bladder surgery
 who had windows</i>

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.304
<i> that looked out on trees</i>

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.607
<i> had a faster recovery rate,
 upwards of a day faster.</i>

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.877
<i> And requested fewer
 strong pain medication</i>

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.278
<i> than those patients
 whose windows</i>

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:08.013
<i> look out on a brick wall.</i>

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.016
<i> And since those studies
 many have followed suit</i>

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.919
<i> and found similar things.</i>

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.588
<i> There's a number of theories
 that have been put forth to</i>

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.124
<i> describe and explain
 what's going on</i>

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.093
<i> and one of the prevailing
 theories is put forth by</i>

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:24.163
<i> Rachel and Stephen Kaplan,
 of the University of Michigan,</i>

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.766
<i> that's called "Attention
 Restoration Theory".</i>

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.901
You have your
directed attention,

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.705
your voluntary attention and
your involuntary attention.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:36.475
And nature, it has
our involuntary attention.

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:39.145
<i> It draws us in
 with this kind of,</i>

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:42.180
<i> what psychologists call
 a "soft fascination",</i>

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.683
<i> that doesn't take much effort.</i>

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.419
<i> You look at the
 clouds overhead,</i>

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.921
<i> you look at the wind
 rustling the leaves</i>

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:52.058
<i> and your attention is drawn
 but it's not taxing you.</i>

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.227
<i> As opposed to directed
 attention where you're...</i>

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:56.896
if you're driving,
you have to,

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:59.164
you know,
stay focused on these things.

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:02.168
And nature is
restorative in this way.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.702
So, that's one of
the prevailing theories,

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:05.805
and there's lots of
different ones as well.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.006
And there's ways
of testing this.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:08.674
You can take...

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:12.244
take bits of saliva
and look for cortisol,

00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:14.680
which is a measure
of stress levels,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.715
you can put on
galvanic skin sensors,

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:18.784
you can put on
heart rate monitors.

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:22.221
But what if you could
crawl right inside the mind.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.357
Now wouldn't that be cool?

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.226
So, that's what
we're looking at now

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:31.097
and I'm coining-- I'm calling
this neuro-biophilia.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:34.433
<i> The science of how
 nature engages the brain.</i>

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.702
<i> And this is a sub-discipline</i>

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:40.673
<i> It joins other sub-disciplines
 that are looking at the brain</i>

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:43.309
<i> and how the brain responds
 to our environments.</i>

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.345
<i> And they include things
 such as neuro-cinematics,</i>

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.146
<i> the brain on movies.</i>

00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:50.315
<i> There's also neuro-aesthetics,</i>

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:52.584
<i> the brain on beauty and art.</i>

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:54.420
<i> And what I find
 really exciting</i>

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.888
<i> about these
 sub-disciplines is that</i>

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.957
<i> they're highly
 interdisciplinary.</i>

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.493
They're drawing from
all sorts of different venues,

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.428
all sorts of
different disciplines,

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:06.465
from social science to
evolutionary psychology to...

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.401
to computer science,

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.671
artificial intelligence,
landscape architecture,

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:14.373
color theory and
they're pulling it all together

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.775
to make sense of what's
going on in the brain.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:21.146
<i> We have our toes on the shores
 of this vast cerebral sea</i>

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:23.148
<i> and it's such an exciting time</i>

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:26.151
<i> to have these tools available
 for these explorations.</i>

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:28.820
And to continue our
adventure into the brain,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.323
I'm going to hand off to Tan.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.057
So, thanks for listening.

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:34.694
( applause )

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:43.235
Thank you, Tierney.
And, good evening everyone.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:46.204 line:0%
You know I spend
most of my day

00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:48.374 line:0%
in front of a computer screen.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.677 line:0%
I basically do
a lot of reading,

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:54.213
I look at a lot of numbers,

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:55.948
measurements and
I coordinate people

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:59.652
because I've spent the
last ten years of my life

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.920
working to develop
new technologies

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.690
that allow us to study brains.

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:09.428
You know, this amazing
and yet enigmatic space

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.130
<i> inside our head.</i>

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.231
<i> And as we go through life,</i>

00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:17.002
<i> our brain actually undergoes
 extraordinary development.</i>

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:20.205
It's the most adaptive
organ in our body.

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:25.310
And it can change both
positively and negatively,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.181
by our thoughts,
actions and experiences.

00:07:29.848 --> 00:07:33.652
And we know,
as neuroscientists that

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:37.089
nature has a restorative
effect on the brain.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:39.925
And the way in which
most of these experiments

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.361
are conducted is based on

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.665
giving people a
sustained attention task

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:49.034
that drains and fatigues
your attentional networks.

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:52.304
And then you're asked
to spend about 30 minutes or--

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:54.440
in nature or in
an urban setting

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.176
and then you're brought
back into the same place

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.478
and asked to do
the same test again.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.646
And you're measured
to see your performance,

00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:03.382
which one did you do better in.

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.484
And whilst that's
a really good way to

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:07.920
observe the effects of
the beneficial effects

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.488
of nature on the brain,

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:11.890
it's not quite the
same as being able to

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.094
measure and quantify exactly

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:18.297
what is going on
in the brain itself.

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.832
And that's the question

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.067
that the three of
us wanted to answer.

00:08:22.067 --> 00:08:25.837
We wanted to actually
measure and quantify exactly

00:08:25.837 --> 00:08:28.074
<i> what is going on in my brain</i>

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:32.445
<i> when I experience those
 amazing imagery of nature.</i>

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:36.015
And, so one of the things that
really excites me the most

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.650
about brain research
in the last decade

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.787
is that we have moved
beyond psychology,

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.488
psychiatry and neurology

00:08:43.488 --> 00:08:45.790
and we've merged
with other disciplines.

00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:49.895
Statistical analysis,
artificial intelligence,

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:52.264
machine learning,
even, you know,

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:55.267
material sciences,
information technology

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:57.069
with advances in technology

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.971
contributing to ever better,

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:02.207
faster and smarter
devices and techniques.

00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:04.009
One of the things
that we're trying to do

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:05.644
is to really push
the boundaries of

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:07.980
the latest in science
and technology

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.617
to enable these portable
electroencephalogram systems

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.085
to open a new window on the

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.787
complex functioning
of our brain.

00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:18.791
And, I wanted to
take a few moments

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.459
to share with you
and really show you

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:23.495
an insight into what my brain

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:25.798
actually looks like
in real-time.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.000
So, if we switch over,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.302
there you are. So, this is,

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:33.506
this device is picking
up my brain activity right now

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:35.841
and transmitting
it to a computer.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.177
<i> And, so what you're
 able to see is</i>

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.245
<i> a data visualization tool</i>

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:41.947
<i> that localizes the activity</i>

00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:43.582
<i> in different
 functional brain areas.</i>

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:46.619
<i> So, when you see the frontal
 part of my brain light up,</i>

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.953
<i> the frontal lobes
 are responsible</i>

00:09:47.953 --> 00:09:49.688
<i> for executive function,</i>

00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:53.058
<i> conscious thoughts,
 movements, attention,</i>

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:55.694
<i> planning, language, logic.</i>

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:57.596
<i> The side of my brains,</i>

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.664
<i> the temporal lobes
 are responsible for</i>

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:02.968
<i> processing auditory
 responses, memory.</i>

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:04.269
<i> And the back of my brain,</i>

00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:05.971
<i> when you see
 that part light up</i>

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:08.073
<i> the parietal and
 occipital lobes,</i>

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:10.976
<i> that's actually responsible
 for sensory integration</i>

00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:12.544
<i> and visual processing.</i>

00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:14.279
And so through tools like this

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.748
we can actually have a window

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:18.417
into what's going on in
real-time,

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:20.218
and that allows us to

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:23.622
really start to piece together
the beneficial effects

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:25.257
of nature on the brain,

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:27.860
in a way that we haven't
really been able to...

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.661
to see in the past.

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.164
And, so with that
I am going to pass on to

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.767
Nalini to end our...

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:38.237
( applause )

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:44.576
Well, that's great.

00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:47.479
I can't believe I just saw
my colleague's brain going on

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:48.880
but that was fantastic.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.015 line:0%
And really that's the
wonderful thing

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:52.351 line:0%
about a collaboration
like ours.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.853 line:0%
There's so much sharing
and learning that goes on,

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:56.255
I've learned, for example,

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.523
<i> that the different
 parts of a neuron,</i>

00:10:58.523 --> 00:11:00.059
<i> a single neuron,
 one of billions</i>

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.359
<i> that occur in our brain,</i>

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:03.461
<i> they function
 in a way to connect</i>

00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:05.664
<i> the thoughts and the actions</i>

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.766
<i> and the knowledge that we have</i>

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:10.903
<i> within our bodies and outside,
 outside our worlds.</i>

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.904
And I'd like to share
with my colleagues

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:14.806
anything I can
tell them about trees

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:16.508
because that's what I study.

00:11:16.508 --> 00:11:19.044
<i> And I have been studying
 forest trees for many years.</i>

00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:20.579
<i> I study in the forest canopy.</i>

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.114
<i> I started 35 years ago</i>

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.849
<i> and that was a time
 when we were pioneers</i>

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.283
<i> in the forest canopy,</i>

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:27.086
<i> where very few
 people had ascended.</i>

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.489
<i> Well, the beautiful tapestry
 of the intact forest canopy</i>

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:33.258
<i> is being destroyed
 by many human activities.</i>

00:11:33.258 --> 00:11:35.261
<i> And I became very
 concerned about this.</i>

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.629
The disturbances
of deforestation,

00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:39.131
of forest fragmentation,

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:42.401
of conversion of primary
forest to agricultural land.

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:45.371
<i> Another environmental problem
 that I became very interested</i>

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:49.174
<i> in is the harvesting of
 canopy dwelling mosses</i>

00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:50.842
<i> for the horticulture trade.</i>

00:11:50.842 --> 00:11:53.478
<i> This is a 300-million
 dollar business.</i>

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:55.848
And it wouldn't sound
so bad unless you realize that

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:58.917
it takes 30 years,
20 to 30 years

00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:00.218
for these mosses to grow back

00:12:00.218 --> 00:12:01.486
after they've been
stripped off

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.656
of old growth forest trees.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:04.957
And as a scientist,

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:07.292
I felt that maybe I could
do something about this

00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:08.827
environmental problem
and I realized

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:10.896
I couldn't stop the
collecting of mosses,

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.732
but perhaps I could learn
how to farm these mosses,

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:16.468
in order to bring down
the harvesting pressure

00:12:16.468 --> 00:12:18.670
in these beautiful
old growth systems.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.673
And it also seemed to me
that I needed help to do this

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.274
And it also seemed
to me that perhaps

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:24.876
people who didn't have access,

00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:27.045
people who don't
have access to nature

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:28.413
or to these beautiful mosses

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:30.649
and this incredible
temperate rainforest

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.985
might be the best
possible partners.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.220
<i> And so I started
 a program in 2005</i>

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.222
<i> to enlist the
 help of prisoners,</i>

00:12:37.222 --> 00:12:38.924
<i> of incarcerated men and women</i>

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.592
<i> to help me learn
 how to grow mosses</i>

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:42.261
<i> for the horticulture trade.</i>

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.797
<i> They have time,
 many of them have space,</i>

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:47.065
<i> you don't need sharp
 tools to grow mosses.</i>

00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:49.868
<i> And so in fact this turned out
 to be a fabulous project.</i>

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:52.238
The incarcerated men and women

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.272
enjoyed this project
and got something out of it

00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:56.008
because they found
that they were contributing

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.843
to something larger
than themselves,

00:12:57.843 --> 00:12:59.078
something larger
than the prison

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.880
in which they
were incarcerated.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.514
Something as large
as planet Earth,

00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:05.283
because they were
helping to reduce...

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:09.154
collecting pressure of
these old growth ecosystems.

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:10.823
And the supervisors
and superintendent

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:13.224
loved this project because
the men were occupied.

00:13:13.224 --> 00:13:15.260
They were having better
social interactions.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.963
Violent infractions
started going down.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:20.265
<i> And so they asked me
 to organize more projects.</i>

00:13:20.265 --> 00:13:21.866
<i> I started a science
 lecture series</i>

00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:23.902
<i> in this prison that
 spread to others.</i>

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:25.236
<i> And from those lecture series</i>

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:26.805
<i> became the inspiration
 for starting some</i>

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:28.607
<i> conservation projects.</i>

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:31.143
<i> These involved growing
 endangered species,</i>

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:33.979
<i> prairie plants,
 the Oregon spotted frog,</i>

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.980
<i> the Taylor checkerspot
 butterfly</i>

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.516
<i> by the inmates behind bars.</i>

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.117
When these animals
and plants were produced,

00:13:39.117 --> 00:13:40.619
they were taken by our

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.487
collaborating conservation
groups

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:45.558
and used for restoration
projects in Washington state.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.494
This was really
a win-win situation

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.529
for the men and women
that we were able to bring

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.632
these projects to
but I very soon realized

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.467
that I was missing
people in the prison,

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:56.835
in terms of people
who could be

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.737
involved with these projects.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.538
That is, I was missing
the men and women

00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:02.607
who were incarcerated far deep

00:14:02.607 --> 00:14:05.477
in the bowels of the prison
system of the United States,

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:07.913
those that live in
solitary confinement.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.614
<i> Over 30,000,</i>

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:12.551
<i> some estimate it up as high
 as 80,000 men and women</i>

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.686
<i> are incarcerated
 in solitary confinement</i>

00:14:14.686 --> 00:14:15.921
<i> in the United States.</i>

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.822
<i> This is a cell, 9 by 12.</i>

00:14:17.822 --> 00:14:20.525
<i> All you can see is very
 bare of really anything.</i>

00:14:20.525 --> 00:14:23.361
<i> They're incarcerated in
 this cell for 23 hours a day.</i>

00:14:23.361 --> 00:14:25.063
<i> Their meals are
 brought to them.</i>

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:28.333
<i> And one hour a day, they
 are brought out by two guards</i>

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.337
<i> to their exercise rooms or
 their recreational space,</i>

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.305
<i> which again is
 a very bare room</i>

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.774
<i> with very little
 in terms of stimulation,</i>

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:38.944
<i> and absolutely no
 exposure to nature at all.</i>

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:40.579
And it seemed
to me that maybe,

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:42.881
although we couldn't
bring in frogs and butterflies

00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.249
and soil and plants,

00:14:44.249 --> 00:14:46.518
that we might be able
to bring nature imagery

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:47.586
to these exercise cells.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.587
So that for at
least one hour a day

00:14:49.587 --> 00:14:51.756
they would be exposed
to some element

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:54.326
of nature and nature imagery.

00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:56.928
<i> We started this out at the
 invitation of a wonderful,</i>

00:14:56.928 --> 00:14:58.997
<i> oh, well, I don't know if I
 can say wonderful prison,</i>

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:01.900
<i> but in any case, a prison
 where wonderful people work,</i>

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.236
<i> the Snake River
 Correctional Institution</i>

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.904
<i> in Ontario, Oregon.</i>

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.907
<i> They installed a
 projector in one of the</i>

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.409
<i> exercise rooms in one
 of the cellblocks there.</i>

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.411
They were able to gather
natural history films

00:15:13.411 --> 00:15:16.014
from the web and
various other places.

00:15:16.014 --> 00:15:18.150
And so, right now

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.952
<i> the men who are
 in solitary confinement</i>

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:22.253
<i> can ask to see
 one of the films</i>

00:15:22.253 --> 00:15:24.256
<i> when they go into
 their exercise room.</i>

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.658
<i> And there they can
 choose one of the 30 films</i>

00:15:26.658 --> 00:15:28.961
<i> that has been made
 available to them.</i>

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.795
<i> And then they're
 able to watch that film</i>

00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:32.363
<i> and for that one hour a day</i>

00:15:32.363 --> 00:15:34.299
<i> they're being exposed
 to nature imagery.</i>

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:35.834
We have some
anecdotal information

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.702
that this has
been very positive,

00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:40.405
in terms of bringing
down stress and anxiety

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:41.874
but we have to do more work

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.274
in terms of understanding

00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:45.244
how this might become
an intervention.

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:47.579
We need to understand
the real impacts of this

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.681
on the attitudes
and the behavior

00:15:49.681 --> 00:15:51.650
of the inmates that
are exposed to it.

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:53.952
We also recognize
that it's not just

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.921
the incarcerated men
and women who are exposed

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:58.590
to this nature
deficit situation.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.858
<i> It's also the staff,</i>

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:02.460
<i> the officers and the people
 who work in this environment</i>

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.830
<i> that undergo what
 they call decomposition</i>

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.900
<i> of physical, emotional and
 psychological behavior,</i>

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.502
<i> as they're removed from
 nature and nature imagery.</i>

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:14.038
This is true not only in
solitary confinement prisons

00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:16.274
but increasingly
as Tierney pointed out,

00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:17.609
<i> in our own society.</i>

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.311
<i> People who work
 in windowless offices</i>

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.213
<i> in cubicles like this,</i>

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:23.281
<i> people who have
 jobs in tollbooths,</i>

00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:25.116
<i> people who work
 in military barracks.</i>

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:26.952
My own mom who's 91 years old

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:29.287
and is in a senior
assisted living center

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:30.822
in Rockville, Maryland here

00:16:30.822 --> 00:16:32.691
has very little
in the way of interaction

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.459
with nature or
nature imagery.

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:36.728
So, I think there's
tremendous potential

00:16:36.728 --> 00:16:38.230
to think about the things that

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.265
Tierney and Tan
have talked about

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.334
and the kind of things
that we'd like to do,

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.736
to eventually
apply what we know

00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:46.872
to the kinds of
populations that we will be

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:50.609
a part of increasingly
as time goes forward.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.812
I think that our collaboration

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.581
has allowed us
to just sort of,

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.882
as Tierney said,

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.350
"put our toes into
the first little waves

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.621
of understanding
humans and the brain."

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:03.922
But I'd like to
just share with you

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:06.425
three of the
beginning conclusions

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.160
that we have come
up with so far.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.994
First of all,

00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:11.362
we've come to understand that

00:17:11.362 --> 00:17:13.899
if we want to understand
nature and the brain

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.834
we must use both
the cognitive sides

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.902
of our ability to understand

00:17:17.902 --> 00:17:20.038
as well as the emotional side.

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:21.340
Both of those are intertwined,

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.442
if we're to understand
nature and the brain.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.378
Secondly,
we need to collaborate.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:29.047
It's great to have this
threesome of colleagues,

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:31.816
but there are other fields
that must be drawn into this.

00:17:31.816 --> 00:17:34.552
Neuroscience, ecopsychology,

00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:37.055
sociology, all of these fields

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.324
must come together
and touch in points

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:42.360
where we can make contact
and help each other understand

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.863
this complexity of
nature and the brain.

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.732
And the third concluding idea

00:17:47.732 --> 00:17:50.903
that we've come up with as
a result of our collaboration...

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.606
is that nature is necessary

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:57.843
for human social resilience,

00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:01.780
that is, nature is
needed by everyone.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.648
Thank you.

00:18:03.648 --> 00:18:05.851
( applause )

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.253
