Now for a slightly trickier one--what is α in this drawing?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here we have a right triangle--I do need two side lengths--4 and 7,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I want to know what is α.

00:00:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here in degrees with two decimal places.
