00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt;Brian: Hello everybody. Thank you so much
for coming and having a chat with Ben Dattner.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.860
I am really happy and proud to introduce him.
Back in 1995, he and I were two of the four

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.260
incoming excited students at NYU's IO Psychology,
Industrial Organizational Psychology PhD program.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.300
So we've known each other for a very long
time.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.599
And I remember for as long as I've known Ben,
he's been interested in how we warp reality

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.150
to meet our needs. And I remember your dissertation
was actually on narcissists and whether narcissists

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.240
have a different perception of what they do
and whether it's perceived as fairer than

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.410
the people who report up into a narcissist.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.070
So actually I wasn't surprised when I heard
about this book, which is "The Blame Game,"

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.820
all about how we assign credit and dole out
blame for the things that happen in the workplace.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.510
So, very eager to hear what you have to say,
Ben. And welcome to Google.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.460
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: Thank you.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.460
[applause]

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.720
Thank you very much. And for anybody who is
curious, Brian's dissertation was about nepotism

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.560
and we used to joke about what is the term?
Is it a nepot for a man and a nepata for a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.150
woman? We never actually came to a consensus.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.180
So thank you for coming. I'm very happy to
be here. I credit Google for my ability to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.490
write this book, because my co-author and
I, Darren Dahl, used Google every day for

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.640
everything that we did when it came to the
book, whether it was hunting down an article,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.970
whether it was hunting down research, whether
it was looking for famous people, whatever

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.970
it may be.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.170
Famous stories, we used Google all the time.
And it is interesting in today's world, who

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.420
gets credit and blame for things. I'm sure
you're all thinking about news and news aggregation

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.380
and what's paid for and what's free, what's
linked to, what makes your profile higher,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370
or lower, on Google and what that means.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.310
So we'll be thinking about that as we move
forward. So as Brian mentioned, I'm an organizational

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.250
psychologist, as is he. I'm very impressed
by the work that you guys are doing here when

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.110
it comes to people analytics. And luckily,
Google is an organization that already has

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.720
in mind the kinds of errors and biases people
make.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.530
When it comes to assessing performance, there
was that great New York Times article a couple

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.730
weeks ago about people analytics at Google
and how you're given cues when you, for example,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.670
fill out a performance appraisal form. Keep
in mind the recency effect, the primacy effect,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.819
the halo effect. So this is an organization
that already has those things in mind.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.660
So why credit and blame? Why did I write this
book? Well, as I work as an organizational

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.540
psychologist, I work with individuals and
teams in organizations large and small, for

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.990
profit and not-for-profit in the US and abroad.
And what I find is regardless of what I'm

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.850
doing, whether it's working with an individual,
doing conflict resolution between two individuals,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.440
facilitating the work of a team, or facilitating
the work between teams, credit and blame is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.140
where everybody's energy is.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.430
Who's being credited? Who's being blamed?
Is it fair? Is it not fair? Is it accurate?

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.210
Is it not accurate? Is it helpful, or is it
not helpful? And in the work that I do, I'm

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:29.730
not able to be helpful to an individual pair
of people, team, or organization without challenging

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.530
notions of credit and blame-- the narratives
of credit and blame.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.330
Who's getting the credit? Who's getting the
blame? Because of our hardwiring as a species,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.921
because of each of our individual early-life
experiences, it's very rare that we credit

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:50.081
people for the same reasons at the same time
in the same way. Each of us comes to work

00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:55.959
each day with the legacy of our own families,
our own culture, our own gender, and that

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.610
impacts how we credit and blame ourselves
and others.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.120
And the book is really about how credit and
blame is not just an effect of organizational

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.660
behavior. It's actually a cause of organizational
behavior. So it's not that organizational

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.150
triumph or tragedy happens and then credit
and blame result. What the book does is it

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.870
flips it around and says, "What about the
patterns of credit and blame that set the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.590
groundwork that lay the foundation, for success
or failure?"

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.491
Hence, the subtitle of the book, "How the
rules of credit and blame determine our success

00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:37.340
or failure." So, the book starts out by looking
at why blame is so important. And it works

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.320
at every level of analysis. So, an individual
in his or her career is going to be thinking,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.300
"How much credit do I deserve for my accomplishments
on a team?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.680
How much blame do I deserve when things go
wrong?" And even starting there, people then

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.290
to take and claim more credit for themselves
in their own contributions and accomplishments

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.560
than others would give them. So if you ask
members of a team, for example, what proportion

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.160
of the team's accomplishments or results were
you personally responsible for?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.290
If you ask ten people on the team, they'll
each say, "About 20 percent, 30 percent, 40

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.270
percent, 80 percent." Whatever it may be.
And if you add up those numbers, it'll add

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.600
up to far more than a hundred percent. It's
a little bit like the fictional shares in

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.930
the Broadway show in the movie of "The Producers,"
where they sell more shares than there actually

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.100
are.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.490
And so, credit and blame--. Everybody, we
have self-serving biases. We have a lot more

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.930
information about what we've done and what
we've contributed than we do about what other

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.640
people have done and what they have contributed.
So part of it's an informational thing. We

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.670
have much more information about ourselves
and our hard work.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:52.230
But part of it's also a bias thing and a motivational
thing, which is, we are motivated to overestimate

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.740
our own contributions and to underestimate
those of others. And these dynamics and these

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.320
self-serving biases soon cascade up within
relationships within and between teams, and

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.260
in entire organizational cultures.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.120
So in the introduction to the book, I talk
about the proverbial six phases of a project.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.560
Is anybody familiar with those? The six phases
are, and I don't know whether it's applicable

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.800
here or not, are enthusiasm, disillusionment,
panic, search for the guilty, punishment of

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.120
the innocent, and then rewards for those who
had nothing to do with it.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.690
And so, even though we studied many formal
academic models of credit and blame over the

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.350
course of our academic and professional careers,
it's rare in my experience that a project

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:47.730
doesn't at least have some of those attributes
as it winds its way from conception to completion.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.650
People care too much and they sub optimize.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.950
If there's one lesson in people's careers
and the Center for Creative Leadership, where

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.139
I'm an affiliate, has done longitudinal research
about what makes people successful over the

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:05.220
course of their careers, it's tempting to
take credit in the short term, to overestimate

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.940
your contributions and your talents. But it's
actually quite harmful over the longer term.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.470
And people who are unrepentant, unremitting,
self-creditors have a problem. First of all,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.509
they're gonna be resented by their co-workers
and colleagues. But second of all, if they

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.070
take credit for everything, they're not going
to learn. They're not gonna take feedback.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.850
They're going to have a fixed view of their
own capabilities, rather than to take a learning

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.360
approach.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.790
And so, people, how you manage credit and
blame for yourself and others is a key determinant

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.199
of career success, regardless of the size
of your organization. And so, it's important

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:46.979
as you go through your career to think about,
"How am I taking credit and blame? Is it fair?

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.419
Is it accurate?" As I mentioned before, people
tend to sub optimize.

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:55.601
People fight too hard to get credit that they
think they deserve, but that other people

00:07:55.601 --> 00:08:01.220
don't necessarily think they deserve. And
when we feel blamed, we tend to work too hard

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:07.410
to get exonerated of that blame. And like
many other things in life and work, the underlying

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.370
issue, the underlying contribution that you
did or didn't make, or mistake you did or

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.910
didn't make, is often much less important
than what you do about it afterwards.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.680
So, if you're working on a project and you
feel under credited, that may or may not make

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.070
a difference. But if you fight so hard to
get the credit that you anger everybody around

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.680
you, you might end up--. They might say, "OK,
OK. It was you who did that, but now I don't

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.550
wanna work with you anymore. Now you're unpleasant
as a colleague and collaborator."

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:42.789
And similarly, you might push so hard to be
exonerated of a minor mistake or oversight--.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:48.839
First of all, doing that might mean that you
have to then blame someone else. So one of

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:54.459
the lessons of this book is not to rush to
judgment, not to act impulsively, but instead

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:59.610
to think in a more mindful way about credit
and blame to make sure that you're acting

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:06.389
in a self-serving way, in a positive sense
of self-serving, not in a biased manner.

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:10.990
So, as the world changes and this is an organization
that's at the vanguard of those changes, the

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.839
world is much less about centralized bureaucracies
and centralized notions of credit and blame.

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:25.100
It's much more about networks and information
and less hierarchical and more horizontal

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.869
notions of information and linkages between
things.

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:34.089
One of the things I've heard about Google
is that in hiring people here, there's a resonance,

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:38.300
and there often is in the companies that I
consult to, that there's something about the

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:43.440
fundamental nature of the company that gets
enacted. It's almost like a work of literature

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.629
in which every little passage reflects the
whole.

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:52.170
What I've heard is that the hiring process
is a little bit analogous to doing a Google

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.369
search. People link to you. You're credible.
There's some secret algorithm, some secret

00:09:57.369 --> 00:10:03.480
sauce, that determines whether you get hired
or not. And so in essence, that's a kind of

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:11.149
avant-garde world-changing, changing world
credit and blame, which is your Google rankings,

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:19.699
how you get hired, etc., is all part of the
new world of credit and blame.

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:25.739
So the first chapter is about evolution. And
even starting with our primate relatives,

00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:31.839
I tell the story of Coco the Gorilla, who
lives in California. I don't know far from

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:36.600
your headquarters. But she learned several
thousand words of sign language and she's

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.449
monitored 24 hours a day. She's one of the
few characters in the book who is identified

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:42.449
by her real name.

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:49.529
I hope she doesn't mind. And so, one night,
Coco was playing with a toy cat and she accidentally

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:55.829
broke it. And the next morning, her morning
attendant came in and signed to her, "What

00:10:55.829 --> 00:11:01.540
happened to the cat?" And Coco signed, "It
was my nighttime attendant who broke the cat."

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:08.379
So, even our gorilla relatives have a notion
of credit and blame and are able to literally

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:11.199
point the finger at someone else.

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:16.399
I also, from the evolutionary point of view,
tell the story of Capuchin monkeys. Brian

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:20.439
and I, when we were in grad school, had to
study equity theory, which was developed by

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:25.730
John Stacey Adams in the 60s, where he said
what workers do is they compare their inputs

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.440
with their outputs with their co-workers inputs
and outputs.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.929
And it turns out that Capuchin monkeys do
the same thing. So, if you have a monkey pulling

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:40.429
a bar, and you're giving him a cucumber reward,
he will happily pull that bar and continue

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:42.339
participating in the experiment.

00:11:42.339 --> 00:11:47.709
If you put another Capuchin monkey in an adjacent
cage where they can see each other but not

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:52.989
touch or directly interact, and if you give
that second monkey a grape for doing the same

00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:58.339
task, the first monkey will become totally
indignant and enraged and actually go so far

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:03.029
as to throw the cucumber back at the researcher
because they have a notion of fairness.

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:06.819
And they say, "I'm pulling this lever. I'm
just getting cucumber. You're doing the same

00:12:06.819 --> 00:12:10.910
thing. You're getting a grape." And so the
same is true in the workplace. We look at

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:17.170
our inputs and outputs and if our co-workers'
ratios of inputs to outputs are unfavorable

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:23.799
to us, we can act and react in an impulsive
primate-emotional hardwiring kind of way.

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:28.790
The interesting thing about this though is
that when you think of the four notions, the

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:34.779
four variables, in this equation, our inputs,
our outputs, your inputs, your outputs, all

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:37.360
four of those things are subjective.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.839
What my inputs really are, what my outputs
really are. I mean outputs in terms of salary

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:47.709
and promotions or visibility might be concrete,
but each of us, because of our social wiring,

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:53.040
have many more subtle notions of outputs,
which is the esteem in which we're held by

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.100
colleagues, the likelihood that we may advance
in the organization.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.970
And in that great Times article about Google,
you looked at what were the people analytics

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.350
team looked at what were the factors that
made people successful. And I don't know.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:13.860
Did you look at credit and blame? Your next
assignment. Area for future research could

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.670
be how people handle credit and blame. I would
imagine though, the sort of emotional skills,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:26.220
managerial skills, leadership skills, I would
imagine credit and blame is somewhere therein.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:33.929
So any questions about the evolutionary perspective
on credit and blame?

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:35.489
[pause]

00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:43.540
OK. So in Chapter One, I also talk about stereotyping,
which is, we have automatic preconscious notions

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.940
of credit and blame. And in the book, and
also in a Harvard Business Review article

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:53.549
that's out this month, I have a link to the
Implicit Associations Test, which is run through

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:59.699
Harvard where you can look at people from
different ethnicities, genders, races, backgrounds,

00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:00.730
etc.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.869
And the test assesses how quick are you to
make associations between positive words and

00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:10.819
members of one group, and between negative
words and members of other groups. And what

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:15.609
the research shows is that no matter how enlightened
and equal opportunity we believe ourselves

00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:22.230
to be, it still may be easier for us to make
an association between a Caucasian face and

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.989
a positive word and a member of an ethnic
minority and the negative words, simply because

00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:32.009
of our socialization, our acculturation, because
of our exposure in the media.

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:37.180
And so, it's good to know the first step to
overcoming these things, which I think people

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.829
of good will wanna do, is judge people as
Martin Luther King said, "by the content of

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:46.500
their character and not the color of their
skin." Being aware of your biases so that

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.370
you can correct for those biases is something
that's very important.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:55.750
And I know when it comes to Google and searching,
there's been stuff in the news recently about

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:01.369
search results--what qualifies as a good search
result, what's includable, what's not includable.

00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:07.790
So that's an interesting credit and blame
that you all work with as well.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.999
The book is about also, people shooting the
messenger that we tend to develop negative

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:18.259
associations and tend to scapegoat people
who threaten our world view, who threaten

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:24.189
organizational paradigms. And this has nothing
to do with people's merit, but instead has

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:29.819
to do with how they're perceived, how much
anxiety they bring up in the organization,

00:15:29.819 --> 00:15:30.819
what have you.

00:15:30.819 --> 00:15:35.649
And so, the book has some practical advice
about how to avoid being scapegoated, yourself.

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:40.480
And just like the other advice in the book,
it's about being mindful, making sure that

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.089
you're delivering your message no matter who
or what you're challenging, that you do it

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:50.029
in a mindful way, that you consider the timing
carefully, that you not embarrass anybody.

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:55.920
And if it turns out the emperor's wearing
no clothes, maybe you can send the emperor

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.259
an anonymous email, or something rather than
calling it out in a meeting.

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:03.730
[paper rustles]

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.910
The second chapter is about the nurture of
credit and blame. And what this is about,

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.869
is about how each of us, in the course of
our lives as we grow up in our families, we

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:18.999
learn about credit and blame from our families,
from our parents, from our siblings.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:24.810
We learn what's praiseworthy. We learn what's
blameworthy. We learn about fairness. We learn

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:30.329
about unfairness. We learn about favoritism.
Sometimes in families, some kids can do no

00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:35.589
wrong. They're the Golden Child. Sometimes,
no kids can do no right. They're the black

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:37.799
sheep of the family, if you will.

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:43.369
And so, this gets played out in the workplace.
So the book also talks about the notion of

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:50.309
transference, which is that we tend to reenact
family dynamics in the workplace. So, a boss

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:57.899
becomes a pseudo-parent and a co-worker becomes
a pseudo-sibling. Nepotism, if you will. So

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:03.359
it's nepotism not of the demographic, literal
sense, but of the psychological sense.

00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:08.980
There's something that's known as homo-social
reproduction, which is that we tend to select

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:14.370
people and to affiliate with people who are
similar to ourselves, to reproduce ourselves

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:19.460
in that social manner. And not necessarily
people who are similar to us in a demographic

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.310
way, but people who are similar to us in terms
of other attributes that they have.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:29.890
It could be in terms of values. It could be
in terms of education or other things like

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:35.730
that. And so learning about transference--I'm
not suggesting that everybody be on the couch

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:42.010
and do psychoanalysis for 15 years-- but still
reflecting on those things about how you're

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:47.050
caring about credit and blame, how your identity
is wrapped up in what you're doing for better

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.740
or for worse, can be very important.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:55.270
And often, I find with my clients that in
order for them to understand what's happening

00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:00.550
for them in their careers, it's very important
that they understand their buttons and which

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:07.460
buttons are being pushed. So I tell this story
in the book of a man of a financial services

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:13.620
executive who was assigned a coach because
Human Resources said this guy had no people

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.620
skills.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.560
He has no managerial skills. And when I first
met with him, I inquired what had happened.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.850
And he said that there was a merger. He never
really wanted to have a staff. As a result

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.251
of the merger, he was given several direct
reports, some of them in Europe. And there

00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:33.740
was a woman who kept calling him and bothering
him, asking him questions.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:41.680
And once, he got so fed up that he hung up
on her. He blamed her for annoying him, for

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.070
interrupting his work. And he hung up on her.
And in this particular financial services

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.520
organization, like in most other organizations,
at least is the way it should be, hanging

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.070
up on someone is not an acceptable way of
handling a workplace conflict, especially

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.270
when it's somebody who reports to you.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.630
You're not setting a very good leadership
example. So, in our first coaching meeting,

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.740
I asked him--. You know, I'm not a psychoanalyst,
but I think it is important to understand

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:13.230
someone's story. How did they get to be who
they are? So I asked him, "Tell me about any

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.200
early life experiences that you think influenced
how you come across in the workplace."

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.930
And the first story he told, was he said,
"I grew up in an immigrant family. I was the

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:28.270
only kid out of five siblings who had any
academic talent or interest. I didn't have

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:33.270
my own room, so I would do my homework in
the dining room on a table. And my siblings

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.670
would always be ruckus and be annoying.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.760
And then at the end of the day after they
were playing and I was finished with my homework,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.240
my sister would come and demand that I help
her with her homework." And we were both like,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.380
I mean, it didn't require my interpretation.
I was so immediately apparent to both of us

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.730
immediately that he was having a flashback.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:01.650
That this direct report asking him that question
was just like being bothered by his younger

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:09.470
sister. So how he reacted, he blamed her unduly
because of this transference flashback reaction

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:14.660
he was having and in turn, got himself in
so much more trouble with the rest of the

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.620
organization because he was acting out in
an immediate, impulsive way.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.350
So, knowing your own story, knowing what's
pushing your buttons, knowing your script

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:29.650
and making sure that you're not reenacting
that can be very important. I also talk in

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:35.900
the book about several other things. Michelle
Conlin wrote an article in Business Week 2004

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.300
called, "I'm a Bad Boss, Blame My Dad."

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:44.610
Dad, if you're watching, I don't blame you.
About how people act out in the workplace.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:51.360
And it tells one story of an executive who
actually worked at Microsoft, who got in trouble

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.970
with his supervisors because he felt like
they were criticizing him. He had a flashback

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:02.640
to his parents criticizing him as a teenager
and it became quite problematic for him.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.420
There's also in the book, a write-up of an
article in which some clients of mine appeared

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:13.790
in the New York Times in 2008. Three women
from an advertising agency called Tag Creative;

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.750
we're in the process of working with the three
of them and helping them with conflict resolution.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.240
They each came to own that they were acting
with each other like sisters.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:29.570
And they, two of them had sisters. One of
them didn't, but they were acting and reacting

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.550
to each other in a way that had nothing to
do with the moment at hand, but instead was

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.370
a flashback from earlier in life.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.070
So, when it comes to credit and blame and
the emotions surrounding credit and blame,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.580
knowing your story and to the extent you can,
trying to know without asking all kinds of

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.930
intrusive questions that violate laws about
people's early life experiences. Just trying

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:56.490
to get a sense of what their story is can
be quite helpful. Any questions about that,

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:02.190
about the nurture aspects of blame? Yes.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:08.440
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member # 1: [inaudible]

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.020
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: You mean like only, people
who are only children?

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.020
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member # 1: Sure.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.840
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: In my experience, only children
aren't different. And I mean there's always

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.210
exceptions to rules. And sometimes people
grew up with cousins and etc., etc. But on

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:28.950
my website, on datner consulting dot com,
there's actually a link to a Power Point presentation

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.730
that I did about birth order with leaders.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.900
And there are some very well-known leaders.
For example, Jack Welch from GE, who were

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:43.120
only children. They tend to be very academically
successful, very comfortable with authority

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:50.900
and control. They may have a tougher time
working on a team. So all of these things

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.750
depend on a lot of different factors, but
there are somewhat consistent patterns.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.851
And it may be--. Sometimes I've had clients
who were only children who were working on

00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:04.620
teams and then they blame--. They don't blame
themselves, or they don't blame their parents

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.990
for not having more kids, but they say, "I'm
an only child so I find this sort of collaborative,

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:16.330
depending on other people and being so interdependent
on them, I find it particularly hard."

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.240
That's one of the things in the book, also,
which is that knowing yourself should never

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.130
be used as a rationalization. It should never,
"Of course I'm having a hard time collaborating

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.010
on the team. I'm an only child." Instead,
it should be, "I might have a harder time

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:36.590
because I'm an only child, but how do I then
work around that?"

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:43.230
OK. So the next chapter is called, "Typecasting
Blame." And what that's about is it's about

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:49.060
personality, both normal and dysfunctional
and how that relates to credit and blame.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.720
On the book's website, which is credit and
blame dot com, there's a link to the Harvard

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.090
Business Review article, which is in this
month's Harvard Business Review, the April

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.970
2011 "Failure" issue.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:07.130
In there, there's a link to a free test, the
IPIP 120. You can Google it. Which is a free

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:13.190
Big Five personality test, which will, for
free, give you a report. You answer 120 questions

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:18.200
and it will tell you where you fall on the
Big Five dimensions, which are--.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.570
&gt;&gt;Brian: Conscientiousness, Agreeableness,
Extroversion, Openness to Experience-- did

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.310
I say that one? Neuroticism.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:32.680
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: CANOE. Kudos to Brian for remembering
stuff from grad school. So, depending on where

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:39.450
you fall on Conscientiousness, Agreeableness,
Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Extroversion,

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.970
there are those dimensions and then there
are also sub factors.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.820
So for example, one of the sub factors of
Conscientiousness is achievement striving.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.520
If you're high on achievement striving, you're
gonna care a lot about getting credit for

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.720
things and wanna make breakthrough contributions.
One of the sub factors of Neuroticism is anger.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.120
You can be angry. You can have anger within
you that comes out in the workplace.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.570
And if you're high on the anger sub factor
of Neuroticism, you might get extremely disproportionately

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:16.380
angry if you feel unduly blamed or insufficiently
credited. So the next part of that chapter

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.140
is about the dysfunctional personality types.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:25.580
The OCEAN or CANOE Big Five is about normal
personality, but it's also important to keep

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:31.680
in mind that you might be displaying some
of the attributes of dysfunctional personality

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.000
types. And these dysfunctional personality
types fall into three broad categories. They're

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.630
extra punitive, where you blame other people
too harshly.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:48.000
Impunitive, where you either deny blame, or
you deny your own role in the blame. Or, intrapunitive,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.460
where you blame yourself too much. And each
one of these can be problematic. Men tend

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:59.240
to be more extra punitive or impunitive and
women tend to be more intrapunitive.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.640
And there's a variety of sociological and
cultural reasons that that's the case, but

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.580
women tend to have a harder time taking credit.
They tend to underestimate how much credit

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.390
they're getting from other people. And men,
if they're displaying these dysfunctional

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.310
personality types, tend to be more blaming
of others.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:23.900
So, when it comes to these categories, extra
punitive, there's the excitable, volatile

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:30.030
guardian and all these are listed in the book
as well as in the Harvard Business Review

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:35.560
article. So a volatile guardian overreacts
to minor mistakes, determines failure prematurely,

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.700
assigns blame unfairly, and reacts defensively
to feedback.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.990
So if somebody is extra punitive, they can
be very hard to work with. They can be very

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:50.250
hard to work for. And although this might
protect their self-esteem and give them righteous

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:56.770
anger and righteous rage instead of self-criticizing
depression, they can be--, have a really hard

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:03.810
time learning over time. Impunitive, which
is denying blame, the big person on campus,

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.830
is someone who is good to steer clear of.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:12.380
This is someone who becomes angry or hurt
when blamed, who will ingratiate with superiors

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:17.880
and distort information in order to avoid
blame. So, as I was walking here this morning,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:23.550
I thought about Google's slogan, which is,
"Don't be evil." So part of it is "don't be

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.970
evil" when it comes to credit and blame. But
I think no less important, it's also "don't

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.000
assume evils."

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.030
Don't look for evil where there may not be
evil in your co-workers. Or, don't look for

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:39.420
failure. Don't look for under-performance.
One of the consistent themes in the book is

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.800
about how helpful it is to give people the
benefit of the doubt. That if you look for

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.630
blame, if you look for failure, you're more
likely to find it.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:52.180
If you look for success, if you look for credit,
you're more likely to find that. So it's self-fulfilling,

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.200
for better or for worse.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:28:02.500
Intrapunitive. So, a martyr would be an example
of somebody who had a dysfunctional approach

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.809
to the workplace.

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:07.970
his is someone who might accept more blame
than she deserves in order to preserve working

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:13.500
relationships, or to blame herself so harshly
that it deflects other people's criticism.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:19.260
So what can you do about this? On the book's
website, on credit and blame dot com, there's

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.059
an assessment that you can take that I developed
and market in partnership with Performance

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:25.059
Programs.

00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:30.610
And you can see how you fall on these eleven
different dysfunctional types, whether you're

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.260
likely to be perceived as displaying these
types. And if you are, if you are working

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.520
with a mentor or an executive coach, or even
with a trusted colleague or peer, you can

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.050
say, "How am I coming across? Am I handling
credit and blame?

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:50.370
Am I reacting to it in a good way? Am I assigning
it in a good way? As I progress in my career,

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.870
how can I do a better job of managing the
delicate balance for myself and for others

00:28:54.870 --> 00:29:03.559
of credit and blame?" Any questions about
that before I move on to the next chapter?

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:04.559
OK.

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:08.630
So the next one is situational awareness,
which is there's the people and there's the

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.630
situation.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.720
And in grad school, we suffered through many
conversations, discussions, and debates about

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.970
is it the person, is it the situation, or
is it both? And so, when it comes to workplace

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:24.180
relationships, when it comes to teams, there's
a lot of social influences that determine

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.210
how we assign credit and blame, how we react
to credit and blame.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:33.270
And the analogy that I use in the book is
it's a little bit like water. Water can change

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:39.050
phase depending on the ambient environment.
So, water can be ice. Water can be water.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.801
Or, water can be steam. And the same is true
of people and their personalities, which is,

00:29:43.801 --> 00:29:46.781
we can be the equivalent of water, steam,
and ice.

00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:52.040
And so, some people may not be extra punitive
until they're under a certain kind of stress

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.680
and then they can act out. Or, people may
not be intrapunitive under normal circumstances,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.090
but then if things go wrong, if they're blamed
by other people, it can push buttons. It can

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.470
bring up early memories or what have you.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.460
So, if you're trying to figure yourself out,
if you're trying to figure others out, there's

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:14.180
something known as the Fundamental Attribution
Error in organizational psychology and psychology

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:19.480
more broadly, where we over attribute to people's
character or their certain dispositions and

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.120
we underestimate the importance of the situation.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.740
But when it comes to credit and blame, it's
important to not only think about someone's

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.670
traits, but also to think about their states.
What kind of state are they in? If they're

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:37.110
under a certain kind of stress, they may act
out and react in a dysfunctional way.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:42.940
We may conclude that's just the kind of person
they are, but what all kinds of research and

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:48.050
organizational psychology shows is that situations
in the workplace can be powerful. Situations

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:52.840
can attenuate differences between people.
So, even though I might be extroverted, you

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.220
may be introverted. If we're both working
in sales, we both have to be extroverted if

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.940
we're going to be successful.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.440
And similarly, just like situations can make
different people act the same, it can make

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.072
the same people act different. I might be
one way in one situation and another way in

00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:13.540
another situation. So it's important in the
workplace to think about these influences

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:18.200
and to think about what kind of environment
are you gonna be most comfortable and successful

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.970
in, and where are you likely to face challenges.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:30.150
Organizational Cultures. This is Chapter Five.
That's another kind of situational, contextual

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.500
influence on how we act and react in terms
of credit and blame. And some cultures are

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.390
open and people are willing to question their
own role in credit and blame, to think about

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.340
the contextual factors, etc.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:46.190
Unfortunately, too many organizations have
scapegoats, search for the guilty, punishment

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:52.640
of the innocent, as I mentioned before. So,
what great leaders do, which is the next chapter,

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.950
regardless of where they are in their careers
or what level they are at an organizational

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:03.370
level, is they think about credit and blame
and how do you set a positive example rather

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.130
than a negative example.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:09.730
There's a seminal article from the 70s. Steven
Kerr, "On the folly of rewarding A, while

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:14.570
hoping for B." And what great organizational
cultures do is they think, "What are we implicitly

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:20.700
or explicitly crediting or blaming? And are
we crediting or blaming the right thing at

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.760
the right time?"

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.960
I have clients who have said, "We wanna sell
higher margin products and all the sales people

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.020
say we're still compensated based on volume."
And so, if an organizational culture doesn't

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:37.160
recognize that it's sending mixed messages
and rewarding the wrong things, it's unlikely

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:43.150
that it's going to change.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.809
So Chapter Six is about leaders.

00:32:45.809 --> 00:32:51.320
Great leaders at different levels of organizations
and what they do. So, one example I tell in

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:56.490
the story is of Wernher von Braun, during
the 1960s. Even though he was controversial

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:02.090
in his role in the Nazi Rocket Program, he
was still a widely admired leader of the US-based

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.870
program. And one day, there was a rocket that
blew up at launch.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.950
And an engineer came into von Braun's office
and sheepishly admitted that he had touched

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:15.250
a circuit board right before launch and that's
why the rocket had blown up. The engineer

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:20.390
came into work the next day expecting to find
a pink slip on his desk, but instead, there

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.720
was a bottle of Champagne from von Braun,
himself, with a note that said, "Thank you

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.300
for confessing your error. You saved us months
of diagnostic work and we may have never even

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:33.570
found out what had gone wrong with the rocket."

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:39.140
So that's what great leaders do. Amy Edmonson
at Harvard has said that "what great leaders

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:44.120
do is they create an environment that's safe,
where people feel safe in admitting mistakes

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.951
and being self-critical." But not necessarily
comfortable. Not an environment where everybody

00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:53.420
feels so at ease that they don't worry about
making mistakes.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:59.860
They still are committed--. They still feel
bad about making mistakes. But paradoxically,

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.790
leaders who encourage blame, who encourage
people to share blame, create better environments.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:11.460
In the Organizational Culture chapter, I also
talk about Amy Edmonson's work about hospitals

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.749
where she found--this is another counter-intuitive,
paradoxical result-- that it's actually better

00:34:16.749 --> 00:34:21.239
to go to a hospital, certain hospitals at
least, with higher error rates, rather than

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.309
lower error rates.

00:34:22.309 --> 00:34:27.181
Higher surgical mistakes, higher drug administration
errors. And you might say, "Why would I want

00:34:27.181 --> 00:34:31.859
to go to a hospital with a higher error rate?"
The reason is because those hospitals are

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:37.540
better on every other metric other than these
error rates. And the reason is because they

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.839
actually confess their errors. And because
they confess them, they are able to fix them.

00:34:42.839 --> 00:34:47.589
In the comparison hospitals where they didn't
admit their mistakes, where they had lower

00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:52.059
error rates, the errors were happening. They
were probably even happening at a higher rate

00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:59.089
than the hospitals that reported the high
error rates, but people didn't actually convey

00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:03.920
them or admit them. And therefore, the underlying
things couldn't be fixed.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:11.890
Any questions? So what great leaders do, Michael
Dell is an example of this, is they are open

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.599
to feedback. Jim Collins, who wrote "Good
to Great," said, "What great leaders do is

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:21.151
they look in the mirror when things go wrong
to take responsibility and out the window

00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:26.180
when things go right." And so, what great
leaders do is they accept feedback.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:32.450
They take on blame. They take a customer-focus,
continuous, and improvement view. And when

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:37.410
they do that, they set an example for people
in the rest of the organization, to also take

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.509
blame and do not deny blame. To some extent,
what this whole book is about is it's really

00:35:42.509 --> 00:35:43.619
about evolution.

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:49.089
It's about individual, team, and organizational
evolution. So, credit and blame are just a

00:35:49.089 --> 00:35:55.299
proxy for pride, sight, shame, and all these
other things that can either, if you manage

00:35:55.299 --> 00:35:58.519
them correctly, help propel you forward in
your career.

00:35:58.519 --> 00:36:04.259
Or, if you're stuck because you're too much
about pride and too ashamed to admit mistakes,

00:36:04.259 --> 00:36:10.670
or you're too afraid of the shame or embarrassment
of making a mistake to never experiment with

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:15.519
something new, if you don't risk failure,
it's unlikely that you'll be able to make

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:20.869
breakthrough contributions, or to make progress
over the course of your career.

00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:28.569
Questions about that before I move on to the
final chapter? OK. So there are two parts

00:36:28.569 --> 00:36:33.799
to the final chapter, which is about practical
approaches for yourself, as an individual

00:36:33.799 --> 00:36:39.140
in your career, and also as the leader of
others in an organization. So the first one

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:43.289
is, take a step back. Don't act impulsively.

00:36:43.289 --> 00:36:47.000
I talk about this in the book and also in
the Harvard Business Review article, which

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.940
is you can't always make things better when
it comes to credit and blame if you've been

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:57.140
insufficiently credited or unduly blamed,
but you can always make things worse. Each

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:02.480
of us has the capability to make things worse
by acting out in a rigid way, by blaming other

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.880
people, by denying it, by being a prima donna,
by being a drama queen, by doing whatever

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.460
it is that you do.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:15.010
Acting out in a self-destructive, impulsive
way, I guarantee you everybody here has the

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:20.950
power to make things worse. Being strategic
is also important. Think about, "What is this

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:26.029
really worth to me? Am I winning the battle,
but losing the war?" And think about credit

00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:28.220
and blame, how you're managing it.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:33.140
And it's never a good idea to blame people
too much, but it can be a good idea to share

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:38.509
a little bit more credit than you believe
others deserve, because it's like the perceptual

00:37:38.509 --> 00:37:42.609
thing where you have two lines. Those famous
perception studies, and one of them looks

00:37:42.609 --> 00:37:45.039
longer just because of the context and perspective.

00:37:45.039 --> 00:37:49.220
One of them looks shorter. Same is true when
it comes to credit and blame, which is, we

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.890
perceive that we deserve more credit. We perceive
that others deserve less credit. So it's good

00:37:53.890 --> 00:38:00.160
to correct for those errors and biases. Understand
your own story.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.539
So again, you don't have to do 15 years of
psychoanalysis, but knowing your story and

00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:10.940
what motivates you, and what's your identity
and how is that related to work and how you

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.560
come across and how you're credited and blamed.
And how does that propel your success, but

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.609
also, how does that hold you back? So what
is your story and what are other people's

00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:20.609
stories?

00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:25.390
And how do you intervene? How do you make
changes and tweaks on an ongoing basis to

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:31.190
change that story? Know your type and your
risk factors. So, even if you take the credit

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:35.960
and blame type assessment and it tells you
you're a big person on campus, or you're a

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.160
martyr, you may still question it. You might
not fully come to terms with it and that's

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160
OK.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.739
But you might be perceived that way. So forget
about, for the moment, the reality of whether

00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:51.850
you actually are or aren't, but if you're
coming across as taking too much credit, how

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:59.641
can you come across in a more modest, more
collaborative way? Fight the fundamental attribution

00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:01.799
errors. So, try to look at the context.

00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:08.230
And Google and Brian and his people help you
do that by saying, "Keep the context in mind.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:13.180
There were contextual factors that make things
easier or harder for this person." And make

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.609
sure you're keeping in mind biases, the recency
effect, the primacy effect, etc. Start with

00:39:18.609 --> 00:39:24.470
positive expectations. So again, as I mentioned
before, giving people the benefit of the doubt,

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.650
looking for credit rather than blame, will
be self-fulfilling. Any questions about those?

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.940
Please.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:37.724
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: What's the most
common thing [ inaudible ]

00:39:37.724 --> 00:39:41.059
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: The research actually did not
look at that. What we found was that 70 percent

00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:46.249
of the population falls into one of those
dysfunctional types, but I didn't actually

00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:49.249
see the statistics about which one was more
common.

00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:55.670
That would be a good question for Robert Hogan,
for Hogan Assessment Systems. OK, so practical

00:39:55.670 --> 00:40:00.760
approaches for leaders. Be a blame-savvy boss.
So, think about credit and blame, the dynamics

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.890
of credit and blame on your team. And be mindful
of how you're assigning it, how other people

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:12.140
are assigning it. Take an open and adaptive
approach rather than blaming people.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.400
Think about how can we focus on solutions
rather than on problems, realizing that you're

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.720
setting an example with everything you do,
or don't do. Fight group think. So, try to

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:27.579
think about--. It's gonna be tempting for
people who report to you to become Yes Men

00:40:27.579 --> 00:40:29.979
and Women and tell you everything you're doing
is great.

00:40:29.979 --> 00:40:34.769
So, you have to keep in mind that sort of
social hierarchy and people's intimidation

00:40:34.769 --> 00:40:39.529
and ask people questions like, "Well, if this
doesn't work, why wouldn't it work?" Or maybe

00:40:39.529 --> 00:40:45.460
you assign people randomly to argue for or
against an initiative or a project that you're

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:51.049
considering just so there's a forum for that,
so people will feel, again, safe to speak

00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:55.229
up even if they don't feel comfortable.

00:40:55.229 --> 00:41:00.109
Focus on systems and situations. So think
about when you're talking with people about

00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:04.299
their performance and what made it go well,
or didn't go well. What are the contextual

00:41:04.299 --> 00:41:08.690
factors? And how can you, as a leader, get
them more resources or support or information

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.750
so that they can be more successful going
forward.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:17.609
Get and keep the right people on the bus.
So when you're hiring people, try to ascertain

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:22.450
how do they do in terms of credit and blame.
Are they unduly crediting themselves? Are

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:27.259
they saying "I" when they really mean "we?"
Or maybe they're too modest and self-effacing

00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:30.660
and they're saying "we" when they really mean
"I?"

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:36.130
But looking at people's pattern credit and
blame can be a great diagnostic as to whether

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:41.029
they'll be a good person to have reporting
to you or to have working with you. And the

00:41:41.029 --> 00:41:46.320
last recommendation is to write a managerial
user's manual for your new team. And what

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.380
this is, is a document. It can be informal.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:54.369
You can share it in writing or just verbally,
which is, "I'm your new boss. Here's what

00:41:54.369 --> 00:41:58.759
you need to know about me. Here's what people
are likely to misunderstand about me." And

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:02.819
the reason this is relevant to credit and
blame is because people size each other up.

00:42:02.819 --> 00:42:07.609
There can be cross-cultural miscommunications.
So, if I'm your new boss and I ask you a lot

00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:13.239
of questions, you might panic and you might
assume that I don't trust you, that I'm trying

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:14.259
to get rid of you.

00:42:14.259 --> 00:42:19.079
I'm asking a lot of questions and you might
get worried that this is really about me determining

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:24.180
who to fire. But if I say to you, "It's my
style to ask a lot of questions. It doesn't

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.420
mean that I don't trust you. It doesn't mean
that I'm trying to diagnose your capabilities.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.910
I just ask a lot of questions." I have one
client who wrote a managerial user's manual.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:38.759
She told her team, "I'm British, so I tend
to be reserved. And Americans tend to think

00:42:38.759 --> 00:42:45.559
I'm standoffish and aloof. But I'm not. I'm
just British, so come talk to me anytime."

00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:51.819
And there are other things like that where
people might say for example, "I like information,

00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:57.460
even if it's unfinalized. So don't wait until
the last minute. Give me updates. I like updates.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.400
Give me an update, even if the update is 'there's
no update.'"

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:05.499
And that way, there doesn't have to be tension
because you're not giving the manager what

00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:11.769
he or she wants. So having this thing can
avoid misunderstandings and what I call in

00:43:11.769 --> 00:43:17.170
the book, "mondegreens," which are when things
are misunderstood. And two famous stories

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:22.920
about that was Winston Churchill, during the
Second World War, was referring to a person

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.059
and he said to his staff, "Bring me Berlin."

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:31.150
Not the city, the person. So they bring this
man to his office and Winston Churchill says

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.869
to him, "So what's the latest thing you've
been working on?" And the guy says, "A song

00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:40.099
called White Christmas." And in fact, Churchill
had wanted them to bring him Isaiah Berlin,

00:43:40.099 --> 00:43:43.569
the great philosopher, but they brought him
Irving Berlin.

00:43:43.569 --> 00:43:48.329
And there's another story about Herbert Hoover,
who had a rigid rule that there had to be

00:43:48.329 --> 00:43:54.380
one-inch margins on every memo that was sent
to him. And some hapless FBI leader sent him

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:59.049
some note and where he proposed something,
but there was a lot of information so the

00:43:59.049 --> 00:44:03.970
margins were thinner. And so Hoover said,
"Your plan is fine, but watch the borders."

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:08.019
And what he meant was watch the borders of
your memo, but instead, they panicked and

00:44:08.019 --> 00:44:12.819
they sent FBI agents to the Rio Grande and
to Saskatchewan, or whatever, to watch the

00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:16.769
borders because they thought he meant watch
the borders of the United States. So as a

00:44:16.769 --> 00:44:22.329
leader, if people are intimidated by you,
if you're blaming, you paradoxically are less

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:26.960
likely to get what you want because people
aren't gonna approach you and ask for clarification.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.230
They're gonna instead bring you the wrong
person and engage in the wrong task-based

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:37.859
behavior. And so, a user's manual breaks the
ice and makes sure that people feel comfortable

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:42.890
approaching you and that there aren't those
cascading misunderstandings of blame that

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.920
then will lead to poor results.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.609
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: [ inaudible ]

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:51.880
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: Because there was a woman who
wrote a book where she heard this song about

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:57.650
Earl Murray and they laid him on the green,
but she misinterpreted that as Earl Murray

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.150
and they laid a mondegreen.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:05.670
So she wrote this book, which is referenced
in the book, where she talked about mondegreens.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:12.130
Like, excuse me while I kiss this guy, or
the girl with colitis goes by or things like

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.130
that.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.349
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: And they said they
could build a reality show.

00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:23.780
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: Yes. That would be great. Great,
so any questions or comments? Please.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:31.630
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: [inaudible ]

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:40.650
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: So the question was, how does
the example of Coco the Gorilla and the Capuchin

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:45.670
monkeys relate to evolution? It could just
be a snapshot in time. Because I believe that

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:50.619
what the research has shown is that we are
hardwired for example, stereotyping. It's

00:45:50.619 --> 00:45:56.579
something that was an evolutionary benefit
to determine is this person friend or foe?

00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:01.849
So the Capuchin monkeys--. I also talk in
that chapter about bats, where there are vampire

00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:08.519
bats that go out and suck the blood of large
mammals. And then they have this bat blood

00:46:08.519 --> 00:46:13.440
co-op where they regurgitate blood into each
other's mouths. If one bat gets lucky one

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.670
night and gets prey and the other one doesn't,
they will actually regurgitate blood and share

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:22.289
with each other and then keep track of who
was stingy and who wasn't stingy.

00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:28.450
So these bats have among the largest cerebral
cortexes in the mammalian world because of

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:32.769
these reciprocal things. So then you can say,
"OK, well these bats have these reciprocal

00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:39.109
notions in a prototype of credit and blame.
So then, how does that relate to human evolution

00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:45.641
and our big cortexes and our reciprocal keeping
track of social relationships."

00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:50.400
So it's not to say that we evolved from bats
or even from Capuchin monkeys, but it's supposed

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:56.599
to say that we're not the only animals that
have notions of credit and blame and that

00:46:56.599 --> 00:47:02.019
are able to point the finger, that care about
fairness, that track reciprocity, or that

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:06.499
are able to blame others. So this is something
that is likely.

00:47:06.499 --> 00:47:12.950
It's always hard to verify any kind of evolutionary
psychology hypothesis because you can't really

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.279
do an experiment to test, "Let's have people
evolve without pointing fingers or what have

00:47:17.279 --> 00:47:27.200
you." But it's argument by analogy. [pause
] Any questions from our YouTube viewers?

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.779
No? OK.

00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:32.501
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you, Ben.

00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:33.501
&gt;&gt;Ben Dattner: Thank you very much.

00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:34.501
[applause]

00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:38.359
Good to be with you. I'll be here if anyone
wants a book signed.
