TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, my name is
Timothy Jordan, and I'm a

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.490
developer advocate on the Glass
team here at Google.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.450
And today I'm joined by Jeff
Eddings of the Turner Emerging

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.570
Technology group.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.400
Jeff, welcome.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.830
JEFF EDDINGS: Hello, thanks.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
are you doing?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.580
JEFF EDDINGS: I'm great,
I'm great.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.330
Thanks for having me.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you are the
man behind the CNN Glassware.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.980
JEFF EDDINGS: That's right.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Why don't you
tell us a little bit about the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.510
Glassware and what users
seem to think of it.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.760
JEFF EDDINGS: Sure.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.390
When we first heard about Glass,
we thought right away

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.620
that we needed to have CNN
news alerts on there.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.950
It was a natural fit.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.680
And so, when we first started
working together, we were

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.240
super excited about doing
it, and our users seem

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.505
to love it as well.

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:43.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, what I love
about the Glassware is

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.610
that, I find during the day,
during my business day, I'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.210
really, really busy.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.590
But at the end of the night,
I'm often hanging out with

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.000
family and friends, or if I'm
reading, I'm reading fiction.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.440
I don't usually sit down
and read the newspaper.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.750
But I like getting alerts
throughout the day.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.920
I like staying current
on world events.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.190
And I find with CNN, it's
really easy to do that.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.800
I can get the cover card and
quickly glance at it, or I can

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.730
view the video while I'm walking
between meetings, and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.660
I still sort of know what's
going on in the world.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.990
But I didn't have to take a
large chunk out of my day.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.660
JEFF EDDINGS: That's right.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.830
And news some of the most
perishable content that exists

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.750
out there today.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.920
The older it is, the less
relevant, the less

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.080
important it is.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.370
And so for us to be able to
get news out to users when

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.680
it's happening, right
after it happens,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.320
that's incredibly valuable.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.360
And so for us, like I said,
this was a really exciting

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.520
project for us.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.550
We're very keen on understanding
how these kinds

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.760
of glanceable technologies work
and how people consume

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.980
news differently with those.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
awesome.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.890
And the videos work really
well on Glass.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.390
JEFF EDDINGS: They do.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.960
They do.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.880
We were a little
bit reluctant--

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.780
or not reluctant, hesitant--
about going into this, because

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.860
we were afraid that the video
wouldn't quite look right.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.560
We were very pleasantly
surprised.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.260
They actually look awesome.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.520
We've been really
pleased by it.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.150
And our users have told
us the same thing.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.960
They've told us the videos look
really, really good, and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.100
that's what they really like
about the Glassware.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.380
OK, so today, we're going to
talk about two new things that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.560
came out with XE8 for the
platform on the Mirror API.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.000
The first was the video player
that we've updated, so it has

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.170
controls for play, pause,
rewind, fast forward.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.800
And HTML pagination.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.040
Let's start with the
video player.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.190
JEFF EDDINGS: Sure.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Kind of got
that one for free, right?

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.080
JEFF EDDINGS: We did.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.090
It's the best kind of feature,
is when we don't have to do

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.310
anything at all to improve it.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.770
So it's been great.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.770
One of the things that our
users were saying,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.810
can I pause the video?

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.740
Can I rewind or fast forward?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.150
And we sort of shrugged.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.440
But now, we get to say,
very confidently,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.690
yes, that is in there.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.990
It works great, and we're
thrilled that you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.900
guys put it in there.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.440
Now the next one,
HTML pagination.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.720
I'm going to talk through it
with some slides in a moment.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.310
But I think the key thing here
is that you were getting rich

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.690
content with multiple screens of
information on Glass using

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.620
bundling before.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.715
But it wasn't necessarily the
best way to use bundling, and

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:04.760
it also tripled your cost
for insertions per user.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.970
But now with HTML pagination,
it's [? totally ?]

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.400
different.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.360
JEFF EDDINGS: Absolutely.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.060
This is a great feature
for us.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.390
From our perspective, we were
able to rip large amounts of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.940
code out and simplify what
we were doing as well.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.450
As you said, the cost went down,
and it just made things

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.940
much more easy to maintain.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.890
It's a very smart way to present
that data and send it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.780
to you guys without having to
manage multiple cards-- and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.160
what if one failed, but another
one didn't-- and so,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.400
it's been actually a really
tremendous feature for us.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.390
We also have content
in there that--

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.260
we were troubled--

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.940
we didn't know how to display
to the end user.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.570
Do we put it on multiple
cards?

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.110
Do we reduce the font size?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.250
Now with the new pagination
feature, we're able to just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.630
put it in there, and, as long
as we have the right tags in

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.890
there, set it and forget it.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.880
So let's take a look at
some slides here.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.390
I just want to show everybody
out there a flow.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.760
This is a single CNN
timeline card.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.550
You'll notice there is
a cover card up in

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.840
the upper left there.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.300
And if you tap into it,
you get your menu

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.530
of options, as usual.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.530
But here, you'll see Play, Read
more, and Read aloud.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.400
Play will go straight
to the video.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.830
If you swipe forward to Read
more, that's the HTML minus

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.610
the cover card.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.430
And that'll auto paginate,
depending on the size of the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.350
text in that article.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.220
And then Read aloud will, of
course, read the speakable

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.100
text to the user.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.020
And now in code--

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.620
and this is always the coolest
part, because these features

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.060
are so easy to implement
on the Mirror API.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.280
Here's the JSON.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.750
And it's as you would expect.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.060
You got HTMLs, speakableText,
and the menuItems.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.700
All you need to specify for the
menuItems is READ_ALOUD,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.640
because Play you get, since
there's a video attached.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.660
And then the Read more you get,
because there's multiple

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.140
pages in the HTML.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.170
The HTML looks like this.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.790
It's done with block
level tags.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.360
So you'll notice there's
two article tags there.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.710
The first one is cover-only, so
that's only going to show

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.210
up on the cover.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.350
And then the second one, you'll
notice, it's class is

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.580
auto-paginate.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.970
So you can have many article
tags and that would be a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.900
deliberate separate page.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.340
But if you set the auto-paginate
on an article

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.270
tag, then the text within there
will grow to the number

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.175
of pages it needs
to contain it.

00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:15.880
And that's it.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.340
So a video player, HTML
pagination, and then hopefully

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.850
we're going to keep working on
this, and see some more stuff.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.610
JEFF EDDINGS: Absolutely.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.420
We're really excited about some
of the things that we're

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.170
working on right now to extend
the CNN Glassware.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.780
Right now, we're sending news
out to the individual

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.580
subscribers.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.420
And they get to read that
throughout the day.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.050
But we think there's a real
opportunity for actually

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.940
gathering news using
the Glass device.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.830
Those are some exciting days
ahead for us, and hopefully by

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.430
the end of the year, we'll have
something great to show.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.950
Well, we're really looking
forward to that.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.350
JEFF EDDINGS: Yeah, thanks.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks
for coming by, Jeff.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.000
JEFF EDDINGS: Thank you.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Everyone,
we'll see you later.
