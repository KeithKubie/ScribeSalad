[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.310
MARIO LIVIO: Thank
you very much, Mark.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.920
So here is the time when
you see me a little bit.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.190
And then I'm switching
to the slide.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.630
So should I do that?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.598
MARK: Go ahead.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.810
MARIO LIVIO: So the book
is about human curiosity.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.780
And the reason I wrote a
book about human curiosity,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.610
even though I'm an
astrophysicist--

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.850
and not a neuroscientist
or a psychologist--

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.420
is because I am a very,
very curious person.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.600
And at some point I became very,
very curious about curiosity.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960
So I decided to do
some research on this.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.150
Read up on all the
research that has

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.760
been done-- by
cognitive scientists,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.400
by neuroscientists--
on curiosity.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.490
And what you see now
is the result of that.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.380
So let me start with
something very strange here.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.840
You see this abstract
painting in front of you.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.470
But inside that abstract
thing, actually,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.500
hides the question
mark which appears

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.320
on the cover of the book.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.040
I start the book with a story.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.780
A little story about
this writer, Kate Chopin,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.050
who lived in the 19th century.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.350
She lived most of her
life in Louisiana.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.040
And she wrote a whole
collection of short stories,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.140
and a few full-length novels.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.561
And I found something very
interesting about her.

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:55.370
One of her short stories is
called "The Story of an Hour."

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.940
And this is truly a
very, very short story.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.390
In fact, it is so short
that, as you can see here,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.030
the whole story fits on less
than one page of "Vogue,"

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.669
from 1894.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.370
And like I said, it's called
"The Story of an Hour."

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.010
This, by the way, shows her
husband, who was a Frenchman--

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.190
Oscar Chopin-- and the
house in which he lived.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.850
This short story, "The
Story of an Hour,"

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.820
starts with a
startling sentence.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.480
It reads, "Knowing that
Mrs. Mallard was afflicted

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.060
with heart trouble,
great care was

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.420
taken to break to her
as gently as possible

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.210
the news of her
husband's death."

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.940
One can hardly
start a short story

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.430
with a better
sentence than this.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.510
You see, in one
sentence, she packs

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.870
both death and human frailty.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.070
So if this doesn't
make you curious,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.670
I don't know what will.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.230
And this is her greatest gift.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.070
What she's able to do, is
she is able to generate

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.300
these intellectual cliffhangers,
if you like, with almost

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.820
every sentence that she writes.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.840
And that's why I
like that so much.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.560
Now let's start to
talk about curiosity.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.700
So there was this
psychologist, Daniel Berlyne--

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.130
he was a British Canadian.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.750
And he wanted to put
curiosity on a grid,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.050
like this, where he gave names
to various kinds of curiosity.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.520
And the names used here are
perceptual and epistemic,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.440
diversive and specific.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.850
And I will explain what
each one of those means.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.460
Now I must give a
small caveat here.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.060
Psychology is not mathematics.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.830
So, you know, when Descartes
put a grid like this,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.960
he was able to generate
all of analytic geometry,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.260
and all kinds of great
things in mathematics.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.140
In this case, of course, this
particular classification

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.760
is not unique.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.950
But it is still
fruitful, in the sense

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.550
that it helps us map
curiosity in these regions.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.270
Now what are these different
types of curiosity?

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.250
So let's start with
the axis that goes

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.769
from perceptual to epistemic.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.050
What is perceptual curiosity?

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.990
Perceptual curiosity
is the curiosity

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.600
we feel when we see
something surprising,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.410
something that doesn't agree
with something we know or think

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.390
we know, something puzzling or
something it's an ambiguous.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.790
That's perceptual curiosity.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.540
Here is an example.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.510
These Asian kids
see a white girl

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.360
for the first time
in their life.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.100
Look at their faces.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.220
I mean, they didn't even know
that such a thing exists,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.390
before.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.400
And, you know, they
all gather like this,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.780
and they are very,
very curious about it.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.600
Opposite perceptual curiosity
was epistemic curiosity.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.970
Epistemic curiosity
is the curiosity

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.430
that drives all basic research.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.010
It's what drives us
to ask why and how,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.900
when we try to
understand something.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.700
It is the real love of
knowledge that many of us have.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.050
Again, here is an example
of epistemic curiosity.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.520
These kids want to understand
how these plants grow.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.740
You know, what makes
them grow, what

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.510
happens to them, and so on.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.750
So that's one axis.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.560
Then on the other axis
we had diverse curiosity

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.290
going to specific curiosity.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.300
What is diversive curiosity?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.850
You know, being
here at Google, I

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.990
have a feeling that many of
you have diversive curiosity.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.140
That's expressed
by this thing here.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.740
These kids there, they sit
next to one of the greatest

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.620
works of art in Western art.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.560
This is Rembrandt's
"The Night Watch."

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.160
And look what they are doing.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.610
They are all looking
at their phones.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.050
This is diversive curiosity.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.400
This is when you have constantly
to check for text messages,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.760
or you wonder what will
the new iPhone look like,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.220
or things of that nature.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.690
Or Android, or whatever
what model of smartphone

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.160
you're talking about.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.340
Finally there is--
opposite diversive,

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.470
there was specific curiosity.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.240
This is when you
are actually curious

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.480
about a very particular
piece of information.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.850
You know, like who was it
that created the first chip

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.400
for the first Android telephone,
or we saw this film last week,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.250
what was the name of the actor
there, you know, and so on.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.650
Like, for example,
here, who is this?

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.112
Does anybody know, by
any chance, who this is?

00:06:56.112 --> 00:06:58.530
This is Ernest Hemingway.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.670
Here, in 1918, he is in Milan.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.710
So that's specific curiosity.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.830
You need a very specific
piece of information,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.440
you're given that
piece, and that's it.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.870
You are satisfied with that.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.570
Now before I start describing to
you the research on curiosity--

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.480
the neuroscientific and
psychological research--

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.520
I thought-- in the book I
decided to look at a few very,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.160
very curious people--

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.030
both in the past and
people who are living--

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.500
and to analyze a little bit
what is it that drives them.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.440
What is it that,
you know, made them

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.210
such exceptionally
curious individuals?

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.840
So the first one is
Leonardo da Vinci.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.990
He has been called,
by art critic Kenneth

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.120
Clark, the most
relentlessly curious person

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.890
to have ever lived.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.920
And, indeed, Leonardo
was amazing in many ways.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.160
Of course he has
incredible works of art,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.820
he has all kinds of very
interesting inventions

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.300
associated with his name,
but perhaps most amazing

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.150
are his notebooks.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.520
These are two pages
from his notebooks.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.190
There are, today,
about 6,000 pages

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.720
that remain from the collection
of about 15,000 pages

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.210
of notebooks that existed.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.450
When you look at this,
it looks, at first,

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.410
like some collection
of unrelated doodles.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.360
By the way, he
filled-- you know,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.140
if you look at the period of
time which he wrote notebooks,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.549
you discover that on the average
he had to fill out, every day,

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.350
at least a page and a half--

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.770
every day, in order to get
this amount of notebooks.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.290
The notebooks always
contain drawings.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.860
And they also contain writing,
which he always wrote--

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.150
he was left handed.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.540
He wrote from right to
left, and in mirror image.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.090
In order to read it, you
needed to put a mirror to it.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.720
Now, you look at this,
and at first, you know,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.000
you don't see much connection
between the things.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.400
When you look a little
bit more carefully

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.400
you start to see two
main themes here.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.650
One is a whole host of
geometrical curves, and then

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.940
certain phenomena.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.900
And the phenomena include
waves in a pond, water,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.320
there are clouds on the
right side of this image.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.450
There is the hair of
this old gentleman

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.930
which looks almost like
the clouds, exactly,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.590
and things like that.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.610
Then there is the
phenomenon of branching.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.580
You have this plant right
in the middle of the figure.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.940
You have a tree right
underneath the old gentleman.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.810
And you cannot
quite see it here,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.090
but if you look up close at
this image, you will see that,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.520
actually, the
branches of the tree,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.020
they are transformed into
the veins of the old man,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.700
seen through his coat.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.390
So the two phenomena
here are curves--

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.940
and things related
to these curves--

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.290
and branching.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.440
So this gives you a little
bit of an idea of how

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.450
his mind might have worked.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.030
You see, he was very
visually inspired,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.860
by things that look
in certain ways.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.690
So let's say he
started studying, OK,

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.710
how do waves propagate from
a pebble thrown into a pond?

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.840
He looked at that,
and he said, aha,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.530
there are some geometrical
curves associated with that.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.800
Once he had those curves,
he started thinking,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.460
but in what other phenomena
do I see curves like this?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.280
And that led him, let's
say, to the clouds,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.710
or to the hair of
this gentleman.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.230
And, you know, if you
look at his drawings,

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.340
when he draws flows of water--

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.930
which is a phenomenon
he dealt with a lot--

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.990
then his drawings
of flows of water

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.540
look very much like
braids of hair.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.270
And when you look at
these drawings of hair--

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.570
for example, the National
Gallery in Washington DC

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.480
has his painting
"Ginevra de Benci,"

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.300
you look at the hair at
the front of her face,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.850
and it looks just
like turbulent water.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.180
So he really connected
these things in his mind,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.400
and thought about them together.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.650
Now what was he interested in?

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.790
In everything.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.220
You know, you look at the
collection of books he had--

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.640
at one point in
time, 106 books--

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.180
there is almost no topic that
he didn't have a book on.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.870
There is one topic that he
really stayed completely off,

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.000
and that was politics.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.300
And that was a very good idea,
because he lived at the time

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.040
when the Borgias reigned.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.080
And the Borgias--
just everybody who

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.770
got involved in their politics
got more or less killed.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.620
Leonardo, by staying
completely out of politics,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.700
actually managed to have them
patron his works, and funding.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.600
So he also was very,
very interested

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.580
in anatomy, of course.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.600
And his interest in
this was very different

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.690
from that of almost
anybody at his time.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.360
Because, you see,
the theory of anatomy

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.110
that was prevailing
then was done by Galen,

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.360
you know, in ancient Greece.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.360
And everybody just
adhered to that.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.640
And what they used to do--
even when they already

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.110
did dissection on corpses, and
so on, all they tried to do

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.990
is to prove that
Galen was right.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.030
Leonardo, on the
other hand, he didn't

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.800
want to prove that
anybody was right.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.750
He wanted to learn what's there.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.130
So, for example, in the heart--
to which he spent more time

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.210
than to any other organ--

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.220
he discovered the
arteries of the heart--

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.650
which weren't known before him--

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.150
what their role was.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.260
He discovered how heat
is generated in the body,

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.880
through the flow of the
blood, and things like that.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.970
So he really he showed
this epistemic curiosity.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.960
He tried to learn
by being so curious.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.310
The second person I discuss in
the book is Richard Feynman.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.960
Richard Feynman, of course,
is a legendary physicist.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.330
There is almost no
branch in physics

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.070
to which he did not contribute.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.020
But he also did work in biology.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.040
He also was a drummer,
you know, on a bongo.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.140
He actually went, even, to
Brazil to learn to drum.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.020
He was interested in
Mayan hieroglyphs.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.110
He was interested
in safe cracking.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.250
And generally, he
basically had this notion

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.560
that everything is
interesting, if you

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.170
get into it deeply enough.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.790
Now, at one point, Feynman
started to learn how to draw.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:47.940
Because he said that there is
this beauty in nature, which

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.880
is a beauty not of the
type that, you know,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.720
what normally painters do--

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.080
but a beauty in the
understanding of what nature

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.250
is all about.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.110
And he wanted to be
able to draw this.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.520
So he asked his friend
Zorthian, who was a painter,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.170
to teach him how to draw.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.470
And he actually tried
to teach him physics.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.370
Wasn't particularly successful
in teaching the artist physics,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:20.130
but he, himself,
became OK in drawing.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.390
And I want to show you a
page from his notebook.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.580
And this is a page from
Feynman's notebook.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.320
And just look at this.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.680
The mathematics is, of course,
more complex than it is

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.630
in Leonardo's.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.680
And the drawing is
of lesser quality

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.020
than the drawings of Leonardo.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.960
But other than that, I mean,
this could have been-- you

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.290
know, you could have
exchanged their notebooks.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.890
They both were interested,
literally, in everything.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.090
So you know, these
two people, of course,

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.000
come at the very extreme
edge of curiosity,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
compared to almost
any other people.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.670
Let's now get into the
research on curiosity.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:12.990
So in 1994 psychologist
George Loewenstein,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:17.370
from Carnegie Mellon
University, proposed

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:22.290
a model for curiosity, which
was called the information gap

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.370
model.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.260
What was this model?

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.830
The idea was the following.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.020
That when we see
something that does not

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.370
agree with our beliefs, or
what we know, or what we think

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.470
we know, a gap is formed.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:44.340
It generates an adversive,
unpleasant state in our mind.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.490
And that curiosity
is the mechanism

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.110
by which we try to get rid
of this unpleasantness,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.220
by finding new information.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.300
So curiosity, in the
information gap model,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.176
is a little bit like an itch
that you have to scratch.

00:16:02.176 --> 00:16:04.050
So you have an itch,
you have to scratch it--

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.150
that's what he says.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:12.240
Now associated with this is
this inverted U-shaped curve

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.330
of curiosity as a
function of knowledge.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.470
The idea is the following.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.970
You see, the claim is-- and I
will show you that experiments

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.800
actually confirm this--

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.790
when we know about
something very, very little,

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.250
we're not curious about
it, because we don't

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.830
know what to be curious about.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.720
When we know about it a lot, we
feel we know almost everything,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.230
we're also not curious
about it, because, you know,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.140
what we don't know
is very little,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.360
and it's deemed unimportant.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.170
When we get curious is at
the middle of this curve.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.580
Namely, when we know
something about the subject,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.630
but we also feel that there
is much more to be known.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:02.640
That's when we become truly
curious about something.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.339
Now believe it or not, but a
former Secretary of Defense

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.430
actually once-- without
knowing about curiosity,

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.200
or any such thing--

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:20.220
actually captured this idea
of this inverted U-curve.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.680
This was Donald Rumsfeld, who
once had a press conference

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.090
in 2012, before the Iraq war.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.610
He was asked at the
press conference, what

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.550
does he have to
say about the fact

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:40.260
that there is no evidence that
Iraq is transferring weapons

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.850
of mass destruction to
terrorist organizations?

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.014
And that was his answer--

00:17:47.014 --> 00:17:47.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.460
- There are known knowns--

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.990
there are things
we know we know.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.710
We also know there
are known unknowns--

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.400
that is to say we know there
are some things we do not know.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.180
But there are also
unknown unknowns--

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.060
the ones we don't
know we don't know.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.890
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.230
MARIO LIVIO: That was his
answer to that question.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:10.110
Now there is a British
organization that, every year,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.560
gives the Foot in
the Mouth Award

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.470
for somebody-- for some
statement they made.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:22.410
They gave it to him that year,
for the most baffling statement

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.430
made by a politician.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:30.870
And, by the way, the
runner up that year--

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.890
number two prize-- was
actually given to Arnold

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.390
Schwarzenegger--

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.640
former governor of this state--

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.490
who said, I think that
gay marriage is something

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.990
between a man and his wife.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:49.090
So he got the second
prize for that.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:55.770
Now what Rumsfeld said,
it's very funny as an answer

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.070
to a question about weapons
of mass destruction.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.490
But actually, as a
statement, is actually

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.590
a very logical statement.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.950
You see, there are
things we know we know,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.820
there are things we
know we don't know,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.740
and there are things we
don't know we don't know.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.110
Now this actually captures
that curve of curiosity.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.540
You see, when we
know we know, that's

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.280
when we think we
know everything,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.410
and we're not curious anymore.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.010
When it's unknown unknowns,
we're also not curious,

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.500
because we don't know
what to be curious about.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.940
When are we curious?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.820
When there are known unknowns.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.550
When there are things we
know that we don't know,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.440
that's when we become curious.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.040
So oddly enough, this
bizarre statement--

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.840
which is, however, logical--

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.540
actually captures that thing.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.710
Now experiments
actually confirmed

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.940
the idea that, at least
for perceptual curiosity--

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.570
I remind you,
that's the curiosity

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:02.790
you feel when there is something
puzzling or ambiguous--

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:08.050
then it is actually associated
with an unpleasant feeling,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.470
and it also activates
those regions in the brain.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.970
How do they do that?

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.280
How can neuroscientists
do these experiments?

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.310
So what they do today--

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.460
I mean, they have tools
that once were not

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.170
available to them--

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.480
they can do functional MRI.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.110
Namely, they can put
people inside MRI machines,

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.520
and can try to
make them curious,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.650
and to see which regions of
their brains are activated.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.950
Now these are not
easy experiments,

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:44.170
because you cannot take somebody
and tell them, be curious now.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.240
You know, that's not possible.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.280
So what they do is, for example,
in this particular experiment--

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.260
conducted by Marieke Jepma,
a Dutch neuroscientist--

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.190
is that they showed people this
collection of images, where

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.620
they first show them
a blurred image,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.870
and then they show
them clear images,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.110
sometimes of the same object,
like the accordion here.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.360
They show a blurred
image of an accordion.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.880
They ask people what, do they
think that is, and so on,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.870
try to make them
curious about that.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.900
And then they show them
the real accordion.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.230
Now, in order to confuse them,
so that people don't always

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.450
expect the same
thing, sometimes they

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.840
show them a blurred imagine
and a clear image of something

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.670
completely different,
and things like this.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.800
Like, you see, they
show something there,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.317
and then they show this
tiger, which are unrelated--

00:21:32.317 --> 00:21:33.400
and things of that nature.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.890
But what they found
was that indeed,

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.340
for the case of
perceptual curiosity,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.220
the regions in our
brain that are activated

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.250
are those that are
associated with conflict--

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.070
with hunger, with
thirst, things like that.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.380
So it's like a basic need.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.700
It's an unpleasant situation.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.370
So for perceptual curiosity,
the information gap model

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.870
actually works quite well.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:08.410
And it also shows this
inverted U-shaped curve.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.660
Now what about
epistemic curiosity?

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.940
I remind you, that's the
true love of knowledge.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.530
The thing that drives us to be
scientists, things like that.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.830
So there is another experiment
done by a researcher named

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.410
Kang, and her collaborators.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.930
And what they did
in this case, is

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:33.250
they presented the subjects with
a series of trivia questions.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.650
I remind you, this is--

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.630
we're testing, now, the love
of knowledge, the wanting

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.580
to learn, things of that nature.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.840
So they presented them
with trivia questions,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.640
such as, I don't know--

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.460
which musical instrument
was invented so as

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.280
to sound like a human voice?

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.040
OK, do you know what that is?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.910
The violin, yeah.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.110
So questions like this.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.900
And they also checked
how curious people

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.880
were about this, and so on.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:13.170
And they discovered that
in this case, actually,

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:18.330
curiosity was associated
with a pleasurable state.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.130
And this actually
has been suggested

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:25.530
by another psychologist
named Spielberger.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.640
That when we want to learn
something, that's associated

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.920
with a pleasurable state.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.170
And indeed, the
areas of the brain

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.350
that were activated by
this type of curiosity

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.520
were those associated with
an anticipation of a reward.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.660
Of a reward.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:49.740
Namely, our brains interpret
the acquisition of knowledge

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.060
as a reward.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.600
It's a bit like when
we get chocolate,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.410
or when we get drugs,
or we win the lottery,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.460
or things like that.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.230
An anticipation of reward.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:05.190
When you sit in a theater in a
play you always wanted to see,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.920
and you wait for the curtain
to go up-- things like that.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:15.920
So in other words, in terms of
these two types of curiosity,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:22.080
not only are they associated
with different states of mind.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.100
Namely, perceptual
curiosity-- this surprised

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.240
ambiguous stimuli, and so
on, is an unpleasant state,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.410
an aversive state.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.550
And it also triggers regions in
the brain that are associated

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.900
with such states.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.090
In the case of
epistemic curiosity,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.990
this love of knowledge,
this is a pleasurable state,

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.030
an anticipation of reward--

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.330
and it triggers areas
in the brain that are

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.180
associated with such rewards.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.090
Now all of these experiments
that I've described so far

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.980
are done with adults.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.510
In fact, you may know--
or you may not know--

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.790
that most experiments
in psychology,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.540
until fairly recently, were
done with either freshmen

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.400
or sophomore students.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.550
So there were some
people that jokingly

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.880
used to say that, in fact,
all the results in psychology

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.520
only apply to that
demographic, because all

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.850
the experiments were done
with those type of people.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.500
But in recent, already,
couple of decades,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.950
people started doing experiments
with very small children, even.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.540
Very, very small children.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.910
So I want to describe to
you an experiment here

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.240
that was done at MIT.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.270
And the idea is the following.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.230
There is a very small child.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.840
And the child is shown
a particular toy.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.590
And when the researcher
presses a button on the toy,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.870
the toy makes a certain noise.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.534
And then you will see
what happens after that.

00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:51.200
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.120
- 2, 3, go.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.190
MARIO LIVIO: So she
now presses the button,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.031
and it makes a noise.

00:25:57.031 --> 00:25:57.530
- Wow!

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.040
MARIO LIVIO: So look, the
child already wants it.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.386
Already wants that toy.

00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:03.171
- --2, 3, go.

00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:04.920
MARIO LIVIO: She presses
the button again.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.364
Again, the noise.

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:07.730
- Wow, that's pretty cool, huh?

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.910
MARIO LIVIO: Now the
researcher shows the child

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.790
that she has two other
things that look similar,

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.460
of different color.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.620
She puts one there, and
she gives the green toy

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.280
to the child.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.920
The child immediately
tries to press it,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.930
and it doesn't make the noise.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.640
So look what the child does--

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.100
turns to his or her parent.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.220
Because she thinks--
or he thinks--

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.010
maybe I'm doing
something wrong here.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.800
Now she's giving the
child the yellow toy,

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.400
which looks a bit different, but
still has something that looks

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.310
a bit like the previous button.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.330
So look, she will try--

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.530
or he will try--

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.740
to press it, but
nothing happened.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.660
Now, she says, ah,
maybe it's broken.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.320
So she bangs it, you see.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.590
But now she sees
the red toy, that's

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.210
there on that piece of cloth.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.910
So look what she
does-- or he does.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.980
Look, pop, and gets that.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:01.970
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:07.710
So this very small child
was able, first of all,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.540
to understand
confounded evidence--

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.950
namely the fact that it
didn't work for him or her--

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:17.970
you cannot tell here if
it's a boy or a girl--

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.550
could be of two causes.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.940
Maybe she's doing
something wrong,

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.530
or maybe the toy is broken.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.850
And found a way to
get to the other toy.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:36.610
Now it turns out that what small
children are most interested

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.520
about are cause and effect.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.160
They want to understand
cause and effect.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.460
You know how small children
ask why all the time?

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.450
Why ne, ne, ne?

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.210
Why da, da, da?

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.920
Why that?

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.090
Sometimes it drives you nuts.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.300
But they ask because
they want to understand.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.350
They understand very early
on that every effect is

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.240
linked to some cause.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.400
And they want to
understand that.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.360
Now what that does,
is it also makes

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.090
for a very specific prediction.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.600
And the prediction is that
when children like this

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.930
will see a situation
which violates

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:18.760
their expectation, then
they would be most curious.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.940
Because that disagrees
with what they expected.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.210
They want to
decrease to a minimum

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.590
their predictive errors.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.490
Which is-- I'm sure you do in
your professional life, too--

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.600
is try to reduce to a minimum
your predictive errors.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.790
Now here is an experiment
that tested this idea.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.100
And the experiment looks
something like this.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.260
There is an object--

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.380
this blue object,
which looks, you know,

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.570
it's not symmetrical--

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.010
and the object can
in principle be put

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.530
in equilibrium on this pole.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:01.400
Now the experiment was done
with three groups of children.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.500
Ones aged, roughly, average
five, six, and seven.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.940
So what the researchers
did was the following.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.060
First, they asked
the kids, you know,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.600
to try to balance this
asymmetrical object

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.430
on the pole.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.050
Now there were kids,
especially the--

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.040
well, there are the
smaller kids who

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.850
really didn't know what to do.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:30.470
But the middle kids, they
tended, more than not,

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.190
to try to balance it at
the geometrical middle.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.630
You know, like
lower left picture

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.970
there, where it is balanced
exactly in the middle.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.730
The somewhat bigger kids--

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.070
actually who had some
notion of center of mass,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.960
things like that--

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.350
tried to balance it more
closer to the heavier

00:29:54.350 --> 00:30:00.140
edge, like in the top
right image, in this case.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.820
Now, what the researchers did
was something very clever.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.780
The kids took the thing, and
wanted to place it there.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.900
The researchers looked
to see, where do they

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.110
try to place it, in the middle,
or close to the heavier edge.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.410
But before they put it there,
they grabbed the from them.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:24.080
So they knew now what was
the belief of the children.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.820
They knew if the
children thought

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.830
that it is in the middle,
or thought that it

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.230
is at the center of mass.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.920
Now they showed the kids a
particular configuration--

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.990
let's say like the
lower left, where

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.470
it's balanced in the middle.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.670
That was belief
consistent to the kids who

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.710
thought it should
be in the middle,

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.250
and belief violating to the
kids who thought it should

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.110
be at the center of mass.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.590
And what they discovered
is that whenever

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.950
it was belief violating,
the kids really

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.200
wanted to explore more.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.290
The other kids just wanted
to play with a new toy.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.680
And this was true also in
the other case, you know,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.410
where it was at
the center of mass.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.520
Again, the same type of
situation repeated itself.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.560
Now they even
added another trick

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.880
on to this, when they showed
some kids that actually

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.750
the thing was
balanced where it was

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.170
balanced because there
was a magnet there,

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.350
holding it in place.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.360
Once they showed that
there is a magnet there,

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.260
the kids didn't care any more
if it was belief violating,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.680
because they say, oh, the
magnet does it, and that's it.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.970
So kids really are interested
in cause and effect,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.610
very, very much.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:46.750
OK, how did we get to
the situation, where

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:51.501
our brains are able to do all
these questions why, and so on,

00:31:51.501 --> 00:31:52.000
and this?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.930
And other animals, believe
it or not, they cannot.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:02.020
I mean, we are the only
species that asks why.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.350
Other animals can be
curious, but they are not

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.790
interested in why.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.110
How do we know that?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.984
How do we know that
chimpanzees don't know--

00:32:10.984 --> 00:32:12.400
well, these are
gorillas-- but how

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.330
do we know that
chimpanzees don't ask why?

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.770
I'll tell you how.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.020
There's a very
interesting experiment

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.810
that did the following.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.810
Took kids-- average age
between three and five--

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.540
and a whole bunch
of chimpanzees.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.920
And they took an object which
looked completely symmetrical,

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.330
and it could be made to
stand, but the researchers hid

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:41.800
inside some weights that made
it such that you couldn't really

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.640
make it stand.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.840
It just kept falling.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.010
Whatever you did,
it kept falling.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.730
The kids-- these
very small kids--

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.730
once they saw you
cannot make it stand,

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.090
more than 60% of
them took the thing,

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.870
examined it from all sides,
examined it with their hands,

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.490
you know, and so on.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.640
None of the chimpanzees
did any of that.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.750
The chimpanzees just kept
trying to make it stand.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.320
The chimpanzees really
did not understand

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.110
that there is some
hidden question here

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.440
that needs to be answered--
why that thing doesn't stand.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.640
They even identified,
actually, the region

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.410
in the brain that is
different between humans

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.410
and, let's say, macaque monkeys.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.820
They did experiments
with macaques.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.640
So humans are the
only ones who ask why.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.390
Now why is that?

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.010
Well, partly it may
be related to the fact

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:43.050
that we have about 86
billion neurons in our heads,

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:48.270
and the chimpanzees or gorillas,
they have about a third

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.430
of that.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.990
Now how did all of that happen?

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.050
In particular, what
counts is the neurons

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.470
in our cerebral cortex,
and in the striatum.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.220
This is where, you know, all
our consciousness, if you like,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:01.720
lies.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.460
This is Lucy.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.530
This is the skeleton of Lucy.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:12.389
This is the nearly human female
that was found in Ethiopia.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.630
It dates to 3.2
million years ago.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.940
It's a pre-human type thing.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.420
This is what they think
Lucy probably looked like.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:27.540
She was about 3 and 1/2 feet
tall, walked mostly upright,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.210
and ate probably mostly fruit--

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.820
but was a vegetarian in
general, mostly fruit.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.150
But then when you start
looking at the Homo species--

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.100
you know, Homo
habilis, the handyman;

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.110
and then Homo erectus,
that walks on two feet;

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:50.250
and eventually Homo
sapiens, which we are--

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.909
and you look at the way
their brain increased,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.960
it is something amazing.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.800
I mean, the brain, from
the time of Lucy, increased

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.300
by a factor of three, or so.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.610
And what caused that?

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.250
Well it turns out that's
a complicated question,

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:14.400
because the brain also
consumes a lot of energy.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.680
The human brain
consumes about 25%

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.050
of the energy
consumption of the body,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.000
even though in weight our brain
is only like 3%, or something.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.440
In other species the brain
consumes only about 10%

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.020
of the energy
consumption of the body.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.070
So why is that?

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.180
What's going on?

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.370
Well, the real
difference in that

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.380
is in the number
of neurons we have.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.210
And like I said, especially
in our cerebral cortex.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:48.110
But, OK, so there is a
difference between primates--

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:52.520
which is, you know, all the
apes and us-- and other species.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.950
And that difference
is in how many

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:58.210
neurons you can pack
into a smaller volume.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:02.960
In humans it scales linearly.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.910
Namely, if you want
a brain to have

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:11.780
twice the number of neurons,
the brain will weigh twice.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.520
So it scales linearly.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.935
On the other hand, in, let's
say, rodents, or the power load

00:36:18.935 --> 00:36:20.870
is completely different.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:24.530
If you want a brain that
has 10 times more neurons,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.910
the brain has to
weigh 50 times more.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.820
So that gives primates
their first advantage

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.530
over other species.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.880
We can cram more neurons
into a smaller volume.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.090
But that still doesn't
explain why we ask why,

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.050
and not the chimpanzees,
and the gorillas,

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.780
and so on, which are
actually even bigger than us.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:52.970
But this is where this business
of the energy comes in.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.990
Because, you see, there
is only so much energy

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:03.230
that an animal can produce
from foraging for food.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:07.070
Because an animal cannot search
for food for more than eight

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.940
or nine hours a day,
or it would just die.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.320
So you look at the maximum
that it can forage,

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:20.260
and then you look at, OK, how
much weight you can support,

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.070
and what kind of a
brain you can support.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.580
And when you look at
that, in simple terms,

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.450
it turns out that
for 165 pounds,

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.030
let's say, you can
support, at most, maybe

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.040
30 billion neurons--

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.410
which is about a
third of what we have.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:41.320
So what gave us this advantage
over these other primates?

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.680
Well, nobody knows precisely
the answer to that,

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.350
but it's probably a
combination of a few factors.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.650
One is, believe it
or not, cooking.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.880
So you're here at Google.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.750
You get very good food,
which is being cooked,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:57.740
and that's very good.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.990
Because cooking allows
you to get more energy

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.440
from the same type of thing,
because you can digest it

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.630
more easily.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.210
You can digest types of food
that otherwise our body could

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:18.060
not digest, you know, like rice,
let's say, or things like that.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.900
And so there are a
few other things.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.820
The digestive
system, as a result

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.600
of cooking and other things,
became shorter in humans.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.010
And the digestive system
consumes a lot of energy

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.990
by itself.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.365
Walking upright is another
thing, because walking on four,

00:38:33.365 --> 00:38:37.060
and knuckles consumes more
energy than walking on two.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:43.220
And what I like to say
is that curiosity also

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.870
played a role in this mix, in
a way of some sort of feedback.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:52.030
Because, you see, imagine
these early humans once

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:58.430
saw a fire hit the forest, and
then some animal got burned.

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:02.000
Then out of curiosity, OK,
they tried to eat that.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.900
And they found that, aha,
this is easier to chew,

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.090
and it tastes, maybe,
better, and things like that.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:16.070
Or, you know, Homo habilis
started to do some tools.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.120
He or she discovered
that, oh, if I somehow

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.370
sharpen this branch here,
then I can get into the bones

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.670
and get the bone marrow out of
that, and that's very tasty.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:29.710
And things like that.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:37.350
So a combination of these
factors gave us our advantage.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:42.760
Now from everything
I've told you so far,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.640
you realize that
curiosity actually

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.460
is one of the most important
things in our lives.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.040
Because it drives
almost everything

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.280
we do, from a simple
conversation--

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.810
you would not have a
conversation with somebody

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.210
if he or she bores you stiff.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.430
I mean, you have to be
somewhat curious about what

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:04.960
they have to say.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.490
You would not read
a book, or a blog,

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.840
or anything if you're
not curious about what

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.700
this person has to say.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.440
You will not see a
film if you are not

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.310
somewhat curious about it.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.270
And you will not get
involved in research

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.550
if you are not
curious about it--

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.440
unless, of course,
your boss forces

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.390
you to get engaged
in that research.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.180
But generally, I
mean, somebody had

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.760
to be curious
about that in order

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.590
to start that research project.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.160
Right?

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.550
So curiosity drives
all of these things.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.560
Now given that
that's the situation,

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.110
you might have thought that
at all times, and at all ages,

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:48.310
people would always encourage
and support curiosity.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.050
Well, that's not the case.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:54.230
For example, in the
Middle Ages, there

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.450
were entire periods
where, you know,

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.960
church orthodoxy or
other things actually

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.740
tried to build walls around
various types of knowledge

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.590
and say, oh, we
already know everything

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.690
that is worth knowing,
and you shouldn't

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:10.400
be curious about other things.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.440
That's not good for you.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.540
This manifested itself
even in fairy tales.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.950
Here is just a drawing of
Hansel and Gretel, you know,

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:25.460
who go exploring in the forest,
find this house made of candy,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.490
and fall into the hands
of a cannibalistic witch.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.910
That's not exactly
encouraging curiosity.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:35.480
And there are more
complicated things than this.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.340
In 1937 the Nazi regime
organized in Munich

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.270
the Degenerate Art Exhibit,
where they collected all

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.620
the works of all the masters
of modern art-- you know,

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.710
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paul
Klee, all these people--

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.140
and put them together
in an exhibit

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.510
which was supposed to
convince the masses that this

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:01.040
is all some malicious
plot of Jews

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.740
in communist against Germany.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.180
This is Goebbels visiting
this art exhibit.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.870
So you see all of
these things, and we

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.920
must be very careful
about our curiosity.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.500
And I coined a phrase,
which I'm very proud of,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.220
which is, curiosity is
the best remedy for fear.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.730
Because, you see, we are
very often afraid of things

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.070
that we don't know,
or don't understand,

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:32.540
or look strange to us.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:37.600
And if you become
curious about them,

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.600
then you are not any
more fearful of them.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.600
And I was very satisfied
when I discovered that--

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.470
you know, I thought I invented
this phrase, and I did.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.440
But I wasn't the only one
who thought about something

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.130
like this.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.580
In 2008 there was an art
exhibit in Copenhagen,

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.130
and they put this sign up--

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.210
replace fear of the
unknown with curiosity--

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.450
which is very much the same.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.320
Now as part of this
book I also, I told you,

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.700
I interviewed nine exceptionally
curious people who live today.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.450
So I'll tell you very
quickly who they are.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:18.100
So Freeman Dyson-- who is
a legendary physicist--

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:23.480
Noam Chomsky, Story
Musgrave, Fabiola Gianotti,

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:34.340
Marilyn vos Savant, Jack
Horner, Martin Rees, Brian May,

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.210
and Vik Muniz.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.520
Let me tell you very
briefly who they are.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:44.720
Vik Muniz is a Brazilian artist
who recreates works of art

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.040
from everything.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.240
From chocolate syrup he can
recreate the "Mona Lisa."

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.365
From mustard and diamonds
he recreates, you

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:56.500
know, maybe "The Night Watch."

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.840
He used garbage and
garbage collectors

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.700
to recreate masterful
works of art.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:09.800
Brian May was the lead guitarist
of Queen, the rock band.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.040
But he's also a PhD
in astrophysics.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.600
He was the Chancellor of John
Moores University in Liverpool.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.430
He's a big, big advocate
for animal rights.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:25.280
He is an expert in
Victorian stereophotography.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.950
So he has many interests.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:32.030
Lord Martin Rees, a
very famous cosmologist,

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.390
but also founded the Center
for Existential Risks,

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.390
about all the risks
that humanity is facing,

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.220
and things of that nature.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.020
Jack Horner is from Montana.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.040
He is a big paleontologist.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:52.280
He was science advisor to all
the "Jurassic Park" movies.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.960
He's also extremely dyslectic.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.210
He told me that he can read
today like a second grader.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.340
And, you know, when I asked
him, how is that possible?

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:09.522
How can you do research
if you cannot read?

00:45:09.522 --> 00:45:10.730
And you know what he told me?

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:14.750
He said, I tell my students,
if you do it first,

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.190
you don't have to
read that much.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.980
And it's true, at some level.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:25.630
Marilyn vos Savant is
actually an autodidact--

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.970
she never finished even
an undergraduate degree--

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:37.310
but she has the highest
recorded IQ in history, 228.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:42.740
I remind you that above 140,
you're considered a genius.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.690
So now, of course,
the scale, actually,

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.610
is completely unreliable by the
time you get to those places.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:55.590
But the fact that she's very
high up there is enough.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:56.840
This is Fabiola Gianotti.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.170
She is the Director
General of CERN in Geneva.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.060
You know, the Large
Hadron Collider?

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.170
She led one of the teams that
discovered the Higgs boson.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.500
But her first
degree was in music.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.810
She is an accomplished pianist.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.270
Plays to this very day.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.790
Story Musgrave-- a
very famous astronaut--

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.450
he serviced the Hubble
Space Telescope.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:25.700
But he also has degrees in
literature, in engineering,

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.890
in computer science.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.960
He's a medical doctor, he's a
pilot, he has seven children.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:41.380
I mean, you know, he
just did everything.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.630
Noam Chomsky needs
no introduction.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.620
He's a very famous linguist, but
also interested in the brain,

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.180
in music, in many things.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.020
He's a political
activist, and so on.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.620
And Freeman Dyson is
a legendary physicist.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:04.690
You know, formulated
different versions of QED--

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.580
of quantum electrodynamics.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.300
But he did-- there is almost no
branch in physics, mathematics,

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.740
and so on, he didn't work on.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.150
Even biology.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.790
So these were the
people I interviewed.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:22.810
And the thing that I found most
amazing about each one of them

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:23.830
is the following.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.130
And that's maybe
the biggest lesson.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:31.030
That at every stage
in their life,

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:36.400
it doesn't matter what their
principal occupation was,

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:41.290
they were open to new
problems and questions.

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:45.580
They saw around them, all
the time, new opportunities

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.590
and new things that
need to be solved.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:53.740
You know, Freeman Dyson,
after his 90th birthday,

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.390
give an interview where he tries
to find an algorithm that will

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:02.020
make clinical trials safer.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.600
You know, at his 90th birthday.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.920
So at all ages you
can still be curious.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.600
Now I cannot finish a talk about
curiosity without returning

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.850
to Leonardo, who said once,
"Blinding ignorance does

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:20.140
mislead us.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:20.730
O!

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.690
wretched mortals,
open your eyes!"

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:28.440
And the one person
that is my icon--

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:33.760
I'm an astrophysicist-- and who
opened his eyes all the time.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:42.150
Einstein here opening his eyes
once, and twice, and thrice.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.020
Thank you very much.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.710
MARK: Hey, we have a little
bit of time for questions.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.890
And here's a question.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.230
AUDIENCE: What would you say is
the relation between creativity

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:53.160
and curiosity?

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.090
MARIO LIVIO: Yes.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.670
The relation between
creativity and curiosity.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:00.709
OK, so there is this very
well-known psychologist

00:49:00.709 --> 00:49:02.000
from the University of Chicago.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.990
He's now retired,
but very well-known.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.870
His name is Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:10.950
And he actually did a
big study on creativity.

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:15.330
In particular, he interviewed
about 100 creative people.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:19.800
And he discovered that
curiosity was absolutely

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.140
essential to each one of them.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.530
So creativity and
curiosity are not the same,

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:29.220
but curiosity appears to
be a necessary ingredient

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.620
for creativity.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.640
Any other questions?

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.460
MARK: Other questions?

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.700
AUDIENCE: So sometimes I
think about the downside

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.214
of curiosity.

00:49:39.214 --> 00:49:40.130
MARIO LIVIO: The what?

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:41.800
AUDIENCE: The downside
of curiosity--

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.508
MARIO LIVIO: Yes.

00:49:42.508 --> 00:49:44.960
AUDIENCE: --which is
the fear of missing out.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.570
I think that I feel like
I don't have enough time

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.870
to try everything, and I
often feel sad about that.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.120
When you interview
people-- or maybe yourself,

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.760
when you think about
that, what do you think?

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.062
How people deal with that?

00:49:57.062 --> 00:49:57.770
MARIO LIVIO: Yes.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:04.670
So, indeed, look, you cannot
be curious about everything.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.010
There just isn't
enough time for that,

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.660
even if you wanted
to be curious.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.180
So you do have to be a little
bit selective in the things

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.520
that you get curious about, yes.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.810
But the thing is the following.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:23.120
The problem is very often the
opposite of what you describe.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:28.310
Namely, people who get so
immersed in what they do,

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:32.280
that, you know,
it's not even clear

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:36.150
that they are driven
any more by curiosity.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:42.370
Maybe they are just driven
by the wanting to succeed.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.940
Which is not exactly
the same, yes?

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.480
So they want to succeed, or
they want to make more money.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.970
So they are not really
driven by curiosity.

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:54.090
They are driven by wanting
to make more money.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.290
I'm not saying there is
something against that.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.590
But this is more
often the problem

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.240
than the problem you describe.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.600
You describe somebody
who is curious, wants

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.660
to be curious about
many things, but maybe

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.130
doesn't quite have the time to
get curious about everything.

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:15.390
So, you know,
prioritize your things.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.020
Namely, choose a few things that
you are really curious about,

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.820
and get interested about them.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.670
And, you know, in
different stages in life,

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.650
you actually may do--

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.110
you see, I didn't
start writing books.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.380
I worked in astrophysics
most of my life.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:35.400
And only in 2000 I started
writing popular science books.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.110
This is my sixth book.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.890
So until that, I wasn't that
interested in writing books.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.240
I wanted to write papers.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.210
I wrote more than 400 papers.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:52.090
But then at one point in my
life, I said, you know what,

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.220
suppose I will write
10 more papers,

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.830
20 more papers, 50 more papers.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:00.280
Is that really going to
make a huge difference?

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.160
And, you know, very often
you decide that probably not,

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.730
because being a
theoretical physicist,

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.840
we tend to do our best work
when we're relatively young.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.490
So at that point
I said, well, let

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:14.470
me try to reach a
broader audience,

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.510
you know, and so on,
and started to be

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:18.160
interested in science writing.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.030
So you may still find
the time in your life

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.950
when you would be curious
about something else.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:28.780
I, all the time, for example,
I am very interested in art--

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.120
was always interested in art.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.200
So I, you know, do science,
and I always liked art.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.040
I have no talents in art, but
I'm very interested in art,

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.040
so I have many art books
and things like that.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.285
Yes, please.

00:52:44.285 --> 00:52:45.970
AUDIENCE: There
have been arguments

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:49.000
about how violence-- for
instance, Steven Pinker

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.310
wrote a book saying that
violence has decreased over,

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:54.160
you know, since the beginning
of dawn of humanity till now.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.160
He did, like, 500
pages of research.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.900
Similarly, we know
that life expectancy

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.960
has increased over time.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.210
Can we say something like
that about curiosity?

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:07.565
Do you think it has changed,
or increased, or decreased?

00:53:07.565 --> 00:53:08.440
MARIO LIVIO: So, yes.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.380
So this is a very important
question, I think.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.690
So there are many people
who think, for example,

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.970
that curiosity
decreases with age.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.580
Because they say, look,
children are so curious

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.830
and, so on, and then
they are less curious.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.440
Well, research shows that
that's not quite the case.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.120
What happens is that diversive
curiosity, and perhaps

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.850
perceptual, does decrease
somewhat with age.

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:35.920
Namely, search for novelty,
and willing to take

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.360
risks for novelty does
decrease somewhat with age.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.560
But epistemic
curiosity, for example,

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.150
this love of
knowledge, and so on,

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:47.200
actually stays fairly
constant across the time.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.570
Now has it changed in terms of,
you know, evolution of humans?

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:56.470
Well, clearly, you
know, I have to think,

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:59.530
even though nobody
knows with certainty,

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.410
that this huge
advantage that we got,

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:04.780
in terms of the
number of neurons

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.570
in our cerebral
cortex and striatum

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.310
had to do something
with the fact

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:13.300
that we are so much more curious
than these other species.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:19.570
So presumably during evolution a
change of that kind did happen.

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:23.470
Now at the same time I noted
these periods in our history

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.020
where, sometimes
curiosity is suppressed,

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.640
or you know, and
so on, so we have

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.880
to be very careful about those.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.750
Yes.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.560
AUDIENCE: Does being curious
have a compounding effect?

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.909
That is to say, if you are--

00:54:36.909 --> 00:54:38.950
MARIO LIVIO: Curious, do
you become more curious?

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:39.940
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:44.350
MARIO LIVIO: Well, you know, I'm
not sure what you do at Google,

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:49.510
but scientists usually
are in a state where

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:53.560
almost answering almost
every question just raises

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.580
more questions.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.160
And sometimes more
profound questions.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.980
For example, in fundamental
physics, that's the case.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:05.860
We keep pushing the questions
farther and farther.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:10.300
Today we answer questions that
100 years ago, we didn't even

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.430
know how to ask.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.200
So there is no
question that there

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.280
is an element like this,
that you could actually

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.350
become even more curious.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.660
But certainly the
opposite is true.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:25.600
I think if you
allow yourself not

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.960
to be curious for a long period
of time, you're probably,

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.750
you know, declining to a
state of lower curiosity.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.560
Now mind you, every
person is curious.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.160
Other than people who
suffer from deep depression

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.700
or have certain brain
injuries, everybody's curious.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.455
Not everybody is
curious the same,

00:55:44.455 --> 00:55:48.280
in the same way that not
everybody is intelligent

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.650
the same, or has some
talents the same.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:57.500
And also not everybody is
curious about the same things.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.680
But they may be curious
about other things.

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.180
MARK: And we have
one more question.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.924
MARIO LIVIO: Please.

00:56:02.924 --> 00:56:05.750
AUDIENCE: Hi, this
was a wonderful talk,

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:12.460
and my last question, I guess,
is about what you believe is--

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.500
how do I ask this?

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.100
So one way to think
about curiosity, I guess,

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.380
is that curiosity can be
like a resulting phenomenon

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.207
from a situation in which you
do have sufficient knowledge,

00:56:29.207 --> 00:56:31.540
but not enough knowledge to
really understand something.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.220
MARIO LIVIO: Right, that's
the information gap, yes.

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.380
AUDIENCE: And then on
the other side of things,

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.790
you could also think of,
like, human capabilities

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:44.990
to feel curious, and/or human
capability to take effect

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.815
and/or act upon that
kind of curiosity.

00:56:46.815 --> 00:56:49.060
I'm wondering what
your views are

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:54.040
on whether you can improve a
human's capability to feel more

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:55.830
curious, or things like that.

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:56.740
MARIO LIVIO: Yeah.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:03.160
So I think this should
start from small children.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:09.080
And the way I think that
works is, you see, sometimes--

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.230
this is a new book,
so I've only had,

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:13.150
so far, a few talks on this.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:17.285
But people ask me, how do I
make my child more curious?

00:57:17.285 --> 00:57:20.980
You know, people ask
me questions like this.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:25.960
Or somebody asked me, how do I
make my coworkers more curious?

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.840
And the way to achieve that--

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.400
again, I'm not a
specialist in education,

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:35.050
but that's my perception from
everything I've now read,

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:38.230
you know, and then learned--

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.890
is that you have to start with
things that they are already

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:43.420
curious about.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.550
And the example
I like to give is

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:49.840
that most small children
are curious about dinosaurs,

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.020
for example.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.850
Most American small children
are curious about dinosaurs.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.880
So if you want to
teach them science,

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.560
don't start with trying to
explain to them the free fall

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.540
acceleration, which they really
don't care about, at all.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.490
Start with dinosaurs!

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.040
Because they are already
interested in that.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.490
And then from
dinosaurs, you know,

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.740
you can perhaps lead them.

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:22.120
If you think about this
thoughtfully enough,

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.590
you can find a way.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.390
You could start
with the dinosaurs,

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:29.890
and then the
dinosaurs, we think,

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:33.490
became extinct because of an
asteroid that hit the Earth.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:37.150
And once an asteroid hit
the Earth you start to--

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:39.190
I'm just saying maybe
you wanted to tell them

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:40.398
about free fall acceleration.

00:58:40.398 --> 00:58:42.940
So you say, OK, an
asteroid hit the Earth.

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.490
Oh, we can actually
try to calculate

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:49.510
how much energy is an asteroid
that hits the Earth, and so on.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:52.750
So start with what
interests them already,

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.080
instead of starting
with what you think

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.940
they should be interested in.

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.411
Because they may not
be interested in that.

00:59:01.411 --> 00:59:03.285
MARK: Thank you so much
for coming to Google.

00:59:03.285 --> 00:59:03.970
MARIO LIVIO: My pleasure.

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:04.980
MARK: And we know
that you're now

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.700
working on the next
book-- which you say

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.320
might take four or five years.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.620
And I'm wondering-- I'll remind
you all, this one is "Why?"

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.250
And we can pick up
copies here today.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:16.540
And I'm wondering if the next
one might be Z for z answer.

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.200
We'll have to stay
tuned to find out.

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.490
Thank you again, Mario Livio.

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.531
MARIO LIVIO: My pleasure.

00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:22.620
[APPLAUSE]
