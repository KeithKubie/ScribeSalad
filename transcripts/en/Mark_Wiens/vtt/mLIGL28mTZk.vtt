00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.464
- Look at how wonderfully oily

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:04.559
and delicious that salmon looks.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.059
That's gonna be my first bite right there.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.112
Good morning everyone it's Mark Wiens

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:20.108
with migrationology.com in New York City.

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:23.945
Just got off the subway
at 2nd Avenue Station.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.388
Crossing the road right now.

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:26.710
We are on our way this morning

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.001
to eat another classic in New York City.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.751
A place for bagels,
cream cheese, and salmon.

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.588
It's about 10:15 am.

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:40.445
This is the Russ &amp; Daughters appetizers.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.124
This is the classic deli,

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:46.505
but they also have a cafe,
I think around the corner.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.721
The line is a little bit out the door

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.584
but we're gonna get in very
soon and then take a number

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:55.751
and then probably have to
wait for a while as well.

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:02.082
What number are we? 345.

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:04.390
First accomplishment,
we got into the door.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.557
We got number 345 and right
now they are one number 333.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.099
Oh, we can look at the
menu here as we're waiting.

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.416
They do have a number
of things on the menu

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:16.382
but I think I'm just gonna go
straight up with the classic,

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:21.287
the bagel with cream cheese
and choice of smoked salmon,

00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:25.037
although I have to choose
the type of salmon.

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:33.625
Russ &amp; Daughters was established in 1914,

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.001
so it's another real classic heritage

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.751
traditional deli restaurant
in New York City.

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:41.734
One classic

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:48.267
with Scottish salmon, everything bagel,

00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:53.051
and the caviar cream cheese.

00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:57.480
Does it come with tomatoes and onions?

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.853
- [Man Behind Counter] Whatever you want.

00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:00.468
- Okay with tomatoes and onions.

00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:02.164
He's making my bagel
in the back right now.

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.628
I got everything bagel

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:06.770
and I just got the caviar cream cheese.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.078
And I decided to go
for the Scottish salmon

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.008
but I was really kind of at a loss

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:12.211
of which salmon to choose.

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.378
There's so many good ones.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.949
And there are no seats
inside the restaurant

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.505
and they just have a
couple benches outside

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.431
but they're all full so

00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:34.827
we're gonna walk down
the road a little bit.

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:36.548
There is a basketball park down the road

00:02:36.548 --> 00:02:37.732
and then also a couple benches

00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.619
right in the middle of the road.

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.929
Maybe right in the middle
of the road is a good idea.

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.631
I was so tempted to order so
many more things in that shop.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.573
Russ &amp; Daughters is really a purveyor

00:02:47.573 --> 00:02:50.401
of some really fine fish and canned goods

00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.299
and preserved, salted things

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.204
and I love just about everything they have

00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:57.671
in that entire shop.

00:02:57.671 --> 00:02:59.950
But the prices are pretty expensive

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.393
so you could definitely spend a fortune.

00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:04.310
It's a very waxy paper.

00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:08.998
Oh yes. And here it is.

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.709
Oh this is beautiful.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.509
Okay, the bagel, I got
the everything bagel,

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.016
and it is a handmade bagel.

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:20.601
It's a boiled bagel and then with topping

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:22.438
sesame seeds and poppy seeds.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:24.619
And then I got the Scottish salmon

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.732
plus the caviar cream cheese,
and then tomatoes and onions.

00:03:28.732 --> 00:03:30.899
I think that's everything.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:35.652
I love how the cream
cheese is just squished.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:36.910
And it's on both sides,

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.970
so then it just squishes through the hole.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.421
And then the salmon in the middle,

00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.588
the juicy tomatoes, okay
I cannot talk any longer.

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:58.329
That is a thing of beauty.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.886
What an exquisite combination.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:05.068
The bagel is nice and chewy and
heavy with that outside skin

00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:07.512
and you can taste that boiledness to it.

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:11.528
Then all of those, kind
of salty seeds on the top,

00:04:11.528 --> 00:04:15.695
then the salmon inside is so
silky, has a smoky flavor,

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.101
and then it's just that cream cheese,

00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:23.459
the thick layer of cream
cheese is awesome as well.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:25.316
I'm not sure if I can taste
the caviar in the cream cheese

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:28.176
but probably I can taste it on its own.

00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:31.299
And then you get a little
bit of that juiciness,

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:34.551
freshness from the tomato and the onion.

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:36.069
That's awesome.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.327
Literally the salmon though
is so creamy and so silky

00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:42.646
that it meshes, blends
in to that cream cheese.

00:04:42.646 --> 00:04:44.587
They almost have the same texture.

00:04:44.587 --> 00:04:46.129
When I took that first
bite the tomato kind of

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.651
shot out the back so I'm
gonna scoot that forward.

00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:51.524
Oh, I lost a little sliver.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.107
Stick that back in.

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.124
And even though there's
not a lot of salmon

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:05.291
on this sandwich, but the
salmon is such good quality

00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:08.632
that you can taste the salmon
throughout the whole sandwich

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:11.014
and I love how they really took their time

00:05:11.014 --> 00:05:11.862
making the sandwich.

00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:13.458
They didn't rush anything.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:16.390
They really sliced everything very thin

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.057
so that it stacks really nicely.

00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:29.068
That's an entire mouthful of cream cheese.

00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:31.318
All the stickiness of that.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:37.686
Oh, and with that salmon mixed
in the middle, those onions.

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:41.641
I'm down to my last bite
and this is the best bite

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.040
because all of the salmon has squished out

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.604
and also a hanging piece of tomato

00:05:46.604 --> 00:05:48.829
has all squished out to the bottom there.

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:51.289
However, it's also a very sad bite.

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:52.930
It's the last bite.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.582
I really should have ordered two.

00:05:54.582 --> 00:05:56.145
You could easily eat two of these.

00:05:56.145 --> 00:05:59.737
They're not very big
and they taste so good

00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:01.390
you could easily order two.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.823
But one, I'm gonna stop at
one because it's so good

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:08.240
and I'm gonna just linger this last bite.

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:16.926
Making sure to lick all
that cream cheese off.

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:19.642
That was incredibly delicious.

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:22.322
It was pretty expensive
though, for how small it was,

00:06:22.322 --> 00:06:25.060
and for just like, one
slice of salmon in it.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.278
But it was extremely delicious.

00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:32.826
Russ &amp; Daughters is
definitely a timeless classic

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:35.993
of culinary heritage in New York City.

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:47.467
Okay we're at Spring Street Station

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:49.967
and heading up to 14th Street.

00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:58.321
Somehow the subway dropped us off,

00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:00.932
maybe there are two 14th street stations,

00:07:00.932 --> 00:07:04.605
I'm not totally sure, but
it's gonna be a couple blocks

00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:06.433
to get to Chelsea Market from here.

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:08.183
So we are on our way.

00:07:19.183 --> 00:07:22.077
We have just arrived to Chelsea Market,

00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:25.024
the heritage classic
market in New York City

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:29.191
and I know it's gonna be a busy
day here as it is Saturday.

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:35.284
I just took a really quick
walk though the market

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:39.066
but the number one place
I wanna eat is Tacos No. 1

00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:41.777
and it's kind of at
the back of the market.

00:07:41.777 --> 00:07:43.377
It's really, really busy.

00:07:43.377 --> 00:07:47.307
There are about, I would
say at least 50 people

00:07:47.307 --> 00:07:49.353
in front of me, but I have gotten in line.

00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:51.610
I don't think the line will take too long.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.949
I'm gonna wait it out for some tacos.

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:55.706
The menu is pretty short and sweet.

00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:58.392
They have tacos, tostadas, quesadillas,

00:07:58.392 --> 00:07:59.850
but I'm gonna keep it all tacos

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.107
and I think I'll get one
of all the tacos they have.

00:08:04.107 --> 00:08:07.774
There's four different
types that they have.

00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:13.280
I'm about to place my order,
that line didn't take too long.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.149
- [Man Behind Counter]
Have a good day guys.

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:15.149
- Thank you.

00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:21.536
What's up man?
- Hi.

00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:27.669
- Can I have half and half.
- Half and half, okay.

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:30.273
Everything on it?
- Everything on it, yes.

00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:33.190
(speaking Spanish)

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.923
- After you pay then you
bring your receipt over here

00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:40.882
and then you can either choose
flour or corn tortillas.

00:08:40.882 --> 00:08:42.693
And then they assemble
them all right here.

00:08:42.693 --> 00:08:45.598
It smells incredible,
and they have a spit.

00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:48.216
On the spit is adobada which is pork

00:08:48.216 --> 00:08:51.358
and it definitely reminds me of the doner,

00:08:51.358 --> 00:08:52.525
thank you man.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.193
Tacos are ready.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:58.125
Oh these are beauties.

00:08:58.125 --> 00:08:59.893
These are absolute beauties.

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:03.523
I'm gonna just go on, so much good sauce.

00:09:03.523 --> 00:09:06.606
Okay, I'll just go with some of this.

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:11.699
This salsa.

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:31.352
I decided to order one taco of each.

00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:34.673
But inside it was so
hectic and it was so busy,

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.067
it was so tight, the lighting was bad

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:40.448
and they were playing like,
10 different types of music

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:44.113
in the Chelsea Market so we
took these plates of tacos

00:09:44.113 --> 00:09:46.659
and came straight for
the exit of the market

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:48.983
and then came to the park which is

00:09:48.983 --> 00:09:50.122
right across the street.

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:53.126
On this plate are two of the
tacos with corn tortillas

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.890
and I think this one is the adobada,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.371
and this one is carne
asada, and then they put

00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:00.685
a handful of onions and cilantro

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:04.580
and also some guacamole and
then I added on some salsa.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.702
And I got some lemon wedges.

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:08.596
I got some fried chilies on the side.

00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:11.013
Squeeze on some of that lime.

00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:16.679
Rehydrate these tacos, some lime.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:19.651
Oh yes, and then I think I'll just go

00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:22.651
for that whole fried chili on there.

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:28.600
Oh yes, these are beauties.
Absolute beauties.

00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:46.450
Oh how I've missed Mexican food.

00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:51.592
Tacos are one of the
best things in the world.

00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:53.591
Oh that is just incredibly good.

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:57.657
The meat has a little bit
of a jerky meat taste.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.477
It's nicely spiced.

00:10:59.477 --> 00:11:00.685
And then with that guacamole,

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:01.772
there's also pineapple on here.

00:11:01.772 --> 00:11:03.907
I got like a sweet burst of pineapple.

00:11:03.907 --> 00:11:06.579
All those salsas, the
onions, the cilantro.

00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:08.186
I had that dried chili in that bite, too.

00:11:08.186 --> 00:11:11.152
The dried chili is not very
spicy but it is very fragrant.

00:11:11.152 --> 00:11:14.035
And that's a good corn tortilla as well.

00:11:14.035 --> 00:11:15.952
Wow, tacos are awesome.

00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:25.626
That's a stunning taco.

00:11:25.626 --> 00:11:26.862
Next up, the pollo asado

00:11:26.862 --> 00:11:28.494
I'll move over to this plate.

00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:30.981
And they've wrapped these
into little cone shapes.

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.814
And these are the flour tortillas.

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:38.478
I almost forgot to squeeze on some lime.

00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:42.645
Lime is a must, I love that
extra sourness and acidity.

00:11:58.287 --> 00:12:00.234
That's really good as well.

00:12:00.234 --> 00:12:02.966
Smoky little pieces of chicken.

00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:05.434
You've got the guacamole
in there, the onions,

00:12:05.434 --> 00:12:07.583
the cilantro, that dried chili,

00:12:07.583 --> 00:12:09.552
and that tortilla is really good as well.

00:12:09.552 --> 00:12:12.128
Even though it's been
sitting for like ten minutes,

00:12:12.128 --> 00:12:15.710
the tortilla has still held
up with all those juices,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.611
even though it's very thin as well.

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.528
That's a good tortilla.

00:12:27.884 --> 00:12:31.673
Mexican food, and particularly tacos,

00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:35.000
are one of the things I
really miss living in Asia.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.167
Next up is the nopal, and
this is a type of cactus.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.457
Add in that dried chili,
oh and another half here.

00:12:47.497 --> 00:12:51.392
And then, you can see the
little pieces of cactus.

00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:53.142
Squeeze on some lime.

00:13:07.197 --> 00:13:10.485
I think this might be my
first time to try this one.

00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:11.851
They almost taste like green chilies,

00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:15.775
but with a little more
of a sliminess to them.

00:13:15.775 --> 00:13:18.435
Yeah it has a sliminess similar to okra,

00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:20.676
and then it has a little
bit of a crispness as well.

00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:22.843
This is a vegetarian taco.

00:13:27.192 --> 00:13:29.942
And my final taco is carne asada.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:34.976
It's getting juicy over here.

00:13:35.871 --> 00:13:38.038
Squeeze on the final lime.

00:13:42.775 --> 00:13:45.538
And then I forgot to
get any spoon or fork,

00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:47.689
so I have this pico de gallo here.

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:51.856
I'm gonna have to just eat
it with my fingers first.

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:04.021
Smoky, flavorful beef. Not too tender.

00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:08.860
It has a little bit of a
grainy, meat texture to it

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.672
which is fantastic.

00:14:10.672 --> 00:14:12.853
Those onions, the cilantro,

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:15.362
that squeeze of lime, the guacamole,

00:14:15.362 --> 00:14:18.474
all the same ingredients that
were on all the other tacos.

00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:20.307
I love tacos, so much.

00:14:26.024 --> 00:14:28.485
Those tacos went down so easily.

00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:30.505
I am so happy right now.

00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:32.666
I could easily go right back in there

00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:35.594
and order another round of four tacos.

00:14:35.594 --> 00:14:37.715
But I don't know if I'm gonna go back in

00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:39.383
and wait out that line.

00:14:39.383 --> 00:14:41.541
But they were really, really good tacos.

00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:44.575
The adobada, in particular, was the best.

00:14:44.575 --> 00:14:47.697
There is also, right in this
area, the High Line Park,

00:14:47.697 --> 00:14:51.555
which is an old railroad that
has been converted into a park

00:14:51.555 --> 00:14:53.253
and I think we're gonna walk around there

00:14:53.253 --> 00:14:55.253
for a little while next.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.686
And this is an old railroad
track or train track

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:09.082
that goes right through New York City

00:15:09.082 --> 00:15:11.953
and they've done a really nice
job to make it into a park.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.470
A lot of people here today

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.090
and because it's a railroad track,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.685
it goes for a long distance
and it's very thin.

00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:21.435
Look at that view right
now, and the flowers.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.127
We walked all the way to the
end of the High Line Park

00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:51.456
and then came down the steps.

00:15:51.456 --> 00:15:53.337
We're back on ground level now.

00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:57.353
That is such a great way to
recycle an old railroad track.

00:15:57.353 --> 00:16:00.439
And not only that but they
did a really good job with it.

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:04.606
The trees, the views, the
different places to sit.

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:10.194
Ying and I spent about
an hour back at the hotel

00:16:10.194 --> 00:16:11.887
and we're now walking around.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.892
We are staying in the Garment District

00:16:13.892 --> 00:16:15.879
which is right next to Korea town,

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:18.178
so I thought it would
be in order this evening

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.761
to have Korean food for dinner.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.889
This restaurant is called Cho Dang Gol

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:35.220
and their specialty is sundubu
which is the soft tofu.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.415
And that is exactly what I'm gonna order,

00:16:37.415 --> 00:16:39.735
and it happens to be one of
my favorite Korean dishes

00:16:39.735 --> 00:16:42.469
so that's one of the reasons
I chose to come here.

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:44.748
This restaurant makes
their own in house tofu

00:16:44.748 --> 00:16:47.676
so it's homemade tofu and
she just gave me a sample.

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:50.093
It looks like scrambled eggs.

00:16:58.641 --> 00:17:02.490
Even though it's soy bean,
it almost tastes like curd.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.443
One of the best reasons to eat Korean food

00:17:04.443 --> 00:17:07.219
is the banchan, which are
all those little side dishes.

00:17:07.219 --> 00:17:08.359
So she just brought them out.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.781
We have six different things

00:17:10.781 --> 00:17:13.614
and kimchi is one of my favorites.

00:17:18.398 --> 00:17:21.928
Slightly fermented, it's nice and sour.

00:17:21.928 --> 00:17:23.761
Fried eggplant, maybe?

00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:31.009
Oh yeah. I think that's eggplant.

00:17:32.902 --> 00:17:34.652
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:41.610
I got the sundubu jjigae
with mixed seafood

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.275
and I think there's some
pork in here as well.

00:17:44.275 --> 00:17:48.946
And it was bubbling away,
this smells fantastic.

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:51.301
And let me tell you,
this is a dish you wanna,

00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:55.468
you wanna cool off before
you take a big bite of it.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.058
And even when you think it's cool,

00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:05.116
you wanna blow on it for
a little while longer.

00:18:05.116 --> 00:18:05.949
Okay.

00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:12.098
Follow with some rice.

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:16.451
And I think in here
there are bits of squid.

00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:18.189
Yeah, pieces of squid.

00:18:18.189 --> 00:18:21.349
There is like, some zucchini,

00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:22.432
and a mussel.

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.943
And then Ying and I also got
a plate of japchae to share

00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:34.776
which is the sweet potato noodles.

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:42.093
That's really good.

00:18:42.093 --> 00:18:45.453
Nice and hot, gooey and sticky,

00:18:45.453 --> 00:18:48.767
and you can taste that
sesame oil and sesame seeds.

00:18:48.767 --> 00:18:50.850
We're gonna walk back
to the hotel from here.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.159
I'm gonna end the vlog
for today right now.

00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:55.376
