00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.100
There's a few around that the most romantic thing you could tell someone else is,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.740
" I don't want to change a thing about you,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.320
'I love you exactly as you are."

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.180
According to a  prevalent romantic philosophy,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.460
Love is definitely not meant to be about trying to alter another person.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.520
But, a blanket refusal to listen to any idea of change at our lover's hands

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.740
would only make sense if we were in fact, already more or less perfect.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.120
and yet, the more time two people spend around each other,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000
the more they're naturally going to spot

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.060
things that are a little less than ideal.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.940
It might be something quite small - their way of chewing perhaps.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.020
Or something larger.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.280
Their attitude towards their career or family.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.120
Many other people might've spotted these problems before -

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680
If they never said anything, it's not because they're nicer -

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.280
just far less concerned.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.660
But our lovers can and have to be bothered.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660
It's the mixed privilege of the job.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.280
However, because the concept of education in love

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.420
has such low status, things tend to go terribly wrong when there's a lesson to impart.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.240
From a lack of confidence in the legitimacy of their task,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.480
the lover with something to teach may be neither calm nor prepared.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820
Furthermore, because so much is at stake

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.720
A fear of not being listened to over something vital

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.320
can quickly explode into rage

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.440
or something similar.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.120
As for the one who has something to learn,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.160
Our culture immediately makes them feel that feedback is by nature unromantic and illegitimate.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.440
They can feel - got at - picked on -

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.560
and humiliated and so may fall back on that comforting

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.160
yet nonsensical line,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.200
"You wouldn't criticize me if you loved me."

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.200
In love, we're too often

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.120
terrible educators and students.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
Yet in truth, we're all so imperfect,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.320
We've got to teach

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.040
and learn.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.980
Good criticism is the salvation not the end of love.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.080
A lot about love IS about tolerating and accepting frailties.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.700
But some of it is also about offering the sort of feedback that no one else

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.620
gives a damn enough about to give us.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.300
Love should not be about cherishing everything,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.980
But about seeing the full potential in one another

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.580
And therefore, about trusting in one another enough to listen to challenging information.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.400
Good love means two people on a rotating basis,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400
knowing how to take on the roles

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400
both of really kind teacher

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
and deeply open minded,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400
undefensive student.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.040
Did you know the School of Life is actually a place.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.400
Ten places, in fact.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.840
Campuses all over the world. From Melbourne to London.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.020
Taipei to Istanbul.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.160
With classes, books, and lots more.
