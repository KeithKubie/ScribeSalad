00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:21.392
(piano music)

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.983
- [Announcer 2] We are
the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:29.816
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:35.125
Long the master of fire, tools, language,

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:39.362
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:42.683
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:44.766
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.349
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:50.851
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.934
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.823
She shape the future from our

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:58.573
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:02.425
Carta brings together experts from diverse

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:05.252
disciplines to exchange insights

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:08.085
on who we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:12.449
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:16.366
of humans like you.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.123
(piano music)

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.282
- I think I'll start off with

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:04.988
an evolutionarily, very strange photo.

00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:08.369
This is Heidi Klume, the super model,

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.761
with her four children,
and this is an almost

00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:16.830
unique sort of photo in
the mammalian kingdom,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.024
and why is it unique?

00:02:19.024 --> 00:02:22.339
You won't see a chimpanzee mother

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.030
with four children under
her care at any one time.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.321
A chimpanzee mother raises her offspring

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:33.154
to independence before
she has the next child.

00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:37.835
Same with gorillas, with orangutans

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:41.701
and pretty well most
of all other primates.

00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:44.580
A mother can only have another child

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.289
once the previous child is independent.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.821
But here is Heidi, and
she's got four children,

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:55.311
all of different ages, and all of them

00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:57.328
dependent for their well-being

00:02:57.328 --> 00:03:01.437
on parental care, maternal care.

00:03:01.437 --> 00:03:04.973
Now raising four children
at a time is hard work,

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:07.564
and there's and interesting
evolutionary question,

00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:10.731
how human mothers are able to do this.

00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:16.347
But it creates sort of
interactions among siblings

00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:18.327
that you don't find else where.

00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:21.117
I should point out that
there are, of course,

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.016
other mammals that
produce multiple offspring

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.515
at the same time, they produce a litter,

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:31.393
but in those cases, all of those
offspring are the same age.

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:34.560
Now the existence of multiple children

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:38.614
all dependent for, at the same time,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:40.605
for maternal care, means that they

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:42.950
tend to compete amongst each other

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.996
for maternal care and attention.

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:47.469
And when I look a photos like this,

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.170
I always like to look,
where are the hands?

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.364
And so if you look at this picture,

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:56.531
here is Heidi's right hand is
holding her youngest child.

00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:00.904
Her other hand is holding the
hand of her eldest daughter

00:04:00.904 --> 00:04:04.054
here, and she is sufficiently rich

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:06.388
that she can afford another pair of hands

00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:09.483
to look after her two other children,

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:12.058
so here's one of the
hands, holding this child,

00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:14.201
and then the second hand of the helper

00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.476
is sort of hidden behind her body.

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:20.226
So raising children is hard work.

00:04:21.186 --> 00:04:24.477
Raising a child is not cost-free,

00:04:24.477 --> 00:04:27.591
and sometimes people challenge
me about that, you know.

00:04:27.591 --> 00:04:29.430
But think about it.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.126
If raising children weren't costly,

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:35.725
and natural selection acts to maximize

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:37.564
lifetime reproductive success,

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:39.717
if there were no cost of child raising,

00:04:39.717 --> 00:04:41.849
mother's would have evolved to produce

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.330
an infinite number of offspring,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.663
which they clearly don't do.

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:51.550
Offspring compete for
maternal care and attention.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.283
That's if your using your right hand

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:56.587
to hold one child, you
don't have the right

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.373
hand available to grab another child

00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:01.873
when it's getting into danger.

00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:04.704
Now there's another interesting

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.174
thing about that photo, and this is

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:12.403
that, as is well known, Heidi's oldest

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:14.514
daughter has a different father

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.177
from her other three children,

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:21.588
and this genetically creates
an interesting asymmetry.

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:25.111
So all of these four children are related

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:27.366
to each other maternally.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.921
If you picked a gene in Heidi,

00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:32.370
it's got a one chance in two of being

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.120
present in each of her offspring.

00:05:36.312 --> 00:05:39.053
These are all maternal half sibs,

00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:41.872
so they're all related maternally,

00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:45.394
but the paternal genes of this child

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:47.985
are necessarily absent from the three

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:51.503
siblings there, so this child is unrelated

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:56.254
for her paternal genome to
Heidi's other three children,

00:05:56.254 --> 00:06:00.305
and this leads,
evolutionarily, to a conflict

00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:02.524
within the genomes of children

00:06:02.524 --> 00:06:06.683
over the extraction of care from mothers,

00:06:06.683 --> 00:06:08.744
which ultimately translates as

00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:12.064
cost of their care having impacts

00:06:12.064 --> 00:06:17.062
on their siblings who might
be maternal half sibs.

00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:19.497
So maternal and paternal genes of a child

00:06:19.497 --> 00:06:22.914
disagree over the value of half siblings,

00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:27.741
who share one parent but not both parents.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.505
And so here's the sort of graph

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:34.042
that you've seen before in earlier talks.

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:36.980
I put fetus here, but I'm just
referring to a child here.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.135
We're looking at effects
on fitness of the child

00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:43.756
and effects on fitness of its siblings,

00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:46.154
and just dividing this space,

00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:48.052
there are some sorts of outcomes.

00:06:48.052 --> 00:06:51.976
Some things that can
happen that are of benefit

00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:54.726
to the child and to its siblings.

00:06:56.034 --> 00:06:57.608
There are some things that are of cost

00:06:57.608 --> 00:07:00.955
to a child and to its siblings,

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:03.753
and then there is side of trade offs

00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:04.940
where some action is benefiting

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.273
one child at the cost to other children.

00:07:09.192 --> 00:07:11.729
That's the holding of
one child in your hand,

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.423
meaning that that hand is not available

00:07:14.423 --> 00:07:16.840
to look after other children.

00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:22.935
So these are the zones of a
trade off in parental care.

00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:26.102
And so just looking at what natural

00:07:26.102 --> 00:07:28.866
selection maximizes in this situation,

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.800
so first of all, I'm going to look at

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.388
natural selection acting
on genes of maternal

00:07:33.388 --> 00:07:38.076
origin in a child with respect to costs

00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:42.243
on maternal half siblings, the
offspring of other fathers.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.319
And so natural selection is predicted

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.486
to maximize this sum here.

00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:52.583
This is the benefit to the child,

00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:56.600
and this is the cost of
the fitness of its siblings

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.700
The child values itself
evolutionarily at twice

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.061
the value of siblings,
because a gene in the child

00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:05.221
is definitely present in that child,

00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:08.500
but it's only got a 50%
chance, this is a maternal

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.099
gene of being present in siblings.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:14.363
So natural selection will favor behavior

00:08:14.363 --> 00:08:17.742
when this sum is positive, which is in

00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:20.424
this region of the phase space,

00:08:20.424 --> 00:08:23.204
what is called matrilineal
inclusive fitness

00:08:23.204 --> 00:08:27.371
is increased, but for
paternally derived genes

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.700
in a maternal half sib, what's relevant

00:08:33.122 --> 00:08:36.786
is the effect on the
fitness of the child itself

00:08:36.786 --> 00:08:40.119
because it is unrelated to its siblings,

00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:43.002
so as long as the benefit to the child

00:08:43.002 --> 00:08:45.680
is positive, natural selection will favor

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.096
increasing demands on the mother.

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:51.497
So combining those two situations,

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:55.328
we have regions where there is an absence

00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:57.441
of evolutionary conflict between genes

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:59.394
of maternal and paternal origin.

00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:02.137
This is where they both benefit.

00:09:02.137 --> 00:09:04.499
This is where they both suffer a cost,

00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:06.061
and natural selection would act

00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.929
against genes with these sort of effects.

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:10.713
But then we have a zone of trade off

00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:13.597
of conflict within the genome,

00:09:13.597 --> 00:09:15.477
where genes of maternal origin

00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:17.759
would benefit by the mother allocating

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:20.214
more resources to siblings.

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:22.438
Those genes of paternal
origin would benefit

00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:26.605
from the child receiving
more maternal care itself.

00:09:27.854 --> 00:09:29.900
This is where the cost benefit ratio

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.892
is sitting in between 1/2 and zero.

00:09:33.892 --> 00:09:37.610
This is the zone of intragenomic conflict.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.430
And for the second half of the talk,

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.984
I'm just going to look at some human

00:09:40.984 --> 00:09:43.667
genetic disorders where genes,

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.910
so called imprinted genes, have an effect,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.146
and these provide clues about the action

00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:53.710
of this evolutionary conflict
during human evolution.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.076
Now an imprinted gene is a gene

00:09:57.076 --> 00:10:00.188
that is expressed differently,

00:10:00.188 --> 00:10:04.784
whether you get it from
your mother or your father.

00:10:04.784 --> 00:10:08.784
It has a imprint, a record,
of its past history,

00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:12.725
what sex of body it was in
in the previous generation,

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:17.508
and that effects what it does
in the current generation.

00:10:17.508 --> 00:10:20.544
So paternally derived genes in offspring

00:10:20.544 --> 00:10:23.241
are predicted to favor greater demands

00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:27.847
on mothers than will
maternally-derived genes in offspring.

00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:31.000
And so here, we will look at an example

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.492
of a chromosome region
on human chromosome 11,

00:10:34.492 --> 00:10:38.068
where there are some imprinted genes.

00:10:38.068 --> 00:10:42.290
Let's focus here, this
is a gene called IGF2

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.710
for insulin-like growth factor two.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.812
Here, we're looking at the chromosome

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:50.649
a child gets from its mother,
and on this chromosome,

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:52.291
I've got a red dot there.

00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:55.689
The IGF2 gene is not being expressed,

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:59.832
whereas on the copy that the
child gets from its father,

00:10:59.832 --> 00:11:03.129
the IGF2 gene is being expressed.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.810
IGF2 is a fetal growth enhancer.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.735
This is a gene that is promoting growth

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:13.309
at the placenta and is
increasing birth weight,

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:15.122
and it's not being expressed when it comes

00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:16.913
from the mother but being expressed

00:11:16.913 --> 00:11:19.972
when it comes from the father.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.772
Now, this is called imprinting

00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:24.053
because this isn't anything to do

00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:26.294
with the DNA sequence itself.

00:11:26.294 --> 00:11:30.694
In my body, the copy of
IGF2 I got from my mother

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:33.811
is silent, but if I pass that silent copy

00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:36.947
on to my children, it's going to be active

00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:41.169
in my children because they
got it from their father.

00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:43.732
In this chromosome
region, there is a second

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:47.899
gene with the opposite
pattern of imprinting, CDKN1C.

00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:52.614
This is a cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor.

00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:56.352
This is an inhibitor of
progression through the cell cycle,

00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:00.073
so this is stopping cells
dividing and growing larger,

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:02.691
so this is an inhibitor of growth,

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:05.733
and it chose the opposite
pattern of imprinting.

00:12:05.733 --> 00:12:08.955
It's expressed off the
maternal chromosome,

00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:10.855
so the gene coming from the mother

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.953
is acting to reduce
growth, whereas the gene

00:12:13.953 --> 00:12:17.798
copy coming from the father is silent.

00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:20.810
So in essence, we have a situation

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.919
where simultaneously
during fetal development,

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:28.119
we have a paternal foot on the accelerator

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:30.360
of growth here, of IGF2 being expressed

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.074
from the paternal
chromosome promoting growth.

00:12:34.074 --> 00:12:36.877
The maternal foot is off the accelerator,

00:12:36.877 --> 00:12:39.599
but the maternal foot is on the brake

00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:43.558
reducing growth, and the
paternal foot in the child,

00:12:43.558 --> 00:12:47.997
in the same cells, is not
applied to that brake,

00:12:47.997 --> 00:12:50.717
and normal fetal development is determined

00:12:50.717 --> 00:12:52.416
by the balance of paternal

00:12:52.416 --> 00:12:55.249
acceleration and maternal braking.

00:12:56.096 --> 00:12:59.916
And so, this internal
conflict can be revealed

00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:02.256
in rare genetic disorders where

00:13:02.256 --> 00:13:05.315
parts of this process go wrong.

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:06.641
So I'll start off with a look

00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:09.041
at Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.462
This is a fetal overgrowth syndrome,

00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:15.002
so these children are born rather large.

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:18.541
I have a friend who had
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:22.708
as a child, and she's given
me her baby photo to look at.

00:13:23.728 --> 00:13:25.159
So here she is.

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:27.909
She was about 13 pounds at birth.

00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:31.169
Typical of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome,

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:34.409
she has macroglossia,
which is just what medical

00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:38.590
people use to say, it's Latin
for having a large tongue.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.266
I suspect evolutionarily this is,

00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:45.004
the tongue muscle is the
pump during breastfeeding,

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:47.582
and so paternal genes
are particularly involved

00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:51.937
in promoting the development
of the tongue muscles.

00:13:51.937 --> 00:13:56.598
Now what are the causes of
this fetal overgrowth syndrome?

00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:59.878
In a number of cases, individuals

00:13:59.878 --> 00:14:02.480
turn out to have two paternal copies

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.782
of this chromosomal region.

00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:07.522
This is called paternal
uniparental disomy,

00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:10.000
so in this case, they have two copies

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.441
of IGF2, they have two paternal
feet on the accelerator,

00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:17.402
and no maternal feet on the brake,

00:14:17.402 --> 00:14:20.058
so they have fetal overgrowth.

00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:22.342
It's also associated with a high risk

00:14:22.342 --> 00:14:25.840
of a number of childhood cancers.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.204
Some other people with the same diagnosis

00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:32.864
of Beckwith-Wiedemann
syndrome of fetal overgrowth,

00:14:32.864 --> 00:14:35.761
have a mutation, an inactivating mutation

00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:38.801
in the maternal copy of CDKN1C,

00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:42.122
so this is the brake on fetal growth,

00:14:42.122 --> 00:14:45.097
so the maternal copy, which
is normally expressed,

00:14:45.097 --> 00:14:47.838
is inactivated by a mutation.

00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:52.339
The paternal copy is
inactivated as normally occurs,

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:54.258
and so in this case,
they've got a paternal

00:14:54.258 --> 00:14:56.678
foot on the accelerator of growth,

00:14:56.678 --> 00:14:58.860
and no maternal foot on the brake,

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.059
and this is associated
with fetal overgrowth

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:04.799
and a similar clinical diagnosis,

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.883
though apparently not with increased

00:15:06.883 --> 00:15:09.050
risk of childhood cancers.

00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:14.779
Such a condition is interesting if,

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:17.058
if a male who had this mutation

00:15:17.058 --> 00:15:19.212
and had Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

00:15:19.212 --> 00:15:21.737
passed the mutant gene on to his children,

00:15:21.737 --> 00:15:23.716
they would have normal development

00:15:23.716 --> 00:15:25.359
because they would get a normal gene

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:28.915
from their mother and the mutant gene

00:15:28.915 --> 00:15:30.970
that is coming from the affected male

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.158
would have been inactivated anyways,

00:15:33.158 --> 00:15:35.457
so this is a case where a mutation

00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:37.619
is having an effect when inherited

00:15:37.619 --> 00:15:40.374
from a parent of one sex but not from

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:42.207
a parent of the other.

00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:46.931
Silver-Russell syndrome is a intrauterine

00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:50.789
growth retardation syndrome, and so here,

00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:54.521
I have a picture of two
girls at the same age.

00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:58.137
This little girl here has
Silver-Russell syndrome.

00:15:58.137 --> 00:16:01.138
It's associated with
very low birth weight.

00:16:01.138 --> 00:16:03.640
Not associated with catch up growth,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.330
so if not treated, these individuals

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.379
grow up to be very small adults.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:10.201
It's also associated with severe

00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:13.034
feeding difficulties as an infant.

00:16:14.242 --> 00:16:17.638
Some individuals with
Silver-Russell syndrome

00:16:17.638 --> 00:16:21.498
have two maternal copies
of this chromosome region.

00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:23.338
So now they have no paternal foot

00:16:23.338 --> 00:16:25.480
on the accelerator of growth

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.373
and two maternal feet on the brake

00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:32.591
associated with intrauterine
growth retardation

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:34.696
and small birth weight.

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:37.072
Other individuals have a loss of DNA

00:16:37.072 --> 00:16:39.757
methylation at what is
called the imprinting

00:16:39.757 --> 00:16:42.628
control region one here, this leads

00:16:42.628 --> 00:16:45.005
to the inactivation of the paternal copy

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:48.407
of IGF2, so now they have
no foot on the accelerator

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:50.468
of growth and that's associated

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.762
with intrauterine growth retardation.

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:55.540
For the final part of the talk,

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.702
I want to talk about a
different pair of syndromes

00:16:58.702 --> 00:17:00.342
that are associated with a different

00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:03.061
cluster of imprinted genes.

00:17:03.061 --> 00:17:06.005
These reside on human chromosome 15,

00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:08.123
and here the imprinting is specific

00:17:08.123 --> 00:17:12.744
to the brain and doesn't
occur in most other tissues.

00:17:12.744 --> 00:17:15.786
I won't go into the details
of naming these genes,

00:17:15.786 --> 00:17:17.603
just to point out that there

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.079
are some genes, like this one here,

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.060
that are not expressed on
the maternal chromosome

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.782
but are expressed on
the paternal chromosome,

00:17:25.782 --> 00:17:28.766
and other genes with the
opposite pattern of expression

00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:30.821
expressed on the maternal chromosome

00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:34.403
but not on the paternal chromosome.

00:17:34.403 --> 00:17:36.823
Some interesting things in this region.

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:40.377
Here is where the single
nucleotide polymorphism

00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:43.401
that in European populations
makes the difference

00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:46.678
between blue and brown eyes resides.

00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:50.761
And sitting here, a gene
that I won't talk about.

00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:54.915
This gene, Makorin 3, so this is a gene

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:57.750
that is only expressed when
you get from your father

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.957
but not expressed from the mother.

00:17:59.957 --> 00:18:02.501
When children have a
mutation in this paternally

00:18:02.501 --> 00:18:05.307
derived gene copy, recent work from Brazil

00:18:05.307 --> 00:18:08.227
said they have precocious puberty,

00:18:08.227 --> 00:18:11.066
that they go through puberty usually

00:18:11.066 --> 00:18:14.064
before age of 10 years,
so this is suggesting

00:18:14.064 --> 00:18:15.701
that the paternally expressed gene

00:18:15.701 --> 00:18:19.868
on this chromosome is
inhibiting pubertal progression,

00:18:20.754 --> 00:18:25.137
which raises some interesting
evolutionary questions.

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:29.084
Okay, so here is a young child
with Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:32.398
I'm going to focus on the childhood

00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:34.617
symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:18:34.617 --> 00:18:37.114
These children, some of you might know

00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:40.173
in studying in their second
to third year of life,

00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:43.696
they go from being anorexic,
of having no appetite,

00:18:43.696 --> 00:18:47.777
to becoming hypophagic and
they become massively obese,

00:18:47.777 --> 00:18:50.012
but I'm just going to be focusing on

00:18:50.012 --> 00:18:52.373
the symptoms that these children have

00:18:52.373 --> 00:18:55.655
in the immediate perinatal period.

00:18:55.655 --> 00:18:58.468
So this girl is showing the hypertonia

00:18:58.468 --> 00:19:00.562
of Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:19:00.562 --> 00:19:03.338
Most individuals with
Prader-Willi syndrome

00:19:03.338 --> 00:19:06.065
have a deletion of the paternal copy

00:19:06.065 --> 00:19:08.683
of this chromosome, so they've only got

00:19:08.683 --> 00:19:10.981
maternally expressed genes coming

00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:14.148
from this region and no paternal copy.

00:19:15.815 --> 00:19:18.821
A few other people have
two maternal copies

00:19:18.821 --> 00:19:22.118
of this region, and they
have Prader-Willi syndrome,

00:19:22.118 --> 00:19:25.299
so what this is showing is
that Prader-Willi syndrome

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:27.382
is caused by the absence

00:19:27.382 --> 00:19:30.280
of expression of genes

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.649
that come from the father.

00:19:32.649 --> 00:19:34.971
Interestingly in individuals with maternal

00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:38.170
uniparental disomy,
this is one of the most

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.670
penetrate causes of psychosis.

00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:44.899
Sitting down in this region of the region,

00:19:44.899 --> 00:19:47.643
this is a GABA receptor cluster,

00:19:47.643 --> 00:19:49.663
and there appears to
be some sort of parent

00:19:49.663 --> 00:19:51.666
of origin affected carrying here

00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:53.767
that is predisposing these individuals

00:19:53.767 --> 00:19:56.124
to developing psychosis.

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:58.684
So Prader-Willi syndrome is associated

00:19:58.684 --> 00:20:02.405
with the absence of expression
of paternally-derived genes,

00:20:02.405 --> 00:20:04.813
and therefore evolutionary, this leads

00:20:04.813 --> 00:20:07.352
to a prediction that Prader-Willi syndrome

00:20:07.352 --> 00:20:10.673
should exhibit an exaggeration of traits

00:20:10.673 --> 00:20:13.233
that reduce demands on mother.

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:16.595
So this region contains
paternal accelerators

00:20:16.595 --> 00:20:18.993
on offspring demands on mothers.

00:20:18.993 --> 00:20:21.414
We're taking away those paternal genes,

00:20:21.414 --> 00:20:23.284
and so you should see in the child

00:20:23.284 --> 00:20:25.750
reduced demands on the mother.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.947
So let's look at the neonatal phenotype

00:20:27.947 --> 00:20:29.790
in Prader-Willi syndrome.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.954
It's associated with low muscle tension,

00:20:32.954 --> 00:20:37.772
neonatal hypotonia, with a weak cry,

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:39.752
these are low maintenance children,

00:20:39.752 --> 00:20:41.670
and with poor suck.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.302
So these children have
little to no interest

00:20:44.302 --> 00:20:46.196
in feeding, and they have

00:20:46.196 --> 00:20:50.255
very weak or non-existing
suckling reflexes.

00:20:50.255 --> 00:20:52.120
Usually they have to have a tube

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.361
put into the stomach, gavage feeding,

00:20:54.361 --> 00:20:57.503
to give them adequate nutrition.

00:20:57.503 --> 00:21:00.618
They show excessive sleepiness.

00:21:00.618 --> 00:21:04.601
The child is put to bed
and it stays asleep.

00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.664
So this suggests that paternal genes

00:21:06.664 --> 00:21:08.841
that are absent in Prader-Willi syndrome

00:21:08.841 --> 00:21:12.939
promote suckling and they also promote

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:15.203
wakefulness, so in their absence,

00:21:15.203 --> 00:21:17.502
you have a child that doesn't suckle

00:21:17.502 --> 00:21:19.841
and a child that sleeps through the night.

00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:22.462
And I have suggested that evolutionarily,

00:21:22.462 --> 00:21:24.923
paternal genes are promoting more intense

00:21:24.923 --> 00:21:29.177
suckling and also night
waking in children,

00:21:29.177 --> 00:21:32.050
in babies, as a way of essentially

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.702
exhausting mothers and delaying her return

00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:38.091
to fertility, delaying the conception

00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:40.873
of a younger sibling who will compete

00:21:40.873 --> 00:21:44.787
for maternal care and attention.

00:21:44.787 --> 00:21:47.329
Interestingly, deletion of precisely

00:21:47.329 --> 00:21:49.227
the same chromosome region

00:21:49.227 --> 00:21:51.526
cause a completely different syndrome.

00:21:51.526 --> 00:21:54.584
This is a boy with Angelman syndrome.

00:21:54.584 --> 00:21:58.581
The majority of cases, 70% of
cases of Angelman syndrome,

00:21:58.581 --> 00:22:01.506
have a deletion of the
same chromosome region,

00:22:01.506 --> 00:22:03.409
but in this case, it's a deletion

00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:06.398
of the maternal chromosome, so they only

00:22:06.398 --> 00:22:09.225
have a paternal copy of this region.

00:22:09.225 --> 00:22:13.887
So now we would expect an
exaggeration of behaviors

00:22:13.887 --> 00:22:17.927
that increase costs to mothers.

00:22:17.927 --> 00:22:20.292
We know of a couple of cases of women

00:22:20.292 --> 00:22:23.495
with Prader-Willi syndrome
who had a deletion

00:22:23.495 --> 00:22:27.168
of their paternal
chromosome that were fertile

00:22:27.168 --> 00:22:28.987
and had a child and passed

00:22:28.987 --> 00:22:31.108
the deletion on to their children.

00:22:31.108 --> 00:22:33.267
Their child got it from their mother,

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:34.978
so the child of a Prader-Willi

00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:38.585
syndrome woman has Angelman syndrome.

00:22:38.585 --> 00:22:40.744
Some other individuals
with Prader-Willi syndrome

00:22:40.744 --> 00:22:44.604
have an activating
mutations in this gene here,

00:22:44.604 --> 00:22:46.301
UBE3A, which is normally

00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:49.283
expressed only on the maternal chromosome,

00:22:49.283 --> 00:22:52.888
so now the maternal copy
is inactivated by mutation,

00:22:52.888 --> 00:22:57.224
and the paternal copy is
inactivated by genomic imprinting,

00:22:57.224 --> 00:23:00.208
and this suggests that Angelman syndrome,

00:23:00.208 --> 00:23:03.047
most of the symptoms,
are caused by the absence

00:23:03.047 --> 00:23:06.063
of expression of the maternally derived

00:23:06.063 --> 00:23:09.144
copy of this gene, UBED3A.

00:23:09.144 --> 00:23:11.982
So Angelman syndrome is predicted

00:23:11.982 --> 00:23:14.764
to exaggerate traits that increase

00:23:14.764 --> 00:23:17.504
offspring demands on mothers,

00:23:17.504 --> 00:23:19.924
and I'll just look at some of the

00:23:19.924 --> 00:23:22.566
symptoms of Angelman syndrome.

00:23:22.566 --> 00:23:25.383
So Angelman syndrome is associated

00:23:25.383 --> 00:23:28.486
with uncoordinated suck and swallow,

00:23:28.486 --> 00:23:31.906
but these children do not
need to be gavage fed.

00:23:31.906 --> 00:23:35.784
It's as if there's hyper
activity in the suckling reflex.

00:23:35.784 --> 00:23:38.146
They get adequate nutrition, so they don't

00:23:38.146 --> 00:23:40.844
show failure to thrive.

00:23:40.844 --> 00:23:44.000
They have adequate
nutrition as I've mentioned.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.422
They are hypertonic rather than hypotonic.

00:23:47.422 --> 00:23:50.848
They have ataxia, hyperactivity,

00:23:50.848 --> 00:23:52.844
particularly tiring for parents,

00:23:52.844 --> 00:23:56.204
they have excessive wakefulness as babies.

00:23:56.204 --> 00:23:58.864
I know of clinical reports of babies

00:23:58.864 --> 00:24:01.697
who were awake 21 hours out of 24.

00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:04.940
Parents are advised to get some sleep.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.527
Sometimes to put the child

00:24:06.527 --> 00:24:09.694
in a darkened room and close the door.

00:24:10.544 --> 00:24:14.580
Angelman syndrome is
associated with happy affect,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.202
the laughing, smiling child you saw

00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:19.981
in the previous picture,
this is particular

00:24:19.981 --> 00:24:23.506
in interactions with potential caregivers,

00:24:23.506 --> 00:24:26.647
and it's associated
with frequent laughter.

00:24:26.647 --> 00:24:29.863
These are happy, smiling children.

00:24:29.863 --> 00:24:33.265
Curiously, this is
associated with the complete

00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:35.883
absence of the development of speech

00:24:35.883 --> 00:24:39.064
or even of sign language,
so these children

00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:43.403
have some degree of cognitive delay,

00:24:43.403 --> 00:24:45.441
but the absence of speech seems to be

00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:48.123
out of proportion to
the cognitive problems.

00:24:48.123 --> 00:24:50.599
It seems to be a specific deficit

00:24:50.599 --> 00:24:53.243
in this imprinted disorder.

00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:54.734
The suggestion is that children

00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:56.881
with Angelman syndrome exhibit

00:24:56.881 --> 00:24:59.483
exaggerated attachment behaviors

00:24:59.483 --> 00:25:02.351
that normally engage maternal attention

00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:04.162
and elicit maternal care.

00:25:04.162 --> 00:25:06.780
This is the laughing, smiling baby

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.903
the mother wants to put
attention, give attention to,

00:25:09.903 --> 00:25:12.323
and I'll finish with another photo,

00:25:12.323 --> 00:25:14.779
and just look at the hands in the photo.

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:18.199
So here we have Mom
holding on to the hands

00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:20.999
of two children, and this child misses out

00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:23.213
and doesn't get a maternal hand.

00:25:23.213 --> 00:25:24.580
Thank you.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.080
