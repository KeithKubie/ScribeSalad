00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.490
So if you've seen any of the other
interviews that I've done here at

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.360
Udacity, you'll notice that I'm
now sitting in the other chair.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.510
And that's because today we're
talking about a topic that was part

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.420
of my dissertation research, which is
Exploratory Learning Environments.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.590
So Jason has agreed to
give me my questions, and

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.800
interview me on the topic.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.460
So thank you.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.263
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Absolutely,
anything for you David.

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:18.795
I think I've said that
before in another video.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.683
So what makes exploratory learning
environments so powerful in education?

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:24.665
&gt;&gt; So the reason I really like
exploratory learning environments in

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:29.005
education is that they let us build
circumstances, or build situations,

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.145
or build opportunities for

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:34.155
students that are pretty hard
to have in a real classroom.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.720
Also in my dissertation research we did
in the context of middle school ecology.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.590
And doing scientific inquiry and
scientific modeling in that domain, and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.570
when you're really doing
inquiry in ecology.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.770
You're usually doing
things that take months or

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.150
years to gather the data on, you build
models that cover decades of time,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.050
or our current climate change models are
covering centuries or millennia in time,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.130
it get's the projections out that far.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.920
And our students in the classroom,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.690
they have 45 minutes or
maybe two weeks for a unit.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.150
They don't have time to sit around
gathering 12 months of data or

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.300
24 months of data or anything like that.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.890
The real power of exploratory learning
environments is it let's us take those

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.670
very real, very authentic opportunities
from the real word, take away some of

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.800
the constraints, or the obstacles
to using them in the classroom and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.020
strip them down to only those things
that are useful for the learning.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.390
So, in our research we had students
simulate what would happen to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
a particular ecological system
over a very large time scale.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.200
Under different initial circumstances.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.390
So if the system started like this, what
would it look like ten years from now?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.090
If it started like this,
what would it work ten years from now?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.250
In person, we can't model a system for
ten years for

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.450
a middle school class project.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.300
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.840
But we want them to
get that experience of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.240
what it's like to authentically
investigate that problem.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.930
And so the real power in exploratory
learning environments is to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.980
open up those opportunities.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.690
But more than just opening up those
opportunities as well, the real,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.640
the meat of them is also how they give
students ownership over that process.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.790
So they're called exploratory
because the student is exploring.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.130
The student is driving
what they're doing.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.660
The student is going in and saying I
think want to research this today, or I

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.060
want to go explore this area, depending
on the the nature of the environment.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.770
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.250
it's not something that we're telling
them you have to do this, and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.020
then this, and then this.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.600
And here's your assignment, and
here's your reading for the day.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.360
They get to take charge.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.100
And that builds a lot of ownership,
a lot of engagement in it.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.030
Experience or constructing is personal.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.230
And it's different for everybody.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.510
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And so that's why I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.630
love using them in that,
because it teaches students

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.210
the skills they need to actually
survive in their eventual real world.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.380
That when you're on the job, hopefully
you don't have someone holding your hand

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.702
and giving you your to do list for
the day.

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:35.202
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You might.

00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:36.182
But, hopefully, you don't.

00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:37.292
You're given some free reign,

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:39.665
and you're trusted to
go forward with it.

00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:42.425
And so exploratory learning
environments are a way of opening up

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:46.071
those opportunities, those experiences
to students earlier in their education.

00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:48.359
&gt;&gt; Sounds like it's going to build
a lot of confidence for those students.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.525
&gt;&gt; I hope so, yeah.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.295
Actually in our experience
in that class it did, we had

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:55.705
a couple students who didn't consider
themselves very good in science.

00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:56.295
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:57.715
&gt;&gt; But it was when they were told,

00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.890
you have the power to question
certain accepted truths.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.760
Based on the evidence that you gather,
that it gave them this idea that,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.900
I don't have to necessarily be
a scientist to do research.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.520
You need to become one eventually
to do it in the real world,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.730
but the idea that beliefs and theories
are constructed based on evidence, and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.200
you have the power to gather evidence.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.720
That's a really powerful idea for

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.550
students to have that early
in their science education.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.120
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.670
When designing a learning environment,
what is important to keep in mind?

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.570
&gt;&gt; So for me, the main thing to keep in
mind when designing these environments,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.970
is to preserve the authenticity of
whatever problem you're mimicking.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.808
I say that because there's a very strong
tendency among some who would design

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:39.299
some environments like
this to really gamify it.

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.467
And I have a strong opposition to
gamifying just because it creates,

00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:44.106
creates some nice motivation, but

00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:46.632
it's motivation that isn't
rooted in the material.

00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:47.258
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And so, we can

00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:49.901
have an exploratory learning
environment where, for example,

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.965
you're gathering evidence to explain
why certain species went extinct.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:53.566
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.250
every time you find a piece of
evidence you get 10 points.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.610
And that's not very
often think about it.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.130
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You're basically just looking around

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.330
finding clues.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.910
What we really want to do when we're
creating these exploratory learning

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.410
environments, is preserve the
authenticity of whatever activity we're

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.970
mimicking out in the real world.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.360
If scientist use simulations for
example,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.130
we want to our students to use the same
kind of simulations that scientist use.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.160
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; We want them to derive value from it

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.860
based on what predictions they can make.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.740
Not whether or not they achieved
an objective or got an achievement, or

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.130
got a trophy or something like that.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.600
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So I think it's really important to

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.780
preserve what it is you want
to teach in that environment.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.470
And make sure it's what you want to
teach that's actually the motivating

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.570
part of engaging with that environment.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.480
&gt;&gt; So you're talking about focusing
on the learning goals as opposed to

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.560
the gamification of the.-
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.710
&gt;&gt; All right, very good.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.090
We talked a lot about learning
environments in the middle school.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.660
I'm wondering what sort of
application for high school or

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.310
the collegiate level exists.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.070
&gt;&gt; So you're right.
I think most often we see explored to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.040
our learning environments used
in lower and middle school.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.440
And part of the reason is that they,
they make things very engaging.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.950
They are very visually attracted,
they are very interactive,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.430
they're very interesting to look at.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.150
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And so

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.990
I think that's one of the reasons we
see them a lot at the earlier ages.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.120
But I think they have a very
strong place later in life,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.200
that the constraints that we
deal with at the lower and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.720
middle school levels don't go
away when we're in college.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.290
We're dealing with the same kind of
things of when we're learning about

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.420
ecology, we're learning
about systems and

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.600
we're learning about systems that take
place over a very long period of time.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.780
I think the difference is that
the authenticity actually comes out.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.580
Even more strongly than when we're
doing it later in our college career so

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.780
we don't need to dress up as much.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.260
We don't need to make it as colorful.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.850
We can actually just sometimes give
students the tools that real people use.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.850
And this is especially, I think
the case, in computer science education.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.140
The IDEs in many ways are exploratory
learning environments.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.180
You're exploring the API.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.550
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You're exploring the different

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.420
results of different programs and
things like that.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.390
So, I think it definitely has a place
later in the educational career.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.500
But I think Jason's right that, I think
that exploratory learning environments

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.750
are most often used at
the lower middle school levels.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.830
And if your interested in working
with lower middle school students, or

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.990
even maybe some high school students,
I think it's a really,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.650
really nice domain to explore.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.080
It lead's itself to some
really fun projects, and

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.840
some really interesting projects
that can really motivate students.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.990
But I also encourage you to think
about some of the ways we could use

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.810
the same kind of principles
in later education.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.330
So, thank you for
chatting with me about this.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.930
&gt;&gt; Of course Kevin.
