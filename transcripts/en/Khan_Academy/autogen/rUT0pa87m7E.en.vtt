00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
 Let's take a look at some examples 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.950
 tasks we use 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.190
 information to make equations to solve our problem 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.690
 task, after which we will actually solve the problem. 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.660
 Let's get to Task 1. 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.280
 Write a mathematical equation that describes it 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.380
 the relationship between the variables in the table. 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 Here we have days and profits. 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.820
 And if we look at them, on the first day the profit is 20, the second- 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.290
 40, and the third 60. 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.690
 It does not matter what's going on, the profit always 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 will be equal to-let's see, at 20, 40, 60, 80. 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 It looks like every day it grew by 20. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.910
 That's plus 20, out of 20 goes to 40, then plus 20, plus 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.900
 20, plus 20. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.850
 So every day there is an increase of 20. 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.810
 Maybe the formula here is that our profit is equal to 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.890
 the day, multiplied by 20, is equal to 20 times a day. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.460
 Does this match the data? 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120
 Let's see, we could try with all of them, but when 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.670
 the day is 5, 20 times 5 is 100. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 5 times 20 is 100. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140
 Yes, it does seem, in fact, this coincides with the data. 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.790
 And if we want to record it in a slightly more algebraic way, 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 we could say that the gain is q, and the day is d, 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.260
 and we will write our equation, with the gain equal to 20 times d or 20d. 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.140
 And that's part a. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.840
 I wrote a mathematical equation that describes it 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.920
 connection. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 Next part b, ask us what is the profit on the tenth day? 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 Well, for our luck we have written our equation, so 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370
 actually ask us what is happening with p, 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.640
 the profit, what happens to the profit when d or day is equal to 10? 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.780
 So the profit will be 20 times a day, 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 in which we are, day 10. 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.230
 20 times 10, which is equal to 200. 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.430
 It is. 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.420
 Task 3. 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.320
 Write a mathematical equation for the following 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.270
 situations and to solve it. 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.500
 So let's look at part a. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
 7 times a given number makes 35. 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.610
 What is the number? 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.500
 So every time I say a number, I'll use it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.350
 the variable x. 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.270
 I could use any variable, I could say y 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.640
 or b, or z or whatever. 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280
 But I'm going to use x because I'm mostly used to this, 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.310
 and is used in principle, unless 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.690
 we have not already used x. 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.690
 So, 7 times the number, I'll say 7 times x is equal to 35. 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.990
 This is our equation. 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.980
 We have written our mathematical equation. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.040
 And now it is, what is the number? 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.730
 To find x, we can use one of two ways. 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.950
 We can divide the two sides from the equation to 7. 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.930
 If we divide this side to 7, and that side to the 7th 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.270
 the whole reason I do this is because I want this one 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.080
 factor to become 1. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.600
 And what I'm doing on one side of the equation, I have to do it 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.780
 on the other side. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.360
 So 7, divided by 7 is 1, so we have 1h or we have only 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.200
 x, equal to 35, divided by 7. 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.980
 x is equal to 5. 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 The other way we could think about it, we could 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.670
 let's say we multiply both sides 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.140
 of the equation by 1/7. 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.180
 So we have 1/7 times 7x equal to 35 times 1/7. 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.830
 These are two tangible ways to do this. 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.830
 Either way, these would be shortened. 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.420
 We would get 1 x equal to 5. 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.670
 And now 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.040
 part b. 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.690
 A number is 25 times greater than 2 times by another number. 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.330
 Well, let's say x is equal to one 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.220
 number, one number. 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.875
 Let us say that y is equal 

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:59.750
 the other number. 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.440
 So here we have more variables introduced. 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.250
 So one number, say x, e-e, looks like equality- 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.279
 is equal to 25 more than 2 times by another number. 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.760
 Well, this is the other number. 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.440
 We have 2 times on our other number. 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.400
 This is the result of this first order here. 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.310
 One number is 25 more than twice the other number. 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.580
 2 times the other number plus 25 will be equal to mine 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.780
 first number. 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.460
 So, let's see now. 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:48.760
 If each number is multiplied by 5, the sum of all will be 350. 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.900
 And that means 5 times that plus 5 times what it will be 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.580
 equal to 350. 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:05.500
 And 5 times x plus 5 times y will be equal to 350. 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.230
 He asks what the numbers are. 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.050
 Well here we can do something called substitution. 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.230
 We have already seen that x is equal to the whole thing here. 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.490
 As if we say x is equal to 5 or x equals 9 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.272
 or the like. 

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:20.830
 x is equal to something. 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.050
 And every time we see x, we can replace it 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.940
 with this "thing." 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.640
 We see one here, so we can replace it with that 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.550
 something, and then we will have an equation that contains only one y 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.670
 and then we can find y. 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.590
 And this can be written as 5 times, instead of one x we ​​have 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.650
 all this here, 25 plus 2. 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.310
 I replaced x because we know x is equal to 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.440
 of all this. 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.860
 25 plus 2y plus 5u equals 350. 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.110
 We use the distribution property. 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.360
 5 times 25 gives 125, plus 5 times 2u is 10 y, plus all, 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.670
 5u equals 350. 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.940
 10u plus 5u is 15u. 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:26.070
 This is 15u plus 125, equal to 350. 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.510
 Now we can get 125 on both sides, so minus 125- 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.900
 Excuse me, minus 125. 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.040
 I do this to get rid of 125 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.460
 on the left side. 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.950
 And our equation is simplified - I will continue here above. 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:51.700
 We obtain that 15u is equal to 350 minus 125. 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.130
 This is equal to 225. 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.120
 And maybe you already know or do not know that 15 times 15 is 225, 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.210
 so we already know how y y is. 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.990
 Let's divide the two sides to 15 to get up 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.510
 clearly what I do. 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.280
 We divide the two sides to 15, and we get that y equals 225 on 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.730
 15, which is equal to 15. 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.300
 But we are not ready yet. 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.860
 We know how long it is, but we're still looking for x. 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.260
 Thus x is equal to 25 plus 2 times y. 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.720
 y is equal to 15. 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.090
 2 times 15, this gives 30. 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:36.750
 25 plus 30 is 55. 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.420
 Now let's pass on part with. 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.110
 I'm excited 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.150
 this here. 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.170
 This too. 

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.420
 Part 

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.620
 p. 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.490
 The sum of two consecutive integers is 35. 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.060
 What are the numbers? 

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.020
 So, let's say x is equal 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.540
 the first integer. 

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.690
 Then how much will be the second number? 

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.710
 Well, the second number will be 

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.970
 with 1 greater than the first one. 

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.610
 They are consistent, one comes after the other. 

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:17.730
 So x plus 1 is equal to the second number. 

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:22.280
 We are also told that the sum of these two numbers is 35. 

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.360
 So x plus the number that comes after x, x plus 1, 

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.490
 is equal to 35. 

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:35.440
 We collect these two, and we get that 2x plus 1 equals 35. 

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.600
 We take 1 on either side of the equation, we get that 2x 

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.919
 is equal to 34 - just pulled out 1 on both sides. 

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.560
 We divide the two sides to 2 and we get that x equal to 17. 

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.240
 So the first number is 17 and the second number is only one 

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.140
 greater, it is 18. 

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.270
 And notice, these are two consecutive integers, 17 and 18, like them 

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.740
 assemble, we get 35. 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.990
 Part 

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.580
 d. 

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.050
 Peter is 3 times older than his age 6 years ago. 

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.690
 How old is Peter? 

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.130
 Thus, Peter - I will use p for Peter's age - he is equal to 

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.540
 3 times the age of 6 years ago. 

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.620
 How old was she 6 years ago? 

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.430
 Well, if he is now at the age of years, he was at the minus 6 

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.420
 three years ago. 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.360
 Let me write this as a p minus 6 -this is older than that 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.630
 6 years ago. 

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.120
 This means a minus 6. 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.020
 This 3 times is the three times he is older with 

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.980
 of his age 6 years ago. 

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.010
 And, of course, that's his age at the moment. 

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.710
 So we have to find q. 

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.350
 And we get that p is equal to, we divide the threes, 3 times the r 

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:56.140
 is 3p minus 3, multiplied by 6 is 18. 

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.310
 Now we can draw 3p on both sides of the equation. 

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.040
 We get minus 2p, right? p minus 3p gives a minus, or 

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.240
 negative sign, 2p is equal to minus 18. 

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.450
 And by dividing the two sides into minus 2, we get that r 

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.050
 is equal to 9. 

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.910
 We only multiply both sides by minus 2, 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.230
 and we can check it out. 

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.810
 Now he is 9. 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:27.120
 Six years ago he was 3, and is now 3 times older than that. 

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.690
 Well, 6 years ago he was 3, and at the age of 9 he was 3 

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.250
 times older than his age 6 years ago. 

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.820
 So it definitely works. 

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.460
 That's the good of the algebra, you always can 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.400
 to check his job. 

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.080
 It is always clear when we received the correct answer. 

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.010
 Task 6. 

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.600
 The cost of an MP3 player has dropped to 20% from the previous one 

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.300
 year to this year. 

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.670
 This year, the player's cost is $ 120. 

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.820
 What was his price last year? 

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:03.760
 Let's say p is the price last year. 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.420
 The fact is that the cost of an MP3 player 

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.910
 has been reduced to 20% from last year until this year. 

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.240
 Let's calculate 20% of that. 

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.230
 Thus, the price minus 20% of it - this is a reduction 

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.880
 with 20% - is equal to the price this year we know, 

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.950
 that is $ 120. 

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.570
 How much is p minus 0.2 or minus 20% of p? 

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.840
 We have reduced by 20%. 

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.360
 And we will have 80% left. 

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.560
 So we can say that 80% of the price last year are equal to 

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.950
 the price of this year. 

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.180
 As we have already done, we divide the two sides of the coefficient 

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.510
 of our variable. 

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:57.485
 We divide both sides to 0.8 or 0.80, depending on how we want 

00:11:57.485 --> 00:11:58.450
 to look at it. 

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.460
 0.80. 

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.420
 These are getting shorter. 

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:11.980
 So we have to find 0.8 at $ 120. 

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.870
 A little exercise with decimal fractions. 

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.840
 Let me put some zeros here. 

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.870
 We can multiply 0.8 and 120 by 10. 

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.460
 This essentially moves the decimal point 

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.990
 to the right with one. 

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:33.510
 And this is the same as the distribution of 8 in 1,200. 

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.520
 So this liver is no longer there, she is here. 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.810
 This liver is now here. 

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.060
 8 goes to 12 once, 1 time 8 is 8. 

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.140
 12 minus 8 is 4, we carry the zero down. 

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.930
 8 is contained in 40 five times. 

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:54.700
 5 times 8 is 40, 40 minus 40 is 0, below we add another 0. 

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.470
 8 goes to 0 zero times, 0 times 8-grasp the idea. 

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.430
 0 times 8 is 0. 

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.730
 We have no remnant. 

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.170
 So our answer is $ 150. 

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.810
 Last year, the sum was $ 150, down 20%. 

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.720
 20% of $ 150 is $ 30, so the discount is $ 30, and 

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.960
 we definitely get 

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.466
 $ 120.
