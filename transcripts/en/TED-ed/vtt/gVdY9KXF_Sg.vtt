00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:12.480
It starts with a tickle in your throat
that becomes a cough.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.485
Your muscles begin to ache,

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:15.955
you grow irritable,

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:17.922
and you lose your appetite.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:20.820
It's official: you've got the flu.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.105
It's logical to assume that this
miserable medley of symptoms

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.291
is the result of the infection
coursing through your body,

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.191
but is that really the case?

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.927
What's actually making you feel sick?

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:37.403
What if your body itself
was driving this vicious onslaught?

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:42.260
You first get ill when a pathogen
like the flu virus gets into your system,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.925
infecting and killing your cells.

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:47.477
But this unwelcome intrusion 
has another effect:

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.231
it alerts your body's immune system
to your plight.

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:56.591
As soon as it becomes aware of infection,
your body leaps to your defense.

00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:00.862
Cells called macrophages charge in
as the first line of attack,

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:05.498
searching for and destroying the viruses
and infected cells.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:10.553
Afterwards, the macrophages release
protein molecules called cytokines

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:11.999
whose job is to recruit

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.988
and organize more virus-busting cells 
from your immune system.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:19.304
If this coordinated effort 
is strong enough,

00:01:19.304 --> 00:01:23.413
it'll wipe out the infection
before you even notice it.

00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:27.194
But that's just your body setting
the scene for some real action.

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:29.925
In some cases, viruses spread further,

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:32.538
even into the blood and vital organs.

00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:35.014
To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate,

00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:38.239
your immune system must launch
a stronger attack,

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.293
coordinating its activity with the brain.

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:43.714
That's where those unpleasant symptoms
come in,

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:45.765
starting with the surging temperature,

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:46.829
aches and pains,

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.307
and sleepiness.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:51.172
So why do we experience this?

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:53.524
When the immune system is under
serious attack,

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.908
it secretes more cytokines,

00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:57.999
which trigger two responses.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.019
First, the vagus nerve, which runs through
the body into the brain,

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:05.337
quickly transmits the information
to the brain stem,

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:09.422
passing near an important area
of pain processing.

00:02:09.422 --> 00:02:12.993
Second, cytokines travel through
the body to the hypothalamus,

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:15.924
the part of the brain responsible
for controlling temperature,

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:16.899
thirst,

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:17.789
hunger,

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:18.919
and sleep,

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.558
among other things.

00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:22.076
When it receives this message,

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:24.426
the hypothalamus produces
another molecule

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:28.995
called prostaglandin E2,
which gears it up for war.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.765
The hypothalamus sends signals
that instruct your muscles to contract

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:35.655
and causes a rise in body temperature.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.396
It also makes you sleepy,

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:40.742
and you lose your appetite and thirst.

00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:43.905
But what's the point of all of these
unpleasant symptoms?

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:45.613
Well, we're not yet sure,

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:48.834
but some theorize that they aid
in recovery.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.523
The rise in temperature can slow bacteria

00:02:51.523 --> 00:02:54.587
and help your immune system
destroy pathogens.

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:58.643
Sleep lets your body channel
more energy towards fighting infection.

00:02:58.643 --> 00:03:03.314
When you stop eating, your liver can
take up much of the iron in your blood,

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:06.270
and since iron is essential 
for bacterial survival,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.233
that effectively starves them.

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:12.674
Your reduced thirst makes 
you mildly dehydrated,

00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:14.959
diminishing transmission through sneezes,

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:15.802
coughs,

00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:16.700
vomit,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.896
or diarrhea.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:20.813
Though it's worth noting that if you don't
drink enough water,

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:23.621
that dehydration can become dangerous.

00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.265
Even the body's aches 
make you more sensitive,

00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:29.958
drawing attention to infected cuts
that might be worsening,

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.925
or even causing your condition.

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.728
In addition to physical symptoms,

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:37.113
sickness can also make you irritable,

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:37.823
sad,

00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:39.233
and confused.

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:41.298
That's because cytokines and prostaglandin

00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:44.385
can reach even higher structures 
in your brain,

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:46.958
disrupting the activity 
of neurotransmitters,

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:47.931
like glutamate,

00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:49.053
endorphins,

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.238
serotonin,

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.171
and dopamine.

00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:56.256
This affects areas like the limbic system,
which oversees emotions,

00:03:56.256 --> 00:04:00.702
and your cerebral cortex,
which is involved in reasoning.

00:04:00.702 --> 00:04:03.384
So it's actually the body's own
immune response

00:04:03.384 --> 00:04:07.918
that causes much of the discomfort
you feel every time you get ill.

00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:10.909
Unfortunately, it doesn't always
work perfectly.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:16.212
Most notably, millions of people
worldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases,

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:21.205
in which the immune system treats
normal bodily cues as threats,

00:04:21.205 --> 00:04:23.719
so the body attacks itself.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.688
But for the majority of the human race,

00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:29.484
millions of years of evolution
have fine-tuned the immune system

00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:32.704
so that it works for, 
rather than against us.

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:35.216
The symptoms of our illnesses 
are annoying,

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:38.745
but collectively, 
they signify an ancient process

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:43.129
that will continue barricading our bodies
against the outside world

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:44.729
for centuries to come.
